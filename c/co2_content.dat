Mass balance calculations suggest a strong decrease of CaO, SrO and <b>CO(2)</b> <b>contents</b> (up to - 90 %), correlated with {{a decrease of}} modal calcite content as the contact is approached. Most other chemical elements behave immobile during metasomatism. They are therefore passively enriched.

Hence, in this study, skarn formation is characterized by the lack of large chemical element influx from the granitoid protolith. A large decrease of the initial carbonate volume (up to - 86 %) resulted from a combination of decarbonation reactions and loss of CaO and CO(2). The resulting volume change has potentially important consequences for the interpretation of stable isotope profiles: the isotope alteration could have occured over greater distances than those observed today...|$|R

H₂ was produced at a maximum rate of 188 nmol H₂ mg Chl a⁻¹ hr⁻¹. Hydrogen production occurred {{in the presence of}} methyl viologen but the cells were not able to catalyze deuterium (D₂) exchange. Screening assay studies showed that the inhibitors DCMU, DBMIB, PCP, and malonate did not effect H₂ production while H₂ production was completely inhibited when KCN was present. The physiological response and genome analysis of T. elongatus indicates that the enzyme responsible for H₂ production may differ from the Fe-only or [NiFe] bidirectional H₂ase enzymes commonly found in green algae and in other species of cyanobacteria. T. elongatus was also analyzed for the ability to grow on 5 - 150 mM dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and 0 - 30 % CO₂. The effect of DIC and CO₂ concentrations on PHB, lipids, and glycogen was also measured. Glycogen and PHB were the primary carbon reserves depending on carbon availability. The highest glycogen concentration was 24. 12 % (w/w) with 150 mM DIC while the greatest PHB concentration was 14. 5 % (w/w) in cultures grown with 0 % supplemental <b>CO₂.</b> Lipid <b>content</b> did not vary significantly with carbon concentrations and averaged around 15 - 20 % (w/w) for all culture conditions.

Degassing, by itself, cannot generate the large variations in δ 13 C values of dissolved CO₂ or coupled CO₂-Ar variations. This suggests that δ 13 C values were also affected by some other processes, most probably melt-crust interaction.

Combined measurements included CO₂ respiration rate, <b>CO₂</b> radiocarbon <b>content</b> to estimate chlorinated hydrocarbon (CH) mineralization and a zone of influence (ZOI) model. CO₂ was collected continuously over 2 two-week periods by recirculating monitoring well headspace gas through NaOH traps. A series of 12 wells in the main CH plume zone and a background well with no known historical contamination were sampled. The background well CO₂ was used to determine radiocarbon content derived from respired natural organic matter. A two end-member mixing model was then used to determine the amount of CH-derived carbon present in the CO₂ collected from plume region wells. The ZOI model provided an estimate for the soil volume sampled at each well. CH mineralization rates were highest upgradient and at the plume fringe for areas of high historical contamination and ranged from 0. 02 to 5. 6 mg CH carbon per day. Using the ZOI model volume estimates, CH–carbon removal ranged from 0. 2 to 32 mg CH–carbon m⁻³ per day. Because the rate estimates were based on a limited sampling (temporally), they were not further extrapolated to long-term contaminant degradation estimates. However, if the site manager or regulators required them, estimates – subject to long-term variability uncertainties – could be made using volume and rate data determined over short timescales. A more comprehensive seasonal sampling is needed to constrain long-term remediation models for the entire impacted area and identify environmental conditions related to more rapid turnover times amongst the wells...|$|R
40|$|The Haveri Au-Cu deposit {{is located}} in {{southern}} Finland about 175 km north of Helsinki. It occurs on {{the northern edge of}} the continental island arc-type, volcano-sedimentary Tampere Schist Belt (TSB) within the Palaeoproterozoic Svecofennian Domain (2. 0 – 1. 75 Ga) of the Fennoscandian Shield. The 1. 99 Ga Haveri Formation forms the base of the supracrustal stratigraphy consisting of metavolcanic pillow lavas and breccias passing upwards into intercalated metatuffs and metatuffites. There is a continuous gradation upwards from the predominantly volcaniclastic Haveri Formation into the overlying epiclastic meta-greywackes of the Osara Formation. The Haveri deposit is hosted in this contact zone. This supracrustal sequence has been intruded concordantly by quartz-feldspar porphyries. Approximately 1. 89 Ga ago, high crustal heat flow led to the generation and emplacement of voluminous synkinematic, I-type, magnetite-series granitoids of the Central Finland Granitoid Complex (CFGC), resulting in coeval high-T/low-P metamorphism (hornfelsic textures), and D₁ deformation. During the crystallisation and cooling of the granitoids, a magmatic-dominated hydrothermal system caused extensive hydrothermal alteration and Cu-Au mineralisation through the late-D₁ to early-D₂ deformation. Initially, a pre-ore Na-Ca alteration phase caused albitisation of the host rock. This was closely followed by strong Ca-Fe alteration, responsible for widespread amphibolitisation and quartz veining and associated with abundant pyrrhotite, magnetite, chalcopyrite and gold mineralisation. More localised calcic-skarn alteration is also present as zoned garnetpyroxene- epidote skarn assemblages with associated pyrrhotite and minor sphalerite, centred on quartzcalcite± scapolite veinlets. Post-ore alteration includes an evolution to more K-rich alteration (biotitisation). Late D₂-retrograde chlorite began to replace the earlier high-T assemblage. Late emanations (post-D₂ and pre-D₃) from the cooling granitoids, under lower temperatures and oxidising conditions, are represented by carbonate-barite veins and epidote veinlets. Later, narrow dolerite dykes were emplaced followed by a weak D₃ deformation, resulting in shearing and structural reactivation along the carbonate-barite bands. This phase was accompanied by pyrite deposition. Both sulphides and oxides are common at Haveri, with ore types varying from massive sulphide and/or magnetite, to networks of veinlets and disseminations of oxides and/or sulphides. Cataclastites, consisting of deformed, brecciated bands of sulphide, with rounded and angular clasts of quartz vein material and altered host-rock are an economically important ore type. Ore minerals are principally pyrrhotite, magnetite and chalcopyrite with lesser amounts of pyrite, molybdenite and sphalerite. There is a general progression from early magnetite, through pyrrhotite to pyrite indicating increasing sulphidation with time. Gold is typically found as free gold within quartz veins and within intense zones of amphibolitisation. Considerable gold is also found in the cataclastite ore type either as invisible gold within the sulphides and/or as free gold within the breccia fragments. The unaltered amphibolites of the Haveri Formation can be classified as medium-K basalts of the tholeiitic trend. Trace and REE support an interpretation of formation in a back-arc basin setting. The unaltered porphyritic rocks are calc-alkaline dacites, and are interpreted, along with the granitoids as having an arc-type origin. This is consistent with the evolution from an initial back-arc basin, through a period of passive margin and/or fore-arc deposition represented by the Osara Formation greywackes and the basal stratigraphy of the TSB, prior to the onset of arc-related volcanic activity characteristic of the TSB and the Svecofennian proper. Using a combination of petrogenetic grids, mineral compositions (garnet-biotite and hornblendeplagioclase thermometers) and oxygen isotope thermometry, peak metamorphism can be constrained to a maximum of approximately 600 °C and 1. 5 kbars pressure. Furthermore, the petrogenetic grids indicate that the REDOX conditions can be constrained at 600 °C to log f(O₂) values of approximately - 21. 0 to - 26. 0 and - 14. 5 to - 17. 5 for the metasedimentary rocks and mafic metavolcanic rocks respectively, thus indicating the presence of a significant REDOX boundary. Amphibole compositions from the Ca-Fe alteration phase (amphibolitisation) indicate iron enrichment with increasing alteration corresponding to higher temperatures of formation. Oxygen isotope studies combined with limited fluid inclusion studies indicate that the Ca-Fe alteration and associated quartz veins formed at high temperatures (530 – 610 °C) from low CO₂, low- to moderately saline (< 10 eq. wt% NaCl), magmatic-dominated fluids. Fluid inclusion decrepitation textures in the quartz veins suggest isobaric decompression. This is compatible with formation in high-T/low-P environments such as contact aureoles and island arcs. The calcic-skarn assemblage, combined with phase equilibria and sphalerite geothermometry, are indicative of formation at high temperatures (500 – 600 °C) from fluids with higher <b>CO₂</b> <b>contents</b> and more saline compositions than those responsible for the Fe-Ca alteration. Limited fluid inclusion studies have identified hypersaline inclusions in secondary inclusion trails within quartz. The presence of calcite and scapolite also support formation from CO₂-rich saline fluids. It is suggested that the calcic-skarn alteration and the amphibolitisation evolved from the same fluids, and that P-T changes led to fluid unmixing resulting in two fluid types responsible for the observed alteration variations. Chlorite geothermometry on retrograde chlorite indicates temperatures of 309 – 368 °C. As chlorite represents the latest hydrothermal event, this can be taken as a lower temperature limit for hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation at Haveri. The gold mineralisation at Haveri is related primarily to the Ca-Fe alteration. Under such P-T-X conditions gold was transported as chloride complexes. Ore was localised by a combination of structural controls (shears and folds) and REDOX reactions along the boundary between the oxidised metavolcanics and the reduced metasediments. In addition, fluid unmixing caused an increase in pH, and thus further augmented the precipitation of Cu and Au. During the late D₂-event, temperatures fell below 400 °C, and fluids may have remobilised Au and Cu as bisulphide complexes into the shearcontrolled cataclastites and massive sulphides. The Haveri deposit has many similarities with ore deposit models that include orogenic lode-gold deposits, certain Au-skarn deposits and Fe-oxide Cu-Au deposits. However, many characteristics of the Haveri deposit, including tectonic setting, host lithologies, alteration types, proximity to I-type granitoids and P-T-X conditions of formation, compare favourably with other Early Proterozoic deposits within the TSB and Fennoscandia, as well as many of the deposits in the Cloncurry district of Australia. Consequently, the Haveri deposit can be seen to represent a high-T, Ca-rich member of the recently recognised Fe-oxide Cu-Au group of deposits...|$|R

The most common consumer packaging types for beef in Sweden is high-oxygen modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), with the gas composition (80 % O₂; 20 % <b>CO₂).</b> The high-oxygen <b>content</b> gives the beef a stable bright red oxymyoglobin colour that is desirable to consumers {{at the moment of}} purchase and the addition of 20 - 30 % CO₂ prolongs the shelf life by inhibiting bacterial growth. Nonetheless, the high level of oxygen promotes oxidation of both proteins and lipids, giving an inferior product compared with packaging systems that exclude oxygen. Vacuum packaging expands the shelf life of beef even further than high-oxygen MAP and the tenderization continues throughout the storage time. However, the purple deoxymyoglobin colour and the visible purge loss in the vacuum bag are thought to be unattractive to consumers. The aim of this thesis was to study how storage time and packaging methods affects the quality of beef, comparing high-oxygen MAP with vacuum packaged and/or skin packed beef, with emphasis on colour, Warner-Bratzler shear force, sensory quality and oxidation of proteins. In conclusion, high-oxygen MAP systems for beef steaks were found to negatively influence shear force and water-holding capacity as well as the sensory attributes tenderness, meat flavour and juiciness, compared with beef steaks packaged in skin pack or vacuum. High-oxygen MAP might also lead to decreased α-tocopherol values and increased oxidation of proteins. Moreover, no clear differences was found between skin packed and vacuum packed steaks for shear force, sensory quality and total loss, however, skin packed steaks had lower purge loss which might be more appealing to the consumers in retail display. Most research is done on frozen meat due to practical reasons. As the consumers mostly eat meat fresh, the differences in quality that comes with freezing should be taken into consideration when planning research...|$|R

Often, in Argentina, farmers do not have enough permanent storage capacity so they overcome this deficit with the use of hermetic plastic bags (silobags). The objectives of this work were: 1) Determine the feasibility of the bagging and extraction processes of canola. 2) Monitoring the condition of canola by periodic measurement of carbon dioxide (<b>CO₂),</b> temperature, moisture <b>content</b> (m. c.) and quality of the grain. Thirty tonnes of canola with initial m. c. of 6 % were stored in a silobag in the southeast of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The storage period was extended from November 2008 to November 2009. The variables measured every two weeks were CO₂ concentration, m. c. and grain quality parameters, such as foreign matters, fat acidity and fat content. The temperature and relative humidity (r. h.) of the interstitial air inside the bag and of the ambient air were also recorded with a frequency of one hour. It was observed that, even the size and characteristics of the canola seeds, it was possible to perform the bagging and extraction operations of canola seeds without problems. The r. h. in the interstitial air remained below 50 % along the entire storage period. The temperature of the grain inside the bag followed the monthly average ambient temperature. The CO₂ concentration ranged from 1 to 8 %, indicating low to moderate biological activity in the grain mass. The m. c., foreign matters and fat values remained unchanged throughout the storage period. The fat acidity increased during storage in 0. 7 % points, reaching a final value of 1. 4 %, but did not represent a commercial quality loss. It was concluded that under the conditions of temperature and m. c. evaluated in this study it is possible to store canola in hermetic plastic bags without commercial quality deterioration...|$|R
