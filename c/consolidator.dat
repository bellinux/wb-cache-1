After the acquisition, all FedEx Kinko's locations exclusively offered only FedEx shipping. In June 2008, FedEx announced {{that they would be}} dropping the Kinko's name from their ship centers; FedEx Kinko's would now be called FedEx Office. In September 2004, FedEx acquired Parcel Direct, a parcel <b>consolidator,</b> and re-branded it FedEx SmartPost.|$|E
25|$|The Kangxi Emperor was {{the great}} <b>consolidator</b> of the Qing dynasty. The {{transition}} from the Ming dynasty to the Qing was a cataclysm whose central event was {{the fall of the}} capital Beijing to the peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng, then to the Manchus in 1644, and the installation of the five-year-old Shunzhi Emperor on their throne. By 1661, when the Shunzhi Emperor died and was succeeded by the Kangxi Emperor, the Qing conquest of China proper was almost complete. Leading Manchus were already using Chinese institutions and mastering Confucian ideology, while maintaining Manchu culture among themselves. The Kangxi Emperor completed the conquest, suppressed all significant military threats and revived the central government system inherited from the Ming with important modifications.|$|E

[...] After 1968, the bank operated as the primary subsidiary of a bank holding company that was eventually renamed Chemical Banking Corporation.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though many}} <b>consolidators</b> are online, most <b>consolidators</b> still work only through retail travel agents. Many <b>consolidators</b> also act as host {{agencies}} for local travel agencies. Today {{many of the}} online OTA use <b>consolidators</b> to increase margins on sales since airlines do not pay commissions.|$|R

50|$|<b>Consolidators</b> most {{commonly}} operate in international markets. In domestic markets, they typically only offer business class and first class tickets.

60|$|These Engines are call'd {{in their}} Country Language, Dupekasses; and {{according}} to the Ancient Chinese, or Tartarian, Apezolanthukanistes; in English, a <b>Consolidator.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{that which}} is very Remarkable, all this not only before the Old <b>Consolidator</b> was broke up, but even while it was {{actually}} whole and in use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Consolidators</b> enter {{contracts}} with major carriers {{to sell at}} reduced prices to niche markets, the main benefit being that fares through <b>consolidators</b> will be lower than published rates available from the airlines themselves. <b>Consolidators</b> normally do not buy the seats in bulk for resale, they sell the available seats at contracted rates. Airlines normally preset the selling rates for these fares for sale to sub-agents and to end customers, thereby ensuring that the fares are not undercut.|$|R
50|$|Global hotel <b>consolidators</b> usually offer {{discounted}} {{rooms in}} almost every major tourist destination, big city or popular resort while local <b>consolidators</b> focus only on a particular geographic area trying to be most competitive on a key for the company market. Hotel <b>consolidator’s</b> activity can be separated into two main operations: 1) Buying blocks of rooms at volume discounts in certain major cities 2) Distributing “excess rooms” offered by hotels not anticipating full occupancy for given dates.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} {{to individuals who}} contact hotels directly and ask for discounts, the <b>consolidators</b> are able to achieve deep discounts due to their buying power. Hotels are willing to offer dramatically reduced room rates to <b>consolidators</b> because they know it will yield {{a greater number of}} reservations. Many hotels are interested in selling room blocks (allotments) to <b>consolidators,</b> because they know that discounted rooms mean more business in the long run and subsequently a greater profit for them.|$|R
60|$|The Reader may observe, I have {{formerly}} noted {{there was}} a new <b>Consolidator</b> to be Built, and observ'd what struggle there was in the Moon about choosing the Feathers.|$|E
60|$|The Men of the Feather as I have noted, who are {{represented}} {{here by the}} <b>Consolidator,</b> fell all together by the Ears, and all the Moon was in a combustion. The Case was as follows.|$|E
60|$|Nay {{they were}} once grown to that extravagant highth, that they began to Stock-Job the very Feathers of the <b>Consolidator,</b> and in time the King's {{employing}} those People might have had what Feathers they had occasion for, without concerning the Proprietors of the Lands much about them.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper contrastively {{analyses}} {{the consolidation}} instances of silt with HEC and HAS soil <b>consolidators,</b> also emphatically discusses the influence regularities of the compressive strength of solidified soil {{with the following}} factors: the dose of <b>consolidators</b> and the curing time. Meanwhile, {{from the point of}} view of experiment, this paper studies the physical and mechanical properties of solidified soil. Case study shows that HEC and HAS soil <b>consolidators</b> behave as well as cement and lime in road-construction engineering, and even that filling subgrade independently. Also, this paper proposes the appropriate value 6 % of HEC and HAS soil <b>consolidators</b> for solidifying silt layer, which can be used as reference for the similar geological conditions...|$|R

60|$|There {{were two}} Solunarian High Priests {{in their proper}} Vestments, one Privy Councellor of the State, one other Noble Man, and one who had in his Hat a Token, to signifie that he possest one of the fine Feathers of the <b>Consolidator,</b> of which I have given the Description already.|$|E
60|$|And indeed some Places such Sorry, Scoundrel, Empty, Husky, Wither'd, Decay'd Feathers were offer'd to the Proprietors, that I have {{sometimes}} wonder'd any {{one could have}} the Impudence to send up such ridiculous Feathers to make a <b>Consolidator,</b> which, as is before observ'd, is an Engine of such Beauty, Usefulness and Necessity.|$|E
60|$|It is {{necessary}} to understand here, that the Men of the Feather serve in several Capacities, and under several Denominations, and act by themselves, singly consider'd, they are call'd the <b>Consolidator,</b> and the Feathers we mention'd abstracted from their Persons, make the glorious Engine we speak of, and in which, when any suddain Motion takes them, they can all shut themselves up, and away for the Moon.|$|E

60|$|For a Body like this, {{what can}} it not do? what cannot such an Extension {{perform in the}} Air?

60|$|His lordship, {{looking over}} the scroll, passed a high eulogium upon the young <b>consolidator,</b> {{compared}} to whom, he said, Justinian was a country attorney. Observing, however, that the crime of high treason had been accidentally omitted in the consolidated legislation of Vraibleusia, he directed the jury to find the prisoner 'not guilty.'
