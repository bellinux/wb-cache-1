40|$|A new tracking-control {{method for}} general {{non-linear}} systems is proposed. A virtual controller and some <b>command</b> <b>references</b> {{are introduced to}} asymptotically stabilise {{the system of the}} tracking error dynamics. Then, the actual controller and <b>command</b> <b>references</b> are derived by solving a system of linear algebraic equations. Compared with other tracking-control methods in the literature, the tracking-controller design in this paper is simple because it needs only to solve a system of linear algebraic equations. The boundedness of the tracking controller and <b>command</b> <b>references</b> is guaranteed by the solvability of the terminal value problem (TVP) of an ordinary differential equation. For non-linear systems with minimum-phase properties, the TVP is automatically solvable. A numerical example shows that the tracking-control method is still available for some systems with non-minimum-phase properties. To enhance the robustness of the tracking controller, a non-linear disturbance observer (NDO) is introduced to estimate the disturbance. The combination of the tracking controller and the NDO is applied to the tracking control of an air-breathing hypersonic vehicle...|$|R

40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{operates}} the ACT/FHS research helicopter {{with a full}} model-based control system operating from hover to 120 kn forward flight including take-off and landing as {{a key element of}} the ALLFlight project. The used feedforward controller is based on linear model inversion of identified local models, therefore the overall feedforward controller performance is highly dependent on the accuracy of the used inverted models. While several approaches exist to validate model accuracy in time and frequency domain, a validation method for model inversion purposes is rarely treated in literature. In this paper a flight test campaign that has been conducted to analyze model validity of the feedforward controller is presented and evaluated. A new model validation method using the feedforward controller to follow a <b>reference</b> <b>command</b> is discussed. Measured deviations from the <b>commanded</b> <b>references</b> are evaluated in time domain to highlight the model subsystems that are not precisely represented by the linear models.

40|$|For {{many types}} of {{mechanical}} systems flexibility presents the biggest challenge to the control system. If the mechanical components undergo deflection {{during the course of}} operation, it may prove difficult to track a desired trajectory or avoid obstacles. Furthermore, once the system has reached a setpoint, the residual vibration will degrade positioning accuracy and may cause a delay in task completion. Even if the mechanical components are very stiff, a closed-loop controller may introduce flexibility of its own that is detrimental to system performance. The desired motion of a system is fed into a command generator that transforms the desired motion into a <b>reference</b> <b>command.</b> The <b>reference</b> <b>command</b> is then used to either drive an openloop system, or form an error signal for a closed-loop system. Not every control system has a closed-loop controller; however, every control system does have some form of command generator. In many systems the command generator may not be immediately obvious and it may not be programmed into a computer. For example, the command generator for a construction crane is the human operator who attempts to produce an appropriate <b>reference</b> <b>command</b> in real time.

The class of adaptive algorithms considered are those commonly referred to as model reference adaptive control algorithms, self-tuning controllers, and dead beat adaptive controllers, developed for both continuous-time systems and discrete-time systems. A unified analytical approach was developed to examine the class of existing adaptive algorithms.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of analysis of cockpit lateral control feel-system studies. Variations in feel-system natural frequency, damping, and command sensing reference (force and position) were investigated, in combination with variations in the aircraft response characteristics. The primary data for the report were obtained from a flight investigation conducted with a variable-stability airplane, with additional information taken from other flight experiments and ground-based simulations for both airplanes and helicopters. The study consisted of analysis of handling qualities ratings and extraction of open-loop, pilot-vehicle describing functions from sum-of-sines tracking data, including, for a limited subset of these data, the development of pilot models. The study confirms the findings of other investigators that the effects on pilot opinion of cockpit feel-system dynamics are not equivalent to a comparable level of added time delay, and until a more comprehensive set of criteria are developed, it is recommended that feel-system dynamics be considered a delay-inducing element in the aircraft response.

Remote control used in this paper is HobbyKing brand that works at frequency 2. 4 GHz.

On the transceiver module, two channels are used as an identifier (address and command), while the other two channels are used for transfer hexadecimal data (0 -F). A PWM data received by the receiver module is read by the microcontroller module using the counter method utilizing the 16 -bit timer. The data is sent to the DAC module to be converted into analogue voltage 0 - 5 Volt which is then manipulated by a signal amplifier to moving the DC motors or control various other devices on the UGV.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved variable-band hysteresis current controller for a two-level three-phase {{voltage source inverter}} (VSI). The controller takes the average voltages of the phase-leg switched outputs as an approximation to the load back-EMF voltages, and uses these results to vary the hysteresis bands so as to maintain constant phase-leg switching frequencies. The switching frequency control process is then further refined by fine tuning the hysteresis band variations to synchronize the zero crossings of the phase-leg current errors with a fixed reference clock so as to achieve a nearest space vector switching sequence, which further ensures that the switched output spectrum has been optimized. Finally, a technique is proposed to replace the third phase-leg current regulator with a fixed-frequency open-loop pulse-width modulator, where its <b>commanded</b> <b>reference</b> is generated from the average switched output voltages {{of the other two}} phase legs. This avoids the hazard of the three independent hysteresis current regulators adversely interacting with each other in a conventional system, resulting from an overconstrained control problem with only two degrees of freedom. Additionally, this approach allows the linear modulation range to be increased by adding a common-mode third-harmonic component to the third phase-leg <b>reference</b> <b>command</b> signal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] In this paper, {{the dynamic}} target {{tracking}} of a car-like wheeled robot within a sensor-network environment by an intelligent control is developed. The proposed intelligent control is called fuzzy decentralized sliding-mode grey prediction control (FDSMGPC). For implementing dynamic target tracking, two distributed CCD (charge-coupled device) cameras {{are set up}} to capture the poses of the tracking and target cars, which have the front-wheel for the steering orientation and the rear-wheel for the translation motion. Based on the control authority of these two CCD cameras, a suitable <b>reference</b> <b>command</b> for the proposed controller of the tracking car is planned on a personal computer and then transmitted to the tracking car by a wireless device. The <b>reference</b> <b>command</b> contains the <b>reference</b> steering angle of the front-wheel and the reference velocity of the rear-wheel. Only the information of the upper bound of system knowledge is required to select the suitable scaling factors and the coefficients of sliding surface for the proposed controller.
