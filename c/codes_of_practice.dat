This usually also applies to professional divers using surface-supplied diving equipment.|$|E

25|$|The {{assessed}} {{risk of a}} dive would {{generally be}} considered unacceptable if the diver {{is not expected to}} cope with any single reasonably foreseeable incident with a significant probability of occurrence during that dive. Precisely where the line is drawn depends on circumstances. Professional diving operations tend to be less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, who are less constrained by occupational health and safety legislation and <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> This is one of the factors driving the use of surface supplied equipment where reasonably practicable for professional work.|$|E
25|$|Mounting options: The bailout {{cylinder}} may {{be mounted}} with the valve {{at the top}} or at the bottom, depending on local <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> A generally used arrangement is to mount the cylinder with the valve up, as this is better protected while kitting up, and the cylinder valve is left fully open while the diver is in the water. This means that the regulator and supply hose to the bailout block will be pressurised during the dive, and ready for immediate use by opening the bailout valve on the harness or helmet.|$|E

Divers are {{expected}} to act as standby divers for other members of the team and the duties of a standby diver include rescue attempts if the working diver gets into difficulties. Consequently, professional divers are generally required to be trained in rescue procedures appropriate to the modes of diving they are certified in, and to administer first aid in emergencies. The specific training, competence and registration for these skills varies, and may be specified by state or national legislation or by industry <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E

25|$|The jacket harness is a {{waistcoat}} (vest) style garment {{with strong}} adjustable webbing straps which are adjustable and securely buckled over the shoulders, across {{the chest and}} waist, and through the crotch or around each thigh, so that the diver can not slide out under any predictable circumstance.
