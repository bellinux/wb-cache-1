He is a level-headed thinker and able to maintain composure in most situations. Suwabe praised the <b>cohesiveness</b> of the music, video and dialogue of the series. He also noted that Yamato's most appealing trait is his strength.|$|E
5|$|Although males {{demonstrate}} little {{involvement in}} territorial disputes between neighboring communities, and ruffed lemur communities lack <b>cohesiveness,</b> females communally defend the community range against females of other communities. These disputes occur mostly during the hot, rainy season, when resources are more abundant and occur near {{the boundaries of}} community ranges. Spacing is maintained by scent marking and vocal communication. Ruffed lemurs {{are known for their}} loud, raucous calls that are answered by neighboring communities and subgroups within the same community.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 210years of {{relations}} with the Spanish, both indigenous societies lost <b>cohesiveness.</b> Official records indicate that survivors of war and disease were transported to Havana in the late 18th century. Isolated groups may have been assimilated into the Seminole nation, which formed in northern Florida when a band of Creeks consolidated surviving members of pre-Columbian societies in Florida into their own to become a distinct tribe. Seminoles were forced into the Everglades by the U.S. military during the Seminole Wars from 1835 to 1842. The U.S. military pursued the Seminoles into the region, which resulted {{in some of the}} first recorded explorations of much of the area. Seminoles continue to live in the Everglades region, and support themselves with casino gambling on six reservations located throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and <b>cohesiveness.</b> Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's <b>cohesiveness</b> and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
5|$|For {{producing}} the new songs for the album, Madonna worked with David Foster and Nellee Hooper, the former {{known for his}} work with such artists as Barbra Streisand and Olivia Newton-John. Madonna stated that the concept for the album was to make fans and critics alike remember her music contributions rather than her media controversies. Something to Remember was well received by music critics who were impressed with Madonna's vocals and the album's <b>cohesiveness.</b> It was also a commercial success, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Finland, and Italy, and peaking within top ten elsewhere. In the United States, it reached number six on the Billboard 200 and was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of three million units. Worldwide, Something to Remember has sold over ten million copies.|$|E
5|$|Team {{effectiveness}} (also {{referred to}} as group effectiveness) is the capacity a team has to accomplish the goals or objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and view themselves as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group <b>cohesiveness,</b> teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{noted for its}} visual style {{employing}} highly saturated colors and varying shapes. Jones {{was inspired by the}} limited-animated series Roger Ramjet and The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, which he felt employed good character design, <b>cohesiveness,</b> jokes, and timing. He credited The Problem Solverz as the first seamless use of Flash for television animation, with conceptualization and the end result occurring in the same program. Writing was the longest aspect of production, taking up to several months for the crew to conceive the story and draft a script. Animation was comparatively quicker, with the team delivering work in only a few weeks given the digital approach; Jones felt that the animators could to play to the strengths of the fully digital animation process.|$|E

25|$|Since Woolley et al.'s {{results do}} not show any {{influence}} of group satisfaction, group <b>cohesiveness,</b> or motivation, they, at least implicitly, challenge these concepts regarding the importance for group performance in general and thus contrast meta-analytically proven evidence concerning {{the positive effects of}} group cohesion, motivation and satisfaction on group performance.|$|E
25|$|Custom and {{tradition}} {{are the most}} frequently cited reasons for FGM, with some cultures believing that not performing it has the possibility of disrupting the <b>cohesiveness</b> of their social and political systems, such as FGM also {{being a part of}} a girl's initiation into adulthood. Often, a girl is not considered an adult in a FGM-practicing society unless she has undergone FGM.|$|E
25|$|It may be {{said that}} the modern formal {{discipline}} of sociology began with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates amongst Catholic and Protestant populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the economic foundations of society. Contemporary debates have centred on issues such as secularization, civil religion, and the <b>cohesiveness</b> of religion in the context of globalization and multiculturalism.|$|E
25|$|In {{its opening}} week, The Greatest Story Never Told entered on the Billboard 200 at number 61, selling 11,000 copies. In its second week, the album sold an {{additional}} 4,800 copies, bringing its total sales to around 16,000. As of March 6, 2011, the album has sold 19,000 copies in the United States. Upon its release, The Greatest Story Never Told received rave reviews from music critics and hip hop publications, who complimented the album's intellectual lyrics, soulful production, and overall <b>cohesiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|When centralities are {{categorized}} by {{their approach to}} <b>cohesiveness,</b> it becomes apparent {{that the majority of}} centralities inhabit one category. The count of the number of walks starting from a given vertex differs only in how walks are defined and counted. Restricting consideration to this group allows for a soft characterization which places centralities on a spectrum from walks of length one (degree centrality) to infinite walks (eigenvalue centrality). The observation that many centralities share this familial relationships perhaps explains the high rank correlations between these indices.|$|E
25|$|As the {{workplace}} is changing to include more group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is needed that draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, <b>cohesiveness,</b> etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of group <b>cohesiveness,</b> commitment, and performance. As {{the workplace}} environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance.|$|E
25|$|Research {{funded by}} the U.S. National Institutes of Health {{has shown that the}} average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of National Geographic, asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and {{maintain}} a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans. The <b>cohesiveness</b> of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other {{institutions}} arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the sense of social <b>cohesiveness</b> that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended. Accompanied by better education and social <b>cohesiveness,</b> the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 Dinshaw Maneckji Petit founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary Maneckji Limji Hataria may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the jizya for their co-religionists in 1882.|$|E
25|$|The {{storming}} parties {{began to}} advance, first crossing a narrow gulley between {{the lake and}} the pā. Kawiti and his warriors arrived at the battle and engaged with the Colonial forces in the scrub and gullies around the pā. There followed a savage and confused battle. Eventually the discipline and <b>cohesiveness</b> of the British troops began to prevail and the Māori were driven back inside the pā. But they {{were by no means}} beaten, far from it, as without artillery the British had no way to overcome the defences of the pā. Hulme decided to disengage and retreat back to the Bay of Islands.|$|E
25|$|In 944, Otto {{appointed}} Conrad the Red as Duke of Lorraine {{and brought}} him into his extended family through his marriage to Otto's daughter Liutgarde in 947. A Salian Frank by birth, Conrad was a nephew of former king Conrad I of Germany. Following the death of Otto's uncle Berthold, Duke of Bavaria, in 947, Otto satisfied his brother Henry's ambition through his marriage to Judith, Duchess of Bavaria, daughter of Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, and appointed him as the new Duke of Bavaria in 948. This arrangement finally achieved peace between the brothers, as Henry thereafter abandoned his claims to the throne. Through his familial ties to the dukes, Otto had strengthened {{the sovereignty of the}} crown and the overall <b>cohesiveness</b> of the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The new Minister Jayewardene saw {{tourism in}} a new {{dimension}} as a great industry capable of earning foreign exchange, providing avenues of mass employment, creating a manpower which commanded a high, employment potential in the world. He was determined to place this industry on a solid foundation providing it a 'conceptional base and institutional support.' This was necessary to bring dynamism and <b>cohesiveness</b> into an industry, shunned by leaders in the past, ignored by investors who were inhibited {{by the lack of}} incentive to invest in projects which were uncertain of a satisfactory return. The new Minister Hon. J. R. Jayewardene considered it essential for the government to give that assurance and with this objective in view he tabled the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966 followed by Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act No 14 of 1966.|$|E
25|$|Another {{contributory}} {{factor was}} the lack of attention paid to Adolf Galland's basic rules of combat. In the tactical battle, he argued that the fighter must fight on the offensive, even when on defensive missions. There was no place for a defensive posture. An example of this dictum being ignored was the instance of having Bf 109 groups escort vulnerable and heavily armed Focke-Wulf Fw 190s which had replaced the vulnerable Zerstörer twin-engined fighters, which reduced the power of interception formations. Combat <b>cohesiveness</b> was frequently disregarded, and the integrity of the formations became compromised and ignored (owing to a lack of experienced leaders). Fixed tactical scheme contributed to failures as well. Rigid tactics were allowed to take root, and technique suffered. Using surprise, cunning and manoeuvrability had to be combined with aggressiveness and improvisation depending on the situation. This sort of tactical advantage was lost over time.|$|E
25|$|Seth Kaplan (2011) {{argues that}} in {{contrast}} to southern Somalia and adjacent territories, Somaliland, the secessionist northwestern portion of Somalia, has built a more democratic mode of governance from the bottom up, with virtually no foreign assistance. Specifically, Kaplan suggests that Somaliland has the most democratic political system in the Horn of Africa {{because it has been}} largely insulated from the extremist elements in the rest of Somalia and has viable electoral and legislative systems as well as a robust private sector-dominated economy, unlike neighbouring authoritarian governments. He largely attributes this to Somaliland's integration of customary laws and tradition with modern state structures, which he indicates most post-colonial states in Africa and the Middle East have not had the opportunity to do. Kaplan asserts that this has facilitated <b>cohesiveness</b> and conferred greater governmental legitimacy in Somaliland, as has the territory's comparatively homogeneous population, relatively equitable income distribution, common fear of the south, and absence of interference by outside forces, which has obliged local politicians to observe a degree of accountability.|$|E
25|$|Following Lowell's earlier {{reform of}} Harvard's admissions process to {{increase}} the admission of public school students, the Jewish proportion {{of the student body}} rose from 6% in 1908 to 22% in 1922, at a time when Jews constituted about 3% of the U.S. population. Lowell, continuing to focus on the <b>cohesiveness</b> of the student body, described a campus where antisemitism was growing and Jewish students were ever more likely to be isolated from the majority. He feared—and recent developments at Columbia University supported him—that the social elite would cease sending its sons to Harvard as Jewish enrollment increased. He cited what he saw as the parallel experience of hotels and clubs that lost their old membership when the proportion of Jewish members increased. He proposed limiting Jewish admissions to 15% of the entering class. His attempts to persuade members of the Harvard Board of Overseers to adopt his views were already failing when the plan was leaked to the Boston Post in May 1922. The idea was immediately denounced by Irish and black groups and by the American Federation of Labor.|$|E

500|$|A {{reconciliation}} of these views {{is suggested by}} William Atwood: [...] "Undoubtedly [...] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments {{and a sense of}} <b>cohesiveness</b> amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World...

Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people..." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Republic, Soviet authorities worked tenaciously to eliminate certain elements in society, in whole or in part, such as nationalism and religion, to strengthen the <b>cohesiveness</b> of the Union. In the eyes of early Soviet policymakers, Armenians, along with Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Georgians, Germans, and Jews were deemed [...] "advanced" [...] (as opposed to [...] "backward") peoples, and were grouped together with Western nationalities.

500|$|Johnny Dee of Virgin Media {{named it}} one of Sweet 7s {{standout}} tracks but in contrary felt that [...] "trimmed of their former member's vocals could be by absolutely anyone". Gavin Martin of Daily Mirror called the song a [...] "sweaty but uninspired thumper", while Daily Mail writer Danny McElhinney considered it average. A critic from The Visitor regarded [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] as [...] "limp" [...] {{in comparison to the}} group's older material which he described as [...] "feisty, sassy pop".

He identified groups that {{had a sense of}} identity and atmosphere as being influential on the album's songwriting. He cited classic stoner rock artists, to which he and his brother Shannon had listened while growing up. Eventually, they gravitated toward more conceptual work like Pink Floyd, David Bowie and The Cure.
