5|$|S-glutathionylation: fsTnI {{was found}} to be S-glutathionylated at Cys133 in rodent fast-twitch {{skeletal}} muscle and in human type II muscle fibers after exercise, which increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the <b>contractile</b> apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular <b>contractile</b> walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is <b>contractile,</b> which helps circulate the blood.|$|E
5|$|The bulb lies dormant {{after the}} leaves and flower stem die back and has <b>contractile</b> roots that pull it down further into the soil. The flower stem and leaves form in the bulb, to emerge the {{following}} season. Most species are dormant from summer to late winter, flowering in the spring, though a few species are autumn flowering.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to {{contract}} easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These <b>contractile</b> cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells. The intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The pacemaker cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the <b>contractile</b> cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate – spreading the impulse rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contraction of the entire heart.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's long {{histories}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office. Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate <b>contractile</b> dysfunction of his left ventricle. He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active <b>contractile</b> tissue of the body. Muscle tissue {{functions}} to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of <b>contractile</b> filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the leaves}} die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs {{deeper into the}} ground (<b>contractile</b> roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers {{outwards}} which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the tunic or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start {{to grow in the}} following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.|$|E
5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the <b>contractile</b> cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a {{hydrostatic}} skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{side effect of}} doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550mg/m², 18% when the dose is 551–600mg/m² and 36% when the dose exceeds 600mg/m². There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress, downregulation of genes for <b>contractile</b> proteins, and p53 mediated apoptosis. The drug dexrazoxane is used to mitigate doxorubicin's cardiotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the <b>contractile</b> proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{muscles and}} nerves are much simpler {{than those of}} most other animals, {{although}} more specialised than in other cnidarians, such as corals. Cells in the outer layer (epidermis) and the inner layer (gastrodermis) have microfilaments that group into <b>contractile</b> fibers. These fibers are not true muscles {{because they are not}} freely suspended in the body cavity as they are in more developed animals. Longitudinal fibres are found in the tentacles and oral disc, and also within the mesenteries, where they can contract the whole length of the body. Circular fibers are found in the body wall and, in some species, around the oral disc, allowing the animal to retract its tentacles into a protective sphincter.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria-mediated {{oxidative}} stress {{plays a role}} in cardiomyopathy in Type 2 diabetics. Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart increases fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the combination of which uncouples the mitochondria. Uncoupling then increases oxygen consumption by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a vicious cycle of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria is uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and <b>contractile</b> dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. The decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.|$|E
25|$|Motor unit {{recruitment}} {{refers to}} the activation of additional motor units to accomplish an increase in <b>contractile</b> strength in a muscle.|$|E
25|$|The {{fibroblast}} {{involved in}} scarring and contraction is the myofibroblast, {{which is a}} specialized <b>contractile</b> fibroblast. These cells express a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA).|$|E
25|$|Microfilament bundles - These {{extremely}} long microfilaments {{are located}} in networks and, in association with <b>contractile</b> proteins such as non-muscular myosin, {{they are involved in}} the movement of substances at an intracellular level.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{serotonin}} upon vascular smooth muscle tone (this is the biological function from which serotonin originally got its name) {{depend upon the}} serotonylation of proteins involved in the <b>contractile</b> apparatus of muscle cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Contractile</b> roots: {{they pull}} bulbs or corms of monocots, such as {{hyacinth}} and lily, and some taproots, such as dandelion, {{deeper in the}} soil through expanding radially and contracting longitudinally. They have a wrinkled surface.|$|E
25|$|The common ostrich {{heart is}} a closed system, <b>contractile</b> chamber. It is {{composed}} of myogenic muscular tissue associated with heart contraction features. There is a double circulatory plan in place possessing both a pulmonary circuit and systemic circuit.|$|E
25|$|Adipose tissues also secrete {{a type of}} cytokines (cell-to-cell {{signalling}} proteins) called adipokines (adipocytokines), which {{play a role in}} obesity-associated complications. Perivascular {{adipose tissue}} releases adipokines such as adiponectin that affect the <b>contractile</b> function of the vessels that they surround.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} his postdoctoral period in America, Perry returned to Cambridge. Using his expertise in manipulating muscle tissue combined with his biochemical knowledge, {{he was able}} to isolate myofibril in an uncontracted state, and from that {{he was able to}} characterize their protein components. Further observation of the myofibrils, and the crude preparations of the extracted <b>contractile</b> protein actins and myosins taken from them, showed that they required trace levels of calcium for <b>contractile</b> activity. Perry then used the calcium chelator EGTA to confirm that calcium was essential for the regulation of muscle contraction. This was a major breakthrough in the understanding of how muscle contractions are regulated. Seven years later Setsuro Ebashi, identified the factor responsible for calcium sensitivity in muscles, which he called troponin.|$|E
25|$|Two {{cases of}} dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} {{have been studied}} involving a substitution of highly conserved amino acids belonging to the protein domains that bind and intersperse with the Z discs. This {{has led to the}} theory that the dilation is produced by a defect in the transmission of <b>contractile</b> force in the myocytes.|$|E
25|$|During storage, bladder {{pressure}} stays low, {{because of}} the bladder's highly compliant nature. A plot of bladder (intravesical) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder (called a cystometrogram), will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled. This phenomenon is {{a manifestation of the}} law of Laplace, which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fills, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. The bladder's smooth muscle has some inherent <b>contractile</b> activity; however, when its nerve supply is intact, stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent <b>contractile</b> response of the muscle.|$|E
25|$|The pennation {{angle of}} the rotator cuff myofibers, the angle at which fibers connect to the {{associated}} tendon, affects the <b>contractile</b> properties and function of the whole pennate muscle. For example, the pennation angle determines the architectural gear ratio at which a pennate muscle operates. A large initial pennation angle results in a large AGR and velocity amplification.|$|E
25|$|Vacuoles: Vacuoles {{sequester}} {{waste products}} and in plant cells store water. They are {{often described as}} liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably Amoeba, have <b>contractile</b> vacuoles, which can pump {{water out of the}} cell if there is too much water. The vacuoles of plant cells and fungal cells are usually larger than those of animal cells.|$|E
25|$|A 2001 study, {{conducted}} by Aagaard et al., utilized MRI, ultrasonography and muscle biopsy techniques {{to examine the}} relationship between muscle architecture, <b>contractile</b> strength and pennation angle in the human quadriceps muscle after 14 weeks of resistance training. Upon completion of the training program, Aagaard et al. noticed a symmetrical increase in quadriceps CSA and volume, as each increased 10.2 and 10.3 percent respectively; however, these parameters increased disproportionately to quadriceps PCSA, which grew 16 percent. The rapid increase in PCSA was accompanied by a 35.5% increase in the fascicle pennation angle of the vastus lateris, one of the major quadriceps muscles, as well as a 16% increase in myofiber CSA. The increase in pennation angle in the vastus lateris resulted in an increase to the muscle’s PCSA, a measure proportional to the <b>contractile</b> force a pennate muscle is capable of producing. Work by Azizi et al. suggests this increase in pennation angle of the vastus lateris following resistance training generates an increase in the muscle’s AGR, a property which allows the whole muscle to contract with a higher velocity.|$|E
25|$|The muscle fiber {{has many}} cells with a plasma {{membrane}} and outer sheath or sarcolemma. The sarcolemma is invaginated {{and can make}} contact with the tracheole carrying oxygen to the muscle fiber. Arranged in sheets or cylindrically, <b>contractile</b> myofibrils run the length of the muscle fiber. Myofibrils comprising a fine actin filament enclosed between a thick pair of myosin filaments slide past each other instigated by nerve impulses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the acute}} setting, the stroke {{volume of the}} left {{ventricle}} is increased (increased ejection fraction); this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart. However, as it progresses the LV volume increases and the <b>contractile</b> function deteriorates, thus leading to dysfunctional LV {{and a decrease in}} ejection fraction. The increase in stroke volume is explained by the Frank–Starling mechanism, in which increased ventricular pre-load stretches the myocardium such that contractions are more forceful.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of an}} {{electromagnetic}} {{nature of}} matter, however, had to be given up. Abraham (1904, 1905) argued that non-electromagnetic forces were necessary to prevent Lorentz's <b>contractile</b> electrons from exploding. He also showed that different results for the longitudinal electromagnetic mass can be obtained in Lorentz's theory, {{depending on whether the}} mass is calculated from its energy or its momentum, so a non-electromagnetic potential (corresponding to 1/3 of the electron's electromagnetic energy) was necessary to render these masses equal. Abraham doubted whether it was possible to develop a model satisfying all of these properties.|$|E
25|$|The main {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} digoxin {{are on the}} heart. Extracardiac effects are responsible {{for some of the}} therapeutic and many of the adverse effects (see above). It exerts a mechanical effect as it increases myocardial contractility; however, the duration of the <b>contractile</b> response is only slightly increased. High ventricular rate leads to insufficient diastolic filling time. By slowing down the conduction in the AV node and increasing its refractory period, digoxin can reduce the ventricular rate. The arrhythmia itself is not affected, but the pumping function of the heart improves, owing to improved filling.|$|E
25|$|The muscle {{architecture}} of pennate muscles, {{such as the}} human quadriceps, is highly plastic and strongly influences <b>contractile</b> properties. Changes to pennate muscle architectural properties, such as pennation angle and thereby the PCSA, can alter the muscle’s force producing capabilities {{as well as the}} AGR at which the muscle operates. Parallelogram models predict that total PCSA of bipennate muscles increases in proportion to sin(θpennation) while total force exerted on the associated aponeurosis decreases with cos(θpennation). This theorizes that pennate muscle force generation increases until a 45 degree pennation angle is achieved.|$|E
25|$|This {{regional}} {{variability in}} strain {{was accompanied by}} a statistically significant increase in AGR and resting pennation angle from distal to proximal portions of the muscle. Furthermore, greater changes in pennation angle were visible at the proximal end of the MG. The experimental AGR values modulated positively with the pennation angle as well as the distance between the deep and superficial apopneuroses and may have been affected by regional patterns in orthogonal bulging. These trends highlight the complexity of muscle physiology, as different regions of muscles may contract with diverse <b>contractile</b> properties, such as strain and AGR.|$|E
25|$|This {{vasodilation}} {{does not}} decrease {{the volume of}} blood the heart pumps, but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood. Nitroglycerin pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The nitroglycerin reacts with a sulfhydryl group (–SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing vasodilation. There is a potential role {{for the use of}} nitric oxide in alleviating bladder <b>contractile</b> dysfunctions, and recent evidence suggests that nitrates may be beneficial for treatment of angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption both by decreasing preload and afterload and by some direct vasodilation of coronary vessels.|$|E
25|$|In medical {{abortion}} regimens, mifepristone {{blockade of}} progesterone receptors directly causes endometrial decidual degeneration, cervical softening and dilatation, release of endogenous prostaglandins, {{and an increase}} in the sensitivity of the myometrium to the <b>contractile</b> effects of prostaglandins. Mifepristone-induced decidual breakdown indirectly leads to trophoblast detachment, resulting in decreased syncytiotrophoblast production of hCG, which in turn causes decreased production of progesterone by the corpus luteum (pregnancy is dependent on progesterone production by the corpus luteum through the first nine weeks of gestation—until placental progesterone production has increased enough {{to take the place of}} corpus luteum progesterone production). When followed sequentially by a prostaglandin, mifepristone 200mg is (100mg may be, but 50mg is not) as effective as 600mg in producing a medical abortion.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral {{muscle fatigue}} during {{physical}} work is an inability {{for the body}} to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand. This {{is the most common}} case of physical fatigue—affecting a national average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002. This causes <b>contractile</b> dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles to do work. The insufficiency of energy, i.e. sub-optimal aerobic metabolism, generally results in the accumulation of lactic acid and other acidic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle, causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local muscle fatigue, though recent studies have indicated otherwise, actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy.|$|E
25|$|Actin {{participates in}} many {{important}} cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, {{and the establishment}} and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape. Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes. In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the <b>contractile</b> apparatus. The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. It is believed that the diverse range of structures formed by actin enabling it to fulfill such a large range of functions is regulated through the binding of tropomyosin along the filaments.|$|E
