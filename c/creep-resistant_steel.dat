40|$|The {{increase}} of thermal efficiency in power plants {{has been the}} main driving force to develop Ferritic/Martensitic steels for structural applications capable of operating at 923  K (650  °C) and higher. It has been clarified in previous works that nano-sized precipitates and its distribution are the key factors controlling {{the stability of the}} microstructure at high operating temperatures. Based on the science of precipitate strengthening, the aim of this work is to optimize the thermo-mechanical treatment in a commercial <b>creep-resistant</b> <b>steel</b> (G 91) to achieve a microstructure where MX precipitates present a suitable size and distribution. The alternative processing route proposed here allows gaining an increase up to 40  pct in yield strength at 973  K (700  °C) compared to the commercial steel. The results of small punch test carried out at room temperature showed that the improvement in strength was obtained without loss of ductility. This fact was attributed to a finer and more homogeneous dispersion of MX precipitates in comparison to the commercial steel.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis summarizes the theoretical and experimental {{knowledge in the}} field of dissimilar weld joint of progressive austenitic and ferritic <b>creep-resistant</b> <b>steels.</b> The following materials were selected for the presented study: 316 Ti stabilized austenitic stainless steel, martensitic 9 - 12 %Cr steel P 92 and ferritic ODS steel MA 956. The main attention was focused on the long-term microstructural stability during high temperature exposure of heterogeneous joints of the austenite / ferrite type. The literature analysis critically evaluates the current state of knowledge {{in the field of}} microstructural stability of advanced <b>creep-resistant</b> <b>steels</b> weld joints. The practical experimental part was carried out in two directions. On the basis of the chemical composition phase equilibrium calculations were performed for each steel using the ThermoCalc software, giving the basic concepts about the dependence of the phase composition and the chemical composition of phases on temperature. In parallel with these calculations the laboratory joints 316 Ti/P 92 made by resistance welding and the MA 956 / 316 Ti electron beam weld joints were prepared, analyzed in as-weld state and further annealed at different temperature conditions. Exposed joints were subjected to microstructure and phase analysis. The stability of the weld interface was mainly observed. Attention was also focused on the agreement between the calculation and experimental data in comparison with data published in the literature. Based on the calculations, experimental results and published data the suitability of the combination of materials is discussed in the thesis and reasoning about the behavior of studied weld joints during long-term high temperature exposure was formulated. Based on the results the expected degree of microstructural stability of 316 Ti/P 92 joint was confirmed, while the joints MA 956 / 316 Ti were found to be unstable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{tempering}} on the microstructure and roomtemperature yield {{stress of the}} two <b>creep-resistant</b> <b>steels,</b> X 20 CrMoV 121 and P 91, was investigated. The samples were tempered for 17520 h at 650 °C and 8760 h at 750 °C. After tempering, the room-temperature yield stress was determined. In addition, the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) imaging on the tempered samples was carried out. It {{was found that the}} effect of tempering at 750 °C on the microstructure and room-temperature yield stress was greater for both steels than the effect of tempering at 650 °C. Changes of yield stress for both steels were found to be mutually very similar; hence a general mathematical expression with specific parameters for both steels and tempering temperatures was deduced. For the samples tempered at 750 °C only, a fairly good correlation between the interparticle spacing, yield stress and creep rate was observed...|$|R
30|$|Efficiency of {{the power}} plant {{strongly}} depends on the operating steam temperature and pressure. The concern for reducing the CO 2 emission and coal consumption leads to the efforts to build power plants operating at higher steam parameters (Brozda 2007; Shu Ping et al. 2010; David et al. 2013). Austenitic stainless steels are selected for use in sections of superheaters and reheaters, which require good oxidation and fire side corrosion resistance, {{in addition to the}} creep strength. The recent improvements in operating steam temperatures up to 620  °C were achieved through the development of <b>creep-resistant</b> stainless <b>steels,</b> containing Cr, Ni, W, Co, Cu and N. Future plans of increasing the efficiency {{of the power}} plants up to 49  % require <b>creep-resistant</b> <b>steels</b> operating at steam temperatures of 760  °C and pressures of 35  MPa (Viswanathan et al. 2005). Super 304 H austenitic stainless steel is used in recently installed ultra super critical (USC) power units of Japan operating at steam temperature of about 613  °C (Thomas 2013). Further, Super 304 H is listed as a candidate material for superheaters and reheaters in the US program for development of materials for USC with steam temperatures of 760  °C (Viswanathan et al. 2005). Super 304 H with nominal composition of 0.1 C- 18 Cr- 9 Ni- 3 Cu-Nb-N derives excellent creep strength from the distinct Cu addition which precipitates as fine Cu-rich particle under creep conditions, in addition to NbCrN, Nb(C,N) and M 23 C 6 particles (Li et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|In <b>creep-resistant</b> <b>steels</b> several {{mechanisms}} {{contribute to}} the degradation of creep properties under long-time service conditions. Most important are the coarsening of the carbide and subgrain structure and grain-boundary cavitation. If creep cavities on grain-boundaries grow by the constrained diffusive mechanism, partly cavitated boundary facets act mechanically like microcracks. Cell models are worked out numerically to {{explore the influence of}} a distribution of microcracks on the constitutive response of a creeping solid. The results confirm the predictions of analytical estimates based on the differential self -consistent method of Rodin and Parks. The Rodin and Parks model is combined with a Chaboche-type model in order to provide a comprehensive model covering primary, secondary and tertiary creep under arbitrary loading conditions. Measured carbide coarsening and subgrain evolution enter through a microstructurally motivated softening equation. The model parameters are adjusted to a set of creep curves for a 12 per cent chromium steel (X 20 CrMoV 12 1) and to quantitative microstructural measurements. The combined model is implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS. Tests on compact specimens are successfully modeled...|$|R

40|$|In new {{and future}} {{generation}} power plants, <b>creep-resistant</b> <b>steels</b> selected for high-temperature components {{are subjected to}} several service environments. In many of these applications, water vapor {{has been found to}} substantially alter the technologically relevant properties, mainly growth rate and adherence, of the surface oxides. Various data sets exist in the literature for steam oxidation for this type of steel; however, these data show a substantial variability. These differences can be related to, e. g., “batch-to-batch” variations, oxidation conditions, surface treatment, and differences between laboratory/power plants data. Therefore, these literature data need careful and critical verification when being used to estimate the long-term materials behavior in real power generation plants. The paper discusses the existing steam oxidation data for the martensitic steels P 91 (9 %Cr-V-Mo), P 92 (9 %Cr-W-V-Mo), and VM 12 (12 %Cr-Co-W-V-Mo), with the main emphasis on discussing the parameters that are responsible for the observed variations in oxidation rates for the various types of materials. Differences in minor alloying additions and surface treatment have as a result that for the 9 %Cr steels the scale thickness after a given oxidation time may easily differ by a factor of two. Because of the “batch-to-batch variation” in oxidation behavior, the common procedure used to determine service temperatures of tubes made of low-Cr steels on the basis of measured oxide layer thicknesses, has to be used with some care in case of the 9 % to 12 %Cr martensitic steels. This is especially the case for the 12 %Cr steels because their oxidation rates between 500 °C and 650 °C may not steadily increase with increasing temperature...|$|R

To better understand the softening mechanisms in an ASTM Grade 92 steel during uniaxial deformation, tensile tests were carried out at 823 K, showing an extended and stable softening stage after some work-hardening. This behaviour may be due to mechanical instability (necking), damage or microstructural (grain size) evolution. Examination of fractured and non-fractured tensile specimens (metallography, macrohardness tests, SEM, TEM) suggests that the physical mechanisms responsible for softening are mainly grain size evolution and diffuse necking...|$|R

Two different values of the strain rate (2 10 − 3 s− 1 and 10 − 5 s− 1) were used for one strain amplitude. The softening behavior is mainly due to microstructural evolution. Examination of fractured specimens (hardness tests, TEM) shows an influence of strain rate on both increase in subgrain size and decrease in free dislocation density during cycling. Study {{of the evolution of}} isotropic, kinematic and viscous contributions to stress during fatigue tests shows a decrease in the kinematic contribution during cycling.

In this study, microstructures found in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of a T 92 steel weld were simulated to evaluate their creep-rupture-life at elevated temperatures. An infrared heating system was used to heat the samples to 860 °C (around AC 1), 900 °C (slightly below AC 3), and 940 °C (moderately above AC 3) for one minute, before cooling to room temperature. The simulated specimens were then subjected to a conventional post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) at 750 °C for two hours, where both the 900 °C and 940 °C simulated specimens had fine grain sizes. In the as-treated condition, the 900 °C simulated specimen consisted of fine lath martensite, ferrite subgrains, and undissolved carbides, while residual carbides and fresh martensite were found in the 940 °C simulated specimen. The results of short-term creep tests indicated that the creep resistance of the 900 °C and 940 °C simulated specimens was poorer than that of the 860 °C simulated specimens and the base metal.

40|$|The study gives {{a summary}} of the results of {{industrial}} and laboratory investigations regarding an assessment of the thermal fatigue behaviour of <b>creep-resistant</b> austenitic cast <b>steel.</b> The first part of the study was devoted to the problem of textural stresses forming in castings during service, indicating them as a cause of crack formation and propagation. Stresses are forming in carbides and in matrix surrounding these carbides due to considerable differences in the values of the coefficients of thermal expansion of these phases. The second part of the study shows the results of investigations carried out to assess the effect of carbon, chromium and nickel on crack resistance of austenitic cast steel. As a criterion of assessment the amount and propagation rate of cracks forming in the specimens as a result of rapid heating followed by cooling in running water was adopted. Tests were carried out on specimens made from 11 alloys. The chemical composition of these alloys was comprised in a range of the following values: (wt-%) : 18 - 40 %Ni, 17 - 30 %Cr, 1. 2 - 1. 6 %Si and 0. 05 - 0. 6 %C. The specimens were subjected to 75 cycles of heating to a temperature of 900 oC followed by cooling in running water. After every 15 cycles the number of the cracks was counted and their length was measured. The results of the measurements were mathematically processed. It has been proved that the main factor responsible for {{an increase in the number}} of cracks is carbon content in the alloy. In general assessment of the results of investigations, the predominant role of carbon and of chromium in the next place in shaping the crack behaviour of <b>creep-resistant</b> austenitic cast <b>steel</b> should be stressed.

40|$|Creep {{crack growth}} {{in two of}} the {{commonly}} used <b>creep-resistant</b> ferritic <b>steels</b> was investigated. Both steels were tested in the as-processed condition and after many years of service in electric power plants. The test temperature was 540 degrees C and test durations ranged from a few days to a year. In 1 / 2 Cr- 1 / 2 Mo- 1 / 4 V steel, crack growth occured intergranularly by grain boundary cavitation, while 2 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo steel also exhibited transgranular growth. The deformation behavior of CT specimens was analyzed in detail. It was found that for typically 20 % of the lifetime, the instantaneous elastic-plastic strains and, primary creep determine the deformation response. The evolution of the crack length parallels that of the load-line deflection: Initially, the crack grows relatively fast, decelerates until a steady growth rate is reached, and finally accelerates due to the increasing stress intensity at the longer crack. This behavior can be described reasonably accurately by models for creep crack growth taking into account the elastic-plastic transient and primary creep. It is demonstrated that the Ct parameter correlates crack growth rates during the transients, whereas C integral becomes the appropriate load parameter during steady-state creep. However, C integral fails to describe crack growth in single-edge notched tension specimens with shallow cracks. This is tentatively ascribed to excessive crack-tip blunting and other geometry changes. Unloading and reloading frequently leads to accelerated crack growth. (IWM...|$|R

Welding P 91 steel components {{is one of the}} most important technological procedures. The aim of the investigation performed is to why creep rupture on welded joints at high temperatures is often observed in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), especially in the so-called inter-critical zone (IC-HAZ). The creep rupture strength (CRS) of cross-weld joints is usually about 20 to 30 % lower than that of the base material, in the case of <b>creep-resistant</b> modified chromium <b>steels.</b> Precipitation strengthening (PS) depends on the inter-particle spacing (IPS) of secondary phases - MX nanoparticles and/or M 23 C 6 particles. With increasing IPS of secondary phases, the proof stress and creep rupture strength decreases, while creep rate increases. With respect to the small size of each in the HAZ region and to determine the IPS in the HAZ, the simulation technique was used for estimation of the microstructure and properties. The Smitweld machine was used to reproduce the thermal cycles in the HAZ. The microstructure of the HAZ-simulated regions was analysed by transmission electron microscopy. Real creep tests were carried out on specimens with HAZ-simulated regions and also on the P 91 real welded joints. It was found that interparticle spacing of secondary phases in the inter-critical region of the HAZ is much higher than that of the base material. Therefore, the proof stress and hardness, as well as creep rupture strength of the HAZ are lower than that of the base material. Creep test results of the real welded joints and simulated HAZ regions are in good correlation with all theoretical presumptions...|$|R
