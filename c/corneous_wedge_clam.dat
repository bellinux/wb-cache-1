In this study, we report the first molecular, morphological and histopathological descriptions of metacercariae from a trematode belonging to the genus Postmonorchis (Digenea: Monorchiidae) that infects D. trunculus in natural beds of the Italian Tyrrhenian coast (Campania, Lazio and Tuscany). Morphological analysis of the parasite revealed a combination of features that exist in the 3 previously identified species of Postmonorchis, viz. P. donacis, P. variabilis and P. orthopristis, with the addition of new, distinctive morphological characteristics. The pathogen exhibited a predilection for the gill; however, it was also present in the labial palp and mantle in addition to the gut, kidney epithelium and foot. The inflammatory response was characterised by either a focal or diffuse haemocyte infiltration followed by the formation of multiple, large multi-layered capsules associated with tissue destruction. The prevalence of the pathogen ranged from 75 to 100 %, while the infection intensity fluctuated among the study areas. Further studies regarding the life cycle of this parasite and the identification of other larval and adult stages and their respective hosts may confirm the identification of a new species of Postmonorchis that infects <b>wedge</b> <b>clams</b> in Mediterranean waters.

A comparative analysis of size and density was performed from a sample obtained from a commercially exploited population from Isla Canela, and from another population which is managed under a strict plan using only artisanal hand dredging from the beach of the Doñana National Park showing that the management {{carried out in the}} Doñana National Park is correct and allows sustainable fisheries. Twenty one microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized in D. trunculus of which 16 were polymorphic and codominant. At least 12 of them have high frequencies of null alleles in all populations, and the rest in most populations. All collected samples were genotyped with these 16 loci and genetic diversity indices, tests of disequiibrium, fixation indices and probabilities of genetic differentiation among localities were determined. The odds of assignment to the sampling location were also determined. Several analyses were conducted to determine the potential causes for the deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium which shown that they were mainly due to the presence of null alleles. Furthermore, using the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer it was determined that the commercially exploited populations of the <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> under the specific name Donax trunculus are actually a mixture of a hybrid and non-hybrid species. The analysis of the genetic structure made both to all individuals and separately for hybrid and non-hybrid individuals showed four genetically distinct populations in the Spanish coast.

40|$|Growth {{rates of}} the Argentinean <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> Donax hanleyanus were {{estimated}} comparing two different methods in the intertidal of the exposed sandy beach Mar de las Pampas: (i) results of a relatively shortly (49 days) tagging-recapture experiment using the in situ fluorescent marking (IFM) method and subsequent size-increment analyses were compared with results from (ii) length-frequency distributions (LFD) analysis originating from a time consuming 25 month quantitative sampling. Residuals, derived from IFM method and LFD analysis, were of similar magnitude and distribution, indicating that both methods are equally appropriate to estimate growth of D. hanleyanus. Comparing overall growth performance indices (OGPs) of several Donax species from different climate areas it resulted that growth of temperate bivalves can be estimated well by carrying out a relatively short-time tagging-recapture experiment using IFM but it is recommended to use both, the IFM {{as well as the}} LFD method to determine growth of tropical bivalves. Furthermore, an in vitro suitability test of the three stains strontium chloride hexahydrate, alizarin red and calcein resulted that the latter is useful as non-lethal growth marker for D. hanleyanus, emitting a bright green fluorescence band under blue light...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn a {{resource}} management perspective, {{the understanding of}} the relative influence of the physical factors on species connectivity remains a major challenge and is also of great ecological and conservation biology interest. Despite the overfishing threat on the <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> Donax trunculus in Europe, relatively little information is known about its population genetic structure and connectivity and their consequences on conservation policies. We employed 16 microsatellite loci to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure of D. trunculus. A total of 514 samples from seven different localities along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, from the Atlantic (Gulf of Cádiz) to the northwestern Mediterranean were genotyped. The analysis of the population genetic structure displayed a clear distinction along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition with different clusters in the Atlantic Ocean, the Alboran Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean. Consequently, we recommend that these three areas should be considered as different management units. We showed that all populations seem to be at high long-term risk of extinction {{with the exception of the}} protected Doñana National Park population which still seems to have evolutionary potential.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the composition, structure and {{damage caused by}} mechanized dredges on discarded species from the <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> (Donax trunculus Linnaeus 1758) fisheries in the Alboran Sea. Discard samples were collected on board artisanal fishing vessels in 95 commercial hauls performed in Fuengirola and Caleta de Vélez between March 2013 and March 2014. The collected fauna was characterized according to their abundance and biomass, and considering their damage type by using a three-level scale (no damage, intermediate damage and severe damage) defined for the different faunal groups identified. Data was analysed for contrasting variations in the different areas and seasons. A total of 87 species were identified, including Paguridae and Annelida. Molluscs were the best represented faunal group, followed by decapod crustaceans and echinoderms. Other groups did not usually exceed 1 % of the total abundance and biomass such as fishes or sipunculids. Most discarded individuals displayed no damage after their capture, promoting therefore a high survival rate. Among the dominant taxa, echinoderms and crustaceans displayed the highest proportion of damaged individuals due to their fragile exoesqueletons, which make them to be highly vulnerable to the physical impact caused by mechanized dredges and the further processing on board.

40|$|After {{a massive}} {{mortality}} {{of the dominant}} species (the clam Mesodesma mactroides) occurred in 1995, changes in the intertidal community in sandy beaches of Argentina were monitored. Eight sampling stations were established in a 40 km open stretch and samples were taken every October each year up to 2001. Biomass, density, size frequency distribution and mean growth rates for the most abundant species were analyzed. During the mortality event, only the benthic stages of M. mactroides were affected, their total mean biomass diminishing from 1, 399 g to 2 g per running meter beach. Post-mortality recruitment was normal and the growth rates for the youngest cohorts {{were similar to those}} previously reported. After a two years’ lag, the <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> Donax hanleyanus replaced M. mactroides as the dominant species, increasing from 6. 0 g/m up to 24. 3 g/m. However, dominance replacement did not restore the productivity of the intertidal macrobenthic assemblage and, despite the increment of D. hanleyanus stocks, the community total biomass remained < 1 % of the pre-mortality levels. Since 1998 on, M. mactroides and D. hanleyanus showed several peaks in abundance. Disturbance, mainly due to non-regulated fisheries, has been delaying the community recovery. Taking into account the interactions among species and human activities, the present individual resourcebased management should be replaced by an integrated systembased management program including both conservation and tourism requirements...|$|R
40|$|Four {{species of}} the genus Donax (D. semistriatus, D. trunculus, D. variegatus and D. vittatus) are common on Iberian Peninsula coasts. Nevertheless, despite their {{economic}} importance and overexploitation, scarce genetic resources are available. In this work, we newly determined the complete mitochondrial genomes of these four representatives of the family Donacidae, {{with the aim of}} contributing to unveil phylogenetic relationships within the Veneroida order, and of developing genetic markers being useful in <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> identification and authentication, and aquaculture stock management. The complete female mitochondrial genomes of the four species vary in size from 17, 044 to 17, 365 bp, and encode 13 protein-coding genes (including the atp 8 gene), 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs, all located on the same strand. A long non-coding region was identified {{in each of the four}} Donax species between cob and cox 2 genes, presumably corresponding to the Control Region. The Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the Veneroida order indicate that all four species of Donax form a single clade as a sister group of other bivalves within the Tellinoidea superfamily. However, although Tellinoidea is actually monophyletic, none of its families are monophyletic. Sequencing of complete mitochondrial genomes provides highly valuable information to establish the phylogenetic relationships within the Veneroida order.

40|$|Intense human {{activities}} facilitate the successful spread and establishment of non-indigenous aquatic organisms in marine and freshwater ecosystems. In some cases such intrusions result in noticeable and adverse {{changes in the}} recipient environments. In the Baltic Sea, the discovery and rapid initial spread of the North American <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> Rangia cuneata represents {{a new wave of}} invasion which may trigger unpredictable changes of the local benthic communities. In this study we present a species-specific DNA-based marker developed in silico and experimentally tested on environmental samples. Marker specificity and sensitivity were assessed in vitro from water samples containing different mixtures of the target species and other five bivalves currently present in the region: the native Cerastoderma glaucum, Macoma balthica and Mytilus trossulus, the invasive Dreissena polymorpha and the cryptogenic Mya arenaria. Cross-species amplification was not found in any case. The method allows to detecting at least 0. 4 ng of Rangia cuneata DNA per μl, and 0. 1 g of tissue per liter of water. Finally, the marker performance was assessed in water samples from the Baltic Sea and Vistula Lagoon. The coincidence between independent visual observations of Rangia cuneata and positive PCR amplification of the marker from the water samples confirmed the efficiency of this highly reproducible, fast, and technically easy method. Rangia cuneata traces can be detected from environmental DNA even when the population is sparse and small, enabling rapid management responses and allowing to track the invasion dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Population structure, {{growth and}} {{production}} of the <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> Donax trunclus, inhabiting highly exposed sandy beaches of the littoral of Huelva (SW Spain) were investigated between January 2014 and July 2015. Growth rates were estimated comparing two different methods in the intertidal zones of beaches: (i) length-frequency distributions (LFD) analysis in two separated beaches (Doñana and Isla Canela) (ii) internal shell growth bands by thin shell cross sections (TS). For the TS methodology, valves were embedded in methyl-methacrylate, and sequential sections were grounded and polished to a thickness of 80 - 100 µm. This technique allowed the identification of annual ring depositions and the shell length-age keys were performed. In addition, several deformities (related to environmental stress or damages probably caused by fishing gears) as well as signs or recovery were observed. Both methodologies were equally appropriate to estimate growth of D. trunculus. Von Bertalanffy growth functions were established from LFD and TS using an asymptotic length (L∞) of 44. 8 mm and the growth constants (K) of 0. 5 (LF) and 0. 44 yr- 1 (TS). The intertidal biomass of D. trunculus ranged between 3. 03 - 3. 31 g ash-free dry mass (AFDW) m- 2 yr- 1. Individual production revealed the highest value at 27 mm length (0. 117 g AFDW m- 2 yr- 1) and annual production ranged between 3. 40 and 4. 91 g, resulting in renewal rate values (P/B) between 1. 03 y 1. 61. Differences between beaches in terms of annual production and P/B seem to be partially related to human activities. Versión del edito...|$|R
40|$|Donax hanleyanus Philippi, 1847 (Bivalvia: Donacidae) dominates fine to coarse sandy beach {{communities}} of the northern Argentinean Atlantic coast. The population biology of this intertidal <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> was studied by determining population structure, growth and production at the three locations Santa Teresita, Mar de las Pampas (both from December 2005 to December 2006) and Faro Querand&# 305;Ž (from March 2005 to December 2006). Von Bertalanffy growth functions were established from length-frequency distributions using an asymptotic length (LN) of 44 mm and the growth constants (K) of 0. 46 and 0. 47 y 1 respectively of Mar de las Pampas and Faro Querand&# 305;Ž. Compared with growth studies four decades ago, D. hanleyanus today is growing more slowly, but is reaching a higher maximum length. Longevity {{is estimated to be}} approximately five years. The present study confirms that the overall growth performance index is habitat-specific, grouping Donacidae into tropical/subtropical, temperate and upwelling species. The intertidal biomass of D. hanleyanus ranged between 0. 04 and 1. 32 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM) m 2 yr 1. Individual production revealed the highest value at 30 mm length (0. 16 g AFDM m 2 yr 1) and annual production ranged between 0. 08 and 0. 99 g AFDMm 2 yr 1, resulting in renewal rate values (P/B) between 0. 82 and 2. 16. The P/B ratios of D. hanleyanus populations increased with decreasing latitude from temperate to tropical regions. Only at Santa Teresita D. hanleyanus was found living with the sympatric yellow clam Mesodesma mactroides. A significant negative correlation between abundances of both surf clams suggests that abundance peaks of D. hanleyanus are related with population crashes of M. mactroides. Spatial differences in abundance are significantly related to sand texture as confirmed by nonmetrical multidimensional scaling, but not to sea surface temperature. However, the decrease of D. hanleyanus seems to be principally related to human activities...|$|R
40|$|Twelve beaches on {{the coast}} west of Cape Agulhas, South Africa, were {{surveyed}} to examine the influence of several physical factors, including stranded kelp, on the zonation, density and biomass of populations of the <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> Donax serra. Biomass and density of adult clams were significantly higher on beaches with lower cover of stranded kelp; this pattern did not hold for juveniles. Discriminant analysis of beaches with and without Donax classified these beaches 100 % correctly - {{the most important factor}} being kelp cover followed by average winter temperature, wave height, morphodynamic state, beach length, wave period and beach slope. Beaches with Donax had a significantly lower percentage of the drift line covered by stranded kelp (mean = 30 %) than beaches without Donax (mean = 77 %). On two beaches of the southwest coast with similar morphodynamics and temperature regimes but different kelp cover, adult populations were centered in different zones: in the low intertidal to subtidal where kelp cover was higher (mean = 42 %) and in the mid intertidal where no kelp was found. A disturbance hypothesis is developed to explain the observed patterns: kelp stranding in varying quantities interferes with Donax feeding and burrowing activities, dislodging animals of increasing size gradually downshore to the saturation and inner surf zones, where adult populations are eventually established. In the presence of extremely high quantities of stranded kelp, both juveniles and adults would be dislodged from the intertidal to the subtidal. The disturbance process may interact with several other physical factors, being magnified when coupled with low temperatures and small waves on reflective pocket beaches with steep slopes and coarse sands. Additionally, kelp gulls predate dislodged animals, explaining the absence of clams in a stretch of 20 m above the swash zone. It is thus concluded that the zonation patterns here observed are the result of a disturbance effect triggered by stranded kelp and mediated by multiple interacting factors. The adaptations of Donax serra that enable it successfully to colonize intertidal and subtidal habitats of the beach ecosystem are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} dynamics and secondary {{production of the}} <b>wedge</b> <b>clam</b> Donax trunculus were studied in the Gulf of Annaba (Northeast Algeria) monthly for one year at a site close to the Annaba port and the Seybouse river, affected by industrial and agricultural pollution (Sidi Salem), and at a site more distant from major pollution sources, but exploited by fishery (Echatt). The number of individuals (N) was lower at Sidi Salem (36 – 148 ind m- 2) than at Echatt (63 – 272 ind m- 2) in most sampling dates, while the biomass was more variable from one date to another, with no consistent pattern of differences between sites. The condition index (CI), although slightly higher at Sidi Salem than at Echatt, showed at both sites a major increase in March/April, June/July and October, reflecting two main periods of gonads development and {{increase in the level}} of stored reserves {{at the end of the}} reproductive period. Consistently, the recruitment of D. trunculus ran from April to October with a major peak of abundance in spring and a minor one in early fall. The maximum age of D. trunculus was 3 years and the growth rate was highest in the first year. Annual somatic production (P) was lower at Sidi Salem (0. 773 g AFDM m- 2 yr- 1) than at Echatt (1. 262 g AFDM m- 2 yr- 1), possibly reflecting a lower mean annual biomass at Sidi Salem (1. 642 AFDM m- 2) than at Echatt (3. 046 AFDM m- 2), while the annual P/B ratio was similar between the two sites (i. e. 0. 471 and 0. 414 yr- 1, respectively). Lower N and P at Sidi Salem compared to Echatt are consistent with the proximity of Sidi Salem to the industrial port of Annaba and low hydrodynamic conditions which may favor the accumulation of pollutants, such as hydrocarbons. On the other hand, moderate secondary production of D. trunculus at Echatt compared to other Mediterranean sites may be due to excessive harvesting. We suggest that the low secondary production described in this study should be taken into account for the development of sustainable strategies of clam exploitation in the Gulf of Annaba. In particular, effort should be made to reduce land-based pollution and to regulate the collection of D. trunculus according to the life cycle and production potential of this species...|$|R
