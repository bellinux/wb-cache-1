Most T34s, however, continued to be built with rubber-rimmed tires.|$|E

5000|$|A-20 (also {{known as}} BT-20): {{prototype}} {{for a new}} BT tank, with 20mm armour, 45mm 20-K gun, model V-2 diesel engine, and 8×6-wheel <b>convertible</b> <b>drive.</b> Lost out in trials to the A-32, which was further improved and produced as the T-34 medium tank. The only built prototype {{is known to have}} participated in the Battle of Moscow. In 1941, as the Germans neared Moscow, the situation was so desperate that everything battle-worthy was put into service by the Soviets. The A-20 prototype, which at that time was at Kubinka army proving ground near Moscow for evaluation trials, was immediately put into service together with other prototypes of tanks present here, which were organized into a separate company led by Captain Semenov. Later on, the tank was included in the 22nd Tank Brigade organic, together with its predecessors and successors, BT-7 and T-34 tanks. On December 1, 1941, during fighting, the tank was seriously damaged and sent to the rear for repairs. Three days later, it re-entered service with the 22nd Tank Brigade until mid-December, when the tank was again damaged and evacuated to the rear. After these events, its fate is unknown.|$|E

40|$|We examine why firms combine {{convertible}} debt offerings {{with stock}} repurchases. In 2006, 33 % of the convertible issuers in the US simultaneously repurchased stock.

Convertible debt arbitrageurs simultaneously buy convertibles and short sell the issuer’s common stock, resulting in {{downward pressure on}} the stock price. To prevent such short-selling activity, firms repurchase their stock directly from arbitrageurs.

We document a large cross-sectional variation across firms in rationales for issuing convertibles and find mixed support for most theoretical models. Our evidence suggests that the popularity of <b>convertibles</b> is <b>driven</b> primarily by their versatility in adjusting their design to fit the financing needs of individual firms, and by their increased demand among institutional investors.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four empirical studies on firms’ financing decisions. In the first two studies, we investigate the debt-equity choice for {{a large number of}} U. S. firms. We find that firms prefer debt financing over equity financing in case a debt issue allows the firm to keep its investment grade rating. When the financing requirement becomes sufficiently large, firms are more likely to choose equity financing. We find that most firms repurchase debt instead of equity in case they have excess funds. The last two studies of this dissertation deal with convertible security design. Since convertible securities combine debt and equity characteristics, the specific structure of these instruments can provide further insight into the relevant costs and benefits of debt and equity. We find that taxes, the costs of refinancing, and the costs of managerial discretion are important drivers of convertible security design. We further find that the desire to manage earnings has been responsible for recent innovations in the convertible market. <b>Convertible</b> arbitrage <b>drives</b> the innovation of combining a convertible issue with a stock repurchase: the stock repurchase serves to mitigate the negative price impact that results from the short sales of arbitrageurs...|$|R
5000|$|The anti-castrists {{know the}} plane was heading to Florida and now think that LeRoy and Chaz are spies sent to give away {{the secret of the}} island base and presumed invasion.

When Chaz and LeRoy return home they try to re-adjust to civilian life. They thumb a ride with a teenage boy who {{is on his way to}} school and drives a suped-up hotrod car. The boy, who has fantasies of joining the army himself, converses with and gives Chaz and LeRoy a crazy high-speed ride through the back country dropping them off in town. Afterward they go to a diner where the latest music from Del Shannon ("Runaway") and Ronnie Dawson ("Decided By The Angels") is playing on a jukebox and they encounter two young high school girls with a stationwagon. The boys go to a secluded spot with the girls and 'score' with the girls before they go off to school. However the boys are not off the plane too long before Saxon's armed men, having identified them in the diner, are chasing and shooting at them in the night. LeRoy makes it out of the first ambush and gets back to his parents home. Chaz loses contact with him but survives the ambush. The next morning Chaz is searching for LeRoy when a fancy <b>convertible</b> <b>driven</b> by an attractive and rich young woman named Sallie Mae stops to give him a lift. Sallie Mae at first refuses to take Chaz to LeRoy's parents house and he then threatens to cut up her car seats with a penknife if she abandons him on the road. Sallie Mae then consents to take Chaz to LeRoy's parents house deep in the Everglades swamp where her car breaks down in the driveway. LeRoy, Chaz and now Sallie Mae are reunited and it's learned LeRoy's father [...] "Pa" [...] Beecher (Lonny Chapman) runs an illegal Moonshine operation. The Beechers, Pa and Ma, have been out shopping and return to encounter Chaz and Sallie Mae who helps Ma Beecher with the groceries.

40|$|Abstract Background Particulate matter (PM) {{is assumed}} to exert a major burden on public health. Most studies that address levels of PM use {{stationary}} measure systems. By contrast, only few studies measure PM concentrations under mobile conditions to analyze individual exposure situations. Methods By combining spatial-temporal analysis with a novel vehicle-mounted sensor system, the present Mobile Air Quality Study (MAQS) aimed to analyse effects of different driving conditions in a convertible vehicle. PM 10 was continuously monitored in a <b>convertible</b> car, <b>driven</b> with roof open, roof closed, but windows open, or windows closed. Results PM 10 values inside the car were nearly always higher with open roof than with roof and windows closed, whereas no difference was seen with open or closed windows. During the day PM 10 values varied with high values before noon, and occasional high median values or standard deviation values due to individual factors. Vehicle speed in itself did not influence the mean value of PM 10; however, at traffic speed (10 – 50 km/h) the standard deviation was large. No systematic difference was seen between PM 10 values in stationary and mobile cars, nor was any PM 10 difference observed between driving within or outside an environmental (low emission) zone. Conclusions The present study has shown the feasibility of mobile PM analysis in vehicles. Individual exposure of the occupants varies depending on factors like time of day as well as ventilation of the car; other specific factors are clearly identifiably and may relate to specific PM 10 sources. This system {{may be used to}} monitor individual exposure ranges and provide recommendations for preventive measurements. Although differences in PM 10 levels were found under certain ventilation conditions, these differences are likely not of concern for the safety and health of passengers. </p...|$|R
