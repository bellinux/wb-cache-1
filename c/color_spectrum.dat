5|$|Sea lions have color vision, {{though it}} {{is limited to the}} blue-green area of the <b>color</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This is likely an {{adaptation}} for living in marine coastal habitats. Sea lions have fairly acute underwater hearing, with a hearing range of 0.4–32 kHz. Sea lions rely on their whiskers or vibrissae for touch and detection of vibrations underwater. Compared to the harbor seal, the California sea lion's vibrissae are smoother and less specialized and thus perform less when following hydrodynamic trails, although they still perform well.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the <b>color</b> <b>spectrum.</b> As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E

25|$|Images of auroras are {{significantly}} more common today {{than in the}} past due to the increase in use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities. Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different <b>color</b> <b>spectrum</b> present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of film can be very important. Longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by Newton’s {{theory of}} music-color correspondences, the French Jesuit Louis-Bertrand Castel {{designed}} a color harpsichord (clavecin oculaire) with colored strips of paper which {{rose above the}} cover of the harpsichord whenever a particular key was hit (Campen 2007, Franssen 1991). Renowned masters like Telemann and Rameau were actively engaged {{in the development of a}} clavecins oculaire. The invention of the gas light in the nineteenth century created new technical possibilities for the color organ. In England between 1869 and 1873, the inventor Frederick Kastner developed an organ that he named a Pyrophone. The British inventor Alexander Rimington, a professor in fine arts in London, documented the phrase ‘Colour-Organ’ for the first time in a patent application in 1893. Inspired by Newton’s idea that music and color are both grounded in vibrations, he divided the <b>color</b> <b>spectrum</b> into intervals analogous to musical octaves and attributed colors to notes. The same notes in a higher octave produced the same color tone but then in a lighter value (Peacock 1988). Around the turn of the century, concerts with light and musical instruments were given quite regularly. As most technical problems had been conquered, the psychological questions concerning the effects of these performances came to the fore. The Russian composer Alexander Scriabin was particularly interested in the psychological effects on the audience when they experienced sound and color simultaneously. His theory was that when the correct color was perceived with the correct sound, ‘a powerful psychological resonator for the listener’ would be created. His most famous synesthetic work, which is still performed today, is Prometheus, Poem of Fire. On the score of Prometheus, he wrote next to the instruments separate parts for the tastiere per luce, the color organ (Campen 2007, Galeyev 2001, Gleich 1963).|$|E

Computer and Video Games praised the voice acting and music, but noted frequent drops in framerate. Ponce panned the English voice work, saying that it added to the unlikeliness of Aeron and Elena's relationship in addition to poor lip-syncing, and called the textures [...] "very ugly" [...] despite a large <b>color</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Edwards also noted the variety of colors and dungeon design found in the Towers, but noted that the game's pace left little time to admire them. Schilling felt that the art design was hampered by technical limitations and praised the choral musical elements, while Raze praised both the character designs and soundtrack. Kemps called the character and environment design [...] "superb" [...] despite technical limitations, and Hogarty praised the boss monsters' designs and scenic variety.|$|E
500|$|The set {{containing}} Sterling Cooper's corporate offices contained skypans {{fitted with}} 5K bulbs onto the centers, which measured 8inches apart. Ambrose {{collaborated with the}} production team to institute twenty-five inch trusses on chain motors and to devise dollys with Arri Alexa cameras that were eventually installed on aluminum I-beams. Ambrose proclaimed that {{the flexibility of the}} trolleys and chain motors enabled production to move more efficiently in concentrating on the design of the window. He added: [...] "We also had four 20Ks and a few more T-12s on stands that could be rolled around the office floor. For tungsten close-ups, we often used Barger-Baglite six- and three-light units with Chimeras, soft cloth, diaper baffles and 60- and 90-degree honeycomb grids for control." [...] In comparison, Ambrose used traditional lighting when creating the housing for the character, as he favored the <b>color</b> <b>spectrum</b> of a household lightbulb. For example, Don's home required four to five rooms to be lit simultaneously. [...] "We used a lot of batten strips with 100-watt household bulbs," [...] noted Ambrose. [...] "The bulbs are so close they're almost touching, so they create a single source that doesn't cast multiple shadows. Over time, we built housings for them with channels into which you can slide diffusion frames or egg crates. We call them 'Whiteys' because the guy who knocked these shells out of tin back in New York was named Whitey; I used them extensively on The Sopranos and felt they suited the homes in Mad Men as well." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method for}} automatic colorization of images (or two-dimensional fields presented as images), in order to clearly visualize the intensity level. Medical images like X-ray, CT scan, MRI and Ultrasound images are generally gray images. In these type of applications, brightness level are very important for good diagnosis. In generally used pseudocoloring methods intensity information is lost due to simple to one transform. Hence a parametric path in RGB color cube is introduced for preserving the brightness level. The obtained spiral can provide a number of <b>color</b> <b>spectra</b> by altering its parameters. in pseudocored image. This method can also applied on images of higher number of bits. Here this technique is taken as the tool for enhancing the gray medical images. A hybrid scheme is also applied in which a specific window of gray image is psudocolored with a <b>color</b> <b>spectra</b> other than the applied on remaining image. Human beings can only discern a few dozen gray level values while they can distinguish thousands of colors, the use of color for human interpretation could only improve the diagnosis process. It can produce an image in different color spectras for visualising the medical image clearly and effectively highlight the disease areas, which results in better diagnosis...|$|R
