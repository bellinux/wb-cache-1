25|$|A crystal radio receiver, {{also called}} a crystal set or cat's whisker receiver, {{is a very}} simple radio receiver, popular {{in the early days}} of radio. It needs no other power source but that {{received}} solely from the power of radio waves received by a wire antenna. It gets its name from its most important component, known as a <b>crystal</b> <b>detector,</b> originally made from a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena. This component is now called a diode.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} crystal receivers did {{not have}} a tuned circuit at all, and just consisted of a <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> connected between the antenna and ground, with an earphone across it. Since this circuit lacked any frequency-selective elements besides the broad resonance of the antenna, it had little ability to reject unwanted stations, so all stations within a wide band of frequencies were heard in the earphone (in practice the most powerful usually drowns out the others). It was used in the earliest days of radio, when only one or two stations were within a crystal set's limited range.|$|E
25|$|A <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> {{includes}} a crystal, a special thin wire that contacts the crystal, and the stand that holds those components in place. The most common crystal used {{is a small}} piece of galena; pyrite was also often used, as it was a more easily adjusted and stable mineral, and quite sufficient for urban signal strengths. Several other minerals also performed well as detectors. Another benefit of crystals was that they could demodulate amplitude modulated signals. This device brought radiotelephones and voice broadcast to a public audience. Crystal sets represented an inexpensive and technologically simple method of receiving these signals {{at a time when the}} embryonic radio broadcasting industry was beginning to grow.|$|E

40|$|<b>Crystal</b> <b>detectors</b> {{have been}} used widely in high energy and nuclear physics experiments, medical {{instruments}} and homeland security applications. Novel <b>crystal</b> <b>detectors</b> are continuously being discovered and developed in academia and in industry. In high energy and nuclear physics experiments, total absorption electromagnetic calorimeters (ECAL) made of inorganic crystals {{are known for their}} superb energy resolution and detection efficiency for photon and electron measurements [1]. A crystal ECAL is thus the choice for those experiments where precision measurements of photons and electrons are crucial for their physics missions. Examples are the Crystal Ball NaI(Tl) ECAL, the L 3 BGO ECAL and the BaBar CsI(Tl) ECAL in lepton colliders, the kTeV CsI ECAL and the CMS PWO ECAL in hadron colliders and the Fermi CsI(Tl) ECAL in space. For future HEP experiments at the energy and intensity frontiers, however, the <b>crystal</b> <b>detectors</b> used in the above mentioned ECALs are either not bright and fast enough, or not radiation hard enough. <b>Crystal</b> <b>detectors</b> have also been proposed to build a Homogeneous Hadron Calorimeter (HHCAL) to achieve unprecedented jet mass resolution by duel readout of both Cherenkov and scintillation light [2], where development of cost-effective <b>crystal</b> <b>detectors</b> is a crucial issue because of the huge crystal volume required [3].

25|$|De Forest {{eventually}} came {{into conflict with}} his company's management. His main complaint was the limited support he got for conducting research, while company officials were upset with de Forest's inability to develop a practical receiver free of patent infringement. (This problem was finally resolved with {{the invention of the}} carborundum <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> by another company employee, General H. H. Dunworthy). On November 28, 1906, in exchange for $1000 (half of which was claimed by an attorney) and the rights to some early Audion detector patents, de Forest turned in his stock and resigned from the company that bore his name. American DeForest was then reorganized as the United Wireless Telegraph Company, and would be the dominant U.S. radio communications firm, albeit propped up by massive stock fraud, until its bankruptcy in 1912.|$|E
500|$|The probe is {{connected}} to a detector and a display meter (not shown in figure 2). [...] These can be, respectively, a thermistor and power meter, or an envelope detector and VSWR meter. [...] The detector can be a <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> or a Schottky barrier diode. [...] The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance Î»/4 from the probe tip {{as shown in figure}} 3. [...] This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the quarter-wave impedance transformer effect. [...] Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line. [...] The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector. [...] Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.|$|E
500|$|A typical {{test setup}} with a {{waveguide}} slotted line {{is shown in}} figure 2. [...] Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown) [...] enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher (1). [...] This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide. [...] An important component in the setup is the isolator (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source. [...] Depending on the test conditions, such reflections can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave. [...] The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable attenuator (4). [...] This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage. [...] The carriage also carries the probe adjustements: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a <b>crystal</b> <b>detector.</b> [...] The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a matched load (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide. [...] The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test. [...] It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line. [...] The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a rotary knob (11) which simultaneously moves a vernier gauge (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.|$|E

2500|$|Indian {{scientist}} Jagadish Chandra Bose was {{the first}} to use a crystal for detecting radio waves in 1894. The <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> was developed into a practical device for wireless telegraphy by Greenleaf Whittier Pickard, who invented a silicon <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> in 1903 and received a patent for it on November 20, 1906. Other experimenters tried a variety of other substances, of which the most widely used was the mineral galena (lead sulfide). Other substances offered slightly better performance, but galena was most widely used because it had the advantage of being cheap and easy to obtain. The <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> in these early crystal radio sets consisted of an adjustable wire point-contact, often made of gold or platinum because of their incorrodible nature (the so-called [...] "cat's whisker"), which could be manually moved over the face of the crystal in search of a portion of that mineral with rectifying qualities. This troublesome device was superseded by thermionic diodes (vacuum tubes) by the 1920s, but after high purity semiconductor materials became available, the <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> returned to dominant use with the advent, in the 1950s, of inexpensive fixed-germanium diodes. Bell Labs also developed a germanium diode for microwave reception, and AT used these in their microwave towers that criss-crossed the United States starting in the late 1940s, carrying telephone and network television signals. Bell Labs did not develop a satisfactory thermionic diode for microwave reception.|$|E

My specific project focused on simulating the high granularity calorimeter for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. CMS detects particles using calorimeters. The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECal) is arranged cylindrically to form a barrel section and two âendcaps. â Previously, both the barrel and endcap have employed lead tungstate <b>crystal</b> <b>detectors,</b> known as the âshashlikâ design. The <b>crystal</b> <b>detectors,</b> however, rapidly degrade from exposure to radiation. This effect is most pronounced in the endcaps. To avoid the high expense of frequently replacing degraded detectors, it was recently decided to eliminate the endcap crystals in favor of an arrangement of silicon detectors known as the âHigh Granularity Calorimeterâ (HGCal), while leaving the barrel detector technology unchanged. The primary aim of my project was to investigate the performance of HGCal using a series of simulations and to compare the performance of the new silicon detectors in the endcap with the traditional <b>crystal</b> <b>detectors</b> in the barrel...|$|R

2500|$|The <b>crystal</b> <b>detector</b> worsened the problem, {{because it}} has {{relatively}} low resistance, thus it [...] "loaded" [...] the tuned circuit, drawing significant current and thus damping the oscillations, reducing its Q factor so it allowed through a broader band of frequencies.

2500|$|Bengali-Indian {{physicist}} Jagadish Chandra Bose {{was first}} to use a crystal as a radio wave detector, using galena detectors to receive microwaves starting around 1894.

The device depended on the large variation of a semiconductor's conductance with temperature; today we would call his invention a bolometer. Bose's patent is frequently, but erroneously, cited as a type of rectifying detector. On August 30, 1906, Greenleaf Whittier Pickard filed a patent for a silicon <b>crystal</b> <b>detector,</b> which was granted on November 20, 1906.
