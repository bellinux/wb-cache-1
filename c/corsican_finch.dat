50|$|The {{citril finch}} {{differs from the}} <b>Corsican</b> <b>finch</b> C. corsicana in habitat selection. While the {{mainland}} citril finch is rather restricted to subalpine coniferous forests and alpine meadows, the insular <b>Corsican</b> <b>finch</b> {{may be found in}} different habitats from sea level to the highest mountain slopes. The citril finch nests mainly in conifers such as pines (Pinus) and spruces (Picea) while the <b>Corsican</b> <b>finch</b> uses also lower bushes such as tree Heath (Erica arborea), juniper (Juniperus) and bramble (Rubus).|$|E

50|$|The <b>Corsican</b> <b>finch</b> (Carduelis corsicana), {{also known}} as Corsican citril finch or Mediterranean citril finch is a bird in the finch family, Fringillidae.|$|E
5000|$|The {{goldfinch}} {{was one of}} {{the birds}} described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his Historiae animalium of 1555. The first formal description was by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1758. He introduced the binomial name, Fringilla carduelis. [...] Carduelis is the Latin word for a goldfinch. The genus Carduelis was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 by tautonomy based on Linneus's specific epithet. Modern molecular genetic {{studies have shown that the}} European goldfinch is closely related to the citril finch, (Carduelis citrinella) and the <b>Corsican</b> <b>finch,</b> (Carduelis corsicana).|$|E
5000|$|The {{citril finch}} was {{formally}} {{described by the}} German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 under the binomial name Fringilla citrinella. The current genus name Carduelis is the Latin word for the European goldfinch, and the [...] specific epithet citrinella is the Italian word for a small yellow bird. It is a diminutive of the Latin citrinus meaning citrine or light greenish-yellow. The <b>Corsican</b> <b>finch</b> (Carduelis corsicana) was at one time considered as conspecific with the citril finch but is now treated a separate species. Molecular genetic {{studies have shown that}} the citril finch is closely related to the European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis).|$|E
