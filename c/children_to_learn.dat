5|$|A key {{ingredient}} to the Hammond organ's success {{was the use}} of dealerships and a sense of community. Several dedicated organ dealers set up business in the United States and there was a bi-monthly newsletter, The Hammond Times, mailed out to subscribers. Advertisements tended to show families gathered around the instrument, often with a child playing it, as an attempt to show the organ as a center-point of home life and to encourage <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> music.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{studied in}} Coupvray {{until the age}} of ten. Because of his {{combination}} of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris. Braille, the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment for blind <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and associate together.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E

5000|$|In {{considering}} curriculum using {{a holistic}} approach, one {{must address the}} question of what <b>children</b> need <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> Since holistic education seeks to educate the whole person, there are some key factors that are essential to this type of education. First, <b>children</b> need <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about themselves. This involves learning self-respect and self-esteem. Second, <b>children</b> need <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about relationships. In learning about their relationships with others, there is a focus on social [...] "literacy" [...] (<b>learning</b> <b>to</b> see social influence) andemotional [...] "literacy" [...] (one's own self in relation <b>to</b> others). Third, <b>children</b> need <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about resilience. This entails overcoming difficulties, facing challenges and <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> ensure long-term success. Fourth, <b>children</b> need <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about aesthetics - This encourages the student to see the beauty of what is around them and <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> have awe in life.|$|R
5|$|Real {{schoolchildren}} participated {{throughout the}} movie's filming. Khan credited {{them with the}} film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them. Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and {{went to great lengths}} to attend to them. The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming. New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> patience and cooperation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school. Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate. To fill out the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in. A total of 1,500children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400students.|$|E
5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

40|$|Replicating earlier research, a study {{examined}} parental expectations {{for their children}} in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Subjects, 88 parents approached as they were leaving the supermarket, were asked whether they thought their <b>children</b> would <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> speak, listen, read, and write. Interviews were conducted by 21 preservice teachers who had collaborated {{in the development of}} the replication. Results indicated that, of the 88 parents interviewed, 80 expected their <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> listen, 86 expected their <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> write, 87 expected their <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> speak, and 85 expected their <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> read. However, many of the negative comments were given in a sarcastic tone, making it difficult to interpret the validity of the recorded response. The preservice teachers were administered an informal questionnaire. Results indicated that participation in the research process allowed them to interact with parents in a real situation and to discover that most parents have high expectations for their children learning. Results also indicated that the pr- ervice teachers gained knowledge of the processes involved with conducting research and enjoyed being involved. Further research will alter the order of interview questions, sites for conducting interviews, and the extent to which parents are informed of the purpose of the interviews.

50|$|The PB {{theory is}} that child development, besides its {{physical}} growth, consists of the learning of repertoires {{some of which are}} basic in the sense they provide the behaviors for many life situations and also they determine what and how well the individual can learn. That theory states that humans are unique in having a building type of learning, cumulative learning, in which basic repertoires enable the <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> other repertoires that enable the learning of other repertoires. Learning language, for example, enables the <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> various other repertoires, like reading, number concepts, and grammar. Those repertoires provide the bases for learning other repertoires. For example, reading ability, opens the possibilities for an individual to do things and learn things that a non-reader cannot.|$|R

25|$|Responding to {{a growing}} multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education {{introduced}} evening English as a Second Language (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its languages programs, offering night classes in 23 languages.

25|$|Neuroplasticity is {{involved}} in the development of sensory function. The brain is born immature and it adapts to sensory inputs after birth. In the auditory system, congenital hearing impairment, a rather frequent inborn condition affecting 1 of 1000 newborns, has been shown to affect auditory development, and implantation of a sensory prostheses activating the auditory system has prevented the deficits and induced functional maturation of the auditory system. Due to a sensitive period for plasticity, there is also a sensitive period for such intervention within the first 2–4 years of life. Consequently, in prelingually deaf children, early cochlear implantation, as a rule, allows the <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the mother language and acquire acoustic communication.|$|E
