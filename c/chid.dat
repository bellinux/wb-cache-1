2500|$|Little {{is known}} of Richardson's early years beyond the few things that Richardson was willing to share. Although he was not {{forthcoming}} with specific events and incidents, he did talk {{about the origins of}} his writing ability; Richardson would tell stories to his friends and spent his youth constantly writing letters. One such letter, written when Richardson was almost 11, was directed to a woman in her 50s who was in the habit of constantly criticizing others. [...] "Assuming the style and address of a person in years", Richardson cautioned her about her actions. However, his handwriting was used to determine that it was his work, and the woman complained to his mother. The result was, as he explains, that [...] "my mother <b>chid</b> me for the freedom taken by such a boy with a woman of her years" [...] but also [...] "commended my principles, though she censured the liberty taken".|$|E
