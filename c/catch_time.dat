40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the patterns}} of variation that characterize 33 <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series of large pelagic fishes exploited by the Japanese and Taiwanese longline fisheries in the Indian Ocean from 1968 to 2003. We selected four species, the yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), the bigeye (T. obesus), the albacore (T. alalunga), and the swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and aggregated data into five biogeographic provinces of Longhurst (2001). We carried out wavelet analyses, an efficient method to study non-stationary time series, {{in order to get}} the time-scale patterns of each signals. We then compared and grouped the different wavelet spectra using a multivariate analysis to identify the factors (species, province or fleet) that may influence their clustering. We also investigated the associations between <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series and a large-scale climatic index, the Dipole Mode Index (DMI), using cross wavelet analyses. Our results evidenced that the geographical province is more important than the species level when analyzing the 33 <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series in the tropical Indian Ocean. The DMI further impacted the variability of tuna and swordfish <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series at several periodic bands and at different temporal locations, and we demonstrated that the geographic locations modulated its impact. We discussed the consistency of time series fluctuations that reflect embedded information and complex interactions between biological processes, fishing strategies and environmental variability at different scales...|$|E

40|$|The {{thornback ray}} (Raja clavata) in the Bay of Biscay {{is presumed to}} have {{declined}} during the 20 th Century. To evaluate this decline and estimate biomass trajectories, a hypothetical <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series was created for the period 1903 - 2013. A Bayesian state-space biomass production model with a Schaefer production function was fitted to the hypothetical <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series and to a shorter research vessel Catch Per Unit Eeffort (CPUE) time series (1973 - 2013, with missing years). A censored likelihood {{made it possible to}} obtain biomass estimates without a CPUE time series or only with an estimate of biomass depletion. A simulation-estimation approach showed a high sensitivity of results to the prior for the intrinsic growth rate. The model provided biomass trajectories which corroborated and quantified the decline of the Bay of Biscay population. The estimated biomass corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield, BMSY, was 32 000 tonnes, which is 17 times higher than the estimated biomass in 2014. The biomass estimates obtained without a CPUE time series were highly uncertain. Adding a current biomass depletion observation improved precision, though the biomass time trend was sensitive to this value. Results should be interpreted carefully as several assumptions were necessary to create the long <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series and to define informative priors, notably for the intrinsic growth rate. Despite this, the results confirm the depleted state of the thornback ray in the Bay of Biscay with the estimated biomass in 2014 being around 3 % of carrying capacity...|$|E

40|$|The factors {{affecting}} {{efficient use of}} tip traps to control rabbit populations were investigated {{in a series of}} field experiments. It was found that continual trapping at the same location was much less effective than periodic trapping. Night-time trapping operations produced larger catches of rabbits than day-time trapping. Traps were equally effective whether sited on existing runs through rabbit proof fences or on previously unbreached sections of fence. The sex ratio of rabbits caught was examined at four different locations and, in each instance, more females were caught than males. The installation of a network of tip traps and associated rabbit proof fencing on a study farm in southern Scotland provided a small positive income per rabbit when carcasses were sold to a local game dealer. Traditional trapping methods employing a professional trapper on the same study farm resulted in a large reduction in rabbit numbers, but despite the sale of carcasses to a local dealer, there was still a net cost to the farmer per rabbit caught. The <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> per rabbit using tip traps was considerably less than the <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> per rabbit using a professional trapper...|$|E
40|$|Catch data {{of large}} pelagic fish such as tuna, {{swordfish}} and billfish are highly variable ranging from short to long term. Based on fisheries data, these time series are noisy and reflect mixed information on exploitation (targeting, strategy, fishing power), population dynamics (recruitment, growth, mortality, migration, etc.), and environmental forcing (local conditions or dominant climate patterns). In this work, we investigated patterns of variation of large pelagic fish (i. e. yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna, swordfish and blue marlin) in Japanese longliners catch data from 1960 to 2004. We performed wavelet analyses on the yearly time series of each fish species in each biogeographic {{province of the}} tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans. In addition, we carried out cross-wavelet analyses between these biological time series and a large-scale climatic index, i. e. the Southern Oscillation Index (Sol). Results showed that the biogeographic province {{was the most important}} factor structuring the patterns of variability of Japanese <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series. Relationships between the SOI and the fish catches in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans also pointed out the role of climatic variability for structuring patterns of variation of <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series.

40|$|Global {{fisheries}} {{are in a}} crisis, and so are {{the marine}} ecosystems upon which these fisheries depend. Major policy and management changes are required to halt and reverse the trends that have brought about this situation. Underlying these changes is the need for availability of data sets, pertaining to large areas, that unequivocally demonstrate any large-scale fisheries impacts on marine ecosystems. Not until recently have such secondary data begun to be assembled, although data sets have been available for some time upon which such demonstrations could be based. This applies particularly to the global fisheries statistics assembled and maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which are assembled by large, arbitrary statistical areas (rather than by ecosystems), and which are not verified against local data sets. The present contribution documents a multi-pronged approach to develop and test a methodology for reconstructing historic <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series (including misreported catches), and spatially assign these to ecosystems on a large spatial scale. This will serve as baselines for assessing the ‘health ’ of ecosystems, and to evaluate the effects of fishing and management scenarios. Important components of this methodology are a globa...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} the first {{contribution}} towards the development of ecosystem-based fisheries management in northeastern Brazil, through the exploration of fishing policies based on a trophic model. The following objectives were addressed: 1) analysis of the richness of common names of Brazilian fishes; 2) reconstruction of time series of marine catches; 3) modelling of trophic interactions off northeastern Brazil; and 4) assessment of fishing policies. The analysis of common names indicated a high richness of names per species (average = 6) {{and the use of}} the same common name for different species, with a negative impact on the accuracy of catch statistics. The reconstruction of <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series was based on landings from national yearbooks, and from ICCAT and FAO’s databases (1978 - 2000), allowing for the detection of ‘fishing down the food web ’ in northeastern Brazil. The trophic model estimated a total biomass for this ecosystem of 222 tonnes·km- 2 (excluding detritus), and indicated a low degree of omnivory and the high importance of detritus. Simulations for 2001 - 2028 indicated that current fishing effort is unsustainable for lobsters and swordfish; however, the model inadequately described the dynamics of swordfish, tunas, and other large pelagics, which have large distribution areas. The simulation of optimum fishing policies led to a diverse fleet whe...|$|E

Most of the 101 triatomines collected, were unfed and negative for Trypanosoma cruzi. T. guasayana predominated over T. sordida, and both appeared on the lighted screens between 19 - 31 min (mean 24) after dusk and the <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> was 30 - 45 min. Although entomological evaluation of 41 houses at Amamá performed in September 1985, just before insecticidal spraying, showed that Triatoma infestans predominated, adults of T. guasayana were collected in sleeping places, in 7 houses (17 %). Most triatomines invading houses from then up to 1990 were flying T. guasayana (20 / 27) and females outnumbered males. Three non infected T. guasayana females were fed on man and two T. guasayana males positive for "T. cruzi like" trypanosomes were unfed.

40|$|The {{speculation}} {{that climate change}} may impact on sustainable fish production suggests a {{need to understand how}} these effects influence fish catch on a broad scale. With a gross annual value of A 2. 2 billion, the fishing industry is a significant primary industry in Australia. Many commercially important fish species use estuarine habitats such as mangroves, tidal flats and seagrass beds as nurseries or breeding grounds and have lifecycles correlated to rainfall and temperature patterns. Correlation of catches of mullet (e. g. Mugil cephalus) and barramundi (Lates calcarifer) with rainfall suggests that fisheries may be sensitive to effects of climate change. This work reviews key commercial fish and crustacean species and their link to estuaries and climate parameters. A conceptual model demonstrates ecological and biophysical links of estuarine habitats that influences capture fisheries production. The difficulty involved in explaining the effect of climate change on fisheries arising from the lack of ecological knowledge may be overcome by relating climate parameters with long-term fish catch data. Catch per unit effort (CPUE), rainfall, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and <b>catch</b> <b>time</b> series for specific combinations of climate seasons and regions have been explored and surplus production models applied to Queensland 2 ̆ 7 s commercial fish catch data with the program CLIMPROD.
