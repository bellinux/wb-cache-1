When observed over multiple epochs, some stars show polarity reversals in their global magnetic fields. On the Sun, polarity reversals are a feature of its activity cycle. In this paper, we examine the magnetic properties of stars with existing chromospherically determined <b>cycle</b> <b>periods.</b> Previous authors have suggested that <b>cycle</b> <b>periods</b> lie on multiple branches, either in the cycle period-Rossby number plane or the <b>cycle</b> period-rotation <b>period</b> plane. We find some evidence that stars along the active branch show significant average toroidal fields that exhibit large temporal variations while stars exclusively on the inactive branch remain dominantly poloidal throughout their entire cycle. This lends credence {{to the idea that}} different shear layers are in operation along each branch. There is also evidence that the short magnetic polarity switches observed on some stars are characteristic of the inactive branch while the longer chromospherically determined periods are characteristic of the active branch. This may explain the discrepancy between the magnetic and chromospheric <b>cycle</b> <b>periods</b> found on some stars.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{activity of the}} Sun becomes stronger and weaker over roughly an 11 year cycle, modulating the radiation and charged particle environment experienced by the Earth as "space weather". Decades of observations from the Mount Wilson Observatory have revealed that other stars also show regular activity cycles in their Ca II H+K line emission, and identified two different relationships between {{the length of the}} cycle and the rotation rate of the star. Recent observations at higher cadence have allowed the discovery of shorter <b>cycles</b> with <b>periods</b> between 1 - 3 yr. Some of these shorter cycles coexist with longer <b>cycle</b> <b>periods,</b> suggesting that two underlying dynamos can operate simultaneously. We combine these new observations with previous data, and we show that the longer and shorter <b>cycle</b> <b>periods</b> agree remarkably well with those expected from an earlier analysis based on the mean activity level and the rotation period. The relative turbulent length scales associated with the two branches of cyclic behavior suggest that a near-surface dynamo may be the dominant mechanism that drives cycles in more active stars, whereas a dynamo operating in deeper layers may dominate in less active stars. However, several examples of equally prominent long and short cycles have been found at all levels of activity of stars younger than 2. 3 Gyr. Deviations from the expected <b>cycle</b> <b>periods</b> show no dependence on the depth of the convection zone or on the metallicity. For some stars that exhibit longer cycles, we compute the <b>periods</b> of shorter <b>cycles</b> that might be detected with future high-cadence observations.

To obtain longer generation times two of the K- 12 strains were cultivated at several different dilution rates in glucose-limited chemostats. The replication period (C period) {{was found to be}} similar in K- 12 and B/r strains grown at similar generation times. At generation times below 60 min the C period was constant; above 60 min it increased linearly with increasing generation time. The period from termination of replication to cell division (D period) was more variable. It was much shorter in B/r than in K- 12 strains. Like the C period it was relatively constant at generation times below 60 min and it increased with increasing generation times at longer generation times. In glucose-limited chemostats good correlation was found between D periods and generation times, whereas batch cultures exhibited carbon-source-dependent variations. Chemostat cultures showed cell cycle variations very similar to those obtained in batch cultures. These flow cytometric determinations of cell <b>cycle</b> <b>periods</b> confirm earlier determinations of the C period and establish that the D period also varies with generation time in slowly growing cultures.

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{findings}} of these experiments was that when free to self-select their schedules, humans run on an approximately 25-h day. More recent experiments {{have shown that the}} intrinsic period of the human circadian pacemaker is actually 24.1-24.2 h.

Strikingly, the length of the sleep/wake cycle varied significantly (from 12 h in some subjects to 68 h in others), while the core body temperature rhythm maintained a period close to 25 h.
