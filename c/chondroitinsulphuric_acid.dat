40|$|IN a {{previous}} investigation (Prodi, 1963) attention {{was focused on}} the changes of acid mucopolysaccharides (MPS) in the dermis during skin treatment with carcinogenic and irritating substances: after one month's treatment with both 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) and croton oil, a relevant percentage increase in hyaluronic acid (HA) and decrease in <b>chondroitinsulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> (CSA) was observed. An analysis of the behaviour of MPS in the dermis ground substance during a long term experiment with the two substances (Prodi and David, 1964) showed that the development of MPS changes {{during the time of the}} experiment was the same in both cancerogenic and simply irritating treatment, the differences in relative composition of MPS depending more on the intensity than on the kind of treatment used. In the present work the synthesis of dermis MPS during skin treatment with DMBA is considered; the aim is to obtain information about the metabolic changes which support the above mentioned alterations of ground substance. The study of MPS metabolism is based on the incorporation of glucose a...|$|E
