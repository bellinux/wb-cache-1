25|$|Evernham Motorsports {{was founded}} in the year 2000 by former crew <b>chief</b> <b>Ray</b> Evernham, who won three championships atop the pit box for Jeff Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports. Evernham was named a team manager and owner for Diamler Chrysler's return to NASCAR's top level through their Dodge brand, leading the {{development}} of the Intrepid R/T race car that debuted in 2001. The team also operated with direct factory backing and sponsorship from Dodge. The team originally operated out of the former facility of Bill Elliott Racing.|$|E
25|$|Richard Petty Motorsports (RPM) is an American {{professional}} {{stock car}} racing team that currently competes in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. The team {{is owned by}} seven-time NASCAR champion Richard Petty and New York businessman Andrew M. Murstein. The team was founded as Evernham Motorsports in 2000 by former crew <b>chief</b> <b>Ray</b> Evernham, entering full-time competition as a two-car operation in 2001 and fielding additional full-time entries in alliances with Ultra Motorsports and the Valvoline corporation. The organization was renamed Gillett Evernham Motorsports in 2007 after former Montreal Canadiens and Liverpool F.C. owner George Gillett bought a controlling interest from founder Evernham, and took on its current name after merging with Petty's team Petty Enterprises in 2009. Known for its factory backing from Dodge since its inception, the team switched to Ford in late 2009 and merged with Yates Racing for 2010. The team has the odd {{distinction of being the}} result of three successful teams (Evernham, Petty, & Yates) merging after falling on hard times.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Carolina, Davis {{was asked by}} the Ford Motor Company to hire up-and-coming Midwest driver Jeff Gordon, who won the NASCAR Busch Series Rookie of the Year in 1991 and won elevens pole positions the next year. Davis was hoping to move him and crew <b>chief</b> <b>Ray</b> Evernham to the Winston Cup Series, but they were lured away by Rick Hendrick. Davis still moved up to the Cup Series full-time in 1993 however, with driver Bobby Labonte, who finished 2nd to Gordon for Busch Series Rookie of the Year driving the No. 22 Maxwell House-sponsored Ford. The team switched to Pontiac the following season. After 1994, Labonte left to drive for Joe Gibbs Racing. MBNA replaced Maxwell House as the sponsor. Originally, Davis went with another rookie — Busch Series standout Randy LaJoie — to drive the car. Midway through the year, LaJoie was fired from the team and replaced by a series of rotating drivers including Wally Dallenbach Jr., who finished second at Watkins Glen. Finally, Ward Burton was hired to finish out the year. He scored the team's first win at North Carolina Motor Speedway in late-1995.|$|E

50|$|Transverse {{chromatic}} aberration {{is defined as}} the angle between the refracted <b>chief</b> <b>rays</b> for different wavelengths. <b>Chief</b> <b>rays,</b> in this case, refer to the ray of a point source that passes {{through the center of the}} pupil. Unlike LCA, TCA depends on object location in the visual field and pupil position within the eye. Object location determines the angle of incidence of the selected rays. By Snell's Law of Refraction, this incidence angle subsequently determines the amount of chromatic dispersion and thus location of the retinal images for different wavelengths of light. In transverse {{chromatic aberration}}, different wavelengths of light are displaced in non-corresponding retinal positions of each eye during binocular viewing. The interocular difference in TCA is generally attributed to the chromostereoptic effect. However, it should be noted that color induced depth effects due to TCA can only be perceived in images containing achromatic information and a single non-achromatic color. Additionally, the amplitude of the perceived depth in an image due to the stereoptic effect can be predicted from the amount of induced TCA. In other words, as the pupillary distance from the foveal achromatic axis is increased, perceived depth also increases.|$|R
50|$|A {{telecentric}} lens is {{a compound}} lens {{that has its}} entrance or exit pupil at infinity; in the prior case, this produces an orthographic view of the subject. This means that the <b>chief</b> <b>rays</b> (oblique rays that pass {{through the center of}} the aperture stop) are parallel to the optical axis in front of or behind the system, respectively. The simplest way to make a lens telecentric is to put the aperture stop at one of the lens's focal points.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the film}} or image sensor, {{all of the}} <b>chief</b> <b>rays</b> from these lenses hit [...] "straight on", or at zero angle of incidence. This {{property}} minimizes any angle-of-incidence dependence of the sensor, or of any beam-splitter prism assembly behind the lens, such as a color separation prism in a three-CCD camera. Many lenses that have been specially optimized for digital SLR cameras are nearly telecentric on the image side, to avoid the vignetting and color crosstalk that occur in color filter array-based digital image sensors with oblique incident rays. The Four Thirds System uses this approach.|$|R

5000|$|The {{principal}} ray or <b>chief</b> <b>ray</b> (sometimes {{known as the}} b ray) in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts {{at the edge of}} the object, and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. As such chief rays are equivalent to the rays in a pinhole camera. The distance between the <b>chief</b> <b>ray</b> and the optical axis at an image location defines the size of the image. The marginal and chief rays together define the Lagrange invariant, which characterizes the throughput or etendue of the optical system. Some authors define a [...] "{{principal ray}}" [...] for each object point. The principal ray starting at a point on the edge of the object may then be called the marginal principal ray.|$|E
