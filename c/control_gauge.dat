Traditional shape and <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> theories are of independent and the control systems are also separated, so {{it is difficult to}} ensure the quality of shape and gauge simultaneously. Based on the updated shape theory and a single parameter model of load distribution method, a combined shape and <b>gauge</b> <b>control</b> method was developed, which can adjust rolling regulations on-line according to the deviation of strip crown measured at the exit of the rolling mill.

40|$|Various {{methods of}} {{treating}} outer boundaries in numerical relativity are compared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using different boundary treatments are {{compared to a}} `reference' numerical solution obtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each boundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and extracted gravitational waves are compared {{to those of the}} reference solution, thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These tests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein equations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are reviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather different approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial compactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here combines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_ 0, and <b>control</b> <b>gauge</b> reflections.

40|$|Abstract A {{randomized}} {{experiment to}} test propane cloud seeding effectiveness {{was conducted on}} the Utah's Wasatch Plateau during the 2003 / 04 winter. Propane dispensers were operated at a previously used high altitude site well up the windward slope. The primary target precipitation gauge was 4. 3 km downwind, on top the plateau, where earlier plume tracking demonstrated routine targeting with seeding site winds from the southwest quadrant. Gauges were maintained upwind and downwind of the primary target, along the expected plume trajectory, but no more than 6. 5 km downwind of the propane dispensers because of targeting uncertainties. A well-correlated crosswind <b>control</b> <b>gauge</b> provided the covariate used in all statistical testing. The experiment was completely automated with 2 hr experimental periods declared when a specified icing rate was exceeded at the seeding site. Each period contained a pair of experimental units, one seeded and one placebo, with treatment by random decision. Three different statistical tests were applied. Statistically significant seeding-caused precipitation increases were strongly suggested by the exploratory experiment for the entire population of 98 experimental units, for a partition of 69 units with wind directions expected to result in successful targeting, and for the same wind directions but excluding highest natural snowfalls. Intriguing but inconclusive suggestions of possible positive seeding effects resulted when supercooled liquid water (icing) was detected, with warmer temperatures and for lighter wind speeds. Hypothetical estimates suggest about an 8 % precipitation increase had all experimental hours been seeded during th...|$|E
40|$|Compaction {{of upper}} soil layers by {{intensive}} sheep grazing has been connected with increased local flood risk in silvopastoral systems. A 12 â��week field {{study was conducted}} at the Henfaes Research Station near Bangor, Wales to compare canopy interception, soil water infiltration, and bulk density between a control pasture and two silvopastoral tree planting configurations: trees clumped in fenced-off ungrazed plots and trees planted evenly and grazed. The study's aim was to characterize the potential of these tree planting configurations to reduce local flood risk. Automated throughfall gauges were installed in each silvopastoral treatment along with a similarly designed <b>control</b> <b>gauge</b> located in the grazed control pasture. Soil water infiltration and bulk density were measured 20 times in a stratified random design for each treatment and control. Results showed that the mean soil infiltration capacity in clumped configuration was 504 % greater than the control pasture and 454 % greater than the even spaced configuration. Average canopy interception was higher in the clumped configuration (34 %) than in the even spaced configuration (28 %). Soil bulk density was lower in the clumped configuration (0. 87 â��Mg/m 3) than in the control pasture (0. 93 â��Mg/m 3) and even spaced configuration (1 â��Mg/m 3). Results suggest that silvopastoral systems {{are more likely to}} benefit from clumped and ungrazed tree configurations than from evenly-spaced and grazed tree configurations due to enhanced infiltration, lower soil compaction, and increased canopy interception. Our findings support the growing evidence base that fenced-off tree areas in silvopastoral settings can increase infiltration and thus reduce local flood risk. This article is protected by copyright.

40|$|The {{boundary}} between water and land {{is one of}} the most ancient boundaries used by society. Despite the long history of usage, society has found that the land/ sea zone is not a definite boundary. The influences on a tidal boundary are many, from gravitational and centrifugal forces acting on the earth to the many local variations that can shape a tide. From this active interface between water and land, a surveyor must determine a precise boundary. The aim of this project is to develop a system of procedures that will help to define this dynamic boundary. Developing a procedure manual will involve researching and evaluating the current guidelines, regulations and survey techniques used in determining tidal boundaries. This research will allow the development of a system that will guide a land surveyor when determining Mean High Water Mark boundaries along tidal land. These guidelines will be applied to a tidal boundary on the Central Coast of New South Wales, so as to validate the procedures. This project has found that using tidal information collected over a long period of time at a tide gauge would increase the accuracy of determining a tidal plane. By comparing the tidal data of a site that does not have long term tidal data with a <b>control</b> <b>gauge,</b> which does have long term tidal data, a reliable answer can be achieved. Therefore a procedure was developed to guide a surveyor through the determination of a Mean High Water Mark within New South Wales. The procedure manual will introduce a system in the techniques to follow in determining a water boundary. The user of the manual will be aware of the various issues faced in establishing a tidal boundary and this manual will allow them to make the informative decisions. It is recommended that this manual be incorporated into any survey company's quality control management system...|$|E
40|$|Given {{a record}} of daily {{rainfall}} over a network of gauges, this paper describes a method of linking the Gauge Wetness Ratio (GWR) {{on a given day}} to the joint distribution of the parameters of the anisotropic correlogram defining the spatial statistics of simulated radar-rainfall fields. We generate a large number of Gaussian random fields by sampling from the correlogram parameters conditioned on the GWR and then conditionally merge these fields to the gauge observations transformed into the Gaussian domain. Availability of such a tool allows better spatially distributed hydrological modelling, because good quality ensemble spatial information is required for such work, as it yields uncertainty of the fields so generated. To achieve these ends, correlograms of many Gaussianised daily accumulations of radar images weredeveloped using the Fast Fourier Transform to generate their sample power spectra. Empirical correlograms were fitted using a 2 D exponential distribution to yield the 3 key parameters of the correlogram: the range, the anisotropy ratio and the direction of the major axis. It was found that the range follows a Gamma distribution while the anisotropy parameters follow a Loglogistic one; a t 5 copula was adequate to capture the bivariate negative dependence structure between the range and ratio. The Radar Wetted Area Ratio (RWAR) drives the parameters of the correlogram, and its link with GWR is modelled by a transition probability matrix. We take each of the generated Gaussian random fields and conditionally merge it with Gaussianised rainfall values at the gauge locations using Ordinary Kriging. The method produces realistic simulated radar images, on a grid chosen to suit the data, which match the gauge observations at their locations. Ensemble simulations of 1000 samples were used to derive the median and the interquartile range of the fields; these were found to narrow near the <b>control</b> <b>gauge</b> locations, as expected, emphasising the value of high density gauge networks. Ongoing research is looking towards integration of the presented methodology with a stochastic daily rainfall generator for useful spatial rainfall simulation over catchments with gauged records...|$|E

With quality <b>control</b> <b>gauges</b> no quantitative statements can be made regarding the process stability. The components are either good or bad and no production trends can be determined. This leads to high scrap rates and in addition, the real performance of the produced components may differ from the target behaviour of the initially designed CAD model. As addressed within this contribution, with integrating optical 3 D measuring systems into the bending process, the actual state can be detected continuously. This enables to give feedback to the bending device for automatically readjust of bending parameters and thus prevent producing defective components. Moreover, the digitalisation of the actual contour allows a parametric correction of the designed CAD model, whereby the functional behaviour can be closer to reality within simulation models...|$|R
