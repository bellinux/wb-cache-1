25|$|MARS celebrates Armed Forces Day {{annually}} with {{a traditional}} military to amateur <b>crossband</b> communications test and a message-receiving test. These tests give amateur radio operators and shortwave listeners an opportunity to demonstrate their individual technical skills and receive recognition from the Secretary of Defense or the appropriate military radio station for their proven expertise. A QSL card is provided to those making contact {{with one of the}} military stations. Special commemorative certificates are awarded to anyone who receives and accurately copies the digital Armed Forces Day message from the Secretary of Defense.|$|E
25|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a pale tan to pinkish tan ground color that becomes darker towards the foreline, overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–18 (13.4) crossbands. Characteristically, both the ground color and <b>crossband</b> pattern are pale in A. c. contortrix. These crossbands are light tan to pinkish tan to pale brown in the center, but darker towards the edges. They are about 2 scales wide or less at the midline of the back, but expand to a width of 6–10 scales {{on the sides of the}} body. They do not extend down to the ventral scales. Often, the crossbands are divided at the midline and alternate on either side of the body, with some individuals even having more half bands than complete ones. A series of dark brown spots is also present on the flanks, next to the belly, and are largest and darkest in the spaces between the crossbands. The belly is the same color as the ground color, but may be a little whitish in part. At the base of the tail there are 1–3 (usually 2) brown crossbands followed by a gray area. In juveniles, the pattern on the tail is more distinct: 7–9 crossbands are visible, while the tip is yellow. On the head, the crown is usually unmarked, except for a pair of small dark spots, one near the midline of each parietal scale. A faint postocular stripe is also present; diffuse above and bordered below by a narrow brown edge.|$|E
50|$|California {{mountain}} kingsnakes have a banded {{pattern that}} consists of red, black, and white crossbands. The bands are always arranged {{in the same order}} with each red <b>crossband</b> being surrounded by two black crossbands, forming what is called a triad. Each triad is separated from the next triad by a white <b>crossband,</b> or in some examples by a cream or yellow <b>crossband.</b> Some individuals may have reduced amounts of red pigment, and rare individuals may have virtually no red bands at all. One population from Isla Todos Santos always lacks the red crossbands and is instead uniformly banded with black and white, similar in appearance to the related California kingsnake.|$|E
50|$|Dorsally, it {{is black}} or dark brown with white <b>crossbands.</b> Ventrally it is red with black <b>crossbands.</b> The upper labials are white or yellowish.|$|R
50|$|Dorsum black. Ventrum {{black with}} distant yellow <b>crossbands,</b> {{which are usually}} broken at the midline and alternating, but {{sometimes}} meet to form complete <b>crossbands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dorsally, S. pullatus {{is black}} with yellow spots which may form <b>crossbands.</b> The {{tip of the}} snout is yellow. The head shields may be mostly yellow, or mostly black, or <b>crossbanded</b> with a {{combination}} of yellow and black, but the sutures between the shields are always black. Ventrally, it is yellow with irregular black <b>crossbands.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crossband</b> Repeaters - Similar to an STSP, {{but usually}} {{based on a}} COTS Dualband Tranceiver with native {{cross-band}} repeat functionality. These {{have the advantage of}} being very portable - a <b>Crossband</b> Repeater based on a Dual-band Hand-held Transceiver can be transported, complete with antenna and mast, by 2 trampers. This would include an external 12V battery power supply capable of running the unit for a number of days. <b>Crossband</b> units are often inserted into areas of bush or scrub via Helicopter, with a Search Party (made up of tramping club members or LandSAR volunteers and/or Police staff) conducting the actual installation. Commercial type approved equipment is required for use on the commercial and government frequencies used for SAR operations.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 24-26 mm. The forewings are dull ash-grey with a dot at {{the margin}} and a curved <b>crossband.</b> There are ochreous yellow markings on the hindwings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crossband</b> (cross-band, cross band) {{operation}} {{is a method}} of telecommunication in which a radio station receives signals on one frequency and simultaneously transmits on another {{for the purpose of}} full duplex communication or signal relay.|$|E
50|$|Anteriorly, it has {{a pattern}} of dark <b>crossbands</b> on a light ground color. Posteriorly, the <b>crossbands</b> are {{replaced}} by three rows of alternating squarish blotches. The light spaces between the <b>crossbands</b> or blotches are wider than the dark markings. On the belly, the crescent-shaped markings on the ventrals tend to form two stripe-like series.|$|R
50|$|Dorsally Brachyophis revoili {{is either}} grayish white with {{irregular}} brown <b>crossbands,</b> or dark brown with irregular white <b>crossbands.</b> The ventral scales are broadly edged with brown in front.|$|R
50|$|The brown-banded water snake {{grows to}} a maximum total length (including tail) of 78 cm (31 inches). Dorsally, it is olive or gray-brown, with dark brown, black-edged <b>crossbands,</b> which narrow at the sides, and are usually {{confluent}} with the black <b>crossbands</b> of the belly. There is a large dark rhomboid on the nape. Ventrally, it is yellowish (in alcohol) with black <b>crossbands</b> or black spots.|$|R
50|$|The {{coloration}} of juveniles {{is completely}} {{different from that of}} adults. Juveniles have a black head, a yellow or white nuchal <b>crossband</b> (collar), and a red body. They are often mistaken for coral snakes and killed.|$|E
50|$|To {{provide a}} means of {{communicating}} in tunnels greater than one kilometre long, the company began developing the FRW-XB <b>Crossband</b> Repeater. The system is currently in the final phases of testing, and is scheduled for release in 2012.|$|E
50|$|The dorsum is brown, with {{a yellow}} streak {{on each side of}} the neck. A yellow <b>crossband</b> is at the base of the tail, but not on the sides of the tail. The ventrum is brown mixed with yellow.|$|E
50|$|Dorsally, M. tchernovi has {{a pattern}} of 58 (on average) black saddle-like <b>crossbands</b> which fail to reach the ventrals. The <b>crossbands</b> are usually {{narrower}} than the light interspaces. Ventrally, it is all black.|$|R
50|$|Coloration is variable. It usually {{consists}} of {{some combination of}} red and black rings or <b>crossbands.</b> In some individuals the light-colored <b>crossbands</b> are white instead of red on the anterior part of the body.|$|R
25|$|Several {{aberrant}} color {{patterns for}} A. c. contortrix, or populations that intergrade with it, {{have also been}} reported. In a specimen described by Livezey (1949) from Walker County, Texas, 11 of 17 <b>crossbands</b> were not joined middorsally, while on one side three of the <b>crossbands</b> were fused together longitudinally to form a continuous undulating band, surmounted above by a dark stripe that was 2–2.5 scales wide. In another specimen, from Lowndes County, Alabama, the first three <b>crossbands</b> were complete, followed by a dark stripe that ran down {{either side of the}} body, with points of pigment reaching up to the midline in six places but never getting there, after which the last four <b>crossbands</b> on the tail were also complete. A specimen found in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana by Ernest A. Liner, had a similar striped pattern, with only the first and last two <b>crossbands</b> being normal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wingspan}} of Epinotia tenerana ranges between 12-16 mm. [...] These small moths {{are very}} variable in color. The basic {{color of the}} forewings is usually brown, ferruginous or reddish brown, with a light <b>crossband</b> {{in the middle and}} a bright area at the apex.|$|E
50|$|Dorsally, it is reddish brown, either uniform or {{with some}} {{scattered}} small black spots. The {{top of the}} head and neck are black or dark brown. There may or may not be a yellowish <b>crossband</b> or collar across the temples and occiput. Ventrally, it is yellowish.|$|E
5000|$|Dorsally {{it is dark}} brown, with a whitish or {{yellowish}} <b>crossband</b> on the occiput, {{and similar}} body crossbands which bifurcate on the sides. Ventrally it is whitish. Adults are about [...]5 m (20 inches) in total length, which includes the tail of about 10 cm (4 inches).|$|E
40|$|An ultrastructural {{study of}} <b>crossbands</b> {{isolated}} from Caulobacter crescentus Sk 1 418 stalks permitted {{a view of}} these structures in a plane other than the perpendicular view normally presented in the electron microscope. These <b>crossbands</b> were composed of concentrically arranged, alternating light and dark bands when stained with phosphotungstic acid. Evidence supports the hypothesis that <b>crossbands</b> appear to compose a structural barrier extending {{the width of the}} stalk and may function to support unit membrane extending the length of the stalk...|$|R
50|$|The dorsum is brown, with indistinct brown <b>crossbands.</b> The {{head and}} {{anterior}} part of body are blackish-brown. There {{is a bright}} red or reddish-orange stripe on the upper lip that extends {{to the back of}} the head. When the lizard is threatened, or agitated by stress, the brown-colored lip turns to a bright white color, as does the dorso-nuchal crest. The throat of adult males is black. The tail is brown with dark <b>crossbands.</b> The venter is pale brown with darker <b>crossbands.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{body colour}} of S. nebulatus varies from grey to brown with dark brown {{irregular}} ring-like <b>crossbands.</b> These <b>crossbands</b> are edged by fine, irregular, beige spots. The belly ranges from white to beige, speckled with tiny dark brown points. The labial scale {{on the upper}} lip behind the eye is enlarged.|$|R
50|$|Hemidactylus kyaboboensis grow to {{a maximum}} snout-vent length of 80 mm and a maximum total length of 160 mm. The head is broad. The body has indistinct dark crossbands and more {{prominent}} whitish stripes and dots. There is a broad <b>crossband</b> on the neck that reaches the lower tip of the ear hole.|$|E
50|$|Dorsally, it has {{a pattern}} of 27-34 dark-brown, black, or bluish-black crossbands on the body and tail, which are narrowed and rounded on the sides. The first <b>crossband</b> is {{continuous}} with the dark color of the head. The dark crossbands are separated by broad, yellowish-white interspaces, which may be spotted with black. Ventrally, it is uniformly white.|$|E
50|$|The Baracoa skipper {{is smaller}} than the tawny-edged skipper. The male has a short and {{straight}} stigma. The female has a lost of orange on her forewing and has dark patches in the same locations as the male. The underside of the wings {{is very similar to}} the tawny-edged skipper's except the hindwing has a pale <b>crossband.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dorsally, it {{is light}} brown or yellowish, with 26-35 reddish-brown to black <b>crossbands.</b> Ventrally, it is yellow or white, with reddish-brown or black markings. In large adult individuals, the ground {{color on the}} lower sides is {{sometimes}} darker than the <b>crossbands,</b> producing an appearance of alternating blotches {{on the back and}} sides.|$|R
50|$|The dwarf sea snake is bluish or grayish blue dorsally, merging to {{yellowish}} ventrally, with 35-58 deep bluish-black <b>crossbands.</b> The <b>crossbands</b> are as wide or {{wider than}} the interspaces, well defined in younger specimens, but obscure in older specimens. The head is black, and in juveniles may also have a yellowish horseshoe-shaped mark.|$|R
5000|$|... young {{usually with}} light <b>crossbands</b> {{on the front}} half of the body.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 25 mm. The ground {{color of the}} forewing is grey dusted with white scales, with a bi-colored brown and white basal <b>crossband,</b> a small elongate discal spot and a blackish and white apical zigzag band. The hindwings are broad and white with greyish margins. Adults are on wing from June to October.|$|E
50|$|Lycodon striatus is {{dark brown}} or black above, with white {{transverse}} spots or crossbands, which are widely separated anteriorly. The sides are lineolated with white, {{with a black}} spot corresponding to each white <b>crossband.</b> The upper lip and ventrum are uniform white (coloration in alcohol). The longest adult known to George Albert Boulenger in 1893 was 43 cm in total length, with a tail 7.5 cm long.|$|E
50|$|Hemidactylus coalescens {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 78 - 174 mm. These medium sized species has a more {{elongated}} head and three enlarged internasal scales. Body shows a few dark crossbands with white spots and pale brown interspaces with white spots. The first <b>crossband</b> is restricted to the neck. On {{the sides of the}} brown head there is a fine narrow dark stripe reaching the eyes.|$|E
50|$|Dorsally, {{they have}} a pattern of dark brown or black <b>crossbands</b> on a {{yellowish}} brown or grayish background. The <b>crossbands</b> have irregular zig-zag edges, and may be V-shaped or M-shaped. Often a rust-colored vertebral stripe is present. Ventrally they are yellowish, uniform or marked with black. Melanism is common, and some individuals are very dark, almost solid black.|$|R
50|$|The {{color of}} this species is variable, and can be brown, gray, green, or {{yellowish}} above, often with red blotches on {{the middle of the}} back. Usually there are between 9 and 13 dark <b>crossbands</b> on the back, sides, and tail, with adjacent white spots. These <b>crossbands</b> can be pronounced or covered with reddish or yellowish color.|$|R
50|$|Dorsum dark violet. Venter dark violet with {{alternating}} large yellow spots or <b>crossbands.</b>|$|R
