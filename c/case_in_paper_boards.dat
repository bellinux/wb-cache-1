40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} {{migration}} investigations with different spiked and non-spiked <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> packaging {{materials in contact}} with foodstuffs and food simulants in the temperature range between - 18 °C and 40 °C were carried out. The aim was to deepen {{the understanding of the}} migration behaviour of target substances <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> fibres. Components and contaminants of <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> with different molecular weight and chemical structure were selected as target migrants. From the kinetic migration studies diffusion and partition coefficients were derived by using a software for modelling migration in multilayer materials. On the basis of these results {{for the first time a}} model for the migration from <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> into foods and simulants was developed by adapting the validated diffusion model for plastics. In contrast to the migration in plastic materials, where the migrants are solved and homogenously distributed in the polymer matrix, mass transfer <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> is a more complex phenomenon, because the migrants can be adsorbed on the cellulose surface with different strength. The most important finding of the study was that for a correct modelling of the experimental results <b>in</b> many <b>cases</b> <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> must be regarded as a 2 -layer system: the main mass of <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> (B 1) defines the core layer with high diffusion rates and a thin second layer (B 2) represents the surface region of the <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> with decreased diffusion rates due to the slow desorption...|$|R

They were placed with uninoculated mushrooms <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> <b>board</b> trays, {{which were then}} covered and sealed in a polyvinyl chloride stretch film to simulate prepackaged mushrooms available at retail stores. When incubated at 20 C, botulinum toxin could be detected as early as day 3, or 4, when the mushrooms still appear edible. Mushrooms inoculated in the stem with 1, 000 type A spores frequently became botulinogenic; higher spore levels were needed if gills or caps were inoculation sites. Type B spores were less apt to produce toxic mushrooms. Respiration of the fresh mushrooms used up O 2 more rapidly than could enter through the semipermeable wrapping film, so that the equilibrium O 2 concentration became low enough for growth of C. botulinum. Inoculated mushrooms did not become botulinogenic when held at 4 C...|$|R

40|$|<b>Paper</b> and <b>board</b> used as food contact {{materials}} (FCMs) are chemically complex matrices, {{partly due}} to the naturally occurring substances <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> and <b>board,</b> but also due to the chemical treatment of the paper used to make it suitable for food contact. In order to assure the safety of packaging materials, information on the exposure {{as well as on the}} toxicity of substances in the packaging must be obtained. This study describes a comprehensive method for the extraction and fractionation of substances present <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> FCMs for further investigation by in vitro testing and chemical analysis. The extraction efﬁciency and the fractionation process were validated by determining recoveries <b>in</b> extracts from <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> fortiﬁed with ﬁve surrogates of known concentration. The recoveries for the ﬁve surrogates were between 20 % and 104 % in the raw extract and between 21 % and 109 % after extraction and fractionation. The fractionation both reduces the number of compounds to be identiﬁed and works as a sample clean-up by reducing matrix effects. Raw extracts and fractions from two <b>paper</b> and <b>board</b> FCMs were furthermore tested in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) reporter gene assay. Both raw extracts and two of the fractions of the raw extracts gave a positive response in the AhR assay. The strategy of extraction followed by fractionation offers a powerful tool in order to make the workﬂow for screening FCMs for potentially adverse effects more efﬁcient...|$|R
