2500|$|In brief, {{situation}} awareness {{is viewed as}} [...] "a state of knowledge," [...] and situational assessment as [...] "the processes" [...] used to achieve that knowledge. [...] Endsley argues that [...] "it is important to distinguish the term {{situation awareness}}, as a state of knowledge, from the processes used to achieve that state. These processes, which may vary widely among individuals and contexts, will {{be referred to as}} situational assessment or the process of achieving, acquiring, or maintaining SA." [...] Note that SA is not only produced by the processes of situational assessment, it also drives those same processes in a recurrent fashion. For example, one's <b>current</b> <b>awareness</b> can determine what one pays attention to next and how one interprets the information perceived.|$|E

40|$|Introduction One of {{the goals}} of my work is to build Web spaces that promote {{collaborative}} activities among people who meet in online environments. In this endeavor, conventional concepts of awareness that stress presence and activity information are critical to informing the design of environments to support interactions among strangers. Knowing that people are around and what they are doing helps set the stage for social interaction. However, the task confronting strangers is to identify the "right" people to interact with. By this I mean, the one who has the skills, knowledge, interests and motivation to provide value to the other. Systems that are informed by <b>current</b> concepts of <b>awareness</b> do not help an individual address the selection question. In this position paper, I argue that the <b>current</b> concepts of <b>awareness</b> need to be extended to provide descriptive information about people {{that could be used for}} supporting the selection task.

An original questionnaire about the <b>current</b> status and <b>awareness</b> of psychological preparation for children in hospitals was distributed by mail to nurses’ working on Japanese pediatric wards in 2010. The same questionnaire, translated into German, was dis tributed to nurses working on German pediatric wards via the internet in 2010. A large majority of respondents strongly agreed that children {{have a right to}} informed consent. German nurses expressed a longer-term viewpoint on the effects of preparation than Japanese nurses. Japanese nurses recognized a greater need for i mprovement in their duties than German nurses. The results suggest that we should consider our own country’s nursing practices and need for improvement, but also learn from studies of other countries to address each culture and medical situation appropriately. </p...|$|R
