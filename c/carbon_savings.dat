By the end of 2015, it was hoped all British Airways flights from London City Airport will be fuelled by waste and rubbish discarded by London residents, leading to <b>carbon</b> <b>savings</b> equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road.

40|$|This {{briefing}} {{focuses on}} {{a particular type of}} rebound effect, which results from re-spending decisions as households realise savings due to reduced energy requirements. Measuring rebound from re-spending involves identifying changes in emissions-relevant energy use embodied in the supply chains of different goods/services that households may switch consumption between as their energy requirements are reduced In assessing re-spending options, we consider a <b>carbon</b> <b>saving</b> multiplier (CSM). This measures the change in embodied supply chain emissions per kilotonne (kt) directly saved by UK households. A key aim of policy will then be to limit the erosion of this multiplier value. Our central finding is that upward rebound effects in supply chains supporting re-spending decisions erode <b>carbon</b> <b>saving</b> multiplier effects of reduced energy spending. There may also be important effects in terms of increased emissions overseas (carbon leakage) because non-energy supply chains tend to be more international than energy supply chains...|$|R

[...] The authors conclude that intensification of cattle ranching and concentration on oil palm are required to achieve effective <b>carbon</b> <b>savings,</b> recommending closer collaboration between the biofuel and cattle-ranching sectors.|$|E

Two such controllers are considered in this paper and their performance tested through numerical simulations.

This article explains how the ownership and management (‘governance’) arrangements of MoPs can limit or inhibit energy upgrades. A building governance framework is adopted to examine the energy efficiency gap in MoPs through two lenses: an organisational lens that focuses on complex decision-making, and a ‘law and technology’ lens that explores the role of title deeds. Although the problem is particularly acute in England and Wales, where flats are sold on a leasehold basis, there is a broader issue whenever there is co-ownership of buildings containing apartments, and policy measures designed to improve energy efficiency in homes must {{pay particular attention to}} the complexity created by governance arrangements...|$|R
