25|$|The 1710 {{introduction}} of Statute of Anne in England (and later copyright laws in France) eased this situation. However, historian Eckhard Höffner claims that <b>copyright</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> their restrictions {{acted as a}} barrier to progress in those countries for over a century, since British publishers could print valuable knowledge in limited quantities for the sake of profit; while the German economy prospered in the same time frame since there were no restrictions.|$|E
25|$|During his American visit, Dickens spent a {{month in}} New York City, giving lectures, raising the {{question}} of international <b>copyright</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> the pirating of his work in America.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a cultural history of Australian <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> related artistic controversies. It examines {{a number of}} disputes over authorship, collaboration, and appropriation {{across a variety of}} cultural fields. It considers legal controversies over the plagiarism of texts, the defacing of paintings, the sampling of musical works, the ownership of plays, the co-operation between film-makers, the sharing of MP 3 files on the Internet, and the appropriation of Indigenous culture. Such narratives and stories relate to a broad range of works and subject matter that are protected by <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> This study offers an archive of oral histories and narratives of artistic creators about <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> It is founded upon interviews with creative artists and activists who have been involved in copyright litigation and policy disputes. This dialogical research {{provides a}}n insight into the material and social effects of <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> This thesis concludes that <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> is not just a ‘creature of statute’, {{but it is also a}} social and imaginative construct. In the lived experience of the law, questions of aesthetics and ethics are extremely important. Industry agreements are quite influential. Contracts play an important part in the operation of <b>copyright</b> <b>law.</b> The media profile of personalities involved in litigation and policy debates is pertinent. This thesis claims that <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> can be explained by a mix of social factors such as ethical standards, legal regulations, market forces, and computer code. It can also be understood in terms of the personal stories and narratives that people tell about litigation <b>and</b> <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> reform.

25|$|Due to redefined and reinterpreted <b>copyright</b> <b>laws,</b> <b>and</b> {{increased}} financial interests, {{some forms}} of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, {{in the area of}} sound collage (such as hip hop music), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the de minimis doctrine as a defense to copyright infringement, thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on fair use or de minimis protections, and toward licensing. Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are The Grey Album and Negativland's U2.|$|E

25|$|The Universal Exposition of 1878, {{which lasted}} from 1 May to 10 November 1878, was {{designed}} to advertise the recovery of France from the 1870 Franco-German War {{and the destruction of}} the period of the Paris Commune. It took place {{on both sides of the}} Seine, in the Champ de Mars and the heights of Trocadéro, where the first Palais du Trocadéro was built. Many of the buildings were made of new inexpensive material called staff, which was composed of jute fiber, plaster of Paris, and cement. The main exposition hall was an enormous rectangular structure, the Palace of Machines, where the Eiffel Tower is located today. Inside, Alexander Graham Bell displayed his new telephone and Thomas Edison presented his phonograph. The head of the newly finished Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World) was displayed before it was sent to New York City to be attached to the body. Important congresses and conferences took place on the margins of the exposition, including the first congress on intellectual property, led by Victor Hugo, whose proposals led eventually to the first <b>copyright</b> <b>laws,</b> <b>and</b> a conference on education for the blind, which led to the adoption of the Braille system of reading for the blind. The exposition attracted thirteen million visitors, and was a financial success.|$|E

Jim Guerinot, then manager of Nine Inch Nails, explained the unconventional release of the album as [...] " [...] a reaction to what doesn’t exist today. it’s more just like, 'Hey, in a vacuum I can do whatever I want to do.'" [...] The digital-release of the album reportedly required an extensive overhaul of the Nine Inch Nails website {{in order for the}} site to cope with the influx of traffic, online-payments, and customer service needs of releasing the album. These upgrades cost Reznor approximately $20,000 to implement. Despite these measures, upon the release of Ghosts the site crashed, and additional servers were necessary to handle the traffic.|$|E

2500|$|Warez is {{a common}} {{computing}} and broader cultural term referring to pirated software (i.e. illegally copied, often after deactivation of anti-piracy measures) that is distributed via the Internet. Warez is used most commonly as a noun, a plural form of ware (short for computer software), and {{is intended to be}} pronounced like the word , [...] The circumvention of copy protection (cracking) is an essential step in generating warez, and based on this common mechanism, the software-focused definition has been extended to include other copyright-protected materials, including movies and games. The global array of warez groups has been referred to as [...] "The Scene," [...] deriving from its earlier description as [...] "the warez scene." [...] Distribution and trade of copyrighted works without payment of fees or royalties generally violates national and international <b>copyright</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> agreements. The term warez covers supported as well as unsupported (abandonware) items, and legal prohibitions governing creation and distribution of warez cover both profit-driven and [...] "enthusiast" [...] generators and distributors of such items.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2009, the Associated Press counter-sued artist Shepard Fairey {{over his}} famous image of Barack Obama, saying the uncredited, uncompensated {{use of an}} AP photo {{violated}} <b>copyright</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> signaled a threat to journalism. Fairey had sued the AP the previous month over his artwork, titled [...] "Obama Hope" [...] and [...] "Obama Progress", arguing {{that he did not}} violate copyright law because he dramatically changed the image. The artwork, based on an April 2006 picture taken for the AP by Mannie Garcia, was a popular image during the 2008 presidential election and now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. According to the AP lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, Fairey knowingly [...] "misappropriated The AP's rights in that image". The suit asked the court to award AP profits made off the image and damages. Fairey said he looked forward to [...] "upholding the free expression rights at stake here" [...] and disproving the AP's accusations. In January 2011 this suit was settled with neither side declaring their position to be wrong but agreeing to share reproduction rights and profits from Fairey's work.|$|E

60|$|My ardor for Shakespeare {{must have}} been at its height when I was between sixteen and {{seventeen}} years old, for I fancy when I began to formulate my admiration, {{and to try to}} measure his greatness in phrases, I was less simply impassioned than at some earlier time. At any rate, I am sure that I did not proclaim his planetary importance in creation until I was at least nineteen. But even at an earlier age I no longer worshipped at a single shrine; there were many gods in the temple of my idolatry, and I bowed the knee to them all in a devotion which, if it was not of one quality, was certainly impartial. While I was reading, and thinking, and living Shakespeare with such an intensity that I do not see how there could have been room in my consciousness for anything else, there seem to have been half a dozen other divinities there, great and small, whom I have some present difficulty in distinguishing. I kept Irving, and Goldsmith, and Cervantes on their old altars, but I added new ones, and these I translated from the contemporary: literary world quite as often as from the past. I am rather glad that among them was the gentle and kindly Ik Marvel, whose 'Reveries of a Bachelor' and whose 'Dream Life' the young people of that day were reading with a tender rapture which would not be altogether surprising, I dare say, to the young people of this. The books have survived the span of immortality fixed by our amusing <b>copyright</b> <b>laws,</b> <b>and</b> seem now, when any pirate publisher may plunder their author, to have a new life before them. Perhaps this is ordered by Providence, that those who have no right to them may profit by them, in that divine contempt of such profit which Providence so often shows.|$|E

40|$|The main {{thesis of}} this article {{is that one of the}} Copyright Act’s {{principal}} aims is to promote the distribution of knowledge and information, and that any reform of <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> must maintain this goal and must in a negative sense, not restrict ‘freedom of communication’ more than is necessary to achieve that aim. Now more than ever, at a time of unprecendented developments in the market for information, <b>copyright</b> <b>law</b> presents both potential threats and potential benefits which must be carefully weighed up from the point of view of general welfare, and benefits for the individual author, user, and the user as author in her turn.
