500|$|The basic apothecaries' system {{consists}} of the units pound, ounce and scruple from the classical Roman weight system, together with the originally Greek drachm and a new subdivision of the scruple into either 20 ("barley") or 24 ("wheat") grains (...) [...] In some countries other units of the original system remained in use, for example in Spain the obolo and siliqua. In some cases the apothecaries' and civil weight systems had the same ounces ("an ounce is an ounce"), but the civil pound consisted of 16 ounces.

5000|$|<b>Carob</b> <b>trees</b> {{can survive}} long drought periods, but to grow fruit, they need 500 to 550 mm {{rainfall}} per year.

After irrigation with saline water in summer, <b>carob</b> <b>trees</b> could possibly also recover during rainfalls in winter.

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} one day, Rabbi Eliezer {{employed}} every imaginable {{argument for the}} proposition that {{a particular type of}} oven was not susceptible to ritual impurity, but the Sages did not accept his arguments. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, then let this <b>carob</b> <b>tree</b> prove it," [...] and the <b>carob</b> <b>tree</b> moved 100 cubits (and others say 400 cubits) out of its place. But the Sages said that no proof can be brought from a <b>carob</b> <b>tree.</b> Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let this stream of water prove it," [...] and the stream of water flowed backwards. But the Sages said that no proof can be brought from a stream of water. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let the walls of this house of study prove it," [...] and the walls leaned over as if to fall. But Rabbi Joshua rebuked the walls, telling them not to interfere with scholars engaged in a halachic dispute. In honor of Rabbi Joshua, the walls did not fall, but in honor of Rabbi Eliezer, the walls did not stand upright, either. Then Rabbi Eliezer told the Sages, [...] "If the halachah agrees with me, let Heaven prove it," [...] and a Heavenly Voice cried out: [...] "Why do you dispute with Rabbi Eliezer, for in all matters the halachah agrees with him!" [...] But Rabbi Joshua rose and exclaimed in the words of [...] "It is not in heaven." [...] Rabbi Jeremiah explained that God had given the Torah at Mount Sinai; Jews pay no attention to Heavenly Voices, for God wrote in [...] "After the majority must one incline." [...] Later, Rabbi Nathan met Elijah and asked him what God did when Rabbi Joshua rose in opposition to the Heavenly Voice. Elijah replied that God laughed with joy, saying, [...] "My children have defeated Me, My children have defeated Me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Talmud, Rebbi Shimon bar Yohai {{criticized the}} Roman {{government}} {{and was forced}} to go into hiding with his son Elazar for thirteen years. They sheltered in a cave (which local tradition places in Peki'in). Next to the mouth of the cave a <b>carob</b> <b>tree</b> sprang up and a spring of fresh water gushed forth. Provided against hunger and thirst they cast off their clothing except during prayers to keep them from wearing out, embedded themselves in the sand up to their necks, and studied the Torah all day long. He and his son left the cave when they received a Heavenly voice saying that the Roman Emperor had died and consequently all his decrees were abolished. According to tradition, they left their place of hiding on Lag BaOmer, and while when they were in hiding in the cave they studied Torah together in their cramped space accepting each other's presence and from that study there came forth the basis of the Zohar's mystical revelations which in a sense was regarded as a [...] "replacement" [...] for the Torah that was [...] "lost" [...] {{as a result of the}} death of the 24,000 disciples of Rabbi Akiva.
