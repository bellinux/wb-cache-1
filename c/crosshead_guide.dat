50|$|Meteor :A small {{vertical}} single-cylinder {{marine engine}} designed for 30-inch boats. -inch bore and stroke, table-style engine supported on 4 columns with trunk <b>crosshead</b> <b>guide</b> and piston valve. Listed through 1930s.|$|E
50|$|The bogie was {{connected}} with the chassis by pivot bearings, creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the centring springs of the mobile <b>crosshead</b> <b>guides,</b> counteracted any rolling of the bogie. The carrying axle was {{in the form of}} an Adams axle, and therefore had greater articulation than the bogie.|$|R
50|$|A {{piston rod}} is {{attached}} to the piston and links it to the crosshead, which is a large casting sliding in <b>crosshead</b> <b>guides</b> (UK: slidebar), allowing it only to move {{in the same direction as}} the piston travel. The crosshead also houses the gudgeon pin on which the small end of the connecting rod pivots. In this way, the transverse forces are applied only to the crosshead and its bearings, not to the piston itself.|$|R
50|$|The G 2/2+2/3 {{class had}} an {{external}} frame. The {{part of the}} chassis supporting {{the rear of the}} locomotive was pulled forward, and in the centre supported the rear bogie. The boiler was mounted forward of this point, and thus its rear was supported at fulcrum level. The locomotive had no pivot point, as a ball joint provided for steam injection. The bogie was connected with the chassis by pivot bearings, creating an articulated joint. In connection with this, there were two buffer springs, which, together with the centring springs of the mobile <b>crosshead</b> <b>guides,</b> counteracted any rolling of the bogie.|$|R
5000|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision grinding machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] In Great Britain the grinding process is now being used extensively on passenger car axles (particularly the journals) passenger railway carriage axle bearing units, <b>crosshead</b> <b>guide</b> bars, links, piston rods, chilled rolls, granite rolls, brass rolls, rubber rolls, paper rolls, crankshafts, camshafts, piston rings, planer knives, ball race rings, aluminium pistons, lenses, plate glass edges, glass tubes. Experiments are being carried out on the grinding of cylinders for locomotive and other engines. [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|E
40|$|LectureReciprocating {{compressors}} {{constructed to}} API- 618 standards find application in refineries, petrochemical plants, and pipelines around the world. These compressors are constructed with a force-fed lubricated crosshead that drives a double-acting piston via a piston rod. Looseness {{in the running}} gear (piston assembly, connecting rod assembly, and crosshead assembly) results in knocks (impulse events) that are usually detected at the <b>crosshead</b> <b>guide</b> with accelerometers and, in some cases, with proximity probes measuring the piston rod vibration at the pressure packing case. <b>Crosshead</b> <b>guide</b> accelerometers have proven successful in detecting and preventing catastrophic failure; however, the alarm set points for the vibration levels have been derived heuristically because no model exists that relates forces and impacts within the running gear to the vibration of the <b>crosshead</b> <b>guide.</b> This paper presents {{a model of the}} crosshead system that estimates the vibration response of the crosshead and <b>crosshead</b> <b>guide</b> in reaction to the forces and impulses in the running gear. The model incorporates the oil-film behavior including non-linear, position-dependent stiffness and damping. The paper also examines the system response in the time domain and the complex plane (eigenvalue migration). The numerical model results are validated by comparison with data acquired on operating machines in known conditions of distress. The results show good agreement between the model and crosshead and piston rod vibration data, both in the timing and amplitude of vibration. Using the results of the model and historical data collected from operating reciprocating compressors the paper concludes with guidelines for filtering of crosshead accelerometer signals and alarm thresholds...|$|E
40|$|Reciprocating {{compressors}} generate vibrations {{caused by}} pulsation-induced forces, mechanical (unbalanced) free forces and moments, <b>crosshead</b> <b>guide</b> forces and cylinder stretch forces. The {{traditional way of}} mitigating the vibration and cyclic stress levels to avoid fatigue failure of parts of the reciprocating compressor system (piping, separators, dampers, and compressor) is to stiffen the structures by e. g. the installation of additional pipe supports or steel structures. This {{is becoming more and}} more challenging because compressor speeds are increased, resulting in higher frequencies to be mitigated. Higher frequencies require stiffer structures which is often not possible because the available space and the absence of stiff structures in the vicinity is limited. This is especially the case for high elevated pipe systems, e. g. the pipe between the separator and suction damper. At mechanical resonance, the damping ratio determines the amplitude of the vibration: more damping decreases the vibration and cyclic stress amplitude leading to lower fatigue failures. Mitigating vibrations of rather low damped systems is possible by applying the concept of constrained layer damping (CLD). The technique has been used for decades in other industries such as the space and automotive industry, but is not often (if at all) used in reciprocating compressor systems up to now. Another way of mitigating vibrations is the application of a tuned mass damper (TMD) system which is often used in ships, building and bridges. The disadvantage of TMD systems is that fatigue failure of the TMD can occur if not damped sufficiently. This paper presents the investigative work performed on the potential of using CLD and a TMD for a U-pipe configuration and a pulsation damper. The application of CLD to increase the damping of the TMD to avoid fatigue failure of the TMD is also discussed into detail. Detailed, material characterization, FE calculations and design optimization has been performed, followed by experiments. By means of measurements it is shown that a large reduction in vibration and cyclic stress levels can be achieved. Reduction factors between 13 and 42 have been achieved with a TMD system and 20 for a CLD application. This paper explains the principle and optimized design of a CLD and damped TMD systems and will show the effectiveness for two different parts of existing reciprocating compressor systems...|$|E
50|$|This popularity, however, was short-lived. Significant {{maintenance}} difficulties appeared, {{particularly with}} uneven forces wear on the <b>crosshead</b> <b>guides.</b> The two cylinders {{were supposed to}} be proportioned so as to do equal work (with the low pressure being three times larger than the high); but since the steam passed between the low- and high-pressure cylinder is always expanded, even before cutoff, the force produced in the low-pressure cylinder varies differently from that in the high-pressure cylinder. The complex valve assembly and the starter valve also led to increased maintenance costs. The introduction of the superheater further increased efficiency and made it much easier to maintain.|$|R
50|$|Whether two or {{four-stroke}} in design, all oilfield engines {{share some}} common parts. A heavy cast iron bedplate secures {{the engine to}} its base, usually of concrete. The cylinder is attached to {{one end of the}} bedplate, the crankshaft bearings are at the other. The crankshaft rests in these bearings, with either one or two flywheels and a clutch fastened to it. A great number of oil field engines used a crosshead to connect the piston rod to the connecting rod; this slides {{back and forth between the}} bedplate and <b>crosshead</b> <b>guides.</b> Ignition in the combustion chamber is either by hot tube or spark plug.|$|R
50|$|Where {{high-speed}} {{steam engines}} were used, these small engines usually incorporated a single-piece cast iron bed. This could {{be supported by}} a single brickwork pier, without needed careful alignment by its masons. Some engine makers, such as Robey & Co. of Lincoln, developed a distinctive form of cantilevered cast iron bed for their large medium speed engines that formed both the <b>crosshead</b> trunk <b>guide</b> and the crank bearings, thus permitting a similar single plinth foundation.|$|R
50|$|It was {{originally}} driven by 1000 hp twin tandem compound engine by Goodfellow and Matthews built in 1868. It had a 30-foot flywheel with 27 ropes, which operated at 55rpm. It had two 22"HP and two 42"LP cylinders with a 6-foot stroke. The air pumps were driven by lever from <b>crossheads</b> with <b>guides</b> between HP and LP cylinders. This had Corliss valves on all cylinders and was steamed at 80psi. The HP cylinders {{were to the}} front.|$|R
5000|$|In a steam locomotive, {{the crank}} pins are usually mounted {{directly}} {{on one or}} more pairs of driving wheels, and the axle of these wheels serves as the crankshaft. The connecting rods (also called the main rods in US practice), run between the crank pins and crossheads, where they connect to the piston rods. <b>Crossheads</b> or trunk <b>guides</b> are also used on large diesel engines manufactured for marine service. (The similar rods between driving wheels are called side rods in US practice and coupling rods in British practice.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Salamanca {{was also}} the first rack and pinion locomotive, using John Blenkinsop's {{patented}} design for rack propulsion. A single rack ran outside the narrow gauge tracks and was engaged by a large cog wheel {{on the left side of}} the locomotive. The cog wheel was driven by twin cylinders embedded into the top of the centre-flue boiler. The class was described as having two 8"×20" [...] cylinders, driving the wheels through cranks. The piston <b>crossheads</b> slid in <b>guides,</b> rather than being controlled by a parallel motion linkage like the majority of early locomotives. The engines saw up to twenty years of service.|$|R
50|$|By 1925 the {{vertical}} {{arrangement of the}} engine had been taken advantage of to improve steam porting and access for maintenance. The Super-Sentinel engine used two camshafts: inlet and exhaust, placed near the crankshaft in the crankcase and operating the poppet valves through long pushrods. In the original waggon engine, all four valves were mounted {{at the far end of}} the cylinder from the crankshaft, requiring long narrow ports to the other end of the cylinder. With the locomotives the easily accessed vertical engine allowed a pair of these valves to be moved to the lower end of the cylinder, allowing for a short, efficient port with less 'dead space'. The crankcase of the engine, together with the <b>crosshead</b> trunk <b>guide,</b> was enclosed and provided with oil splash lubrication. A small plenum was left exposed between the cylinder's piston rod stuffing box and another gland seal into the crankcase. This allowed any steam that did leak past the seals to be vented to the atmosphere, rather than condensing within the crankcase.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{locomotives}} of {{this pattern}} were also {{made by the}} Royal Iron Foundry in Berlin. Though they worked well when tested at the Foundry, neither {{could be made to}} work properly at their intended workplaces, and both ended their days as stationary engines. The Murray/Blenkinsop locomotives had the first double-acting cylinders and, unlike the Trevithick pattern, no flywheel. The cylinders drove a geared wheel which engaged with the rack beside one rail. One of the geared locomotives was described as having two 8"x20" [...] cylinders, driving the wheels through cranks. The piston <b>crossheads</b> worked in <b>guides,</b> rather than being controlled by parallel motion like the majority of early locomotives. Between them, the engines saw more than twenty years of service.|$|R
