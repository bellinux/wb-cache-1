5|$|A {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the War of the Magi. This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again. The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen years before {{the events of the}} game begin, the barrier between the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E
5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in what has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington, or by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.|$|E

25|$|However, Bengal and Punjab {{remained}} hotbeds of anti colonial activities. Militancy in Bengal, increasingly {{closely linked}} with the unrest in Punjab, was significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration. Also, {{from the beginning of}} the war, an expatriate Indian population, notably from the United States, Canada, and Germany, headed by the Berlin Committee and the Ghadar Party, attempted to trigger insurrections in India along the lines of the 1857 uprising with Irish Republican, German and Turkish help in a massive conspiracy that has since <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the Hindu–German Mutiny This conspiracy also attempted to rally Afghanistan against British India.|$|E

25|$|Soviet partisans {{had very}} little support from the Baltic countries' populations.

The anti-Soviet resistance movements in the Baltic states, known as the Latvian or Lithuanian partisans, (established just before the Soviet re-occupation in 1944), and local self-defence units often came into conflict with Soviet partisan groups. In Estonia and Latvia, almost all the Soviet partisan units, dropped by air, were either destroyed by the German forces or the local self-defense units.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the only}} one of Christie's novels not to be set in the 20th century, and – unusually for her – also {{features}} no European characters. Instead, the novel is set in Thebes in 2000 BC, a setting for which Christie gained an appreciation of while working with her archaeologist husband, Sir Max Mallowan in the Middle East. The novel is notable for its very high number of deaths and is comparable to And Then There Were None from this standpoint. It is also the first full-length novel combining historical fiction and the whodunit/detective story, a genre which would later <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the historical whodunit.|$|E
25|$|The {{first study}} {{of what would}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> aDNA was {{conducted}} in 1984, when Russ Higuchi and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley reported that traces of DNA from a museum specimen of the Quagga not only remained in the specimen over 150 years {{after the death of}} the individual, but could be extracted and sequenced. Over the next two years, through investigations into natural and artificially mummified specimens, Svante Pääbo confirmed that this phenomenon was not limited to relatively recent museum specimens but could apparently be replicated in a range of mummified human samples that dated as far back as several thousand years (Pääbo 1985a; Pääbo 1985b; Pääbo 1986).|$|E

25|$|Fermi–Dirac (F–D) {{statistics}} {{apply to}} identical particles with half-integer spin {{in a system}} with thermodynamic equilibrium. Additionally, the particles in this system are assumed to have negligible mutual interaction. That allows the many-particle system to be {{described in terms of}} single-particle energy states. The result is the F–D distribution of particles over these states which includes the condition that no two particles can occupy the same state; this has a considerable effect on the properties of the system. Since F–D statistics apply to particles with half-integer spin, these particles have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> fermions. It is most commonly applied to electrons, which are fermions with spin1/2. Fermi–Dirac statistics {{are a part of the}} more general field of statistical mechanics and use the principles of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} {{the independence of}} his realm, Alfonso IX applied customary Galician-Leonese inheritance to nominate Aldonza as future Queen of Galicia, and Sancha as Queen of León, enlisting their uncle Afonso II of Portugal to support their succession. Alfonso died in 1230 in Sarria, while on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela to thank the apostle for his help in the conquest of Extremadura, and his body was taken there for burial. Most of the Leonese nobility cleaved to Ferdinand, who also gained {{the support of the}} new Portuguese king, Sancho II. After clashes in León and Galicia, Alfonso IX's two former wives, Berengaria and Theresa, reached an agreement whereby Theresa induced Aldonza and Sancha to abandon their regal claims in exchange for an annuity. As a result, Ferdinand III became successor to Alfonso's kingdoms of León and Galicia, bringing about a permanent union into what would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the Crown of Castile, wherein the kingdoms continued as administrative entities under the unified rule of a single monarch.|$|E
25|$|Carnegie {{spent his}} last {{years as a}} philanthropist. From 1901 forward, public {{attention}} was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited {{way in which he}} devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in Triumphant Democracy (1886) and Gospel of Wealth (1889). Carnegie bought Skibo Castle in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in his New York mansion located at 2 East 91st Street at Fifth Avenue. The building was built in 1903 and he lived there until his death in 1919. His wife Louise also lived there until her death in 1946. The building is now the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution. The surrounding neighborhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Carnegie Hill. The mansion was named a National Historic Landmark in 1966. He then devoted his life to providing the capital for purposes of public interest and social and educational advancement.|$|E

25|$|Interested in the {{definition}} of number, Russell studied the work of George Boole, Georg Cantor, and Augustus De Morgan. Materials in the Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster University include notes of his reading in algebraic logic by Charles Sanders Peirce and Ernst Schröder. In 1900 he attended the first International Congress of Philosophy in Paris, where he became familiar with the work of the Italian mathematician, Giuseppe Peano. He mastered Peano's new symbolism and his set of axioms for arithmetic. Peano defined logically all of the terms of these axioms with the exception of 0, number, successor, and the singular term, the, which were the primitives of his system. Russell took it upon himself to find logical definitions for each of these. Between 1897 and 1903 he published several articles applying Peano's notation to the classical Boole-Schröder algebra of relations, among them On the Notion of Order, Sur la logique des relations avec les applications à la théorie des séries, and On Cardinal Numbers. He became convinced that the foundations of mathematics could be derived within what has since <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> higher-order logic which in turn he believed to include some form of unrestricted comprehension axiom.|$|E
25|$|In exile, his {{political}} views radicalized {{and he became}} involved with the preparations for an insurrection. In 1794 he {{took part in the}} Kościuszko Uprising, co-authoring its Uprising Act (24 March 1794) and Połaniec Manifesto (7 May 1794), heading the Supreme National Council's Treasury Department, and backing the Uprising's left wing of Polish Jacobins. After the suppression of the Uprising in the same year, Kołłątaj was imprisoned by the Austrians until 1802. In 1805, with Tadeusz Czacki, he organized the Krzemieniec Lyceum in Wołyń (Volhynia). In 1807, after the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw, he was at first involved in its government, but soon excluded from it through the intrigues of {{his political}} opponents, and soon afterwards, interned and imprisoned by Russian authorities until 1808. When he was released, he found himself barred from public offices; despite that he sought to present a program for rebuilding and developing Poland (Remarks on the Present Position of That Part of the Polish Lands that, since the Treaty of Tilsit, Have <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Called</b> the Duchy of Warsaw, 1809). In 1809 he {{became a member of the}} Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning. In the years 1809-1810 he became once again involved with the Kraków Academy, reforming it from its temporarily Germanized form.|$|E
