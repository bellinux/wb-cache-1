The national horse and <b>cattle</b> <b>show</b> at Lahore is the biggest festival where sports, exhibitions, and livestock competitions are held. It not only encourages and patronises agricultural products and livestock through the exhibitions of agricultural products and cattle but is also a colourful documentary on the rich cultural heritage of the province with its strong rural roots.|$|E

At that time, no connection had been made with the B railroad {{to the south and}} no station had been built in Frederick but a local citizen wished the road success because it had been met with great opposition.|$|E

500|$|James Stillman owned a {{small farm}} on Pleasantville Road {{since at least}} 1886. It was known as Briarcliff Farm after John David Ogilby's estate, Brier Cliff (itself named after Ogilby's family home in Ireland). In 1887 Stillman had a display at the Great Dairy and <b>Cattle</b> <b>Show</b> in New York City's Madison Square Garden, where he {{demonstrated}} setting milk, churning cream and making butter. In 1890, Walter Law began purchasing property in the present-day village of Briarcliff Manor {{as part of his}} desire for rest and recreation. That year, Law paid James Stillman $35,000 ($ in [...] ) for his [...] farm and renamed it Briarcliff Farms. In 1893, The New York Times reported that the 14th Duke of Veragua (a livestock farmer) and a large party visited the farm on the afternoon of June 16; at that time, the farm had about 330 cattle and 100 sheep. The party went from New York to Scarborough, proceeding by carriage to Briarcliff, and visited the farm's poultry yard, hennery and stables. After observing the farm's heifers and stallions, they went to the creamery to taste Briarcliff butter. The guests went to Law's Yonkers home, Hillcrest, for dinner before returning to New York. After the visit, the duke had said [...] "Well, this is a perfect place. I am delighted with what I have seen." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} reports, Nguni type <b>cattle</b> have <b>shown</b> {{to have a}} lower glycolytic potential {{with less}} glycogen measured in muscles 1 h post-mortem. With the release of catecholamines in the immediate pre-slaughter period, there is potential for depletion of muscle glycogen, {{because of the fact}} that epinephrine activates muscle adenylate cyclase and thereby stimulates glycogen breakdown. Epinephrine and nor-epinephrine are secreted as a result of any “fight or flight” situation. Tyrosine is a conditionally non-essential large neutral amino acid and the precursor of the neurotransmitters dopamine, nor-epinephrine and epinephrine. Ante-mortem stress experienced by an animal may be influenced by amino acids that provide substrates for neurotransmitter synthesis. The Nguni type <b>cattle</b> <b>showed</b> 55. 8 % and 55. 1 % greater urinary nor-epinephrine values than for the Brahman- and Simmental type cattle respectively. The Nguni type <b>cattle</b> <b>showed</b> 35. 6 % and 43. 8 % greater urinary epinephrine values than the Brahman- and Simmental type cattle respectively. The higher urinary nor-epinephrine and epinephrine levels measured in Nguni type cattle could either be explained by a greater neuronal out flux immediately prior to slaughter or a slower re-uptake...|$|R

30|$|The small steers {{to males}} ratio in <b>cattle</b> <b>shows</b> that {{castration}} {{is not a}} common practice in this pastoral subsistence production. The practice is probably used as a breeding rather than a marketing tool since the greater number of the entire males enhances the reproductive potential of the herd. The high proportion of young stock in all species suggests a high birth rate or low pre-weaning mortality.|$|R
