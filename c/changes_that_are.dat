5|$|The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time {{of changes}} in Ancient Egyptian {{religion}} and in the ideology of kingship, <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> first demonstrable under Unas. A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing Horus names of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty points to a marked decline of {{the cult of the}} king during Unas' time on the throne. This continued under Unas' successor Teti, for whom we know only two seals bearing his Horus name. This trend reflects the lessening of the king's power in conjunction with the growth of the administration and priesthood.|$|E

25|$|Parental involvement, as {{discussed}} in the benefits section {{can also be a}} drawback, if parents and community members are not willing to express their opinions {{on the quality of the}} education system, the system may not see a need for improvement, and not change to meet student’s needs. Parents may also become too involved, requesting too many changes, so that important improvements get lost with other <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> being suggested. Instructors will also find that their work is increased; they must work to first understand the outcome, then build a curriculum around each outcome they are required to meet. Instructors have found that implementing multiple outcomes is difficult to do equally, especially in primary school. Instructors will also find their work load increased if they chose to use an assessment method that evaluates students holistically.|$|E
25|$|This stage {{began its}} {{evolution}} as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European {{that had lost}} its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels {{as well as one}} or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, {{but it would have been}} strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} year of the war, the Confederate forces in the West went through a series of command <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> often confusing, and left {{responsibility}} for particular actions hard to pin down. Although New Madrid was in Missouri, it was in a pro-Southern part of the state, and therefore fell within the purview of Confederate Department No. 2. In command of the department was Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk. The region of the bend was brought to official notice by one of Polk's subordinates, Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow. Neither Pillow nor Polk was actively involved in developing the defenses at the bend; the latter assigned an army engineer, Captain Asa B. Gray, to the task, but he was not given adequate resources. On September 15, General Albert Sidney Johnston superseded Polk in command of Department No. 2, with Polk remaining in a subordinate position. Like his predecessor, Johnston took no active interest in Island No. 10. In early February, just in time for the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson, General P. G. T. Beauregard was sent to the West to command the Army of the Mississippi, and became in effect Johnston's second in command. He recognized the importance of Island No. 10, and issued the orders to abandon Columbus and move its garrison there. His health failed him at this time, so he could not take personal charge. When he recovered, he and General Johnston were preoccupied with preparations for the forthcoming Battle of Shiloh. Transferred from Columbus to Island No. 10 was Major General John P. McCown, who thereby became local commander. He remained in charge until after New Madrid was taken by the Union Army of the Mississippi; on March 31, 1862, he was replaced by Brig. Gen. William W. Mackall.|$|E
500|$|Brain {{injuries}} can {{be classified}} into mild, moderate, and severe categories. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), {{the most commonly used}} system for classifying TBI severity, grades a person's level of consciousness on a scale of 3–15 based on verbal, motor, and eye-opening reactions to stimuli. In general, it is agreed that a TBI with a GCS of 13 or above is mild, 9–12 is moderate, and 8 or below is severe. Similar systems exist for young children. However, the GCS grading system has limited ability to predict outcomes. [...] Because of this, other classification systems such as the one shown in the table are also used to help determine severity. [...] A current model developed by the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs uses all three criteria of GCS after resuscitation, duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and loss of consciousness (LOC). It also has been proposed to use <b>changes</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> visible on neuroimaging, such as swelling, focal lesions, or diffuse injury as method of classification. Grading scales also exist to classify the severity of mild TBI, commonly called concussion; these use duration of LOC, PTA, and other concussion symptoms.|$|E

I go from playing with a synthesizer, and then I morph that into playing the same piece of music with the orchestra, but in an adjusted key." [...] Russo also looked to a variety of instruments and sounds for the show, such as orchestral and quartet effects that he called [...] "left of center"; violin bows on bed springs and other metal objects; a solo harpsichord for the finale's opening sequence; and an electronic version of Maurice Ravel's [...] "Boléro" [...] for [...] "Chapter 7" [...] that was merged with a classical recording of the piece to create what Russo referred to as [...] "Fauxlero".|$|E
