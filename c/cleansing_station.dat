500|$|When {{the railway}} line was built between Brighton and Lewes in 1846, the {{northern}} slope of Round Hill was effectively severed {{from the rest}} of the area. [...] It developed separately as an industrial area and the site of many Brighton Corporation utilities: the Brighton Dust Destructor, an incinerator for rubbish, was built in 1866, followed by another incinerator in 1898; the Municipal Abattoir was established in 1894; and in the early 20th century a meat market and a municipal <b>cleansing</b> <b>station</b> for the fumigation and delousing of people and property were built nearby. Although they occupy land that was part of the hill, these buildings were considered to be part of neighbouring Hollingdean. Residents of Round Hill, especially those who owned laundries, often complained about the smell and soot from the incinerators.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{before the}} advent of modern plumbing, there existed a number of <b>cleansing</b> <b>stations</b> for <b>cleansing</b> one's clothes and body. <b>Cleansing</b> <b>stations</b> were {{separated}} by gender, and combined the function of cleaning clothes with cleaning of the body. The closest modern equivalent would be a combination laundromat plus locker room with showers.|$|R
50|$|During the nineteenth, {{and early}} part of the twentieth century, the {{increase}} of urbanization caused an increase in the spread of disease. Poor hygiene was determined to be the cause. Since many families did not have practical means to clean themselves or their clothes, public <b>cleansing</b> <b>stations</b> were established for their use.|$|R
50|$|Tying {{the game}} {{together}} is the game's infection meter. When the meter reaches 100%, Jenosa's health deteriorates rapidly. When her health reaches zero, she becomes a Scurge host. There are various <b>cleansing</b> <b>stations</b> (which also {{act as the}} game's save points) scattered about the game world that heal Jenosa. The result quickens {{the pace of the}} game.|$|R
50|$|Certain fish {{perform the}} task of {{cleaning}} other fish, by removing ectoparasites, cleaning wounded flesh, and getting rid of dead flesh. Even predatory fish rely on cleansing symbionts, and adopt a placid state while they are cleansed. The fish that do the cleansing are often concentrated around specific sites where the other fish come to be cleansed these are known as <b>cleansing</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{increasingly}} unstable Hunter {{heads to}} {{the centre of the}} Metro, to Polis, to gather an armed force to <b>cleanse</b> the infected <b>stations.</b> He is accompanied by Homer, while Sasha leaves with Leonid who claims to know a cure for the plague. The detour was unnecessary and Leonid admits that he did it in order {{to spend some time with}} Sasha. He tells her the disease had broken out before in a different section of the Metro and it was found that exposure to radiation could cure it. He agrees to accompany her in an effort to prevent Hunter from killing everyone there.|$|R
