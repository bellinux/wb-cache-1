25|$|Judge Pine {{began the}} hearing on schedule. The steel {{companies}} {{focused on the}} issue of equitable relief. The employers' attorneys pointed out that they could not make a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> if the courts found the seizure illegal. Additionally, the Federal Tort Claims Act required the government to give its consent to be sued for relief, and this the government had not done. Judge Pine pressed the steel company attorneys to address the constitutional issue, which the government had strongly emphasized in its briefs. Most of the company attorneys seemed shocked by Pine's request, and were unable to address the issue. But Charles Tuttle, counsel for Armco Steel, squarely argued the issue. In his counter-argument the following day, Baldridge claimed that the courts had no authority to enjoin the President of the United States and then argued that the court should ignore the constitutional issue if it could decide the case on grounds of equity. Baldridge relied heavily on Ex parte Merryman 17 F. Cas. 144 (1861), Mississippi v. Johnson 71 U.S. 475 (1866), In re Debs 158 U.S. 564 (1895) and United States v. Pewee Coal Co. 341 U.S. 114 (1951) as justification for the government's claims of unfettered executive power.|$|E

Although Morrison suggested that an individual aggrieved by such a law could bring a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he argued that such a claim {{is unlikely to be}} successful because the law will likely be upheld when reviewed under the rational basis test.

First, the tenet that a court must accept as true {{all of the}} allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. ... Second, only a complaint that states a plausible <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> survives a motion to dismiss. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. ... In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they {{are no more than}} conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Our decision in Twombly illustrates the two-pronged approach.|$|E

6000|$|And {{why should}} it not be just the same in a benefit club? There the good member is NOT the man who pays his money merely to have a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> when he himself is sick, and yet grudges every farthing that goes to help other members. That man {{is not a good}} member. He has come into the club merely to take care of himself, and not to bear others' burdens. He may obey the letter of the club-rules by paying in his {{subscriptions}} and by granting relief to sick members, but he does not obey the spirit of them. If he did, he would be glad to bear his sick neighbour's burden with so little trouble to himself. He would, therefore, grant club relief willingly and cheerfully when it was wanted,--ay, he would thank God that he had an opportunity of helping his neighbours. He would feel that {{all the members of the}} society were his brothers in a double sense; first, because they had joined with him to help and support each other in the society; and, next, that they were his brothers in Christ, who had been baptised into the same Church of God with himself. And he would, therefore, delight in supporting them in their sickness, and honouring them when they died, and in helping their widows and orphans in their affliction; in short, in bearing his neighbour's burdens, and so fulfilling the law of Christ. And do you not see, that if any of you subscribe to this benefit society in such a spirit as this, that they are the men to give an answer to the question I asked at first, [...] "Why are you all here at church to- day?" [...] They come here for the same reason that you all ought to come, to thank God for having kept them well, and out of the want of relief for the past year, and to thank Him, too, for having enabled them to bear their sick neighbours' burdens. And they come, also, to pray to God to keep them well and strong for the year to come, and to raise up those members who are in sickness and distress, that they may all worship God here together another year, as a company of faithful friends, helping each other on through this life, and all on the way to the same heavenly home, where there will be no more poverty, nor sorrow, nor sickness, nor death, and God shall wipe away tears from all widows and orphans' eyes.|$|E

50|$|The Court {{observed}} that the defendants had been adjudged to be antitrust violators. The Court said that while “we do not recognize unlimited authority in the Government to attack a patent by basing an antitrust claim on the simple assertion that the patent is invalid,” whether the patents are valid or invalid could significantly affect what remedies were appropriate. Therefore, when the Government presents substantial <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief,</b> a court should entertain the Government’s validity challenge.|$|R

60|$|The {{subject of}} the Poor Laws was never {{out of my sight}} whilst I was in Ireland; it seems to me next to {{impossible}} to introduce a general system of such laws, principally for two reasons: the vast numbers that would have equal <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief,</b> and the non-existence of a class capable of looking with effect to their administration. Much is done at present in many places (Derry, for example) by voluntary contributions; but the narrow-minded escape from the burthen, which falls unreasonably upon the charitable; so that assessments in the best-disposed places are to be wished for, could they be effected without producing a greater evil.|$|R

50|$|Under the Second Restatement of Contracts, a {{party may}} assert a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> from {{unilateral}} mistake regarding the terms or conditions {{of a contract}} or a liquidated damages clause.

The law sees fit to put few limits on the judge’s power, and properly so. The few limits are in fact quite narrow in application, and even narrower if properly understood. The Steel Co. -Ruhrgas rule generally requires a federal court to decide Article III justiciability and subject-matter jurisdiction before ruling on the merits.

The Supreme Court argued that [...] "because relief under Padilla may only be sought by defendants pursuant to Rule 30 motions, such <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>relief</b> should be directed as a direct view, thus even a new rule can be applied retroactively. State law, in this instance Rule 30, allowed for Massachusetts to apply its own interpretation of previous Supreme Court precedents.
