5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduation}} {{the four}} go their separate ways, but they remain in contact through letters and regular visits, although their letters are {{read by the}} Securitate. They take menial jobs: Kurt works in a slaughterhouse as a supervisor, for instance; and the narrator translates German manuals in a factory. A fifth member, Tereza, befriends the narrator even as it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is acting partly on Pjele's orders.|$|E
5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many employees {{have a deep}} fear of her. She seems cold and calculating, {{but it is also}} <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to a lesser degree, Rose.|$|E
25|$|People are {{attracted}} by the stories, by the pace and, {{in the case of}} Stephenie Meyer, it's very <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> writing to a whole generation of girls and opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books. It's exciting and it's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because it's not overtly sexual.|$|R
50|$|There is {{some sort}} of {{reconciliation}} between these two extremes, however, and it is found in what is coined as the “Eternal Woman” (eien josei), a woman to be worshiped. Though it’s not expressed clearly who exactly this Eternal Woman is, nor what characterizes her, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she’s</b> someone who would not only inspire, but command genuflection of the man who worships her.|$|R
5000|$|In season one, {{the episode}} [...] "Rudy and the Snow Queen" [...] marks the {{beginning}} of the softening of Whitley's image as a spoiled troublemaker at Hillman. Denise's kid sister Rudy (Keshia Knight-Pulliam) visits Hillman and becomes smitten with Whitley. Flattered at the attention, Whitley befriends the little girl, but when it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> trumping Denise as a role model, Whitley has a change of heart, steps back and gently persuades Rudy to return to her sister.|$|R
5|$|Germanicus {{had died}} in AD 19, in {{somewhat}} suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved {{with a group of}} senators who opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> believed that he was {{responsible for the death of}} Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) felt for her, since Agrippina's ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret. To Sejanus, Agrippina's sons Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula were a threat to his power.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rubeus Hagrid {{has not yet}} {{returned}} from the secret mission {{given to him by}} Dumbledore {{at the end of the}} previous book, and is absent for the first part of the school year. Upon his return, Harry, Ron, and Hermione learn that his mission, which was mostly unsuccessful, was to seek out the last giants to stop them from joining Lord Voldemort. Professor Umbridge has been steadily amassing more and more power and influence at the school, and as she begins regularly inspecting Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures lessons, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> intends to get rid of him.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was one of the women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying {{to get in touch with}} her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{it is not}} all," [...] he continued. [...] "As to the rest, {{she told}} me nothing definite. It is quite <b>clear,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is very anxious to keep away from you." ...|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, Or {{begins a}} burgeoning romance with her {{neighbour}} and childhood friend, Ido. After they sleep together, Ido's mother confronts Ruthie {{and makes it}} <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> though <b>she</b> likes Or she does not approve of their relationship.|$|R
50|$|Janice and {{her family}} arrive in Benidorm in season 1. In the first episode it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> the {{peacemaker}} of the family, often having to resolve {{and put an end}} to arguments between Mick, her children and her mother Madge. At the end of the first episode, it is revealed that her teenage daughter Telle is pregnant, which was previously unknown by Janice and Mick. At the end of the first series, undercover investigators approach Janice and reveal that Mick has been falsely claiming disability benefits and will be prosecuted on their return to the UK.|$|R
5|$|In need of {{something}} silvera {{weakness of the}} djinnDean breaks into his mother's house to steal a sterling silver knife. However, he is caught by Sam, who thinks he's stealing from their mother. While Dean at first pretends that he needs the knife to repay a gambling debt, he eventually reveals the truth. Although Sam does not believe him, he accompanies his brother to the djinn's warehouse lair. There Dean discovers that the young woman he has been having visions of {{is a victim of}} the djinn. It's <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is alive but in an hallucinatory statea way for the djinn to keep its victims unresisting while it feedsDean realizes that he, too, is within an illusory world. Knowing that a person wakes up if he or she dies in a dream, he decides to kill himself. Carmen, Jessica, and his mother appear and try {{to talk him out of}} it. Dean resists the urge to stay, and awakens in the real world after stabbing himself. Sam, who is already in the warehouse trying to rescue him, is attacked by the djinn, but Dean kills the creature.|$|E
5|$|The {{letter to}} Æthelburg makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was already {{married at the}} time the news of Eadbald's {{conversion}} reached Rome. This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald's acceptance of Christianity, and it has been suggested in Bede's defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written while she was in Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface's letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband's side. It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than before, as Bede has it; Boniface's letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.|$|E
5|$|Toyah argues with Leanne's half-sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley), for not {{passing on}} a message about {{starting}} a {{shift at the}} pub, but they agree to call a truce. Peter leaves cigarettes at Leanne's flat and Toyah tries to take the blame but Simon is forced to cover for her. Simon later tells Eva who blackmails Toyah: stop Peter from shutting down Aidan Connor's (Shayne Ward) factory or Eva will tell Leanne about Peter and Toyah. Peter agrees to Eva's demands and they continue their affair. Toby returns in January 2017 and demands Toyah sign a paper to destroy their frozen embryos. Toyah is reluctant and after a heart to heart, they kiss. However, Toyah makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> doesn't love Toby and is staying with Peter, causing Toby to lash out and leave. Peter learns what has happened and decides to drop off Chloe Tipton (Jo-Anne Knowles), making Toyah jealous. They later make up and Leanne catches Peter and Toyah kissing. During a heated argument, Leanne disowns Toyah and refuses {{to talk to her}} again, despite her efforts. Leanne forgives Toyah after she helps deliver baby Oliver in a lift after it breaks down.|$|E
60|$|Bella asked no more {{questions}} and Millicent sat wondering how far {{she had been}} influenced by the reason she had given for leaving Clarence behind. She had undoubtedly desired to be free to devote herself to the gathering of material for her book, but that was not quite all. She had also half-consciously shrunk from the close contact with Clarence which would have been one result of their life in camp, but this she refused to admit. It was <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> desired an extension of the liberty which she must sometime relinquish. Taking it all round, she was rather troubled in mind.|$|R
50|$|When Robin pokes Barney {{about not}} calling Nora, it becomes <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> happy about this. Lily realizes that Robin still has {{feelings}} for Barney and encourages {{her to tell}} Barney and make their relationship clear. Robin denies it, and is prepared to tell Barney {{that there is nothing}} between them when he pulls her onto the dance-floor, proving Lily right. Whatever tension there is between them is broken when Barney receives a call from Nora, whom he reveals he actually called multiple times and lied that he had not called at all. Robin feeds him the words <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had intended to say to him and Barney succeeds at convincing Nora to meet him again.|$|R
50|$|It was <b>clear</b> to him <b>that</b> <b>she</b> loved another, and Burns {{wrote that}} {{it took him a}} few months to get over her.|$|R
5|$|With both of {{the leading}} {{candidates}} now discounted, Princess Victoria suggested Prince Louis of Hesse, a minor German royal, the nephew of the Grand Duke of Hesse. Princess Victoria {{had gone to the}} court of Hesse to inspect Louis's sister, Princess Anna, as a potential bride for her brother, the Prince of Wales. Although not favorably impressed with Princess Anna, she was impressed with Louis and his brother Prince Henry. Both were invited to Windsor Castle in 1860, ostensibly so they could watch the Ascot Races in the company of the royal family, but in reality, the visit was a chance for the Queen to inspect her potential son-in-law. The Queen admired both Louis and Henry, but noted how well Louis and Alice got along together. When the Hessian family departed, Louis requested Alice's photograph, and Alice made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was attracted to him.|$|E
5|$|Paul meets an old friend, Kim Taylor (Jenny Young), and learns he is {{the father}} of her sons David (Takaya Honda) and Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Paul and Kim manage to stop Amy and Leo from consummating their relationship. David bonds with Paul soon after, {{although}} Leo stays away from him due to their business rivalry, but eventually comes to accept Paul as his father. Paul tries to pursue a relationship with Terese, but she rejects him and later gets engaged to Gary. After receiving compensation from the Quill group, Paul buys and moves back into the Lassiter's Penthouse, with Amy and Jimmy. Terese confides in Paul that she has breast cancer, and he does his best to support her. However, once it is obvious that her chemotherapy is not working, Terese visits her brother Nick in prison, who is later granted bail with the help of Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), much to Paul's chagrin. Paul soon learns that Amy and Nick are dating. In addition, Paul and Leo are bought out of Robinsons after Amy encourages Steph to help Nick set up a wellness centre in the premises. Paul and Terese have sex, but she chooses to stay with Gary. After attempting to give Nick money to leave town, Paul frames him by having someone plant stolen medication in Nick's hotel room, resulting in his parole being revoked. Amy is furious to discover that Paul has set Nick up, and when Paul does not confess his crime to the police, she and Jimmy move back into No. 26. After Terese makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and Paul will never be in a relationship, and Amy refuses to move back into the penthouse, Paul decides to leave Erinsborough for a few weeks supposedly to visit his family in New York City, but David reveals that Paul never arrived. Paul returns a few weeks later and reveals he is engaged to Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). He also buys Mr Udagawa's (Lawrence Mah) share of Lassiters making him Terese's boss.|$|E
25|$|The AWSA {{supported}} the amendment, but Lucy Stone, who became its most prominent leader, {{also made it}} <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> believed that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men.|$|E
50|$|Between September 1965 and May 1966, Trieste II again {{underwent}} extensive modification and conversion at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, {{but there}} is no <b>clear</b> record <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was ever operated in that new configuration, i.e., the addition of skegs or outriggers {{on both sides of the}} sphere.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she made}} direct and <b>clear</b> {{affirmation}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had never had}} any intention to deny them; and that if--I noted the if--"if she had made some retractions and revocations on the scaffold it was from fear of the fire, {{and it was a}} violation of the truth." ...|$|R
500|$|Many have derided {{the series}} as poor writing. While {{comparing}} Stephenie Meyer to J. K. Rowling, Stephen King said, [...] "the real difference [...] is that Jo Rowling {{is a terrific}} writer, and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good." [...] However, King understood {{the appeal of the}} series, adding, [...] "People are attracted by the stories, by the pace {{and in the case of}} Stephenie Meyer, it's very <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> writing to a whole generation of girls and opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books.

25|$|At {{some point}} a Danish company bought her, It {{is not clear}} if the Danes bought {{her and she was}} then wrecked, or if they bought her after she wrecked. It is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not totally wrecked as she {{returned}} to commerce.|$|E
25|$|There were {{tensions}} {{in the relationship between}} young Alice and her stepmother, who had known her husband's previous wife and made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> regarded her predecessor as a beautiful, but insipid, childlike fool. Edith once angrily told her that if Alice Hathaway Lee had lived, she would have bored Theodore to death.|$|E
25|$|Anny – Anny is an English {{woman who}} was once Antoine's lover. After meeting with him, Anny makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has changed a {{considerable}} amount and must go on with her life. Antoine clings to the past, hoping that she may want to redefine their relationship, but he is ultimately rejected by her.|$|E
60|$|Nevis {{recognized}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would not}} have admitted this had she not been disposed to treat him on a confidential footing, and it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the indignation <b>she</b> had displayed in her answer was directed against her husband and had not been occasioned by his presumption.|$|R
500|$|In November 2012, Novakovic {{proclaimed that}} Natasha was still herself, despite {{how much she}} had grown. She {{explained}} [...] "It's {{so much fun to}} playing such a free spirited character.

5000|$|In Women and Economics, Gilman {{looks at}} the {{intersection}} between gender and class, but almost completely ignores race. It seems quite <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> when <b>she</b> does refer to “the race,” she is referring to a solely white race. [...] In various other works, she refers to other races as inferior and belonging to a {{lower part of the}} evolutionary ladder, “echoing the very social Darwinist sentiments <b>that</b> <b>she</b> despised when applied to gender”.|$|R
25|$|On 13 September 1800 John Shaw {{received}} a letter of marque. The letter gives a crew size of 100 men, suggesting, if the number is correct, that Glennie & Co. wished to use her as a privateer. Certainly by 1802 it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is sailing as a West Indiaman, trading between London and Jamaica, and then London and Tobago.|$|E
25|$|His {{favourite}} daughter, the artistically talented Mady (Marion), {{who became}} the first wife of artist John Collier, was troubled by mental illness for years. By her mid-twenties it was becoming <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not sane, and was getting steadily worse (the diagnosis is uncertain). Huxley persuaded Jean-Martin Charcot, one of Freud's teachers, to examine her {{with a view to}} treatment; but soon Mady died of pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Everyone arrives to {{celebrate}} Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum's union ("With aspect stern and gloomy stride"), but the festivities are {{interrupted by the}} arrival of Katisha, who has come to claim Nanki-Poo as her husband. However, the townspeople are sympathetic to the young couple, and Katisha's attempts to reveal Nanki-Poo's secret are drowned out by the shouting of the crowd. Outwitted but not defeated, Katisha makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> intends to get vengeance.|$|E
60|$|She {{left him}} shortly after this and walked {{home in a}} {{thoughtful}} mood, regretting his approaching departure and pondering over what he had said. With reflection it became <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had entertained the same idea as his. He and she and the others he mentioned were not acting and reacting upon one another casually; {{it was all a}} part of a purpose, leading up to something that still lay unrevealed on the knees of destiny. Perhaps he had been right in speaking of a drama; it suggested a sequence of prearranged events, springing from George's death. Reaching home, she endeavored to banish these thoughts, which were vaguely troublesome, but Miss Hume found her preoccupied and absent-minded during the evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{trust that}} Pierre {{and the others}} are on the alert, and not wasting their time in {{thinking}} about me; and that, if this troop make along the river, they will ride to warn the queen in time.
