25|$|The judges {{stated in}} the verdict that Orić had reason to know about murder and cruel {{treatment}} of Serbs on two specific occasions in the Police station, but acquitted him of all other crimes. Orić was acquitted of direct involvement {{in the murder of}} prisoners {{in the early years of}} the 1992–95 Bosnia war. But the court found he had <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to their mistreatment and failed to punish their killers. The three judges acquitted him of all charges related to the wanton destruction of Serb villages. The judges also took into account the lack of food and supplies and resulting lack of order and law during the Serbian siege on Srebrenica.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union. In response, many Central Asians, {{including}} Uzbeks or Samarqandites, {{were sent to}} fight the Germans {{in the area of}} Smolensk. However, a number of them, including Hatam Kadirov and Zair Muratov, were captured, transported to the Netherlands, abused and killed. Their bodies were buried in Rusthof cemetery near Amersfoort. For some time, these 101 victims were not identified, apart from {{the fact that they were}} Soviets, until an investigation by journalist Remco Reiding. Their plight was also studied by Uzbek historian Bahodir Uzakov of Gouda, South Holland. Witness Henk Broekhuizen said that, despite having seeing them once as a teenager, he would recall the soldiers' faces, whenever he <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

500|$|Hardy came belowdecks to see Nelson {{just after}} half-past two, and {{informed}} him {{that a number of}} enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma. With Nelson at this point were the chaplain Alexander Scott, the purser Walter Burke, Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to [...] "take care of poor Lady Hamilton", Nelson said [...] "Kiss me, Hardy". Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood {{for a minute or two}} before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, [...] "Who is that?", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied [...] "God bless you, Hardy." [...] By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, [...] "fan, fan... rub, rub... drink, drink." [...] Beatty heard Nelson murmur, [...] "Thank God I have done my duty", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as [...] "God and my country". Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.|$|E

2500|$|On November 25, 1997, Ron Carey took a {{leave of}} absence from the Teamsters, just hours before the Independent Review Board accused him of {{illegally}} using union money to fund his 1996 re-election campaign and failing to meet his fiduciary duties. Carey staunchly defended himself before the IRB, claiming that the accusations against him were based on the testimony of a single person (Jere Nash) who was trying to avoid prison time by implicating Carey. He directly contradicted testimony by his former executive secretary, who said Carey knew of the kickbacks to his campaign. Carey's attorney pointed out that the executive secretary had changed her testimony several times the past year, and that it had been undermined by testimony from another secretary and a mail clerk who both testified that the executive secretary admitted forging Carey's initials on donation approvals. However, Carey admitted that he had not adequately overseen the union's finances, and did not know that the union had spent close to $1 million in political contributions during a 10-day period in October 1996. The Independent Review Board expelled Ron Carey for life from the Teamsters union on July 27, 1998. The IRB concluded Carey breached his fiduciary duty, but that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he approved or knew about the donation kickback scheme. [...] "A fair inference to be drawn from all the facts is that Carey <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> because he knew or suspected that those contributions were to generate a personal benefit for him, i.e., benefits to his campaign," [...] the Board concluded.|$|E
