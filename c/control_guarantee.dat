40|$|ABSTRACT: A remote {{synchronization}} {{system for}} the on-board crystal oscillator (RESSOX) of the QZSS is proposed. Aimed at offering an alternative architecture for the classic GPS time-keeping system (TKS), the proposed system consists of a synchronization framework where an ultrastable atomic clock, localized at the ground station, is kept synchronized to a second time reference, a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO), on-board the QZSS satellite. Based on orbit calculations and delay predictions, feedback and feed-forward <b>control</b> <b>guarantee</b> the correct synchronization of the on-board time reference and the ground-station atomic clock. Compared with the classic GPS TKS, the RESSOX scheme offers several advantages in terms of accuracy, cost, weight, and power consumption. An extensive explanation of this novel design is presented. Differences and advantages of the proposed system are compared with the classic atomic clock scheme...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} new protocols {{for admission}} control and handling of overload conditions when scheduling real-time messages on CAN networks. The proposed solution builds incrementally on the FTT-CAN protocol, which provides guaranteed scheduling for cyclic (periodic) and aperiodic message streams as defined at design time and best effort scheduling for signalling (including admission requests) and scheduling of dynamically arriving message streams. FTT-CAN does not specify any particular admission control or overload management methods but provides mechanisms that support their implementation. This work exploits such mechanisms {{and provides the}} description of protocols related to admission <b>control,</b> <b>guarantee</b> of dynamic message streams, temporary overload management and fault containment. This work provides the description of protocols and implementation related issues that allow for guaranteed bandwidth and bounded response time for admission requests, and graceful recovery from temporary overload of event-based messages.

40|$|In this thesis, Quality of Service (QoS) and {{resource}} management in multimedia communication systems are briefly reviewed. Then, two Connection Admission Control (CAC) methods, {{one for a}} media server with multiple disks supporting the simultaneous retrieval of continuous media streams {{and the other for}} Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks supporting multimedia traffic under varying traffic conditions and different QoS requirements, are proposed, simulated and evaluated in order to improve system performance with respect to the delivery of multimedia services in multimedia communication systems. The proposed CAC method for the media server with multiple disks {{can be applied to the}} different media stream storage patterns on the disks, which is also well-suited to support retrieval service for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID). This CAC method can distribute the workload of applications evenly across the disks in order to maximize the system processing capabilities. The proposed CAC method for ATM networks can be applied to not only an ATM multiplexer but also an output buffer type switching node. Since cell loss rate and average queuing delay are two main important performance objectives provided by the networks to connections, which is closely related to the buffer sizes in the ATM switching node or the multiplexer, our proposed CAC method with buffer model can improve statistical multiplexing gains due to the effects of different buffer sizes. Also, a two-level CAC method is proposed so that our proposed algorithm could be guaranteed to compute in real-time. Computer simulations are used to help the performance evaluation for two CAC methods. The simulation results show that the proposed CAC methods can provide very high efficient admission <b>control,</b> <b>guarantee</b> the real-time continuous retrieval of delay sensitive media streams or achieve high utilization efficiency by taking account of statistical multiplexing effects based on different buffer sizes...|$|E

40|$|Unfunded defined-benefit (DB) public {{pension plans}} {{throughout}} the world are being converted to funded defined-contribution (DC) plans that typically contain a minimum benefit guarantee (DC-MB). Risk management techniques must be used to control the cost of these guarantees. The most common technique is to 'over-fund' the benefit: the contribution rate is set high enough so that the expected benefit is {{much larger than the}} guaranteed minimum benefit. This paper shows that while over-funding is very effective in <b>controlling</b> <b>guarantee</b> costs in traditional DB plans, it is highly ineffective for DC-MB plans. This result holds even at very large contribution rates and when risky investments are restricted to a very diversified index like the S&P 500. Calculations show that the true risk-adjusted value of unfunded guarantees in a realistic DC-MB plan equals 40 to 90 percent (or more) {{of the value of the}} unfunded liability in the DB benefit being replaced, depending on design. This result is true even when the contribution rate in the DC-MB plan is chosen to produce an expected benefit five times larger than the DB benefit. This paper considers two approaches to <b>controlling</b> <b>guarantee</b> costs. The first approach borrows from the recent catastrophic insurance literature. A 'standardized' portfolio is guaranteed, requiring agents to accept 'basis risk' if they chose a non-standard portfolio. However, for large conversions from DB to DC-MB plans, in which there is little or no DB benefit remaining the government must still worry about any 'implicit guarantee' extending beyond the standardized portfolio, thereby enticing agents to accept a lot of basis risk (a 'Samaritan's Dilemma'). The second method, therefore, uses a more brute force approach: private portfolio returns in the good states of the world are taxed while returns in the bad states are subsidized. Both options are very effective at <b>controlling</b> <b>guarantee</b> costs, and they can be used separately or together. Calculations demonstrate that all of the unfunded liabilities associated with modern pay-as-you-go public pension programs can be eliminated under both approaches even at a modest contribution rate. ...|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the pursued {{strategy}} {{is expected to}} have a beneficial effect on the decoding complexity. A decoder-driven rate control scheme is based on repeated 'request-and-decode’ operations until decoding proves successful. Although decoder-driven rate <b>control</b> <b>guarantees</b> decoding at a minimal SW rate, the series of decoding attempts severely increases the decoding complexity. In contrast, encoder-driven rate control assigns a fixed 'take-it-or-leave-it’ amount of non-systematic information and only one decoding attempt is made. Hence, the decoding complexity of the proposed feedback-free system is expected to be significantly lower than that of the feedback-based systems.|$|R
