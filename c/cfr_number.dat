It also involved the Romanian companies Electroputere Craiova and UCM Reşiţa. Thus the Romanian party delivered to Yugoslavia {{a number of}} 103 Co’Co locomotives of the 461 JŽ series and sub-assemblies for 130 Bo’Bo locomotives of the 441 JŽ series, delivered to Romania and registered with <b>CFR</b> under the <b>number</b> 040-EC. The Yugoslavian locomotives derived directly from the already renowned prototype ASEA RB1 improved in the mechanical construction under the RC1 series pattern.|$|R

The Code of Federal Regulation (<b>CFR)</b> addresses a <b>number</b> of situations, include confined space rescue, 29 CFR 1910.146 and 29 CFR 1910.147. In most cases, wilderness rope rescue is not specifically covered by such mandates (except in the case where the wilderness rescue is carried out by governmental organizations).|$|R
5000|$|Number 38 3199 of the South German Railway Museum (Süddeutsches Eisenbahnmuseum) in Heilbronn has {{an unusual}} history. It {{was built in}} 1921 by the Linke-Hofmann {{locomotive}} factory in Breslau. It was initially designated as 2580 Elberfeld by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and later renumbered to 38 3199. It was last stationed at Breslau locomotive depot. As early as 1926 it was purchased by the Rumanian railways (<b>CFR)</b> and allocated <b>number</b> 230.106. In 1974 it was mothballed. Railway fans discovered it in the scrap yard and had it restored to full operation in Klausenburg in 1999 in the livery of the former Reichsbahn. Since 2002 the locomotive has been deployed again on museum services.|$|R
40|$|The Knowledge and Abilities Catalog for Nuclear Power Plant Operators: Boiling-Water Reactors (BWRs) (NUREG- 1123, Revision 1) {{provides}} {{the basis for}} the development of content-valid licensing examinations for reactor operators (ROs) and senior reactor operators (SROs). The examinations developed using the BWR Catalog along with the Operator Licensing Examiner Standards (NUREG- 1021) and the Examiner`s Handbook for Developing Operator Licensing Written Examinations (NUREG/BR- 0122), will cover the topics listed under Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 55 (10 CFR 55). The BWR Catalog contains approximately 7, 000 knowledge and ability (K/A) statements for ROs and SROs at BWRs. The catalog is organized into six major sections: Organization of the Catalog, Generic Knowledge and Ability Statements, Plant Systems grouped by Safety Functions, Emergency and Abnormal Plant Evolutions, Components, and Theory. Revision 1 to the BWR Catalog represents a modification in form and content of the original catalog. The K/As were linked to their applicable 10 <b>CFR</b> 55 item <b>numbers.</b> SRO level K/As were identified by 10 CFR 55. 43 item numbers. The plant-wide generic and system generic K/As were combined in one section with approximately one hundred new K/As.

Finally, High Containment Hydrogen Concentration and Plant Fire On Site evolutions added to the Emergency and Abnormal Plant Evolutions section...|$|R
40|$|Introducción: La revascularización de una estenosis coronaria que induce isquemia mejora el estatus funcional del paciente y su pronóstico. Por el contrario, la angioplastía de una lesión que no provoca isquemia puede implicar complicaciones sin beneficios. La medición de flujo de reserva coronario (FFR) es un índice del significado fisiopatológico de las estenosis coronarias. Objetivos: Comparar los eventos cardiovasculares adversos mayores (MACE) en pacientes en quienes la FFR permitió excluir una o más lesiones de angioplastia (Grupo FFR > 0, 75) con aquellos en que ésta obligó a la revascularización (grupo FFR 0, 75, y en ellos disminuyó el porcentaje de lesiones múltiples angiográficamente significativas (dos o más vasos), desde un 51, 4 % (previo a la realización de FFR), a un 25, 7 %. En este grupo se utilizó un promedio de 0. 7 stents por paciente, mientras que en el grupo FFR The {{treatment}} of coronary stenosis causing myocardial ischemia improves functional capacity and prognosis. Treatment of non-ischemia inducing coronary stenosis {{may lead to}} complications with no benefit to the patient Measurement of coronary flow reserve (CFR) {{may be used to}} assess the significance of coronary artery stenosis. Aim: To compare major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with significant stenosis (CFR 0. 75) and thus were not subjected to PTCA in the corresponding artery. Methods: 74 patients were included from August 2006 to July 2010. CFR was measured in lesions exhibiting 6070 % stenosis, using adenosine. A value 0. 75 CFR group. After evaluation of <b>CFR</b> the <b>number</b> of significant coronary stenosis decreased from 51. 4 % to 25. 7 %. They received a mean of 0. 7 stents per patient. On the other hand, in the group with CFR 0. 75 group (12. 8 % vs 2. 9 %, respectively, p= 0. 047). Conclusion: The exclusion of myocardial ischemia as inferred by a CFR > 0. 75 allowed a significantly lower number of PTCAs without increase in MACE at a medium term follow up. A greater number of revascularization procedures was required in patients with CFR < 0. 75, which is expected from the greater number of lesions subjected to PTCA...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the survival of}} individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD-associated CRC) {{compared to that of}} individuals without IBD diagnosed with CRC. METHODS: Epidemiologic, clinical, and follow-up data were obtained from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (Colon CFR). IBD-associated cases were identified from self-report of physician diagnosis. For a subset of participants, medical records were examined to confirm self-report of IBD. Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95 %CI of mortality, comparing IBD-associated to non-IBD-associated CRC, adjusted for age at CRC diagnosis, sex, Colon <b>CFR</b> phase, and <b>number</b> of prior endoscopies. Following imputation to complete CRC stage information, adjustment for CRC stage was examined. RESULTS: A total of 7202 CRC cases, including 250 cases of IBD-associated CRC, were analyzed. Over a twelve year follow-up period following CRC diagnosis, 2013 and 74 deaths occurred among non-IBD associated CRC and IBD-associated CRC patients, respectively. The difference in survival between IBD-associated and non-IBD CRC cases was not statistically significant (aHR = 1. 08; 95 %CI: 0. 85 - 1. 36). However, the assumption of proportional hazards necessary for valid inference from Cox regression was not met over the entire follow-up period, and we therefore limited analyses to within five years after CRC diagnosis when the assumption of proportional hazards was met. Over this period, there was evidence of worse prognosis for IBD-associated CRC (aHR = 1. 36; 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 1. 76). Results were similar when adjusted for CRC stage, or restricted to IBD confirmed in medical records. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that IBD-associated CRC has a worse prognosis than non-IBD-associated CRC...|$|R
5000|$|... "Riva" [...] {{began its}} long career in 1890 {{when it was}} turned out by the Krauss Works of Linz, Austria as serial number 2360. Its first owner was the M.A.R. (Mori-Arco-Riva del Garda) Railway in {{northern}} Italian region of Trentino-South Tyrol, where it served as number 2 alongside two identical sister engines, [...] "Arco" [...] and [...] "Lago di Garda". The railway was closed when Italy entered the World War I in 1915. The railway {{was on the front}} line and then sustained heavy damage, while [...] "Riva" [...] was sent to work on the Heeresfeldbahn (field military railways) in the Eastern front. From 1918 to 1941 it served an industrial railway in Stryj, Poland. The Second World War brought another stint in military duty before the engine finally ended up on the State Railways of Romania (<b>CFR)</b> as <b>number</b> 395-104. [...] "Riva" [...] operated on the CFR's Alba Julia-Zlatna line until 1968, when it was finally retired and sold to Plasser and Theurer, an Austria-based builder of track maintenance machinery. Fortunately for the little engine, an American representative of Plasser and Theurer became aware of the Omaha Zoo's search for a second locomotive, and in 1974 arrangements were made for [...] "Riva" [...] to be donated to the zoo. Restoration took place in the Union Pacific's Omaha shops. The overhaul consisted of major running gear work, the installation of American air brake equipment, and conversion from coal to oil firing. The locomotive was then painted, and missing parts such as the headlights and bell were replaced. The reborn [...] "Riva" [...] entered service at the zoo in 1976 during the annual Family Night/Members' Day event, and has operated almost every year since. A major multi-year overhaul took place in the early 1990s and another in 2000-2002. During the winter and spring of 2005, the water tanks were replaced and the air tanks (added in 1976) were moved to a concealed location, returning the engine to a more historically correct appearance. The engine lost its light green and black paint sceme and was repainted all dark green. The engine was given a new bell in 2013."Virgie" [...] is the zoo's first diesel locomotive, acquired in 2008. It is a four-wheeled, 40-ton diesel switcher locomotive built by Plymouth, in 1957 and named for one of the railroad's founders. The engine was initially painted light blue with red and black, and featured a likeness of a woman's face(presumably that of its namesake) on its front. Virgie entered service in 2009, and is occasionally used to pull trains when one or both steam engines are being serviced. This locomotive was later repainted to red and black, and the face has since been removed.|$|R
40|$|Classified {{transuranic}} {{material that}} cannot be {{shipped to the}} Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico is stored in Greater Confinement Disposal boreholes in the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site on the Nevada Test Site. A performance assessment was completed for the transuranic inventory in the boreholes and submitted to the Transuranic Waste Disposal Federal Review Group. The performance assessment was prepared by Sandia National Laboratories {{on behalf of the}} U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office using an iterative methodology that assessed radiological releases from the intermediate depth disposal configuration against the regulatory requirements of the 1985 version of 40 CFR 191 of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. The transuranic materials are stored at 21 to 37 m depth (70 to 120 ft) in large diameter boreholes constructed in the unsaturated alluvial deposits of Frenchman Flat. Hydrologic processes that affect long- term isolation of the radionuclides are dominated by extremely slow upward rates of liquid/vapor advection and diffusion; there is no downward pathway under current climatic conditions and there is no recharge to groundwater under future ''glacial'' climatic conditions. A Federal Review Team appointed by the Transuranic Waste Disposal Federal Review Group reviewed the Greater Confinement Disposal performance assessment and found that the site met the majority of the regulatory criteria of the 1985 and portions of the 1993 versions of 40 <b>CFR</b> 191. A <b>number</b> of technical and procedural issues required development of supplemental information that was incorporated into a final revision of the performance assessment. These issues include inclusion of radiological releases into the complementary cumulative distribution function for the containment requirements associated with drill cuttings from inadvertent human intrusion, verification of mathematical models used in the performance assessment, inclusion of dose calculations from collocated low-level waste in the boreholes for the individual protection requirements, further assessments of engineered barriers and conditions associated with the assurance requirements, and expansion of documentation provided for assessing the groundwater protection requirements. The Transuranic Waste Disposal Federal Review Group approved the performance assessment for Greater Confinement Disposal boreholes in 2001 and did not approve the Application of the Assurance Requirements. Remaining issues concerned with engineered barriers and the multiple aspects of the Assurance Requirements will be resolved at the time of closure of the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site. This is the first completion and acceptance of a performance assessment for transuranic materials under the U. S. Department of Energy self-regulation. The Greater Confinement Disposal boreholes are only the second waste disposal configuration to meet the safety regulatory requirements of 40 CFR 191...|$|R
40|$|Poster Presentations: S 1 -P 001 BACKGROUND: One of the {{immediate}} public health priorities during the 2009 pandemic was to establish the transmissibility and severity of the novel influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus (pH 1 N 1). Whereas transmissibility was estimated generally reliably from {{the early stages of}} the pandemic, there was greater difficulty in estimating severity. One measure of severity at the individual level is the risk of death among people who have the disease, and this conditional measure can be referred to as the case fatality risk (CFR). Our objective was to review published estimates of the CFR of pH 1 N 1, identify challenges to real-time estimation of the CFR, and make recommendations for estimation of severity in the next pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies reporting estimates of the CFR of pH 1 N 1 were retrieved from the Medline (PubMed) electronic database on April 20, 2012. Eligible articles reported a CFR in the population for the first wave or the first year of the pandemic. Studies that only reported the CFR in population subgroups, such as pregnant women, or those with chronic diseases, were excluded. We defined the <b>CFR</b> as the <b>number</b> of influenza-associated deaths divided by the number of pH 1 N 1 cases or infections in a population. RESULTS: We identified 46 articles reporting estimates of the CFR. The CFRs were measured using cumulative incidence of infection derived from serologic data, estimated cases, medically attended cases, or laboratory-confirmed infections as the denominators. The earliest studies of the severity of pH 1 N 1 provided high estimates of the CFR based on confirmed cases (CFRs of approximately 1000 deaths per 100, 000 cases). After the peak of the pandemic, the CFRs based on symptomatic cases were similar in those studies using estimated infections and estimated cases as denominators (CFRs of approximately 10 deaths per 100, 000 cases). In age-stratified analysis, point estimates of the CFRs increased with age from approximately 1 death per 100, 000 cases in older children to approximately 100 deaths per 100, 000 cases in elderly. CONCLUSIONS: The wide range in published estimates of the CFR led to challenges in identifying unbiased and comparable severity measure of the pandemic strain. While the choice of denominator could explain some of the variability, CFR estimates for the estimated case denominator still covered a very wide range. One clear limitation in estimating the CFR is the lack of consensus on the definition, computation, and estimation of the CFR, highlighted by the variable denominators and the difference between directly and indirectly estimated numerators. Real-time estimation of a well-defined measure of severity with sufficient comparability has to be ensured as preparedness against the next major global epidemic of respiratory infection. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
