40|$|Regarding rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> {{researchers}} lack a {{basic understanding}} of soil microbial communities; specifically, little is known about whether or not soil microbial variation is correlated with succession in these plantations. In this paper, we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene to investigate the diversity and composition of the soil bacterial communities in a chronosequence of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> that were 5, 10, 13, 18, 25, and 30 years old. We determined that: (1) Soil bacterial diversity and composition show changes over the succession stages of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations.</b> The diversity of soil bacteria were highest in 10, 13, and 18 year-old rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> followed by 30 year-old rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> whereas 5 and 25 year-old rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> had the lowest values for diversity. A total of 438, 870 16 S rDNA sequences were detected in 18 soil samples from six rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> found in 28 phyla, 66 classes, 139 orders, 245 families, 355 genera, and 645 species, with 1. 01 % sequences from unclassified bacteria. The dominant phyla were Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia (relative abundance large than 3 %). There were differences in soil bacterial communities among different succession stages of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantation.</b> (2) Soil bacteria diversity and composition in the different stages was closely related to pH, vegetation, soil nutrient, and altitude, of which pH, and vegetation were the main drivers...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{means to}} map <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> {{is needed to}} detect tropical land use change and evaluate reforestation projects. To analyze recent <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> expansion in northeastern Costa Rica, we examined the potential of combining moderate-resolution hyperspectral imagery (2005 HyMap mosaic) with multitemporal, multispectral data (Landsat) to accurately classify (1) general forest types and (2) <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> by species composition. Following a linear discriminant analysis to reduce data dimensionality, we compared four Random Forest classification models: hyperspectral data (HD) alone; HD plus interannual spectral metrics; HD plus a multitemporal forest regrowth classification; and all three models combined. The fourth, combined model achieved overall accuracy of 88. 5 %. Adding multitemporal data significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0. 0001) of all forest types, although the effect on <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> accuracy was modest. The hyperspectral data alone classified six species of <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> with 75 % to 93 % producer’s accuracy; adding multitemporal spectral data increased accuracy only for two species with dense canopies. Non-native tree species had higher classification accuracy overall and made {{up the majority of}} <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> in this landscape. Our results indicate that combining occasionally acquired hyperspectral data with widely available multitemporal satellite imagery enhances mapping and monitoring of reforestation in tropical landscapes...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} phenology-based algorithm {{was developed to}} detect and map rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> in Xishuangbanna, a prefecture in southwest China's Yunnan province. This algorithm highlighted the unique phenological characteristics of deciduous rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> during the dry season. Phenology of rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> and natural evergreen forests was delineated with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager imagery during 2009 - 2014. The {{results showed that the}} differences of NBR were larger than those of NDVI and LSWI from defoliation stage to foliation stage. Then, the change rate of NBR derived between defoliation stage and foliation stage was used to map rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> in 2014, by combining a Landsat-based forest mask and a Digital Elevation Model mask. Our study demonstrates that Landsat imagery holds great potential for rubber <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> mapping, as it not only improves the classification results but also reduces the data demand...|$|R

40|$|As the {{greatest}} rainwater users among all vegetative land covers, <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> have been employed strategically to mitigate salinity and water-logging problems. However, large-scale commercial <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> in high rainfall areas reduce fresh water inflows to river systems supporting downstream communities, agricultural industries and wetland environmental assets. A bio-economic model {{was used to}} estimate economic demand for water by future upstream plantations in a sub-catchment (the 2. 8 million ha Macquarie valley in NSW) of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. Given four tree-product values, impacts were simulated under two settings: without and with the requirement that permanent water entitlements be purchased from downstream entitlement holders before establishing a <b>tree</b> <b>plantation.</b> Without this requirement, gains in economic surplus from expanding <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> exceeded economic losses by downstream irrigators, and stock and domestic water users, but resulted in reductions of up to 154 GL (gigalitres) in annual flows to wetland environments. With this requirement, smaller gains in upstream economic surplus, added to downstream gains, could total $ 330 million while preserving environmental flows. Extending downstream water markets to new upstream <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> to equilibrate marginal values across water uses, helps ensure water entitlements are not diminished without compensation. Outcomes include better economic-efficiency, social-equity and environmental-sustainability.

40|$|Extreme {{precipitation}} {{events are}} expected to increase in frequency and magnitude in future due to global warming, but relevant impacts on <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> ecosystem carbon cycle are unknown. In this study, we use an atmosphere-vegetation interaction model (AVIM 2) to estimate the likely impacts of extreme precipitation events on carbon fluxes and carbon stocks of a <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> in south China. Our results indicate that shifting from moderate precipitation events to extreme precipitation events whilst keeping monthly precipitation unchanged could decrease the <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> carbon accumulation. <b>Tree</b> <b>plantation</b> net primary productivity, net ecosystem productivity, soil carbon stock and vegetation carbon stock could decrease by 4. 2, 28, 4. 3 and 1. 4 % during the studying period of 1962 - 2004, respectively. Though reductions in net primary productivity and net ecosystem productivity are relatively smaller than their annual variations, our sensitivity test shows that the <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> carbon stock could decrease by 3. 3 % if the assumed extreme precipitation regime lasts for 500 years. Observed and simulated gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem productivity have significant positive correlation with soil water content (SWC), especially the deep SWC. The mechanism for the extreme precipitation effect is {{that the increase in}} extreme precipitation events will cause SWC to decrease, consequently, reducing carbon fluxes and stocks...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a new carbon economy has the potential to offer win–win outcomes for environments and economies. Large-scale <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> are expected {{to play a major role}} in carbon economies but could have negative ecological and economic consequences when key environmental values such as biodiversity conservation are not considered. We discuss three potential “bio-perversities”—negative outcomes for biodiversity—that could result from inappropriate <b>plantation</b> <b>tree</b> programs aimed solely at reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide and mitigating rapid climate change effects. These are: (1) clearing native vegetation to establish <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> (2) planting <b>trees</b> that become invasive taxa, and (3) <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> negatively affecting key ecosystem processes such as fire and hydrological regimes. These bio-perversities may result from common mistakes in environmental management: (1) too narrow a focus on a single environmental value, (2) failing to adequately quantify ecological uncertainty, and (3) failing to anticipate how different groups of people respond to an environmental problem. We highlight ways to prevent possible bio-perverse outcomes in large-scale plantation programs. These include requiring that risk assessments precede project establishment, full carbon accounting is undertaken, incentives used to stimulate <b>tree</b> <b>plantation</b> establishment are rigorously examined, and rigorous compliance and ecological monitoring is undertaken...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} local habitat structure and surrounding landscape characteristics (proportion of land use types and connectedness) on species density and composition of bird communities inhabiting the interior of young <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> on former cropland in central Spain, which were motivated by the Common Agrarian Policy. Variation of species density (number of species/ 0. 78 ha) among <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> showed different environmental associations across seasons: local habitat {{was more important than}} landscape characteristics during winter, whereas they were similarly important during spring. Species density increased with the development of the tree layer in winter and with the presence of urban areas around <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> and cover of the herbaceous layer within them in the breeding season. We identified 15 species that exhibit high relative abundance in woodland habitats within the Mesomediterranean region of Central Spain that were absent in both seasons in the studied <b>tree</b> <b>plantations,</b> which were an attractive habitat for urban exploiter species but an unfavorable habitat for the regional forest species pool except for forest generalist species. Composition of bird assemblages was more related to local habitat structure than to landscape characteristics around <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> and was rather similar in winter and spring seasons. The very different effects of local habitat and landscape characteristics on bird communities make difficult suggesting management practices with positive effects for all avifauna species during the entire year. We conclude that the small size and low maturity of the studied <b>tree</b> <b>plantations</b> do not contribute to enhancing the bird diversity value of current CAP aids to afforest former cropland with pines in the Mediterranean region. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
