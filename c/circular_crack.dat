40|$|Role {{of impact}} on {{determination}} of interfacial toughness measurement by indentation for {{thermal barrier coating}} systems B. Ekici* The measurement of interfacial toughness by an indentation method was proposed several years ago. It {{has been shown that}} this method is very simple and reliable for the calculation of interfacial toughness. For this reason, many studies were performed for different substrate and coating combinations. Numerical models also supported these studies. Unfortunately, the success of this method depends on the hardness of the substrate. In most studies, the coating was ceramic and the substrate was steel. The substrate must be hard enough to get a <b>circular</b> <b>crack</b> around the indentation zone. If the substrate is not hard enough, the <b>circular</b> <b>crack</b> cannot be seen. In the light of the experiments performed for different combinations of substrate and coating, the use of the method was restricted to a very narrow range of materials that are mainly used for thermal barrier coating systems. In the present study, this method is used even for a medium hardness substrate. In order to get a <b>circular</b> <b>crack,</b> loading is performed with constant acceleration instead of static loading. The success of the method is shown to be considerably increased...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply the method {{developed}} by Rice [1], of solving for the elastic field of a crack with a front perturbed from some reference shape, {{to solve the}} elasticity problems of somewhat circular planar tensile cracks under arbitrary load distributions. The method {{is based on a}} known solution for the stress intensity factor along a <b>circular</b> <b>crack</b> due to a pair of wedge-opening point forces on its surfaces. A full solution, accurate to first order in the deviation from a circular shape, is derived for the stress intensity factor and the crack opening displacement distributions. The results of a perturbation in a harmonic wave form suggest that a <b>circular</b> <b>crack,</b> under axially symmetric loading, can be configurationaUy unstable (not grow as a circle), for loadings that increase in intensity with distance from the center. Circular cracks with harmonic shape perturbations are found to have the same form of variation of the stress intensity factor with arc length along the crack edge (to first order accuracy) as found in previous work for a half plane crack. As a test case for the perturbation solution, an elliptical planar tensile crack under uniform tension is viewed as being perturbed from a <b>circular</b> <b>crack.</b> Results derived from the perturbation formulae through numerical evaluation are compared with the exact solutions existing in the literature. The perturbation results show a very good match with the exact solutions even when the semi-axis lengths of the elliptical crack differ by a factor of two (and by as much as a factor of three when special choices of the reference <b>circular</b> <b>crack</b> location are made). This suggests that the perturbation procedure presented here, while theoretically exact only to first order, can be used to produce acceptable results for some planar cracks whose shapes deviate appreciably from a circle. 1...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the N 1 value in the relationship between pressure and flow for different types of water reticulation pipes with different forms of fractures. The relationship is defined as: Once these N 1 values are established, they can be used as an indication for better pressure management in water reticulation networks. This investigation was limited to three types of pipe with diameter 110 mm and wall thickness of 4 mm: • uPVC • Cast iron • Steel And three different forms of failures: • Round holes • Longitudinal splits • <b>Circular</b> <b>cracks</b> Pressure step testing was used to obtain experimental data. During analysis of the data, Cd was calculated from the initial area of a fracture and kept constant thereafter. Conclusions could be drawn about similar type pipes with similar fractures and comparisons could be made between all the samples as well as previous studies. Generally it seems that longitudinal splits lead to the most excessive leaking, followed by round holes and then the <b>circular</b> <b>cracks.</b> A summary of typical N 1 exponents found is shown below: • uPVC pipes with round holes 0. 48 - 0. 49 • uPVC pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 89 - 1. 26 • uPVC pipes with <b>circular</b> <b>cracks</b> 0. 31 – 0. 48 • Cast Iron pipes with round holes 0. 43 – 0. 44 • Cast Iron pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 42 – 0. 46 • Cast Iron pipes with <b>circular</b> <b>cracks</b> 0. 41 – 0. 43 • Steel pipes with round holes 0. 42 – 0. 44 • Steel pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 39 – 0. 45 • Steel pipes with <b>circular</b> <b>cracks</b> 0. 38 – 0. 4...|$|R

40|$|Strain {{energy release}} rates were {{evaluated}} for an external <b>circular</b> <b>crack</b> {{subjected to a}} combination of a uniform tension and a bending stress at infinity. The value depends on the shape of the propagating crack and the realistic propagation path would release the greatest strain energy. Considering various shapes for the propagating crack such as circle and ellipse the most preferential shape is found to be the circular one which is tangent to the original border {{at the point where the}} smallest nominal stress arises. A discussion of the distinction between a fracture criterion based on the strain energy release rate and one based on the stress intensity factor is presented.

40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to {{calculate}} the T (transition) matrix for a <b>circular</b> <b>crack</b> in a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic medium. The T matrix method is a building block technique for multiple scattering, where the T matrix is calculated for each scatterer separately without prior knowledge of the other scatterers (cracks, inclusions, surfaces, etc.). This means that we solve the scattering problem for arbitrary incoming time harmonic elastic waves. A solution for the scattering by an open <b>circular</b> <b>crack</b> {{can be found in}} [1], and for multiple scattering see [2]. On the crack surface the so called spring contact boundary conditions are assumed, enabling modelling of various cracktypes, such as the open crack, the fluid filled crack and a crack partly closed by a static background pressure.

Figure  10 a shows the damages observed on the top face of slab, which include a spall localized {{at the center of}} slab, a series of longitudinal cracks parallel to the supported edges of slab, and some <b>circular</b> and radial <b>cracks,</b> as shown in Fig.  10 a. The damage pattern simulated by the uncoupled analysis is shown in Fig.  10 b. As shown in this figure, the damages are mainly localized on the central region of slab. In addition, the corners of slab to some extent have experienced damage. The damages predicted by coupled analysis are in better agreement with the experimental observation. The longitudinal and <b>circular</b> <b>cracks</b> predicted by the coupled analysis on the top face are similar to the cracks observed in the experimental study (compare Fig.  10 a–c). The uncoupled analysis is not as effective as the coupled analysis in damage prediction of the concrete slab. Although the radial and <b>circular</b> <b>cracks</b> are to some extent simulated by the uncoupled analysis, the longitudinal crack that is formed at the mid-span of the slab due to the flexural deformations cannot be simulated effectively by this analysis.

A first Qp estimate was obtained by applying the classical risetime method, under the assumption of a point-like source time function. In order to investigate the effect of directivity due to the finiteness of seismic sources, new nonlinear relationships, based on a <b>circular</b> <b>crack</b> model rupturing at a constant velocity, were numerically built. These relationships were used to formulate a nonlinear inverse method for retrieving source (radius, dip, and strike of the <b>circular</b> <b>crack)</b> and Qp parameters from the inversion of risetime and pulse width data.
