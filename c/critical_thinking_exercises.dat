40|$|With {{the advent}} of the objects-first {{approach}} for introductory programming, instructors are challenged to think differently regarding the projects and exercises they create for their classrooms. The objects-first approach reduces the emphasis on syntax and encourages the student to focus upon the proper construction and use of classes. This change in emphasis means that students must understand the relationships between classes within a code solution and how such relationships affect the overall design of a system. Unfortunately, such <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises</b> can prove challenging to the introductory student, especially if presented in an abstract manner. In this paper, the authors examine how fundamental principles such as inheritance, composition, and association can be conveyed to introductory programming students within a collaborative virtual environment.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a research programme whose focus was critical thinking and explores how information technology (IT) postgraduate students model problems. Some results from the programme show that IT students appear to improve their problem-solving ability by undertaking structured <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises.</b> An AC Nielsen survey commissioned by DETYA in 2000 sought to gauge employer satisfaction with graduates using a variety of methods including questionnaires, focus groups and in-depth interviews. A key finding was that ‗the skills employers consider to be most important in graduates are creativity and flair, enthusiasm and the capacity for independent and critical thinking‘. Similar conclusions were drawn in earlier work from the UK and USA. Generally, critical thinking, if it is taught in a university, is taught as a formal or symbolic logic subject, usually by the philosophy or mathematics department. While there is nothing inherently wrong with teaching students the syllogisms of Aristotle, as formal logic has its uses, that does not necessarily equate to critical thinking. The assessment of critical thinking skills is also somewhat problematic. There are several generi...|$|E
40|$|Motivational {{techniques}} are often employed by teachers. Many {{of these techniques}} foster extrinsic motivation, meaning that students are either offered rewards or threatened with some type of negative consequence in order {{to lead to a}} desired action or behavior (Viadero, 1999). Although there is much debate on the usefulness of extrinsic motivation, the focus of this review is on intrinsic motivation, or motivation derived from a genuine interest or desire to learn {{on the part of the}} student (Viadero, 1999). While the debate over the effects of extrinsic motivation is beyond the scope of this review, Wilson and Corpus (2005) provide a good discussion of the place of extrinsic motivation in education. Student-centered instruction is a potential method for enhancing intrinsic motivation among students (Hancock, Bray, & Nason 1995). Student-centered instruction attempts to engender active learning by using methods such as cooperative learning, open-ended assignments, <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises,</b> simulations, and problem solving activities (Felder & Brent, 1996). The goal of student-centered instruction is to shift student learning away from passive sitting and listening to a more active and dynamic learning experience.

40|$|Just as Pirsig’s (1974) {{account of}} his {{motorcycle}} adventure explores the dichotomy of holistic and reductionistic philosophies, so too does a short course in chainsaw safety and tree felling incorporate these seemingly disparate viewpoints into a <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercise.</b> Students entering college often lack <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills (National Commission on Excellence in Education 1983). The chainsaw course described here addresses this disparity via the transmission of two types of information: (1) subject matter and (2) how to process that subject matter (Schafer 1991); the latter {{is the essence of}} <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> The chainsaw course has three modules taught over two days. Module one covers safety equipment and chainsaw techniques. Module two covers the disassembly and maintenance of the chainsaw. Module three allows the student to assess field conditions and integrate learned theories to safely fell trees. Over twelve hours, the student experiences authority-centered lecture, reductionistic discovery-based learning, and <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> The objective is to formulate a holistic solution (felling a tree into a desired space) from integrated reductionist principles (forces and techniques). The expected outcomes for this course are a better understanding of safety and knowledge of one’s technical limitations. I found, however, that students also develop a renewed interest in their chosen curricula, a more mature interaction with faculty, and an attitude of inquiry that permeates their continuing academic pursuits. I believe the noted changes in philosophical direction result from the combination of a uniquely interesting subject, an informal student/teacher relationship (student/teacher ratio of 3 / 1), and a rapid application of knowledge to confirm cause and effect. This philosophy lesson, disguised as a chainsaw safety course, can be replicated under many pretexts. The keys to implementation are to find a subject of passionate interest to students, share one’s expertise, and challenge the students to find tangible solutions to real questions...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{no clear}} {{guideline}} on how to teach students evidence-based decision making (EBDM), so this study aimed {{to assess the impact}} of an educational intervention on students’ EBDM skills. Methods: This was an explorative mixed-method study of 12 undergraduate occupational therapy students and their teacher. The teaching was aimed at increasing self-efficacy and cognitive skills in EBDM. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather the students’ perceived learning benefits. Before and after the intervention, a self-efficacy questionnaire, a critical thinking test, and scored generic cognitive skills in an argument were used as measures of learning achievements. Content analysis was applied to analyze the interview data. To analyze the quantitative data, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied. Results: Following the five teaching sessions, the participants’ experienced (a) an understanding of the value and challenges in individually tailored EBDM, (b) the ability to sort and select information, (c) being more cautious in reasoning and reaching conclusions, and (d) better interaction with clients. These categories were supported by significant increases in measures of self-efficacy and cognitive skills used in EBDM. Active, guided education and working with real clients were reported as powerful stimuli for learning. Conclusion: <b>Critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises</b> used in authentic health professional evidence-based decisions are promising methods for promoting EBDM...|$|E
40|$|Nationally, science major {{programs}} develop {{courses that}} consider the human {{impact on the}} variability and management of natural resources, relative to biodiversity and landscape physical components. Courses are grouped into minors and/or configured as a major&#x 2019;s track. Many of these courses incorporate service-learning and utilize the campus and surrounding university community as a field lab for exploring sustainability, conservation and resource management issues. For non-majors, sustainability may be the theme of first-year seminars taught by faculty from different disciplines, to engage students in <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises</b> in solving global environmental problems. Often sociologists, political scientists, historians and geographers are more involved in teaching these general education courses than ecologists.

40|$|There are chalenges {{within the}} {{delivery}} of Media Production degree courses that stem from a misalignment of student/employer expectations, and {{can be summed up}} thus: Most students attend Media Production courses to improve employment prospects within the industry and believe that this is best achieved by focusing on acquiring technical/practical expertise. As a result they are often reluctant to engage with broader aspects of education associated with critical thinking. Potential employers, however, are not overly concerned with new recruits having expertise of current technologies. Of equal, if not of more importance are ‘transferable’ skills, many of which are developed through <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises.</b> As a result, graduates from Media Production courses enter the work place believing they are sufficiently prepared for what is a very competitive industry, but, in reality, they lack the skills employers look for. Inevitably the academic reputation and credibility of these courses is progressively undermined, and graduate dissatisfaction increased. The process of creating media product, however, draws heavily on the same transferable skills most employers seek in new recruits. The proposition, then, is that increasing critical thinking elements within these courses will simultaneously enable students to perform better at subject level AND increase their employability, both within the media industry and beyond.

Learning objects allow the student to use the content learned in a particular part of a course and; 1. demonstrate mastery of the content, 2. apply that knowledge to solving a problem, and 3. use the content in a <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercise</b> that both demonstrates mastery and allows the student to place the content {{within the context of the}} larger topic of the course. The difficulty associated with the use of {{learning objects}} on a broad scale is that they require programming skills most professors and instructors do not possess. Learning objects also tend to be custom productions and are defined in terms of the programming and code terminology, further limiting the professor's ability to understand how they are created. Learning objects defined in terms of styles of learning and teaching allow professors and instructors to develop a deeper understanding of the learning objects and the design process. A set of learning objects has been created that are designed for some of the important styles of learning and teaching.

40|$|Critical {{thinking}} enjoys {{almost universal}} support, except {{when applied to}} controversial topics. Yet it is these topics that are often the most effective initiators of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises</b> that improve students’ rational approaches to challenging problems. The use of controversial issues to promote critical thinking requires an institutional commitment to academic freedom in order to survive. In some institutional contexts, the most crucial need for critical thinking is the very condition under which it is least likely to be applied. Instead, avoidance of controversy {{seems to be the}} predominant policy of institutions fearful of expensive lawsuits or damaging public relations. Several trends are decreasing the likelihood that critical thinking is applied in the classroom to challenging topics: demands for increased accountability from legislatures; scrutiny of adopted content standards; oversight of Internet and other intellectual work of professors affiliated with the universities; student challenges to faculty instruction; and attempts to curtail ideological diversity. This paper describes these current dynamics which erode academic freedom and thus the ability to apply critical thinking to controversial topics. The paper also recommends that institutions and faculty adopt clearly delineated policies related to academic freedom in order to ensure faculty freedom to promote critical thinking. Awareness of how these trends impact the instructional climate enables teachers to design instruction and be more proactive in guaranteeing that critical thinking about controversial topics is able to flourish under academic freedom...|$|E

A course titled, International Social Work, was taught using an online global classroom with students residing in their home countries of the USA, Hong Kong, South Africa, Mexico and Australia. The course was designed to introduce students to international social work and the theories and perspectives that underpin current thinking and practice in international social work. Students explored how historical, environmental, cultural, religious, political and economic factors impact social welfare policies and the delivery of human services in different regions of the world. Students engaged in critical thinking and analysis of global social welfare issues including poverty, child welfare, health, issues particular to women and the results of catastrophic events including conflict and natural disaster. Students and faculty participated weekly in blogs, a course "coffee shop", discussion boards, live online class lectures, and <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises.</b> Qualitative data was collected from the weekly blogs and discussion boards. Analysis of the data revealed that the online global course had a positive impact on the students' views toward international social work, an increase in their desire to address international issues in their professional goals, and an increase in networking with each other across countries. The use of technology presents both challenges and opportunities for global social work education and teaching across borders. The authors will discuss the logistical challenges as well as the outcomes of this international teaching collaboration...|$|E

40|$|Poster {{presented}} on June 4, 2009 at the 2009 International Association of Technological University Libraries (IATUL) conference, Leuven, Belgium (June 1 - 4, 2009) This poster focuses on University of Maryland librarians’ participation in an innovative, collaborative program where instruction extends beyond a typical library session, providing {{students with a}} quality learning experience {{over the course of}} four years. The program, called Gemstone, is an interdisciplinary honors research program and involves collaboration between librarians, faculty, program staff, and undergraduate students. During {{the first year of the}} program, the students attend classes that help them prepare for their research. After forming research teams, they spend the next three years designing and conducting a research project that focuses on the intersection of science and technology with society. This experience facilitates the development of research, teamwork, communication, and leadership skills, and culminates in the students’ defense of their thesis, orally and in writing, to a panel of experts. Librarians are involved in the first year of the program through a class called GEMS 100. The librarians teach a session of the class where they introduce research tools and lead the students in <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>exercises</b> to turn their potential topic ideas into research questions. During the remainder of the program, the librarians partner with a particular team. That partnership includes helping the students with research strategies on an informal basis, reviewing and critiquing proposals and presentations, and attending the Junior Colloquia and final Team Thesis Conference. The librarians and faculty mentors assigned to each group also meet several times a year to compare notes about improving the quality of assistance for the students' research efforts. By having librarians work closely with them throughout the research process, students further benefit from the advice, feedback, and expertise in research skills that the librarians provide. Thus, the librarians have the opportunity to provide quality, hands-on service over an extended period of time leading to an enriched learning experience...|$|E
40|$|My {{original}} contribution to knowledge consists in generating a new <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> framework {{that can be}} used to investigate the elements of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> in textbooks. The framework, however, can also be used as a guideline for teachers who are concerned with the development of learners’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills. <b>Critical</b> <b>thinking</b> has been included in an Indonesian government document as an educational objective; however, it is currently neglected and not seriously disseminated in schools. This study attempts to investigate to what extent <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> has been manifested in textbooks in Indonesia and to what extent Indonesian senior secondary school students are ready for the teaching of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills. To this end, the study investigates the elements of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> contained in Indonesian ELT textbooks and students’ responses to modified materials containing elements of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> Three methods are adopted: content analysis, qualitative analysis of students’ written responses, and interviews. Predetermined analytic categories are used to analyse nine Indonesian ELT textbooks used by senior secondary schools. The categories have been created as a result of evaluating, examining, and synthesising Bloom’s and Freeman’s <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> taxonomies, <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> strategies from empirical studies, <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> programmes created by <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> authorities and <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> tests. The findings of the content analysis show that the textbooks examined do contain a few elements of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> <b>Critical</b> <b>thinking</b> questions occupy 15. 81...|$|R
