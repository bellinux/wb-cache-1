40|$|The {{riparian}} rural <b>cutover</b> <b>lands</b> and backyards {{represent a}} sustainable alternative {{for the production}} of food and medicinal drugs to the traditional communities from the Amazon, especially with regard to products diversity and income generation. Considering the ecological and social functions of these spaces, this paper aims at analyzing the agrobiodiversity of these environments in the Boca Moa community, in the town of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil. Data collection was carried out through participative, formal, and inductive interviews following a semi-structured questionnaire with open questions, besides in loco visits. The rural <b>cutover</b> <b>lands</b> present many species at the same area, and manioc is the main product cultivated. The backyards have spatial arrangements of food species, with emphasis on fruits and vegetables, besides medicinal plants.

50|$|As {{the supply}} of virgin timber {{declined}} in the 1920s, the Dantzler Lumber Company gradually ended its use of railroad logging and began implementing reforestation on its <b>cutover</b> <b>lands.</b> By the early 1940s, the company had begun selectively cutting their timber to extend their reserve of larger trees.|$|R
50|$|Early in the 20th century, many timber {{companies}} had {{the philosophy of}} cut out and get out—a logging technique that removed all merchantable trees and left a barren landscape.

5000|$|In 1910, Hardtner {{was elected}} {{as the first}} state {{representative}} from the newly established La Salle Parish, carved from the hilly western half of Catahoula Parish. He pushed for various forestry and conservation bills but constantly ran into the problem {{of a lack of}} available funding. His Act 261 of 1910 established the first reforestation contracts, under which state and local governments assessed <b>cutover</b> <b>lands</b> at a lowered valuation for taxable purposes provided that timber was grown and maintained on the land. Hardtner was the first president of the La Salle Parish Police Jury, the equivalent of a county commission in other states, having served from 1908 to 1910 and 1912 to 1920. His two-year representative term extended from 1910 to 1912. He was a state senator from 1924 to 1928 and was earlier a delegate to the 1921 convention that rewrote the Louisiana Constitution, which included some basic provisions regarding forestry. Hardtner was defeated for renomination in the 1928 Democratic primary by future Governor Oscar K. Allen, a protégé of Huey Pierce Long, Jr. Allen, however, quickly left the state Senate to become chairman of the Louisiana Highway Commission, after the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that no one could hold executive and legislative offices simultaneously. He was hence succeeded in the upper chamber of the legislatured by fellow Democrat James L. Anderson. [...] In the 1900 general election, he ran on the William McKinley/Theodore Roosevelt ticket as a Republican for the United States House of Representatives, as Louisiana supported the Democrat William Jennings Bryan. He subsequently joined the majority Democrats in order to hold parish and state office, then practically excluded to Republican candidates. Hardtner polled 628 votes (9.2 percent) to Ransdell's 6,172 (90.8 percent). Hardtner was the last Republican even to seek the Fifth District House seat until 1976, when Frank Spooner, an oil and natural gas landman from Monroe, unsuccessfully challenged the Democratifc nominee, Jerry Huckaby. of Bienville Parish. In the Democratic primary, Huckaby had unseated veteran Representative Otto E. Passman of Monroe.|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{this growth}} {{was driven by}} logging. The S.M.&P. Railway was {{primarily}} a logging railroad, hauling logs out to sawmills at Stanley and Owen. When the timber was exhausted, little freight remained. Rail passengers also declined as roads improved. The S.M.&P. shut down in 1933.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1971 INTRODUCTION: A {{cooperative}} elk {{study program}} was initiated in 1956 {{to obtain information}} needed for effective management of Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti, Merriam) in the Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park region of northern California. Harn (1958), Bentley (1959), Harper (1961), and Stevens (1965) accumulated preliminary knowledge of the history, food habits, condition, movements, and abundance of Roosevelt elk in four Master's theses presented to Humboldt State College. With exception of the work by Stevens (1965), the above theses were later summarized in monograph form (Harper et al., 1967). Additional elk movement and range condition information was gathered by Logsdon (1965) and Franklin (1968), also presented in Master's theses to Humboldt State College. The present study {{is part of a}} cooperative program involving the Division of Natural Resources, Humboldt State College, Arcata, California; California Division of Beaches and Parks; Arcata Redwood Company; and the California Department of Fish and Game. Financing {{of the present study was}} made possible by the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Project. The present study was initiated to provide a better understanding of elk-forest management relationships in and adjacent to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Utilization of forage on these areas and the value of different ages of regrowth to Roosevelt elk were analyzed from June 1967 to June 1968. The major objectives of the study were: (1) To determine if the Kirsch area of Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park supported a vegetative complex and an elk population satisfactory for visitor observation. (2) To determine the forage present in different ages of re-growth following clear cutting of redwood forest areas. (3) To determine the impact of elk on forest regeneration of recent cutovers. A secondary objective was to determine the relationship of the surrounding <b>cutover</b> <b>lands</b> to the activities of the Boyes Prairie herd within Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Two different-aged redwood forest cutovers were chosen which had undergone extremely different management practices. One area was within Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park and had undergone secondary succession for 13 to 15 years without human interference. The second area was owned by Arcata Redwood Company and had undergone strict forest management practices for five to seven years...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a biological technique that successfully controls conifer seed damage by the deer mouse. Eleven experiments have been conducted on three study areas at the University of British Columbia Research Forest, Maple Ridge, B. C. Populations of deer mice have been monitored in all experiments with data from 56, 000 trap nights. The technique involves a mixture of conifer seed (Douglas fir) with sunflower seed and oats which is uniformly distributed on logged areas in the late winter-early spring. Survival of conifer seed with these alternate foods was excellent, compared with control Douglas fir by itself, for an 8 -week period during this time of year. Populations of seed-eating birds and chipmunks are not present on clearcut areas from late October to early April. In addition, deer mice are at their lowest density during the spring. Thus, the use of alternate foods with Douglas fir seed in a direct-seeding operation at the appropriate time of year will result in successful regeneration of <b>cutover</b> forest <b>lands...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Short-rotation {{hardwood}} plantations generally require repeated {{applications of}} nitrogen (N) fertilizer to maintain desired growth {{and are being}} installed on two previous land uses: agricultural fields and <b>cutover</b> forest <b>lands.</b> Because the soil organic matter chemistry is different between agricultural field and cutover soils, indices of N availability developed for one land use or the other may not work well across both land use types. The standard aerobic incubation index is time consuming and costly. Therefore, three rapid methods were tested for estimating it on six converted agricultural fields and seven cutover pine sites currently in intensively managed sweetgum plantations on the eastern coastal plain of the United States. Two procedures (anaerobic incubation and hot KCl extract) were not useful for estimating mineralizable N in either agricultural field soils or cutover pine soils. The third index, a 3 -day incubation of rewetted soils previously dried, was linearly correlated to mineralizable N (p, 0. 0001, R 2 0. 88). This method, which had not been tested in forest soils previously, worked best for the cutover soils (p, 0. 002, R 2 0. 82) and less so for the agricultural field soils (p, 0. 097, R 2 0. 66). However, none o...|$|R

40|$|For {{almost a}} half century now {{repeated}} failures in direct seeding operations on <b>cutover</b> forest <b>lands</b> in North America had been largely blamed on the unproven destruction of the seed supply by small mammals. In 1960, the Canadian Wildlife Service undertook a research project to ascertain the possible fate of white spruce seeds placed into the natural environment and the influence which small mammal populations may have upon such a seed supply. By equipping each seed with a microscopic radio-transmitter (radio isotopes), the seeds could {{be left in the}} field for up to one year and then recovered intact or as seed coat fragments to provide data on seed fate. Recovery success on 21, 800 white spruce seeds in ten years of study has been 90 %. Recoveries indicate near 50 % of spring sown seeds could be destroyed by small mammals within 17 weeks in some years despite the fact that these seeds had been previously treated with the widely accepted protective coating of aluminum powder-endrin-arasan- 1 atex. Late winter seeding reduced losses to small mammals by 2 / 3. No direct relationship between numbers of small mammals present and the number of seeds destroyed could be demonstrated. A critical examination of seed treatment procedures widely used has {{led to the development of}} a new seed coating formulation employing a potent rodent repellent, R- 55 - Under laboratory conditions, the new coating yielded improved germination and a high degree of protection against small mammals.

40|$|Abstract Montana 2 ̆ 7 s Lee Metcalf was an {{extraordinary}} Montana leader with an unbelievable record of accomplishment fighting for the little people {{against the forces of}} economic and political power. The public memory is so short that this film will serve to help reacquaint Lee 2 ̆ 6 Donna Metcalf to most of those who were around during their time. But it will also provide an opportunity for new generations to receive a perspective of an important leader from an important time. (Language from YouTube version of the film, written and provided by Executive Producer Evan Barrett) Lee Warren Metcalf (January 28, 1911 – January 12, 1978) was an American lawyer, judge, and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U. S. Representative (1953 – 1961) and a U. S. Senator (1961 – 1978) from Montana. He was permanent acting President pro tempore of the Senate, the only person to hold that position, from 1963 until his death in 1978. U. S. House of Representatives During his tenure in the House, Metcalf served on the Education and Labor Committee (1953 – 1959), Interior and Insular Affairs Committee (1955 – 1959), Select Astronautics and Space Exploration Committee (1958), and Ways and Means Committee (1959 – 1960). He became known as one of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Young Turks 2 ̆ 2 who promoted liberal domestic social legislation and reform of congressional procedures. He introduced legislation to provide health care to the elderly ten years before the creation of Medicare. He earned the nickname 2 ̆ 2 Mr. Education 2 ̆ 2 after sponsoring a comprehensive bill providing for federal aid to education. He also voted against legislation that would have raised grazing permits on federal lands, and led the opposition to {{a bill that would have}} swapped forested public <b>lands</b> for <b>cutover</b> private <b>lands.</b> He was elected chairman of the Democratic Study Group in 1959. U. S. Senate Regarded as 2 ̆ 2 a pioneer of the conservation movement 2 ̆ 2, Metcalf worked to protect the natural environment and regulate utilities. He helped pass the Wilderness Act of 1964, and supported the creation of the Great Bear Wilderness and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness. In 1962, he introduced a 2 ̆ 2 Save Our Streams 2 ̆ 2 bill to preserve natural recreation facilities and protect fish and wildlife from being destroyed by highway construction. He was a longtime member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. He was also active on the issue of education. He was a leading supporter of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the effort to extend the G. I. Bill 2 ̆ 7 s educational benefits to a new generation of veterans, and the development of legislation to improve federally-aided vocational education. [1] The Peace Corps was established under leadership of Metcalf and Senator Mansfield. In 1983, by act of Congress, the Lee Metcalf Wilderness area was created in southwestern Montana in honor of the late Congressman. The Great Bear Wilderness and Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness areas were also created as a result of Metcalf 2 ̆ 7 s efforts in Congress, in addition to the Lee Metcalf National Wildlife Refuge in Montana. Metcalf was ranked number 15 on a list of the 100 Most Influential Montanans of the Century by the Missoulian newspaper.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{landscape}} alteration is rather common in many protected areas (PAs), jeopardizing {{the efficacy of}} PAs conservation. However, the general consensus is that PAs still remain effective in habitat conservation. To assess the efficacy of landscape-level conservation, we examined {{landscape alteration}}s in the Changbai Mountain Biosphere Reserve (CMBR), which was established in 1960 as a "flagship" protected area in China. Based on analyses of high-resolution satellite images and data of forest inventory, field survey and interview, we developed two new indexes to assess the efficacy of landscape conservation, i. e. the quality index of protected landscape and the interference index of anthropogenic landscape. From 1993 to 2012, the quality index increased from 74. 48 to 75. 50, and the interference index decreased from 0. 49 to 0. 06, suggesting that {{the overall quality of}} protected landscape improved and the degree of anthropogenic interference decreased in CMBR. The increase in landscape quality was mainly due to the progressive vegetation recovery of previous <b>cutover</b> <b>land</b> in the windthrow area, the cease of the use of the cultivated land, and the amelioration of spatial pattern of protected landscape. We conclude that the current landscape conservation methods used in CMBR are effective, and the method we developed {{has the potential to be}} used to assess the efficacy of landscape-level conservation in nature reserves worldwide...|$|E
