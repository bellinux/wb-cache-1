These compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35mm focal length f/2.8 four-element, three-group Tessar-type Minotar/Minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm, a center positioned viewfinder, two stroke film winder lever and a film rewind knob. The Minox 35 <b>camera</b> <b>back</b> must be removed for loading or unloading film.|$|E

The Leaf DCBI (Digital <b>Camera</b> <b>Back</b> I), nicknamed [...] "The Brick", offered resolution of 4 megapixels (MP) in a 2048×2048 pixel format. The same CCD was used by Sinar in its equivalent sinarback. In 1994 Leaf introduced an improved model, the DCBII, which included a live-video view, and in 1998 they introduced the 6 MP Volare.|$|E

50|$|By 2006 CCD matrix <b>camera</b> <b>backs</b> of 39 megapixels were available. {{using the}} Kodak CCD and 33-megapixel Dalsa CCD in the Sinar 75 {{and in the}} Leaf Aptus 75 (6726×5040 pixels, with 7.2-micrometre-wide pixels). By 2008 several camera {{manufactures}} were developing larger <b>camera</b> <b>backs</b> based on the Kodak 50-megapixel CCD. Scanning backs are a narrower niche, used only for the highest-quality images with large-format cameras. Sinar continued their development of the step and repeat system of extending the CCD capabilities (macroscanning) with the arTec camera which creates a panoramic image with stitching technology.|$|R

50|$|With a PC lens, the <b>camera</b> <b>back</b> {{can be kept}} {{parallel}} to the subject while the lens is moved to achieve the desired positioning of the subject in the image area.

50|$|Unlike other medium-format DSLRs, which accept digital <b>camera</b> <b>backs</b> of {{different}} resolutions or even manufacturers, the 645D has a fixed-back design similar to smaller full-frame and APS-C DSLRs. The fixed back allows the 645D {{to be fully}} weather-sealed.|$|R

50|$|The Kodak DCS {{series of}} digital single-lens reflex cameras and digital <b>camera</b> <b>backs</b> were {{released}} by Kodak in the 1990s and 2000s, and discontinued in 2005.

50|$|Most earlier digital <b>camera</b> <b>backs</b> used {{linear array}} sensors, moving {{vertically}} to digitize the image. Many of them only capture grayscale images.
