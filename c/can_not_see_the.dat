6000|$|Of {{course we}} ascended {{to the summit}} of the dome, and of course we also went up into the gilt copper ball which is above it.--There was room there for a dozen persons, with a little crowding, and it was as close and hot as an oven. Some of those people who are so fond of writing their names in {{prominent}} places had been there before us--a million or two, I should think. From the dome of St. Peter's one can see every notable object in Rome, from the Castle of St. Angelo to the Coliseum. He can discern the seven hills upon which Rome is built. He can see the Tiber, and the locality of the bridge which Horatius kept [...] "in the brave days of old" [...] when Lars Porsena attempted to cross it with his invading host. He can see the spot where the Horatii and the Curatii fought their famous battle. He can see the broad green Campagna, stretching away toward the mountains, with its scattered arches and broken aqueducts of the olden time, so picturesque in their gray ruin, and so daintily festooned with vines. He can see the Alban Mountains, the Appenines, the Sabine Hills, and the blue Mediterranean. He can see a panorama that is varied, extensive, beautiful to the eye, and more illustrious in history than any other in Europe.--About his feet is spread the remnant of a city that once had a population of four million souls; and among its massed edifices stand the ruins of temples, columns, and triumphal arches that knew the Caesars, and the noonday of Roman splendor; and close by them, in unimpaired strength, is a drain of arched and heavy masonry that belonged to that older city which stood here before Romulus and Remus were born or Rome thought of. The Appian Way is here yet, and looking much as it did, perhaps, when the triumphal processions of the Emperors moved over it in other days bringing fettered princes from the confines of the earth. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> long array of chariots and mail-clad men laden with the spoils of conquest, but we can imagine the pageant, after a fashion. We look out upon many objects of interest from the dome of St. Peter's; and last of all, almost at our feet, our eyes rest upon the building which was once the Inquisition. How times changed, between the older ages and the new! Some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago, the ignorant men of Rome were wont to put Christians in the arena of the Coliseum yonder, and turn the wild beasts in upon them for a show. It was for a lesson as well. It was to teach the people to abhor and fear the new doctrine the followers of Christ were teaching. The beasts tore the victims limb from limb and made poor mangled corpses of them in the twinkling of an eye. But when the Christians came into power, when the holy Mother Church became mistress of the barbarians, she taught them the error of their ways by no such means. No, she put them in this pleasant Inquisition and pointed to the Blessed Redeemer, who was so gentle and so merciful toward all men, and they urged the barbarians to love him; and they did all they could to persuade them to love and honor him--first by twisting their thumbs out of joint with a screw; then by nipping their flesh with pincers--red-hot ones, because they are the most comfortable in cold weather; then by skinning them alive a little, and finally by roasting them in public. They always convinced those barbarians. The true religion, properly administered, as the good Mother Church used to administer it, is very, very soothing. It is wonderfully persuasive, also. There is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beasts and stirring up their finer feelings in an Inquisition. One is the system of degraded barbarians, the other of enlightened, civilized people. It is a great pity the playful Inquisition is no more.|$|E

50|$|With the {{original}} design of email protocol, the communication between email servers was plain text, which posed a huge security risk. Over the years, various mechanisms have been proposed to encrypt the communication between email servers. One {{of the most commonly}} used extension is STARTTLS. It is a TLS (SSL) layer over the plaintext communication, allowing email servers to upgrade their plaintext communication to encrypted communication. Assuming that the email servers on both the sender and the recipient side support encrypted communication, an eavesdropper snooping on the communication between the mail servers <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> email contents. Similar extensions exist for the communication between an email client and the email server.|$|E

50|$|A Barani (barani) flip is {{an aerial}} {{maneuver}} {{consisting of a}} front flip and a 180 degree turn (half twist). This trick is performed in number of sports including {{but not limited to}} dancing, gymnastics, cheerleading, trampoline, cliff diving, aggressive inline skating, and freerunning. A barani is an aerial somersault flip, used as a trick for flyers, dancers and snowboarders. It is used as an official move in gymnastics, tumbling, and freerunning. The 180 degree turn is carried out usually halfway through the frontflip. The reason why it is used in so many sports is that it converts a regular frontflip (during which one <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ground or water for the landing) into a move in which one turns in time so that {{the last half of the}} flip is done in the same way as a backflip (during which one can see the ground or water). It therefore allows for greater control of the landing.|$|E
5000|$|Good course {{designers}} {{will use}} the terrain to either help the inexperienced horse and rider at the lower levels to prepare for an obstacle, or to make an obstacle {{more difficult for the}} experienced competitors. For example, the designer may place a fence at the opening of a wooded area, resulting in a lighting difference between the takeoff and landing side. This requires careful riding and a confident horse. Designers may make an obstacle more difficult by placing it along the side of a steep hill, {{at the top of a}} mound (so the horse <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> landing until he is about to take off, testing bravery), or use the natural trees and ditches to force riders to take slightly more difficult lines to their fences. A good course designer will be able to incorporate the obstacles into the landscape so that they seem natural, yet still fairly test the horse and provide the horse an option to run-out if the rider makes a mistake. Most designers use accuracy fences, such as skinnies (fences with a narrow face) and corners, to make the rider's job more difficult, while still being very [...] "horse-friendly." ...|$|E
50|$|Users {{who wish}} to keep a low profile, can opt for the {{concealed}} display unit sold by Valentine Research directly on their website. Together with hard wiring the device to the vehicle fuse box (which eliminates the traditional power cord throughout the vehicle cabin) a stealth installation is achieved. The main unit still receives and process all signals, but the display is projected in the concealed display mounted discreetly anywhere in the vehicle interior. This helps, especially at night so others <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> readout other than the driver. Some users even elect to install a kill switch so they can shut off the device without accessing the main unit. There is also a remote audio kit available that allows connection to headphones or speaker and can turn the main unit on or off as well as having a button that functions like {{the one on the}} main unit.The newest feature that can be added to the V1 unit is the V1connection which works with all V1's, but its full capability is available only from V1s with ESP. (Check for the ESP logo on the front panel below the Control Knob.) On pre-ESP V1s, or when using a Pre-ESP Concealed Display or Remote Audio Adapter, your handheld will serve as a wireless remote display of all of V1's front-panel warnings, but other functions and screens are unavailable.|$|E
