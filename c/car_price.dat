2500|$|The Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (TILA) {{resulted}} in honest reporting of effective APRs {{for more than}} a decade. [...] Then in the 1980s, auto makers (and providers of some other durable goods) began to exploit a loophole in the Act and its implementing regulations. Since the Act does not precisely define [...] "Finance Charge" [...] or [...] "Total Sale Price" [...] (terms used in the TILA disclosures), auto makers found they could reduce Finance Charges and increase <b>car</b> <b>price</b> as much as they wanted, provided Total Sale Price was not changed. APRs calculated with the reduced, or eliminated, finance charge became the [...] "below market rate" [...] and [...] "Zero percent APR' loans that were commonly advertised for the next 30 years. [...] "Zero percent APR or $1,000 rebate" [...] is {{the most common form of}} these deceptive loans. [...] The [...] "rebate" [...] is the hidden finance charge, reclassified to <b>car</b> <b>price.</b> [...] If the consumer doesn't accept the [...] "zero percent loan," [...] then he or she does not accrue the extra $1,000 interest on that loan, and this $1,000 is represented as a [...] "rebate." [...] In reality, there is no rebate and no [...] "zero percent loan." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{estimates}} from the 2006 Collector <b>Car</b> <b>Price</b> Guide {{some of the}} desirable extras include the V8 engines, particularly the 390 and 401 versions, {{as well as the}} [...] "Go" [...] package, and special models including the [...] "Big Bad" [...] color versions. The 1971 through 1974 AMX versions also command higher prices, according to several collector price guides. The 1973 Trans Am Victory edition also adds a premium in several classic car appraisal listings, but the distinguishing decal was readily available and it has been added to many Javelins over the years.|$|E
2500|$|Mid year 1968 saw the {{official}} {{introduction of the}} California GS, and it is frequently known as a '69 model. Buick asked [...] "Why settle for less when the California GS, built especially for YOU, costs no more?" [...] Exclusively designed for Golden State motorists, Buick advertised the car nationally as a high performance family sports car at an economy <b>car</b> <b>price.</b> Though the car {{was not included in}} Buick's yearly catalog it was shown in a two-page black and white fold out brochure. Custom California GS emblems again graced the rear fenders while GS ornamentation could be found in the grille and sail panels. The drivetrain included Buick's new for '68 350-4 V8 with 10.25:1 compression and Rochester (GM) 4GC Quadrajet four-barrel (four-choke) carburetor, producing 280hp and 375lb·ft of torque. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 transmission (driving a 3.23:1 rear axle gear, designed for highway cruising) and bench seat interior were again the only choices. Buick also added chrome plated wheels and air cleaner lid to the two-door thin pillar coupe. Tires were [...] on [...] rims.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} is {{a critical}} and highly visible urban problem. In land scarce Singapore, the problem is even more crucial {{and the government has}} resorted to gargantuan measures not only to curb car use but also car ownership. Besides a plethora of road-use taxes, a unique tax structure on car ownership is employed that comprises hefty taxes on new car purchases plus provisions for tax discounts if new car purchases are accompanied by the scrappage of old cars. Consequently, a thriving scrap car market has evolved in which scrap <b>car</b> <b>prices</b> exceed even new <b>car</b> <b>prices</b> in some other countries. This paper constructs a theoretical model to explain the determination of the equilibrium scrap <b>car</b> <b>prices.</b> The equilibrium properties are subject to empirical tests. The paper also discusses the welfare implications of this unique policy scheme. ...|$|R
