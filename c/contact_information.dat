5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard {{was searching for}} a friend's <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> and the phone company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier to way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E

5|$|A {{weekend edition}} titled Super Sloppy Double Dare began taping in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, {{with an initial}} 26-episode run. Super Sloppy Double Dare {{featured}} gameplay {{identical to the original}} format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were designed to make a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged to send in a postcard with their <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> and could win a prize if their card was selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of Super Sloppy Double Dare were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV.|$|E
5|$|By September 3, 2009, {{attorneys}} representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, {{had requested}} that the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website delete the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that the domain registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection service for the website, and turn over <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. The registrar, NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain registrar, repeating their requests and noting that they had read the website's contents and were therefore aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by the registrar.|$|E

40|$|Haptic {{technologies}} {{enable a}} user to feel virtual/remote objects through {{the sense of}} touch. While force-feedback technology has matured over the last decade, tactile displays providing information at the skin are coming into the limelight due to the significance of tactile information in various manual tasks. This thesis investigates the effect of <b>contact</b> location <b>information</b> rendered with a tactile display on the perception of shape primitives and thus to provide design specifications in developing state-of-the-art tactile displays. A series of experiments were conducted to assess how <b>contact</b> location <b>information</b> affects human perception of virtual shape primitives. The results from the first study on edge sharpness perception indicated that <b>contact</b> location <b>information</b> alone could convey edge sharpness information. However, when it was presented together with force feedback, it was dominated by the force cues. In a second study, the perception of virtual curvature was matched {{to that of a}} real one and the relation between virtual and real curvatures was modeled. Finally, the role of <b>contact</b> location <b>information</b> in the perception of surface bumps during contour following was investigated. The results showed that the addition of <b>contact</b> location <b>information</b> to force feedback improved the participants 2 ̆ 7 ability to identify surface features due to the improved identification of small, as opposed to large, surface bumps. No improvement was observed for contour following. Overall, the results of this thesis reveals the extent to which <b>contact</b> location <b>information</b> plays a role in the perception of shape primitives, providing useful references for developing effective tactile displays. ...|$|R
5|$|Whitepages {{was founded}} in 1997 as a hobby for then-Stanford student Alex Algard. It was {{incorporated}} in 2000 and received $45 million in funding in 2005. Investors were later bought-out by Algard in 2013. From 2008 to 2013, Whitepages released several mobile apps, a re-design in 2009, the ability for consumers to control their <b>contact</b> <b>information,</b> and other features. From 2010 to 2016, the company shifted away from advertising revenue and began focusing more on selling business services and subscription products.|$|E
5|$|By September, Brooks {{was back}} at a work camp, this time in Svitavy in the Sudetenland. He escaped that month with five other men, this time making it to Lüneburg inside a coal train prior to his recapture. Sent to a {{prisoner}} of war camp near Wiener Neustadt, he once more tried to escape but failed, suffered a severe beating {{at the hands of the}} Germans, and was again sent back to Stalag VIII-B for two weeks of solitary confinement. Working as a truck helper from a saw mill in Toszek, he slowly acquired maps of Europe and the surrounding region as well as <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> for the Polish Underground State. Having escaped twice already, he risked transfer to a special punishment camp if caught again but, nevertheless, he fled his detention once more, this time with a Scottish soldier by the name of John Duncan, in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Unity Council {{incorporated}} a Montreal-based lobbying group called Option Canada with the mandate to promote federalism in Quebec. Option Canada received $1.6 million in {{funding from the}} Canadian Heritage Department in 1994, $3.35 million in 1995 and $1.1 million in 1996. The Montreal Gazette reported in March 1997 that the group also had other funds from undeclared sources. A Committee to Register Voters Outside Quebec was created to help citizens who had left Quebec before the 1995 vote register on the electoral list. The Committee handed out pamphlets during the referendum, including a form {{to be added to}} the list of voters. The pamphlet gave out a toll-free number as <b>contact</b> <b>information,</b> which was the same number as the one used by the Canadian Unity Council.|$|E

She knew {{she wanted to be}} a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children. As a teenager, Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked to be trained, but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time. Bret Hart, however, claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts. During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport. She later wrote to Mildred Burke, after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's <b>contact</b> <b>information,</b> and sent her a biography and photo. Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in Encino, California.|$|E
5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found <b>contact</b> <b>information</b> for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E
