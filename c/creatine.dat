5|$|Compounds {{that have}} failed to prevent or slow {{progression}} of Huntington's disease in human trials include remacemide, coenzyme Q10, riluzole, <b>creatine,</b> minocycline, ethyl-EPA, phenylbutyrate and dimebon.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{hypothyroidism}} {{are associated with}} mild elevations in <b>creatine</b> kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.|$|E
5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, <b>creatine),</b> calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. <b>Creatine</b> kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete <b>creatine,</b> rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|The swollen, {{inflamed}} muscle may directly compress {{structures in}} the same fascial compartment, causing compartment syndrome. The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, phosphate ions, the heme-containing protein myoglobin, the enzyme <b>creatine</b> kinase and uric acid (a breakdown product of purines from DNA) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate disseminated intravascular coagulation. High potassium levels may lead to potentially fatal disruptions in heart rhythm. Phosphate binds to calcium from the circulation, leading to low calcium levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Troponin is a {{sensitive}} biomarker {{for a heart}} with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken – one {{at the time of}} initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the left ventricle. These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of <b>creatine</b> kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated <b>creatine</b> kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} forms shoals or schools {{that tend to}} be larger during the winter and spring. Though fairly active, its {{swimming}} muscles exhibit lower activity of glycolytic enzymes and higher activity of <b>creatine</b> phosphokinase compared to the shallow-water spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), suggesting a lesser capacity for bursts of speed. The lipid-filled liver comprises about one-fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining neutral buoyancy. Potential predators of the black dogfish are larger sharks and bony fishes. It {{is one of several}} deep-sea sharks parasitized by the barnacle Anelasma squalicola, which attaches in front of the second dorsal fin and impairs the reproductive development of its host. Other known parasites of this species include the fluke Otodistomum cestoides, the copepods Neoalbionella fabricii and Neoalbionella centroscyllii, and the protozoans Haemogregarina delagei and Trypanosoma rajae.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatine</b> {{is sold in}} {{a variety}} of forms, {{including}} <b>creatine</b> monohydrate and <b>creatine</b> ethyl ester, amongst others. Though all types of <b>creatine</b> are sold for the same purposes, there are subtle differences between them, such as price and necessary dosage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatine</b> {{monohydrate}} {{is regarded}} as a necessity by most bodybuilders. <b>Creatine</b> monohydrate is the most cost-effective dietary supplement in terms of muscle size and strength gains. … There is no preferred <b>creatine</b> supplement, but it is believed that <b>creatine</b> works best when it is consumed with simple carbohydrates. This can be accomplished by mixing powdered <b>creatine</b> with grape juice, lemonade, or many high glycemic index drinks.|$|E
25|$|L-Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase catalyses the first, {{which is}} also the {{committed}} step in the formation of <b>creatine.</b> The second step of the process, producing the actual <b>creatine</b> molecule, occurs solely in the cytosol, where the second enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine:guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), is found. The <b>creatine</b> is then transported through the bloodstream and taken up through sodium-dependent <b>creatine</b> transporters by cells that require <b>creatine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2000, The American Journal of Human Genetics {{reported}} {{two female}} siblings, aged 4 and 6 years, {{with mental retardation}} and severe <b>creatine</b> deficiency in the brain. Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) catalyzes {{the first step of}} <b>creatine</b> synthesis, resulting in the formation of guanidinoacetate, which is a substrate for <b>creatine</b> formation. In two female siblings with mental retardation who had brain <b>creatine</b> deficiency that was reversible by means of oral <b>creatine</b> supplementation and had low urinary guanidinoacetate concentrations, AGAT deficiency was identified as a new genetic defect in <b>creatine</b> metabolism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatine</b> is {{an organic}} acid {{naturally}} {{occurring in the}} body that supplies energy to muscle cells for short bursts of energy (as required in lifting weights) via <b>creatine</b> phosphate replenishment of ATP. A number of scientific {{studies have shown that}} <b>creatine</b> can improve strength, energy, muscle mass, and recovery times. In addition, recent studies have also shown that <b>creatine</b> improves brain function. and reduces mental fatigue. Unlike steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs, <b>creatine</b> can be found naturally in many common foods such as herring, tuna, salmon, and beef.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatine</b> Kinase Test (CK-Test): {{measures}} the circulating {{blood levels of}} <b>creatine</b> kinase an enzyme found in the heart (CK-MB), brain (CK-BB) and skeletal muscle (CK-MM).|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that consumption of <b>creatine</b> with protein and carbohydrates can have a greater effect than <b>creatine</b> combined with either protein or carbohydrates alone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatine</b> {{increases}} what {{is known}} as cell volumization by drawing water into muscle cells, making them larger. This intracellular retention {{should not be confused with}} the common myth that <b>creatine</b> causes bloating (or intercellular water retention).|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatine</b> kinase (CPK) level: Increases in CPK levels {{indicate}} {{tissue damage}} associated with decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Substrates {{within the}} muscle {{generally}} serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glycogen and <b>creatine</b> phosphate. ATP binds to the myosin head and causes the ‘ratchetting’ {{that results in}} contraction according to the sliding filament model. <b>Creatine</b> phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose, used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular <b>creatine</b> stores are exhausted, producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct. Contrary to common belief, lactic acid accumulation doesn't actually cause the burning sensation we feel when we exhaust our oxygen and oxidative metabolism, but in actuality, lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce pyruvate in the liver, which {{is known as the}} Cori cycle.|$|E
25|$|MRPs {{can also}} contain other ingredients, such as <b>creatine</b> monohydrate, {{glutamine}} peptides, L-glutamine, calcium alpha-ketoglutarate, additional amino acids, lactoferrin, conjugated linoleic acid, and medium-chain triglycerides.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 he {{published}} {{the results of}} experiments regarding the importance of <b>creatine.</b> This line of research {{was inspired by the}} lactic acid hypotheses of muscular action at the time and before phosphagen was discovered.|$|E
25|$|Both MEF2 and cAMP {{response}} element (CRE) {{are essential}} for contraction-induced PGC-1α promoter activity. AMPK is required for increased PGC-1α expression in skeletal muscle in response to <b>creatine</b> depletion. LKB1 knockout mice show a decrease in PGC-1α, as well as mitochondrial proteins.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of tubular creatinine secretion. Creatinine is a metabolic byproduct of <b>creatine</b> breakdown. Accumulation of creatinine is associated with uremia, but the symptoms of creatinine accumulation are unknown, as they are hard to separate from other nitrogenous waste buildups.|$|E
25|$|Myopathy with {{elevation}} of <b>creatine</b> kinase (CK, aka CPK) and rhabdomyolysis {{are the most}} serious side effects, occurring rarely {{at a rate of}} 2.3 to 9.1 per 10,000 person-years among patients taking atorvastatin. As mentioned previously, atorvastatin should be discontinued immediately if this occurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of muscular dystrophy {{is based on}} the results of muscle biopsy, increased <b>creatine</b> phosphokinase (CpK3), electromyography, and genetic testing. A physical examination and the patient's medical history will help the doctor determine the type of muscular dystrophy. Specific muscle groups are affected by different types of muscular dystrophy.|$|E
25|$|Several {{molecules}} {{have been}} proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them has been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include antiapoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, <b>creatine),</b> calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein.|$|E
25|$|Microarray {{analysis}} from one report shows {{a significant decrease}} in myocardial arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) gene expression during the late-stage heart failure. This suggests that the reduced AGAT may correlate with loss of heart function. Increase of AGAT expression in the myocardium after heart failure due to increase in <b>creatine</b> synthesis was associated with favorable outcome.|$|E
25|$|Common (1–10% of patients): blurred vision, diplopia, {{increased}} {{appetite and}} subsequent weight gain, euphoria, confusion, vivid dreams, changes in libido (increase or decrease), irritability, ataxia, attention changes, feeling high, abnormal coordination, memory impairment, tremors, dysarthria, parasthesia, vertigo, dry mouth and constipation, vomiting and flatulence, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, peripheral edema, feeling {{the effects of}} drunkenness, abnormal walking, asthenia, nasopharyngitis, increased <b>creatine</b> kinase level.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creatine</b> and Uric acid {{levels are}} lower than normal, at least in women. Ex vivo CD4(+) T cells {{isolated}} from the circulation show a wrong TIM-3 (Immunoregulation) behavior, and relapses are associated with CD8(+) T Cells. There {{is a set of}} differentially expressed genes between MS and healthy subjects in peripheral blood T cells from clinically active MS patients. There are also differences between acute relapses and complete remissions. Platelets are known to have abnormal high levels.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} neuroimaging studies in BPD have {{reported}} findings of reductions in {{regions of the}} brain involved in the regulation of stress responses and emotion, affecting the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala, amongst other areas. A smaller {{number of studies have}} used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore changes in the concentrations of neurometabolites in certain brain regions of BPD patients, looking specifically at neurometabolites such as N-acetylaspartate, <b>creatine,</b> glutamate-related compounds, and choline-containing compounds.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{needed to}} perform short lasting, high {{intensity}} bursts of activity {{is derived from}} anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme <b>creatine</b> kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and <b>creatine.</b> This resource is short lasting because oxygen {{is required for the}} resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial <b>creatine</b> kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen phosphorylase into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic condition is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of hypoxia, but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{night before}} the 1999 UEFA Cup Final, a video tape was {{released}} which showed Cannavaro being injected with a substance. The substance {{was found to be}} neoton (phosphocreatine), which is used in cardiac surgery to protect the heart during periods of anoxia and stress. It is not on the banned substance list. This chemical is, in partnership with adenosine triphosphate (ATP), fundamental to the ability of the body to produce muscular energy. Phosphocreatine is formed naturally within the body, with over 95% of the compound stored within the muscle cells. The body also receives dietary <b>creatine</b> primarily through the consumption of meat. No action was ever taken regarding this incident.|$|E
25|$|The urate to {{creatinine}} (breakdown {{product of}} <b>creatine</b> phosphate in muscle) concentration ratio in urine is elevated. This {{is a good}} indicator of acid overproduction. For children under ten years of age with LNS, a urate to creatinine ratio above two is typically found. Twenty-four-hour urate excretion of more than 20mg/kg is also typical but is not diagnostic. Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration of >8mg/dL) is often present but not reliable enough for diagnosis. Activity of the HGPRT enzyme in cells from any type of tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts) that is less than 1.5% of normal enzyme activity confirms the diagnosis of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Molecular genetic studies of the HPRT gene mutations may confirm diagnosis, and are particularly helpful for subsequent 'carrier testing' in at-risk females such as close family relatives on the female side.|$|E
25|$|According to the WHO, {{all humans}} {{are exposed to}} some level of mercury. Factors that {{determine}} whether health effects occur and their severity include the type of mercury concerned (methylmercury and ethylmercury, commonly found in fish, being more serious than elemental mercury); the dose; the age or developmental stage of the person exposed (the foetus is most susceptible); the duration of exposure; and the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact). The universal standard for examining mercury toxicity is usually {{discussed in terms of}} the amount of mercury in the bloodstream for short-term exposure or the amount of mercury excreted in the urine relative to <b>creatine</b> for long-term mercury exposure. Elemental mercury (which is a component of amalgam) is absorbed very differently than methylmercury (which is found in fish). The exposure to mercury from amalgam restorations depends on the number and size of restorations, composition, chewing habits, food texture, grinding, brushing of teeth, and many other physiological factors.|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Independent, the {{journalist}} Chris Arnot {{noted that the}} Cambridge crew had used <b>creatine</b> supplements in order to attempt to enhance their performance. [...] Used extensively at the 1992 Olympics, by athletes including Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell, and given to horses and greyhounds, <b>creatine</b> was believed to provide legal energy-enhancing effects to the crew.|$|E
500|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{affecting}} horses {{may also}} occur in outbreaks; {{these have been}} reported in many European countries, and later in Canada, Australia, and the United States. It has been referred to as [...] "atypical myopathy" [...] or [...] "myoglobinuria of unknown etiology". No single cause has yet been found, but various mechanisms have been proposed, and a seasonal pattern has been observed. Very high <b>creatine</b> kinase levels are detected, and mortality from this condition is 89%.|$|E
