5000|$|At {{the start}} of World War I (1914-18) many {{teachers}} were mobilized and others supported the war effort, but later a strong pacifist movement developed among them.Marie and François Mayoux were hardline pacifists, opposed to the Union sacrée.Marie Mayoux called a pacifist meeting at the teachers' union office in June 1915.She wrote a [...] "Manifesto of the teachers union", dated 1 July 1915 and signed by {{the section of the}} Charente, the union of the Bouches-du-Rhône and activists of eleven departments.This {{was one of the first}} <b>collective</b> <b>statements</b> of opposition to the war by the teacher's federation.On 15 August 1915 a pacifist resolution was presented at the CGT's national congress at the initiative of Alphonse Merrheim and Albert Bourderon, signed by several militants of the federation of teacher's unions including Bouet, Fernand Loriot, Louis Lafosse, Marie Guillot, Marie Mayoux, Marthe Bigot and Hélène Brion.

40|$|Recent {{challenges}} {{to affirmative action}} practices in higher education have pressed college and university presidents to clarify and sometimes to legally defend the educational value of diversity. On the public front, they have made themselves available to the media (Lee Bollinger interviewed in Weiss, 2001) and written articles for periodicals and alumni magazines (Rudenstine, 1996). Even former presidents have joined in this effort by empirically docu-menting the value of affirmative action (Bowen & Bok, 1998). Some {{of the most prestigious}} and selective institutions in the nation have also issued <b>collective</b> <b>statements.</b> For example, the Association of American Universi-ties (AAU) purchased advertising space in the New York Times to issue a statement that emphasized the significance of racial diversity to the very concept of higher education. They cautioned that without diversity the quality and texture of education would be significantly diminished (AAU, 1997).

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 524 p. The dissertation compares the legal thought of four of the most active radical groups of the English Revolution [...] the Levellers, the Diggers, the Quakers, and the Fifth Monarchy Men. Analyzing the printed works of each group this study examines both legal theory and concrete criticisms and proposed reforms of the law. It attempts to show the relationship between each group's legal ideas and its political, social, and economic thought. In doing this, the dissertation reveals how law reform is also a good standard with which to measure more general similarities and differences within the mental worlds of the radicals. Many of the same reform demands appeared in the popular pamphlets and <b>collective</b> <b>statements</b> produced by each group. Yet, it is also demonstrated how different radicals took standard, accepted seventeenth-century legal and constitutional concepts and adapted them to their own needs and worldviews. By charting this creative adaptation, this dissertation touches upon broader themes concerning law and society in seventeenth-century England...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} {{intended}} to be read as a supplement to the article “Iraq and the Serious Consequences of Word Games: Language, Violence and Responsibility in the Security Council,” which was published in the German Law Journal in 2002. The date of publication of the 2002 article (1 November) was exactly one week before the Security Council voted on Resolution 1441 (8 November). Resolution 1441 subsequently became (and has remained) the site of interpretative debate {{on the question of whether}} states, notably the US and the UK, needed express authorization in a new (post-Resolution 1441) Security Council resolution in order for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 to have been lawful. As the original essay was able to take into account the evolution of negotiations only up to 28 October 2002, before going to press, the present essay continues the narrative by tracing the trajectory of Resolution 1441 ’s textual language from the provisions of the first US–UK draft (of October 21, 2002) to the final form that Security Council Resolution 1441 took when adopted on 8 November 2002. The article also digests, primarily by way of two charts, the positions taken by key States on the meaning of Resolution 1441 after its adoption. The focus is the explanation of vote by each of the 15 Security Council members as well as two <b>collective</b> <b>statements</b> by France and Russia, joined by China in one case and by Germany in the second case. As noted briefly in the article, the normative politics of word games identified in the original and the present German Law Journal article is relevant, inter alia, to any legal analysis that the UK Iraq Inquiry may carry out as part of its eventual report of the involvement of the UK in the war...|$|E
