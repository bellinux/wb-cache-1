5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} high price, wet tantalum electrolytic capacitors have few consumer applications. They {{are used in}} ruggedized industrial applications, such as in probes for oil exploration.

25|$|These {{electric}} circuits {{can also}} easily perform {{a wide variety}} of simulations. For example, voltage can simulate water pressure and electric current can simulate rate of flow in terms of cubic metres per second.

25|$|Combining {{different}} materials <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> desired stiffness, compliance, or damping {{in different}} areas better than can be accomplished with a single material. The combined materials are usually carbon fiber and a metal, either steel, aluminum, or titanium. One implementation of this approach includes a metal down tube and chain stays with carbon top tube, seat tube, and seat stays. Another is a metal main triangle and chain stays with just carbon seat stays.|$|E
25|$|Convertible {{bonds are}} safer than {{preferred}} or common shares for the investor. They provide asset protection, because {{the value of}} the convertible bond will only fall to {{the value of the}} bond floor: however in reality if stock price falls too much the credit spread will increase and the price of the bond will go below the bond floor. At the same time, convertible bonds <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> possibility of high equity-like returns.|$|E

Oenothea, {{who is also a}} sorceress, claims she <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> cure desired by Encolpius and begins cooking (134–135). While the women are temporarily absent, Encolpius is attacked by the temple's sacred geese and kills one of them. Oenothea is horrified, but Encolpius pacifies her with an offer of money (136–137).|$|E
25|$|For a given {{quantity}} of light, an {{incandescent light bulb}} produces more heat (and thus consumes more power) than a fluorescent lamp. In buildings where air conditioning is used, incandescent lamps' heat output increases load on the air conditioning system. While heat from lights will {{reduce the need for}} running a building's heating system, in general a heating system <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> same amount of heat at a lower cost than incandescent lights.|$|E
25|$|After mastectomy, {{surgical}} breast reconstruction with autogenous skin flaps {{and with}} breast implants can produce subtle deformities and deficiencies resultant from such global breast augmentation, thus the breast reconstruction is incomplete. In which case, fat graft injection <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> missing coverage and fullness, and might relax the breast capsule. The fat can be injected as either large grafts or as small grafts, as required to correct difficult axillary deficiencies, improper breast contour, visible implant edges, capsular contracture, and tissue damage consequent to radiation therapy.|$|E

25|$|Any dessin <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> surface it is {{embedded}} in with a structure as a Riemann surface. It is natural to ask which Riemann surfaces arise in this way. The answer is provided by Belyi's theorem, which states that the Riemann surfaces that can be described by dessins are precisely those that {{can be defined as}} algebraic curves over the field of algebraic numbers. The absolute Galois group transforms these particular curves into each other, and thereby also transforms the underlying dessins.|$|E
25|$|It was the Eastern Region's Motive Power officer, L.P. Parker, {{who made}} the case for a new design of {{powerful}} freight locomotive, able to shift heavy loads at fast speeds in round trips between distant destinations within the eight-hour shift of the footplate crew. Riddles took up the challenge, initially designing a 2-8-2 locomotive, but settled upon the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement for the increased traction and lower axle load that five coupled axles <b>can</b> <b>provide.</b> <b>The</b> resultant design {{became one of the most}} successful locomotive classes ever constructed in Britain.|$|E
25|$|C.S. Lewis, in Mere Christianity and elsewhere, {{raised the}} {{argument}} from desire. He posed that all natural desires {{have a natural}} object. One thirsts, and there exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other intangibles strongly implies {{the existence of such}} things, though they seem unobtainable on earth. He further posed that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a different life, necessarily governed by a God who <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> desired intangibles.|$|E

25|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the Uranian atmosphere, extending for thousands of kilometres, is the thermosphere/exosphere, which has a uniform temperature of around 800 to 850K. This is much higher than, for instance, the 420K observed in the thermosphere of Saturn. The heat sources necessary to sustain such high temperatures are not understood, since neither solar FUV/EUV radiation nor auroral activity <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> necessary energy. The weak cooling efficiency due to the depletion of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere may contribute to this phenomenon. In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere contains {{a large proportion of}} free hydrogen atoms, while helium is thought to be absent here, because it separates diffusively at lower altitudes.|$|E
25|$|Privatization {{works when}} the person who owns the {{property}} (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving {{the tragedy of the}} commons. Internalizing the externalities, in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.|$|E
25|$|When using linear regression, {{multiple}} {{data points}} are graphed and the points can be {{fitted with a}} linear regression equation, which will provide a slope. This slope <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> rate of soil respiration with the equation , where F is the rate of soil respiration, b is the slope, V is {{the volume of the}} chamber and A is the surface area of the soil covered by the chamber. It is important that the measurement is not allowed to run {{over a longer period of}} time as the increase in CO2 concentration in the chamber will also increase the concentration of CO2 in the porous top layer of the soil profile. This increase in concentration will cause an underestimation of soil respiration rate due to the additional CO2 being stored within the soil.|$|E
