50|$|In 1989-1990 and 1992-1993 Kuroń was a Minister of Labor and Social Policy. From 1989 to 2001 he was {{a member}} of the Polish Parliament. He belonged to the {{following}} parties: <b>Citizen</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> Club (OKP), Union of Democracy (UD), Union of Freedom (UW). In the 1995 elections Kuroń ran for the office of president of the Republic of Poland. With support of 9.2%, Kuroń came third.|$|R
50|$|This {{came to a}} head in {{the case}} of Sigurd Smebye, a {{meteorologist}} who insisted on using highly conservative riksmål terms in reporting the weather. This ended up on the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>floor,</b> where the minister had to assure the public that anyone was entitled to use his/her own dialect on the air. However, Smebye was effectively disallowed from performing on television and ended up suing and prevailing over NRK in a supreme court case.|$|R
25|$|A {{manifesto}} {{was proposed}} entitled An Agreement of the People, and at an open meeting in Putney the {{officers of the}} Army Council heard the argument from private soldiers for a transparent, democratic state, without corruption. Proposals included sovereignty for English <b>citizens,</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> seats distributed according to population rather than property ownership, religion made a free choice, equality before the law, conscription abolished and parliamentary elections held every year. While the ideas proved greatly influential, including inspiring much {{of the language of}} the United States Declaration of Independence, Oliver Cromwell would later have the Leveller leaders executed.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s Schäuble {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular {{politicians}} in Germany and there was constant speculation that he would replace Kohl as Chancellor, whose popularity was declining. In November 1991, Schäuble became the Christian Democrats' <b>parliamentary</b> <b>floor</b> leader, replacing 71-year-old Alfred Dregger, in a move that made him Kohl's likely heir-apparent. In 1997 Helmut Kohl stated that Schäuble was his desired candidate to succeed him, but he did not want to hand over power until 2002 when the European monetary union would be completed with the introduction of the euro. However, as the CDU/CSU lost the 1998 election, Schäuble never became Chancellor.|$|R

During the First Merkel cabinet (2005-2009), a Grand Coalition of CDU/CSU and SPD, he served as the Chief Parliamentary Secretary of the CDU/CSU Parliamentary group in the Bundestag until 2009. In this capacity, he worked closely with the SPD <b>parliamentary</b> <b>floor</b> manager Olaf Scholz to manage and defend the coalition government in parliament. He also served as member of the Parliamentary Control Panel, which provides parliamentary oversight of Germany’s intelligence services BND, MAD and BfV.|$|R
5000|$|The UPC {{reached a}} high {{at the end}} of 1964 when the leader of the DP in parliament, Basil Bataringaya crossed the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>floor</b> with 5 other MPs, leaving DP with only 9 seats. The DP MPs were not {{particularly}} happy that their leader Benedicto Kiwanuka's hostility towards the Kabaka that was hindering their chances of compromise with KY. The trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable. Obote’s charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him, and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda. The response from the Kabaka was mute - probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country. However, there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote. By the time Uganda had become independent, Buganda [...] "was a divided house with contending social and political forces" [...] There were however problems brewing inside the UPC. As its ranks swelled, the ethnic, religious, regional and personal interests began to shake the party. The party’s apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures. And by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>floor</b> from DP and KY.|$|R

The authors evaluate their hypotheses on legislative speechmaking by considering parliamentary debates in seven European democracies: Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. Assuming that MPs are concerned with policy-making, career advancement, and re-election, the book discusses various incentives to taking the floor, and elaborates {{on the role of}} gender and psychological incentives in speechmaking. The authors test our expectations on a novel dataset that covers information on the number of speeches held by MPs and on the ideological positions MPs adopted when delivering a speech...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Intravenous {{endotoxin}} {{has been}} shown to trigger a delayed pulmonary hypertensive response that varies widely in magnitude and duration among individ-ual broilers. It was proposed that this individual variabil-ity may reflect immunological differences acquired dur-ing previous respiratory challenges that might have sub-sequently altered the endotoxin-initiated biochemical cascade. In Experiment 1, we tested the hypothesis that, when compared with broilers reared in clean stainless steel cages (Cage group), broilers reared on <b>floor</b> litter (<b>Floor</b> <b>group)</b> should experience a greater respiratory challenge and therefore may consistently exhibit a more enhanced pulmonary hypertensive response to intrave-nous endotoxin. Birds in the Cage group were grown in stainless steel cages at a low density (72 birds/ 8 m 2 chamber), and fecal and dander materials were removed daily. Birds in the <b>Floor</b> <b>group</b> were reared on wood-shavings litter at a higher density (110 birds/ 8 m 2 cham-ber). Pulmonary and systemic mean arterial pressures and blood-gas values were evaluated prior to and follow-ing the intravenous administration of 1 mg Salmonell...|$|R
40|$|Few {{issues in}} swine {{production}} are {{as complex as}} floor space allowances. One method for pork producers to calculate floor space allowance (A) is to convert BW into a 2 -dimensional concept yielding an expression of A = k * BW 0. 667. Data on ADG, ADFI, and G:F were obtained from published peer-reviewed studies. Five data sets were created: A = grower-finisher pigs, fully slatted <b>floors,</b> and consistent <b>group</b> size; B = grower-finisher pigs and fully slatted <b>floors</b> (<b>group</b> size {{did not need to}} be consistent); C = grower-finisher pigs, partially slatted <b>floors,</b> and consistent <b>group</b> size; D = grower-finisher pigs, partially slatted <b>floors</b> (<b>group</b> size {{did not need to be}} consistent); and E = nursery pigs, fully slatted or woven wire <b>floors</b> (<b>group</b> size did not need to be consistent). Each data set was analyzed using a broken-line analysis and a linear regression. For the broken-line analyses, the critical k value, below which a decrease in ADG occurred, varied from 0. 0317 to 0. 0348. In all cases the effect of space allowance on ADG was significant (P < 0. 05). Using the linear analyses based on data with k values of 0. 10); however, none of the linear regressions explained a significant proportion of the variation in ADG. The slopes for the nonplateau portion of the broken-line analyses based on percent values varied among data sets. For every 0. 001 decrease in k (approximately 3 % of the critical k value), ADG decreased by 0. 56 to 1. 41 %, with an average value of 0. 98 % for the 5 %-based analyses. The use of an allometric approach to express space allowance and broken-line analysis to establish space requirements seem to be useful tools for pig production. The critical k value at which crowding becomes detrimental to the growth of the pig is similar in full- and partial-slat systems and in nursery and grower-finisher stages. The critical point for crowding determined in these analyses approximated current recommendations to ensure the welfare of pigs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} clarify the effect of two management systems (cages Vs floor system) on welfare status and economics of broiler chicks. Two commercial flocks each of about 12375 day old Hubbard broiler chicks of mixed sex were housed in two fully environmentally controlled pens (cage and floor pens) from 0 - 6 weeks of age. Welfare was assessed through bird's performance, behavior, fearfulness and Heterophil: lymphocyte ratio (HLR). Compared to cage reared <b>group,</b> <b>floor</b> reared broilers recorded significantly heavier final body weight, body weight gain, better feed conversion and lower mortalities throughout the whole rearing period (0 - 6 weeks). Behavioral data showed that, caged birds were more often standing and stereotyped drinking, however <b>floor</b> reared <b>group</b> showed more walking, feeding and pecking. Total prevalence of gait problems and (HLR) were significantly higher in cage than <b>floor</b> <b>group.</b> Economic analysis revealed that, rearing broilers on floor was more profitable than cage rearing system. Data obtained in this experiment suggested that the welfare status of broilers was compromised under cage conditions as indicated by impaired performance, increased mortalities, higher prevalence of leg problems, stereotyped behavior and higher (HLR). In conclusion, cages are not recommended as a management system for rearing broilers from both the economic and welfare points of view...|$|R
