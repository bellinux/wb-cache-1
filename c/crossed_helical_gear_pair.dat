However, these are costly and mechanically complex, since they require additional spur gear reducers in the loop. ISO directives document the use of crossed helical gear pairs as virtual gears for hypoids to calculate the sliding velocity since, the flank geometry at the mean point can be precisely represented. The use of such pairs can be a cost effective and simpler alternative for testing purposes. However, the validity of this analogy regarding contact mechanics and tribology for the full mesh cycle has not been investigated hitherto. In {{the current study a}} new method for calculating the sliding and rolling speed along the full path of contact of a hypoid gear pair is presented. Cutter kinematics are considered, for the accurate definition of the contact bodies. Using TCA, the load distribution on the tooth under quasi-static conditions and the sliding velocity are calculated for comparison purposes. By applying a selection algorithm, a single experimental <b>crossed</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> is chosen aiming to simulate the contact conditions of hypoid gears. Two test scenarios are studied using EHL film thickness equations and friction models for evaluating the power loss. The contact is an elongated ellipse with varying directions of the sliding and sum velocities, which are considered in the model. The kinematic equivalence shows good agreement while the tribological equivalence is achievable using a reduced input torque...|$|E

The objective of this work is to conduct a comparative study on <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> design and its performance based on various performance metrics through finite element as well as analytical approaches. The theoretical analysis for a single <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> system based on American Gear Manufacturing Association (AGMA) standards has been assessed in Matlab.

40|$|The gear {{contact stress}} {{problem has been}} a great point of {{interest}} for many years, but still an extensive research is required to understand the various parameters affecting this stress. Among such parameters, helix angle is one which has {{played a crucial role in}} variation of contact stress. Numerous studies have been carried out on spur gear for contact stress variation. Hence, the present work is an attempt to study the contact stresses among the <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pairs,</b> under static conditions, by using a 3 D finite element method. The <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> on which the analysis is carried are 0, 5, 15, 25 degree <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> sets.

The FE results have been further compared with the analytical calculations. The analytical calculations are based upon Hertz and AGMA equations, which are modified to include helix angle.
