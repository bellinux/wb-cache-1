30|$|Prosopis {{species have}} been {{introduced}} to many areas outside their native range to provide benefits to local communities. Several Prosopis species and their hybrids (hereafter “mesquite”) have, however, become naturalised and invasive and now generate substantial <b>costs.</b> <b>Management</b> options are limited because of the complex conflicts of interest regarding benefits and <b>costs.</b> <b>Management</b> policies and strategies must take account of such conflicts, but further insights are needed on the dimensions of uses and impacts before such information can be usefully applied.
