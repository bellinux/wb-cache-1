5|$|Earlier, {{the first}} {{recorded}} use {{of toilet paper}} was made in 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591), and in 851 an Arab Muslim traveler commented on how he believed the Tang era Chinese were not <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> cleanliness {{because they did not}} wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, {{they had to be}} <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka who had been a police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he had to be removed from his post.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{a cousin}} {{introduced}} Hu Die to Pan Yousheng (潘有声), a young employee of a Shanghai trading firm. Hu Die was <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> {{her personal life}} and their relationship progressed slowly until autumn 1935, when they announced their impending marriage. Their wedding {{was the most important}} social event in Shanghai of that year. Famous film stars served as bridesmaids and groomsmen, and child stars were their flower girls and page boys. Hu Die was ready to retire from the film industry, as was customary at the time after an actress' marriage, but with her husband's support, she signed a contract with Mingxing to make one film per year. She only made one more film under the new contract, before the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the hard-fought Battle of Shanghai completely destroyed Mingxing and other Shanghai studios in 1937.|$|E

25|$|However, other {{researchers}} have contested {{the claims of the}} media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects {{are much more likely to}} cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized. It also argues that one must be <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.|$|E
25|$|O'Brien, {{alarmed at}} the {{increased}} activity of Sinn Féin in 1915, predicted {{the danger of}} a potential republican eruption, culminating in the IRB 1916 Rebellion, in which however Sinn Féin were not involved. He was forced to cease publication of his Cork Free Press in 1916 soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press to be <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the Cork Free Press. It was suppressed after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the Frongoch internment camp.|$|E

25|$|This {{new version}} of Krypto has all the {{physical}} abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes {{a great deal of}} trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he wanted to go out and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the door with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit the scent of the dog's real master. Superman has {{gone to great lengths to}} train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to-eye.|$|E
