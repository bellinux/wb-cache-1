50|$|Souq Khan al-Nahhaseen or the <b>coopery</b> souq, {{built in}} 1539. It hosted the general {{consulate}} of Belgium during the 16th century. Nowadays, {{it is known}} for its traditional and modern shoe-trading shops with 84 stores.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries {{economic}} {{activities in the}} village included tanning, turnery and <b>coopery.</b> Local timber supplies provided raw materials for these industries, such as oak bark for tanning. Products such as tanned hides, bowls, ladles and cheese vats were sent for sale {{as far away as}} Bristol, and subsidiary trades evolved to support the village's population, which reached 600 in 1851.|$|E
50|$|The Cooperage {{is one of}} the {{locations}} of the Zaans Museum at the Zaanse Schans. The focus at the Cooperage is on the craft of <b>coopery,</b> or barrel making, circa 1960. The interior of the Cooperage came from the cooper's and barrel trading company S.R. Tiemstra & Sons from Oostzanerwerf in the north of Amsterdam. Upon his death, the last cooper - Jaap Tiemstra - bequeathed the entire cooperage and its contents to the Zaans Museum. The barrels produced served as packaging material for butter, milk, vinegar, oil, fish, fruit, vegetables, jenever (Dutch gin), rum, and all kinds of beer and wine.|$|E
50|$|By 1886, {{shipbuilding}} was surpassed by {{the lime}} business, which had twelve manufacturers employing 1,000 workers. Nevertheless, Rockland had {{three or more}} shipyards, a marine railway, five sail lofts and two boatbuilders. Other industries included three grain mills, two foundries, three carriage factories, six lumber mills, two machine shops, three <b>cooperies,</b> one tannery, four granite and marble works, two boot and shoe factories, and four printing offices. Fishing was also important. Fleets of Friendship Sloops sailed between the harbor and fishing grounds across Penobscot Bay.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the villages}} in the area were yeomen villages. The locals were working as lumberjacks and {{carpenters}} or hunters. In 1672, hospodar Radu Leon granted the land to the yeomen of Sibiciu. They {{took it as a}} common ownership and used it for shepherding, as in that area grasslands were insufficient. During the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu (late 17th, early 18th century), the ownership of the Buzău mountains was clearly established: five people were owning the land up until the Austrian Empire's border. One of the owners was Costache Sibiceanu, former yeoman who became a boyar. During the phanariote period, a Wallachian of Greek origin, by the name of Enache Persescu, acquired the lands of the local peasants who could not prove their inheritance. In the meantime, they became serfs on the Bâsca-Gura Teghii estate, so they could not raise cattle, so they took on <b>coopery,</b> selling barrels and casks in the Buzău and Mizil market towns; the traditional trade was kept until the 1940s, but became lost due to industrialization—many locals were hired at the Göetz lumber mills in Nehoiu.|$|E
40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to using wood in wine-making. Firstly, is focused on chemical composition of wood and its physical parametres, its individual components in particular. There are described types of woods mostly used in viticulture and its consecutive utilisation at <b>coopery.</b> An individual chapter {{is dedicated to}} <b>coopery</b> where are described: technological manufacturing of timber, burning out the barrels {{and its effect on}} the change of their chemical characteristics as well as analysing the barrels as means to wine fertilisation and wine ripening. There is also mentioned individually the barrique-type barrels and barrels for ageing of special (mostly fortified) wines. In this connection possible diseases and flaws of wines connected to ageing in wooden barrels are described. The following chapter focuses on using preparations replacing barrique barrels which also add oak and vanilla shades to wine such as wooden chippings, desks and oak bore dust. A special attention is paid to corks, their production, types and effect on wine while ageing in bottles. The end of this thesis dealt with using tannins extracted from timber which are recently becoming very popular...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} based upon a {{proboscidean}} collection made from the siwalike during the project survey of vertebrate fossils of West Pakistan, 1968 â€“ 71, sponsored by the University of the Punjab. During this period, whole of the pot war and the suthimalsyas were thoroughly investigated. As a result 25 species have been identified, of these, 11 species are new to science. These arel stegodon dhokewsnensis, S. sardhokensis. Gomphotherium G. intermedius. G. dialensis, synoonologhus seaborne, Tetralophodon buzdarensis, stegolophodon maluvalenals, Elephas irshadil, and E. Promaximus. Status and position of the Siwalik and some non Siwalik general and species has been reviewed and the following changes have been made. 1. Gomphotherium pendionis is excluded from gomphotherium and has been transferred to the genus synconelophus. 2. Synconelophus hasneti, which had been transferred to the genus Ansneus by chakravarti (1957), has been resurrected. 3. pentalophodon has been synonymies with the genus Ansncus and the species, pentalophodon sivalensis and P. falooneri have been incorporated as ansncus sivalensis and A. osborni nom. n. Respeotuveity. 4 primelophas has been synonymies with stegetetrabelodon. 5 Elephas plenifrens. This was synonymy with Elephas by Simpson (1945). Has been resurrected. 6 Elephas plenifrens. This was made a genetype of the genus Arohidiekedon by pohlig (1888), has been resurrected. 7 Elephas namadieus, which was made a gene type of the genus Palaeoloxodon by matsumoto (1924), has been resurrected. The following material is being described {{for the first time}} in the following species: 1. p 3 in Deinotherium pentspotsmiae. 2 Dp 4 in Deinetherium indieum. 3 DP 2. DP 3, upper incisor and m 3 in sysoonelophus ptyehedus. 4 M 3 in synconolophus corrugate. 5 M 1 and M 3 in ansnous omborni nom. n. Probable evolution, migration and extinction of the Siwalik forms have been disoussed. The salient features are: 1 stegodon originated in Asia probably in the Siwalik region. Stegodon bembifrens has been regarded as the most primitive species of the genus. 2 Gemphotherium angustidens is the most primitive species of the genus and G. <b>Coopery</b> has been regarded as its junior synonym. 3 Genus synconlolophus originated in the Siwalik region and migrated later on to other parts of Asia syncoolephus ptyohodus is the most primitives species of the genus. 4 Stegolophodon originated in the Siwalik region. It is absent in Europe and Africa. The hitherto referred material from Europe and Africa by Osborn (1942), patriarchy (1943, 1954), Bergenieuy and creosol (1955), Singer and Hooijer (1958) and Hooijer (1963) is referable to the family fliphsntidas. 5 Stegoterrabelodont stocks, which migrated to Asia, probably gave rise to platolophas and Elepha...|$|E
