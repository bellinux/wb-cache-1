From there the road traveled to the east along Main Street, where it <b>crossed</b> <b>a</b> branch rail line of the present-day CSX Transportation. and headed east out of town in Genesee County. After about , the highway crossed into Oakland County and followed Grange Hall Road south of Seven Lakes State Park. The road then turned south in the town of Holly along Saginaw Street. Near Bevins Lake, the street curved to the east around the end of the lake. The highway turned east on Maple Street and ran south of Simonson Lake as it continued eastward out of Holly. The road <b>crossed</b> <b>a</b> branch line of the present day Canadian National Railway in Springfield Township. The trunkline continued to the east and southeast through rural areas before terminating at US10 (Dixie Highway).|$|E

5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be <b>crossed</b> (<b>a</b> steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step.

Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he <b>crossed</b> <b>a</b> pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E

5|$|In {{the upper}} Vistula basin, where the Przeworsk culture {{settlements}} were still relatively dense {{in the first}} half of the 5th century, they are markedly absent during the second half of it. This is also the case in Silesia - the depopulation pattern began there earlier and the latest finds are dated around 400 AD. All of it agrees well with the information given by Procopius of Caesarea, according to whom the Heruli returning to Scandinavia from the Carpathian Basin in 512, heading towards the Varni tribe area in Germany, <b>crossed</b> <b>a</b> large region devoid of human settlements - presumably Silesia and Lusatia. Likewise there are no settlements found in Masovia and Podlasie beyond the early part of the 5th century. On the other hand, in central Poland and Greater Poland isolated remnants from the Roman era cultures continue to be located through the end of 5th and even into the earlier parts of the 6th century. Still further north, in Pomerania, such findings are actually quite numerous, including many cult coin deposit sites (Roman and then Byzantine golden solidi). That's where the Germanic groups lasted the longest (and kept up trade and other contacts with their brethren elsewhere).|$|E

5|$|Spanish {{forces were}} entrenched {{on the crest}} of two small hills, between which the road from Arroyo to Guayama ran. The Americans had <b>crossed</b> <b>a</b> stream in front of the hills when {{suddenly}} the Spanish opened fire. The Americans protected their position by the stream and increased their firepower as more reinforcements arrived. The outnumbered Spanish troops retreated to Guayama as the Americans made their advance on the hills. The firefight, which lasted half an hour, left three American wounded. When the 4th Ohio entered the town they discovered that the Spaniards had fled north and abandoned the city, ending the Battle of Guayama. General John Rutter Brooke used the Cautiño Residence (Casa Cautiño) by the town square in Guayama as his military headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Neither of {{the early}} designations— Highway 25 and Route 1 - was marked (signs posted by the California State Automobile Association used the Redwood Highway name), but in 1926 it became U.S. Route 199, a branch of US 99 from Grants Pass to US 101 in Crescent City. Oregon moved the Pacific Highway No. 1 from present OR 99 to I-5, which {{bypassed}} Grants Pass, in 1959, and the Redwood Highway No. 25 was extended north through downtown Grants Pass to I-5. A proposed branch on M Street to I-5 east of downtown was also included in Highway 25, but this {{was moved to the}} E and F Streets one-way pair in 1961. (I-5 here was built in the early 1960s, but US 99 remained on the old alignment.) On the California side of the state line, US 199 was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 and the State Scenic Highway System in 1963; in the 1964 renumbering the Route 1 designation was dropped, making Route 199 the legislative number. Although US 299 and US 399 became state routes in 1964, the shorter US 199, which <b>crossed</b> <b>a</b> state line, remained. US 99 has since become Oregon Route 99 through Grants Pass, and US 199 now ends at I-5. The spur east from downtown Grants Pass to I-5 was built {{at the same time as}} I-5, and in 1991 it was moved from E and F Streets to bypass downtown on the new Grants Pass Parkway.|$|E
5|$|The Quantock Hills {{are largely}} formed by rocks of the Devonian Period, which consist of sediments {{originally}} laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock. In the higher north western areas older Early Devonian rocks, known as Hangman Grits, predominate, {{and can be}} seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which were worked for road building. Further south there are newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, there is a limestone cave, which is the only one in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger rocks of the Triassic period, these are known as New Red Sandstone rocks which represent the deposits of large river systems that <b>crossed</b> <b>a</b> desert plain, and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was worked on the foreshore at Watchet. The scarp is to the west with a dip slope to the east. The west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on the east. The hill tops are open heathland with woods on the slopes.|$|E
