They argue that these are two options of an Article <b>Choice</b> <b>Parameter</b> offered by Universal Grammar, and that the Russian and Korean speakers fluctuate between them when they are acquiring English. In the present study it is shown that a similar pattern {{can be observed in}} L 2 speakers of English whose L 1 is Japanese (also a language that lacks articles) but not in speakers whose L 1 is Greek, a language with articles that encode definiteness like English. It is also shown that while group results for the Japanese speakers suggest fluctuation, individual results do not. It is argued that an account can be given of both cases which does not require appeal either to an Article <b>Choice</b> <b>Parameter</b> or to the concept of ‘fluctuation’. The alternative proposal made here is consistent with Universal Grammar, and follows from an organisation of the grammar where phonological exponents are separated from the lexical items manipulated by syntactic computations, as in Distributed Morphology. It is suggested that a descriptively adequate account which avoids a construction-specific parameter like the Article <b>Choice</b> <b>Parameter</b> and departure from the normal assumptions of UG represented by fluctuation should be preferred...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} article {{choice and}} parameter-setting in second language (L 2) acquisition. It argues, {{on the basis}} of L 2 -English elicitation and production data, that L 2 - learners have access to UG-based semantic distinctions governing article choice, but do not know which distinction is appropriate for English. A Fluctuation Hypothesis (FH) is proposed, according to which L 2 -learners fluctuate between different parameter settings until the input leads them to set the parameter to the target value. The thesis proposes that articles cross-linguistically may encode definiteness or specificity. The definition of specificity that is adopted is based on Fodor and Sag's (1982) view of specificity as speaker intent to refer. The behavior of referential this, a specificity marker in colloquial English, is examined, and it is proposed that the definition of specificity incorporates the concept of noteworthy property. An Article <b>Choice</b> <b>Parameter</b> is next proposed, which governs whether articles in a given language are distinguished {{on the basis of}} definiteness or on the basis of specificity. While English has the Definiteness setting of this parameter, it is suggested, on the basis of data from Mosel and Hovdhaugen (1992), that Samoan has the Specificity setting. It is hypothesized, in accordance with the FH, that L 2 -learners fluctuate between the two settings of the Article <b>Choice</b> <b>Parameter.</b> This hypothesis leads to the prediction that L 2 - English errors of article use should come in two types: overuse of the with specific indefinites and overuse of a with non-specific definites. These predictions are examined in a series of studies with adult speakers of Russian and Korean, two languages with no(cont.) articles. The empirical data confirm the predictions, and show that L 2 -English article choice is not random but reflects access to the two settings of the Article <b>Choice</b> <b>Parameter.</b> The same patterns of results are found for L-Russian and L-Korean speakers, and it is shown that the results are not attributable to LI-transfer. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that L 2 -learners have direct UG-access to semantic distinctions underlying article choice. The data also provide evidence for the existence of a specificity distinction which cross-cuts the definiteness distinction. bu Tania Ruth Ionin. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The problem of picking a good <b>choice</b> of <b>parameter</b> values for specific input sequences is called parameter advising.

Experiments with an implementation of this approximation algorithm on biological benchmarks, using various accuracy estimators from the literature, show it finds sets for advisors that are surprisingly close to optimal.

In this paper we further study the effectiveness of LA in adaptation of VF and CP. This time we try to adapt both VF and CP simultaneously using different models of learning automata: P-model, Q-model, and S-model.

Since a choice based on specificity exists neither in L 1 nor in L 2, Ionin (2003) hypothesizes that Universal Grammar (UG) can play a role in this choice. The present article shows that even if both L 1 and L 2 are article-based languages, L 2 learners fluctuate between a choice of articles based on definiteness or on specificity. Following Ionin, this could mean that such L 2 learners fluctuate because they still have access to UG.
