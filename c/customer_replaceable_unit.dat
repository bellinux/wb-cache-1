40|$|AbstractThe {{diagnosis}} of faults to <b>replaceable</b> <b>units</b> {{at the system}} or board level can be enhanced by selective insertion of serial scan shift registers as test points within or between the <b>replaceable</b> <b>units.</b> A systematic approach to the selection of locations for such test points in order to realize a target diagnostic resolution to the <b>replaceable</b> <b>unit</b> level is proposed. The approach {{is based on a}} combination of three models, a structural model for system interconnection and test signal propagation, a syndrome model for system diagnosability analusis, and a probabilistic model for module failure and syndrome occurrence. On the basis of these models, the average number of <b>replaceable</b> <b>units</b> which are projected to be identified as potentially faulty in a diagnosis is formulated as a single parameter diagnostic measure for a system. A test point placement algorithm is presented which makes use of this measure plus a secondary heuristic. The algorithm uses local optimization in the sense that test points are selected one at a time until the <b>replaceable</b> <b>unit</b> diagnosability target is met. The approach is particularly applicable to systems and boards using VLSI chips because of the high ratio of logic circuits to input-output pins and interchip interconnections...|$|R
