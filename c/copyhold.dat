5|$|Ruislip {{came under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the Metropolitan Police in 1845. By 1869, the police were renting a house in the High Street to serve as the local police station, the <b>copyhold</b> of which was purchased in 1873. A new station was built in The Oaks in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the East End {{is arguably}} conterminous with the Manor of Stepney. This manor {{was held by}} the Bishop of London, in {{compensation}} for his duties in maintaining and garrisoning the Tower of London. Further ecclesiastic holdings came about from the need to enclose the marshes and create flood defences along the Thames. Edward VI passed the land to the Wentworth family, and thence to their descendants, the Earls of Cleveland. The ecclesiastic system of <b>copyhold,</b> whereby land was leased to tenants for terms as short as seven years, prevailed throughout the manor. This severely limited scope for improvement {{of the land and}} new building until the estate was broken up in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The Act also {{extended}} the franchise. In county constituencies, {{in addition to}} forty-shilling freeholders, franchise rights were extended to owners of land in <b>copyhold</b> worth £10 and holders of long-term leases (more than sixty years) on land worth £10 and holders of medium-term leases (between twenty and sixty years) on land worth £50 and to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. In borough constituencies all male householders living in properties worth at least £10 a year were given {{the right to vote}} – a measure which introduced to all boroughs a standardised form of franchise for the first time. Existing borough electors retained a lifetime right to vote, however they had qualified, provided they were resident in the boroughs in which they were electors. In those boroughs which had freemen electors, voting rights were to be enjoyed by future freemen as well provided their freemanship was acquired through birth or apprenticeship and they too were resident.|$|E

Stations could either be located at <b>Copyhold</b> or Haywards Heath. There is a proposal that the line could be restored as third rail electrified, allowing operation of the society's electric stock.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} life Coningsby {{suffered}} many difficulties. He was a widower, without any male heir, and subject to innumerable lawsuits. For some severe reflections on Lord Harcourt, the Lord Chancellor, in connection with these legal worries, he was, as Swift notes in his diary, committed to the Tower of London on 27 February 1720. Coningsby's troubles in law arose from his purchase of the manors of Leominster and Marden. After elaborate investigations, he convinced himself that the lord's rights had in many instances been trespassed upon by the <b>copyhold</b> tenants. He caused ejectments to be brought against many persons for being in possession of estates as freehold which he claimed to be <b>copyhold,</b> and as these claims were resisted by the persons in possession, his last days were embittered by constant strife. His collections concerning Marden were printed in 1722–7 in a bulky tome, without any title-page, and with pagination of great irregularity, but were never published. When his right to the Marden property was disputed, all the copies of this work but a few were destroyed. Through his sharpness of temper he was exposed to the caustic sallies of Atterbury in the House of Lords, and to the satires of Swift and Pope in their writings.|$|E

25|$|The {{merits of}} the Uckfield-Lewes closure were debated on several {{occasions}} in Parliament following closure. In particular, it was argued that the line would have provided a valuable alternative route to the Brighton Main Line when that line was out of action, {{as was the case}} on 16 December 1972 when a collision between two passenger trains at <b>Copyhold</b> Junction closed the line for over a month. Lord Teviot referred to this incident when calling for the reinstatement of the line in the House of Lords on 20 May 1974. It was estimated that costs of reinstatement would be in the region of £2 million, together with an additional revenue subsidy of £170,000 per year.|$|E
25|$|These {{legislative}} measures proved largely inefficient at {{regulating the}} market, but the government's repressive measures to enforce them caused public resentment. These conditions were contributing factors to the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The revolt started in Kent and Essex in late May, {{and once the}} rebels reached London they burnt down John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace, and killed both the Chancellor and the Treasurer. They then demanded the complete abolition of serfdom, and were not pacified until the young King Richard II personally intervened. The rebellion was eventually suppressed, but the social changes it promoted were already irreversible. By around 1400 serfdom was virtually extinct in England, replaced by the form of tenure called <b>copyhold.</b>|$|E

This {{stewardship}} {{was first}} used for parliamentary purposes in November 1763 by Edward Southwell, and was in more or less constant use until 1840, after which it disappeared. This manor comprised <b>copyholds,</b> the usual courts were held, and the stewardship was an actual and active office. The manor was sold by public auction in 1823, but in some manner the Crown retained the right of appointing a steward for seventeen years afterwards.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the late}} 14th to 18th centuries, yeomen were farmers who owned land (freehold, {{leasehold}} or <b>copyhold).</b> Their wealth {{and the size}} of their landholding varied. Sir Anthony Richard Wagner, Garter Principal King of Arms, wrote that [...] "a Yeoman would not normally have less than 100 acres" [...] (40 hectares) [...] "and in social status is one step down from the Landed gentry, but above, say, a husbandman". [...] Often it was hard to distinguish minor landed gentry from the wealthier yeomen, and wealthier husbandmen from the poorer yeomen.|$|E
2500|$|An Ottoman diplomat, Aristarchi Bey, {{recounted in}} June 1861 that [...] "the prince Stirbey" [...] and other [...] "leading boyars" [...] were {{fostering}} [...] "agitation {{in favor of}} a foreign prince"; this move, he suspected, had Russian backing. Together, Știrbei, Alexandru C. Moruzi and Manolache Costache Epureanu pushed the Assembly into a deadlock, filibustering over Cuza's attempt to introduce a <b>copyhold</b> (embatic), set aside for landless peasants and supplied from the monastery land reserve. During those moths, he drew close to the conservative club formed by Apostol Arsache, maintaining only loose contacts with the Catargiu faction—they differed on foreign policy issues, with Știrbei favoring an anti-Ottoman stance that Catargiu thought excessive. In July, Știrbei and Catargiu, who was by then the Prime Minister of Romania, reviewed with alarm a meeting of the left-wing liberals on Filaret Hill, which had demanded increased political representation. Știrbei was described as a covert reactionary by the liberal doyen, C. A. Rosetti, but he protested against the label; a polemic ensued.|$|E
2500|$|The present chapel {{was founded}} by Robert Chatfeild [...] of nearby Streat, who was born and baptised in Ditchling in 1675. [...] In 1730, he took <b>copyhold</b> tenure of the land next to the 1672 cottage off East End Lane. [...] Some sources suggest he built the chapel on {{to the side of}} the house in 1740, but his will of 24 February 1734 {{indicated}} that it already existed by then, and William Evershed preached there in 1736. [...] (Evershed, an important figure in Sussex Nonconformism, later founded Billingshurst Unitarian Chapel). [...] Chatfeild's son, Robert junior, acquired the freehold of the land in 1740; he passed it to the trustees of the chapel, who were said in 1901 to have [...] "a singularly open trust deed ... when the number of trustees are reduced to five they are required to choose 12 more to act with them, the property to be applied to such charitable uses as [...] think most proper".|$|E

He had antiquarian tastes, and communicated papers on trial by ordeal and {{on the site of}} Kenwith Castle, Devonshire, to the Society of Antiquaries of London, through his friend Henry Wansey. He prepared the third edition of A Treatise on <b>Copyholds</b> (London, 1821, 2 vols.) by Charles Watkins, and the fifth edition of the work on Tenures (London, 1824) of Sir Geoffrey Gilbert.|$|R
5000|$|The {{estate was}} once again passed to various noble {{families}} until 1667, when Charles II granted it to Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton. He was followed successively by his son and grandson, but by the mid 18th century {{it was back in}} royal hands, being held successively by Prince William Henry (up to 1805) and Prince Frederick (until 1827). Subsequently, the manor was deemed [...] "not important to be kept", and the <b>copyholds</b> of the manor, which included estates in Minstead, Burley, Bartley and Poulner, either became enfranchised or passed to the Crown.|$|R

50|$|Encroachment on the heath {{apparently}} {{began in}} the earlier 17th century when cottages began to be illegally erected on both the Bergholt Hall manor and Cooks Hall manor wastes. By the mid 18th century many encroachments were sanctioned {{as long as they}} were registered in the manor courts. Although a few 18th-century intakes were large additions to existing freeholds or <b>copyholds,</b> many were occupied by small cottages or shops; other encroachments included one for a barn, another for a brick kiln, and a third for a house, but most were small and the heath was still largely unenclosed in 1777.|$|R
50|$|Orehoved was {{probably}} established around the 14th century at a clearing in the forest. There is {{nothing left of}} the old village which in 1509 consisted of just four <b>copyholds.</b> There was little success with farming, prompting a comment in the accounts of 1662 stating that {{there were only two}} fields with very poor soil. In 1766, the village became the property of Hvededal Farm but returned to the State in 1793. The farmers became independent landowners in the 1850s but the State kept the forests which were sold to Johannes Wilhjelm in 1869. Wilhjelm built a new manor called Orenæsgård in 1869 but it was torn down in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Also {{survivals}} {{of medieval}} manor farming practice, {{these are the}} zones of grassland reserved for the commoners of the township - those who held the <b>copyholds</b> (or later freeholds) of the dozen or more farms within the parish. Each was allowed to graze {{a certain number of}} bullocks, cows or sheep upon the commons between spring and late autumn. By the 18th century, this regulation of the manor court was being abused, and various unauthorised villagers let their animals onto the grounds to feed. In 1895 an Act of Parliament finally set up a regulatory body known as the West Tilbury Common Conservators, allows the proper use of the several parts of the Commons.|$|R

In a Chancery case starting in 1739 elderly residents testified that boats still sailed up to Titchfield in their lifetimes and only ceased to do so when the heirs of the Earl built a barrier across the river. Although they are imprecise as to date their evidence does bracket the 1670s for the final closure. Also, presentments in the Titchfield Manorial Court in 1676 show that the Lord of the Manor by cutting the New River [...] "hath taken away and doth detain" [...] parts of the <b>copyholds</b> of two tenants, John Cooper and John Landy, implying that at that time the construction of the New River was recent.|$|R
60|$|The {{encounter}} with the carriages having sprung upon Winterborne's mind the image of Mrs. Charmond, his thoughts by a natural channel went from her {{to the fact that}} several cottages and other houses in the two Hintocks, now his own, would fall into her possession in the event of South's death. He marvelled what people could have been thinking about in the past to invent such precarious tenures as these; still more, what could have induced his ancestors at Hintock, and other village people, to exchange their old <b>copyholds</b> for life-leases. But having naturally succeeded to these properties through his father, he had done his best to keep them in order, though he was much struck with his father's negligence in not insuring South's life.|$|R

Winterborne {{sat down on the}} bed and looked them over. They were ordinary leases for three lives, which a member of the South family, some fifty years before this time, had accepted of the lord of the manor in lieu of certain <b>copyholds</b> and other rights, in consideration of having the dilapidated houses rebuilt by said lord. They had come into his father's possession chiefly through his mother, who was a South.|$|R
