5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter <b>clasping</b> multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral <b>clasping</b> organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|Heaven is {{represented}} by an entrance to the Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach <b>clasping</b> their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.|$|E
25|$|Three <b>clasps</b> were instituted {{to be worn}} on {{the medal}} ribbon, the North Africa 1942–43 <b>Clasp,</b> the 8th Army <b>Clasp</b> and the 1st Army <b>Clasp.</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of stress distributions within circumferential <b>clasp</b> arms with various tapers, was undertaken {{in an effort}} to (1) determine the area of maximum stress concentration in both tapered and non-tapered <b>clasps,</b> and (2) to compare this point of maximum stress concentration with the area of frequent <b>clasp</b> breakage. The non-tapered <b>clasp</b> showed better distribution of stresses than the tapered <b>clasps.</b> The less favourable stress concentrations could result in eventual failure of the <b>clasp</b> when coupled with other factors such as porosities. The maximum shear stresses in the non-tapered <b>clasp</b> also were lower than those in the tapered <b>clasps.</b> As the taper of the <b>clasp</b> became more accentuated, the magnitude of the stresses increased and shifted towards the tip of the <b>clasp.</b> The maximum tensile stress calculated in a replica of a chromium–cobalt–nickel <b>clasp</b> was in the order of 34 MN/m 2 which is well below the ultimate tensile strength of the alloy. This observation leads to the proposal that failure of <b>clasps</b> is a function not only of design but also of other variables, such as porosities, surface irregularities, and fatigue...|$|R
5|$|Keep {{design in}} England {{began to change}} only {{towards the end of}} the 12th century, later than in France. Wooden keeps on mottes ceased to be built across most of England by the 1150s, {{although}} they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Welsh Marches. By the end of the 12th century, England and Ireland saw a handful of innovative angular or polygonal keeps built, including the keep at Orford Castle, with three rectangular, <b>clasping</b> towers built out from the high, circular central tower; the cross-shaped keep of Trim Castle and the famous polygonal design at Conisborough. Despite these new designs, square keeps remained popular across much of England and, as late as the 1170s, square Norman great keeps were being built at Newcastle. Circular keep designs similar to those in France really became popular in Britain in the Welsh Marches and Scotland for only a short period during the early 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has {{a pair of}} <b>clasping</b> organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm {{make their way to}} a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
5|$|Their dactyli are {{powerful}} and curved into a scimitar-like shape. The second pair of gnathopods are densely covered in hair-like setae {{while the first}} pair only has setae on the posterior margins. The third and fourth pereopods are absent. In their place are two pairs of elongated oval gills arising from {{the third and fourth}} pereonites, respectively. In mature females, two brood pouches also develop in the third and fourth pereonites. These are formed by oostegites – platelike expansions from the basal segments (coxae) of the appendages. The fifth to seventh pereopods function as <b>clasping</b> appendages. They all have propodi with two spines on their inside margins. The seventh pair of pereopods are the longest of the three pairs, followed by the sixth pereopod pair and the fifth pereopod pair.|$|E

25|$|The RPI {{design was}} made for <b>clasping</b> a {{bilateral}} free end extension. These clasps are unique {{because they have to}} take into account extra torque force due to being tissue borne (and not tooth borne) at the posterior.|$|E
25|$|A figure {{holding a}} large horn {{to his lips}} and <b>clasping</b> a sword on his hip appears on a stone cross from the Isle of Man. Some {{scholars}} have theorized that this figure is a depiction of Heimdallr with Gjallarhorn.|$|E

40|$|<b>CLASPs</b> {{are widely}} conserved {{microtubule}} plus-end–tracking proteins with essential {{roles in the}} local regulation of microtubule dynamics. In yeast, Drosophila, and Xenopus, a single <b>CLASP</b> orthologue is present, which is required for mitotic spindle assembly by regulating microtubule dynamics at the kinetochore. In mammals, however, only <b>CLASP</b> 1 has been directly implicated in cell division, despite {{the existence of a}} second paralogue, <b>CLASP</b> 2, whose mitotic roles remain unknown. Here, we show that <b>CLASP</b> 2 localization at kinetochores, centrosomes, and spindle throughout mitosis is remarkably similar to <b>CLASP</b> 1, both showing fast microtubule-independent turnover rates. Strikingly, primary fibroblasts from <b>Clasp</b> 2 knockout mice show numerous spindle and chromosome segregation defects that can be partially rescued by ectopic expression of <b>Clasp</b> 1 or <b>Clasp</b> 2. Moreover, chromosome segregation rates during anaphase A and B are slower in <b>Clasp</b> 2 knockout cells, which is consistent with a role of <b>CLASP</b> 2 in the regulation of kinetochore and spindle function. Noteworthy, cell viability/proliferation and spindle checkpoint function were not impaired in <b>Clasp</b> 2 knockout cells, but the fidelity of mitosis was strongly compromised, leading to severe chromosomal instability in adult cells. Together, our data support that the partial redundancy of <b>CLASPs</b> during mitosis acts as a possible mechanism to prevent aneuploidy in mammals...|$|R

25|$|Some limbless animals, such as leeches, have {{suction cups}} on {{either end of}} their body, which allow them to move by {{anchoring}} the rear end and then moving forward the front end, which is then anchored and then the back end is pulled in, and so on. This is known as two-anchor movement. A legged animal, the inchworm, also moves like this, <b>clasping</b> with appendages {{at either end of}} its body.|$|E
25|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, {{religious}} activities {{were carried out}} at the free chapel of Saint Blaise, constructed within the Sutton manor grounds. In the late 1200s, the town constructed its own parish church, the first incumbent of which was ordained in 1305. This later became Holy Trinity Church, and the only remaining features of the original church survive below the east window, where <b>clasping</b> buttresses are visible, a method of construction from the mid-13th century.|$|E
25|$|On {{the crest}} sits an Australian wedge-tailed eagle, {{perched on a}} {{parchment}} scroll and <b>clasping</b> an escallop shell. The wedge-tailed eagle (aquila audax), being such a well-known Australian bird that is found across the continent, was selected to symbolise La Trobe as an Australian university. One might also note that the wedge-tail is the largest Australian bird of prey, which may reflect the founder's early aspirations of La Trobe being a large and prominent university within Australia.|$|E
5000|$|A State <b>clasp</b> {{was awarded}} for service within that state, when no Battle <b>clasp</b> {{was awarded to}} the {{recipient}} for a specific action within the same state. A Queen's South Africa Medal could therefore not carry both a State <b>clasp</b> and a Battle <b>clasp</b> for actions within the same state. The same rule applied to the [...] "RHODESIA" [...] <b>clasp,</b> which was not awarded along with the [...] "RELIEF OF MAFEKING" [...] <b>clasp.</b> The [...] "CAPE COLONY" [...] and [...] "NATAL" [...] <b>clasps</b> were not awarded together, {{with the exception of}} Private Wingell, a Royal Marine attached to the Army.|$|R

25|$|Dentures (also {{known as}} false teeth) are {{prosthetic}} devices constructed to replace missing teeth; they {{are supported by}} the surrounding soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity. Conventional dentures are removable (removable partial denture or complete denture). However, there are many denture designs, some which rely on bonding or <b>clasping</b> onto teeth or dental implants (fixed prosthodontics). There are two main categories of dentures, the distinction being whether {{they are used to}} replace missing teeth on the mandibular arch or on the maxillary arch.|$|E
25|$|The final slab of the Heraklean Amazonomachy, BM 535, is {{separated}} physically from the preceding three, being the single Amazonomachy slab {{on the east}} side. lt also {{is separated}} temporally from the others in that it depicts a moment late in the conflict when the outcome {{is no longer in}} doubt. Thus it follows the pattern of the last scene of the Trojan Amazonomachy, marking the conclusion of the action and commenting on it. The tide of battle, distinctly on the Amazons' side along the south, has now turned against them. Here, BM 535:3, the last of the Amazons is depicted <b>clasping</b> to an altar as she is prised away by a Greek, BM 535:4.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} occurs {{through the}} clustered or scattered deposition of spermatophores by male adults. Stimulation of spermatophore deposition by female pheromones {{has been demonstrated}} in Sinella curviseta. Mating behaviour {{can be observed in}} Symphypleona. Among Symphypleona, males of some Sminthuridae use a <b>clasping</b> organ located on their antenna. Many collembolan species, mostly those living in deeper soil horizons, are parthenogenetic, which favours reproduction to the detriment of genetic diversity and thereby to population tolerance of environmental hazards. Parthenogenesis (also called thelytoky) is under the control of symbiotic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia, which live, reproduce and are carried in female reproductive organs and eggs of Collembola. Feminizing Wolbachia species are widespread in arthropods and nematodes, where they co-evolved with most of their lineages.|$|E
50|$|The Cadet Recruiter Ribbon {{is given}} to cadets who recruit two or more people (cadets or senior members) into the Civil Air Patrol. For each {{additional}} two members recruited, a bronze <b>clasp</b> may be worn on the ribbon. Once a cadet earns five bronze <b>clasps,</b> they may be replaced with a silver <b>clasp.</b> Bronze <b>clasps</b> are no longer worn after a silver <b>clasp</b> is received. For every ten new cadets recruited after this, an additional silver <b>clasp</b> may be worn on the ribbon.|$|R
50|$|Good conduct loops {{are worn}} on a <b>clasp</b> {{attached}} to the service ribbon and suspension ribbon of the Good Conduct Medal. A Good Conduct Loop comprises a <b>clasp</b> with several inscribed loops. The second award of a Good Conduct Medal would display a bronze <b>clasp</b> with two loops, the third would show a bronze <b>clasp</b> with three loops, and so on. At six loops, the <b>clasp</b> changes to silver, and then at eleven loops the <b>clasp</b> changes to gold. Thus, a silver <b>clasp</b> with two loops would denote the seventh award of the Good Conduct Medal while a gold <b>clasp</b> with five loops would indicate the fifteenth award of the Good Conduct Medal, which is the highest that the regulations list.|$|R
40|$|Orthodontic {{appliances}} {{are used}} {{for the treatment of}} malocclusions of a tooth or group of teeth. These appliances is retained in oral cavity with the help of its integral component known as <b>Clasp</b> which engages the undercuts of teeth for retention. There are generally two types of orthodontic appliances, Removal and Fixed type. Here we are dealing with “Removable” type of orthodontic appliance which can be removed for cleaning purpose by the patient or for re-adjustment by the orthodontist. In removal type of Orthodontic appliances stresses is induced in the <b>Clasp</b> either due to removal or insertion of appliance as well as during mastication, which may leads to deformation and fracture of the <b>Clasp</b> earlier. Therefore, achieving <b>clasp</b> designs producing less stress is very important. The present wok is focused on stress analysis of two types of <b>Clasps</b> 1) Adams and 2) Punch <b>Clasp.</b> Adams <b>clasp</b> is more commonly used for retention of these appliances. With some modification a new type of <b>Clasp</b> is made known as Punch <b>Clasp.</b> Comparative study of these <b>clasps</b> shows that under the similar loading condition stress induces in Punch <b>Clasp</b> is less than stress induces in Adams <b>Clasp.</b> We employed Reverse Engineering approach to develop the CAD models of the <b>Clasp</b> and Stress analysis is done using Finite Element analysis software ANSYS...|$|R
25|$|The south aisle {{is early}} 14th century. It is {{supported}} by twin-stepped <b>clasping</b> buttresses at the south-east and south-west corners, and an angle buttress on the south side. A moulded string course runs at the eaves, and a plinth just below the window line. There are five windows: one at the east end; one at the west end; and three at the south with two of these at the west separated by the church porch. The east window is of concave chamfered intersecting 'Y' tracery, creating three lights set within a chamfered pointed arch with hood mould. The west window is similar, but narrower, and of two lights. The south wall windows are identical: rectangular chamfered openings within which are three lights with cusped ogee heads. The parapet is of a coping set above a repeated c.17th-century cusped fretwork device.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} of dressing up in character {{continued into the}} following centuries. One of the photographic series by Julia Margaret Cameron, a pupil of the painter George Frederic Watts, was of mythical characters, for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models. Young Kate Keown sat for the head of “Circe” in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character’s use of wine to bring a change in personality. The society portrait photographer Yevonde Middleton, also known as Madame Yevonde, was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball {{as the foundation for}} her own series of mythological portraits in colour. Its participants were invited to her studio afterwards to pose in their costumes. There Baroness Dacre is pictured as Circe with a leafy headdress about golden ringlets and <b>clasping</b> a large Baroque porcelain goblet.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{millennium}} BCE writing tablets were in use in Mesopotamia as well as Syria and Palestine. A carved stone panel dating to between 640-615 BCE that was excavated from the South-West Palace of the Assyrian ruler Sennacherib, at Nineveh in Iraq (British Museum, ME 124955) depicts two figures, one clearly <b>clasping</b> a scroll and the other bearing what {{is thought to be}} an open diptych. Berthe van Regemorter identified a similar figure in the Neo-Hittite Stela of Tarhunpiyas (Musée du Louvre, AO 1922.), dating to the late 8th century BCE, who is seen holding what may be a form of tablature with a unique button closure. Writing tablets of ivory were found in the ruins of Sargon's palace in Nimrud. Margaret Howard surmised that these tablets might have once been connected together using an ingenious hinging system with cut pieces of leather resembling the letter “H” inserted into slots along the edges to form a concertina structure.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{retentive}} forces of cast cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) and commercially pure titanium (cpTi) <b>clasps.</b> A <b>clasp</b> assembly comprising a pair of symmetrical <b>clasps</b> was made to fit the opposite halves of a hardened stainless-steel sphere. This twin <b>clasp</b> was designed to counterbalance the tipping forces when the <b>clasp</b> assembly was drawn from the sphere. A total of 120 <b>clasp</b> assemblies were fabricated in cast Co-Cr and cpTi and placed at undercut depths of 0. 25 mm, 0. 50 mm, and 0. 75 mm (n = 20 for each). For Co-Cr <b>clasps,</b> the retentive forces at these undercuts depths were 2. 34 ± 0. 23 N, 4. 65 ± 0. 35 N, and 7. 56 ± 0. 50 N, respectively. The corresponding retentive forces for cpTi <b>clasps</b> were 1. 24 ± 0. 13 N, 2. 34 ± 0. 23 N, and 3. 70 ± 0. 27 N.
