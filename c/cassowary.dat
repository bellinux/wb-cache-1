5|$|Miri Crocodile Farm cum Mini Zoo {{is located}} near the Baram Delta. It houses 1,000 estuarine {{crocodiles}} including Malayan gharial crocodiles. Man-made sanctuary pools are also constructed for the crocodiles. Other animals {{can also be found}} here such as <b>cassowary,</b> sun bears, python, monkeys and porcupines. Visitors are allowed to feed the animals with bananas available from the canteen.|$|E
5|$|The crests of Corythosaurus {{resemble}} {{that of a}} <b>cassowary,</b> or a Corinthian helmet. They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The two halves of the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with other}} <b>cassowaries,</b> it is a shy and solitary bird. Their diet {{consists}} mainly of fruits [...] and small animals. They make grunting and hissing sounds, like other <b>cassowaries.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hand {{feeding of}} <b>cassowaries</b> poses a big {{threat to their}} survival, because it lures them into {{suburban}} areas. There, the birds {{are more susceptible to}} vehicles and dogs. Contact with humans encourages <b>cassowaries</b> to take food from picnic tables. Feral pigs are a huge problem. They destroy nests and eggs but their worst effect is as competitors for food, which could be catastrophic for the <b>cassowaries</b> during lean times.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cassowaries</b> have three-toed {{feet with}} sharp claws. The second toe, the inner {{one in the}} medial position, sports a dagger-like claw that can be 125 mm long. [...] This claw is {{particularly}} fearsome since <b>cassowaries</b> sometimes kick humans and animals with their enormously powerful legs. <b>Cassowaries</b> can run at up to 50 km/h through the dense forest and can jump up to 1.5 m. They are good swimmers, crossing wide rivers and swimming in the sea.|$|R
5|$|This large kiwi {{is one of}} five {{species of}} kiwis {{residing}} in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), Okarito brown kiwi (Apteryx rowi), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii), and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). Great spotted kiwis are related most closely to the little spotted kiwi. The kiwi genus, Apteryx, is endemic to New Zealand, 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic. Kiwis are placed in the ratite family, which also includes the emu, ostrich, rhea, and <b>cassowary.</b> All ratites are flightless. Kiwi are closely related to the extinct moa bird that once inhabited New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing {{the last section}} of the tail, {{and part of the}} forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the <b>cassowary</b> and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the <b>cassowary</b> and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cassowaries</b> feed {{mainly on}} fruit, {{although}} all species are truly omnivorous {{and will take}} a range of other plant food, including shoots and grass seeds, in addition to fungi, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. <b>Cassowaries</b> are very shy, but when provoked {{they are capable of}} inflicting injuries, occasionally fatal, to dogs and people.|$|R
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from <b>cassowary</b> droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E
5|$|The double-eyed fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma) {{eats the}} fruit of Ficus obliqua, {{steadily}} depositing fruity detritus on the ground. The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) is another parrot that consumes the fruit and disperses the seeds; other Australian bird species include the southern <b>cassowary</b> (Casuarius casuarius), brown cuckoo-dove (Macropygia phasianella), rose-crowned fruit dove (Ptilinopus regina), wompoo fruit dove (P. magnificus), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia melanoleuca), topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), black-faced cuckoo-shrike (Coracina novaehollandae), olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii). The tree is an important food source for the western Polynesian species the many-coloured fruit dove (Ptilinopus perousii) and crimson-crowned fruit dove (P. porphyraceus), and has been recommended for amenity planting in Tonga for these birds. The spectacled flying fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) and grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) also eat the fruit.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{skeleton}} in Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze, which it obtained from France in 1833, but was mislabelled as a <b>cassowary</b> until correctly identified by Italian zoologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1900. Several elements of this skeleton are missing, and some have been replaced with wooden copies. Its right metatarsus was damaged during life and had healed incorrectly. It {{was thought to be}} a male, but is now known to be a composite of two individuals. A fourth specimen was thought to be kept in the Liverpool Museum, but it may simply be a juvenile mainland emu. Apart from the King Island emu specimens brought to France, a few are also known to have been brought to mainland Australia in 1803, but their fate is unknown.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{birds in}} New Guinea are the flightless cassowaries, of which all three species are native to New Guinea. Two of these species: the {{southern}} <b>cassowary</b> (Casuarius casuarius) {{and the northern}} <b>cassowary</b> (Casuarius unappendiculatus) reach heights of 1.8 metres (6ft). The southern <b>cassowary</b> is also native to northern Australia. The <b>cassowary</b> {{is one of the}} world's most dangerous birds, for it is capable of inflicting fatal injuries with its powerful legs and the dagger-like claw on its inner toe. It is known to have killed humans.|$|E

25|$|The zoo has also, in the past, {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} criticism for keeping single and unpaired specimens of rare species like the banteng, great Indian one-horned rhinoceros, crowned crane and the lion-tailed macaque. Lack of breeding and exchange programs has led to the elimination of individuals and populations of environmentally vulnerable species like the southern <b>cassowary,</b> wild yak, giant eland, slow loris and echidna.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{entrance}} to the zoo is the Main Lake which has two islands. One is home to a group of black-and-white ruffed lemurs and the other to a family of Javan gibbons. Next to the Main Lake and opposite the cafe are exhibits which are home to the southern <b>cassowary</b> and the Goodfellow's tree kangaroo. It also includes Australian pelicans that move around in the waters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cassowaries</b> feed on {{the fruit}} of several hundred {{rainforest}} species and usually pass viable seeds in large dense scats. They are known to disperse seeds over distances greater than a kilometre, and thus {{play an important role}} in the ecosystem.
