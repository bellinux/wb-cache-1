The study focused on the integrated assessment of an engineered pond system of 8 million liters per day capacity {{in the city of}} Karnal, the State of Haryana, northern India. Major areas during the assessment included health, environmental, societal and institutional views aspects as well as the quality of treated effluent subjected for reuse. The treatment facility met the Indian regulatory standards (downstream reuse and discharge into the legally permitted water bodies) in terms of physical-chemical parameters. The total coliform and faecal coliform removal were up to 2 - 3 log units; nevertheless, it was not capable to come across the bacterial <b>count</b> <b>requirement</b> (< 1, 000 per 100 mL to minimise human health risk in aquaculture practices).

The additional benefit from the facility for the farmers included the saving of fertilizers and cheapest source of water available for irrigation. Recycling of treated sewages for irrigation is also returned nutrients to the surrounding farms in Karnal. This exercise has saved significant quantities of chemical fertilizer (26 - 41 Ton of nitrogen, 10 - 18 Ton of phosphorous and 38 - 58 Ton of potassium per year) and the overall benefit for farmers during cultivation of one acre of crop was calculated to be approximately $ 133 per year...|$|E

It is evident that instruction <b>count</b> <b>requirements</b> of the key sorting algorithms are well understood. However, the cost of executing a sorting algorithm is influenced by factors apart from instruction count such as cache miss and page faults as well. There exist studies of sorting algorithms from memory hierarchy perspective, but these studies are stale and losing relevance in the context of modern computer architecture. We have experimented with Quicksort, Merge sort, and Heapsort to assess their respective performances in memory hierarchy of modern computing environments. Inferences derived from the outcome of the experiments have been presented in this paper. Empirical evidence confirms that Quicksort is still an excellent algorithm from memory hierarchy point of view. Also, it has been inferred that Merge sort is poor on large records because its page fault count is too high. Heapsort was found competitive enough to be considered as an algorithm of choice on large records in the view of its lower page fault count...|$|R

The quality of treated wastewater from different types of NTSs was analyzed for various physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters, and needs for post-treatment were identified. Currently, about 1838 million liters per day (MLD) of wastewater is being treated using NTSs, of which the contributions of polishing ponds, waste stabilization ponds, duckweed ponds, constructed wetlands, and Karnal technology {{were found to be}} 53. 39, 45. 15, 0. 13, 0. 55, and 0. 78 %, respectively. Among the NTSs studied, constructed wetland was found most efficient in removal of pollutants including nitrogen, phosphorus, total coliform, and fecal coliform in the range of 76, 61, 99. 956, and 99. 923 %, respectively. Of all types of NTSs, only constructed wetland was found to meet the total coliform <b>count</b> <b>requirements</b> (< 1000 per 100 ml).

The chlorination was the only post-treatment, which is being practiced at only three wastewater treatment facilities. During post-treatment, 1 - 2 ppm of chlorine is applied to the secondary effluent irrespective of its quality.

40|$|At rest, hippocampal “place cells,” neurons with {{receptive}} fields {{corresponding to}} specific spatial locations, reactivate {{in a manner}} that reflects recently traveled trajectories. These “replay” events have been proposed as a mechanism underlying memory consolidation, or the transfer of a memory representation from the hippocampus to neocortical regions associated with the original sensory experience. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that hippocampal replay of a particular experience should be accompanied by simultaneous reactivation of corresponding representations in the neocortex and in the entorhinal cortex, the primary interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex. Recent studies have reported that coordinated replay may occur between hippocampal place cells and medial entorhinal cortex grid cells, cells with multiple spatial receptive fields. Assessing replay in grid cells is problematic, however, as the cells exhibit regularly spaced spatial receptive fields in all environments and, therefore, coordinated replay between place cells and grid cells may be detected by chance. In the present report, we adapted analytical approaches utilized in recent studies of grid cell and place cell replay {{to determine the extent to}} which coordinated replay is spuriously detected between grid cells and place cells recorded from separate rats. For a subset of the employed analytical methods, coordinated replay was detected spuriously in a significant proportion of cases in which place cell replay events were randomly matched with grid cell firing epochs of equal duration. More rigorous replay evaluation procedures and minimum spike <b>count</b> <b>requirements</b> greatly reduced the amount of spurious findings. These results provide insights into aspects of place cell and grid cell activity during rest that contribute to false detection of coordinated replay. The results further emphasize the need for careful controls and rigorous methods when testing the hypothesis that place cells and grid cells exhibit coordinated replay...|$|R
40|$|The radiotracer {{methodology}} was {{combined with}} the Hoagland solution culture of growing soybean in a greenhouse to investigate the absorptions of phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na) {{as a function of}} salinity. Salt stress was varied by using zero to 120 mM NaCl. The research was initiated because of a need to increase soybean production in the saline soils of the semi-arid regions of the world. Although P absorption increased with time at each concentration of NaCl, increasing its concentrations ([NaCl]) to 120 mM reduced P uptake considerably. The addition of inorganic P (Pi) to the salt medium improved P absorption significantly (P < 0. 0001) in stem, petiole, and roots. Polynomial regressions showed the relationship between 22 Na activity and [NaCl] for leaves and petiole to be cubic (R 2 = 1) while in the stem a quadratic relationship prevailed. A maximum of P and Na absorption was observed at 40 mM NaCl. The relationship between 32 P activity and increasing [NaCl] was linear for the roots (a positive slope) and the stem (a negative slope). 45 Ca and 32 P dual labelling part of the experiments failed to produce results because an unexpectedly high degree of tissue quenching which prevented from obtaining the minimum <b>counting</b> <b>requirements</b> for separation.

40|$|In {{spite of}} growing {{importance}} of AES, the Data Encryption Standard {{is by no}} means obsolete. DES has never been broken from the practical point of view. The triple DES is believed very secure, is widely used, especially in the financial sector, and should remain so for many many years to come. In addition, some doubts have been risen whether its replacement AES is secure, given the extreme level of “algebraic vulnerability ” of the AES S-boxes (their low I/O degree and exceptionally large number of quadratic I/O equations). Is DES secure {{from the point of view}} of algebraic cryptanalysis, a new very fast-growing area of research? We do not really hope to break it, but just to advance the field of cryptanalysis. At a first glance, DES seems to be a very poor target — as there is (apparently) no strong algebraic structure of any kind in DES. However in [14] it was shown that “small ” S-boxes always have a low I/O degree (cubic for DES as we show below). In addition, due to their low gate <b>count</b> <b>requirements,</b> by introducing additional variables, we can always get an extremely sparse system of quadratic equations. To assess the algebraic vulnerabilities is the easy part, that may appear unproductive. In this paper we demonstrate that in this way, several interesting attacks on a real-life “industrial ” block cipher can be found. One of our attack is the fastest known algebraic attack on 6 rounds of DES. Yet, it requires only one single known plaintext (instead of a very large quantity) which is quite interesting in itself. Though (on a PC) we recover the key for only six rounds, in a much weaker sense we can also attack 12 rounds of DES. These results are very interesting because DES is known to be a very robust cipher, and our methods are very generic. They can be applied to DES with modified S-boxes and potentially other reduced-round block ciphers...|$|R
