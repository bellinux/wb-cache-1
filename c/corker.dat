The <b>Corker</b> campaign countered that an article published on March 5, 2003 in the Chattanooga Times Free Press publicly identified Corker's ownership interest in the land, through Osborne Enterprises, and that as mayor, a blind trust barred <b>Corker</b> from being involved in issues like these that affected his business.|$|E

2500|$|In {{very simple}} cases, {{knitting}} {{can be done}} without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles, knitting machines or rigid frames. [...] Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called stocking frames, knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting knobbies, knitting nancies, or <b>corkers).</b> [...] There is also a technique called knooking of knitting with a crochet hook that has a cord attached to the end, to hold the stitches while they're being worked.

2500|$|In 1968 Travers {{returned}} to playwriting {{with a new}} farce, <b>Corker's</b> End, which was produced at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford. The Times commented, [...] "Some of his jokes, which always tended to be outrageous, are perhaps a little more outspoken {{than they used to}} be, but nothing essential has changed. Those who care for farce will enjoy themselves for exactly that reason." [...] In 1970 BBC television broadcast seven Travers plays: Rookery Nook, A Cuckoo in the Nest, Turkey Time, A Cup of Kindness, Plunder, Dirty Work and She Follows Me About. At the age of 83 Travers rewrote the plays for the BBC to concentrate on plot twists and verbal misunderstandings, rather than the high-speed action and split-second timing that characterised the original stage versions.|$|R

5000|$|A {{treatise}} Roman Catholick Principles {{in reference}} to God and the King ran to dozens of editions and caused a controversy among English Catholics in the nineteenth century, {{over the issue of}} the accuracy with which it represented Catholic doctrine. It first appeared as a small pamphlet in 1680, and at least two other editions of it were published in that year. It is reprinted in Staffords Memoires. Six editions of the Principles were published before 1684, and six were published by Goter in 1684-6 {{at the end of his}} Papist misrepresented and represented. William Coppinger gave at least twelve editions of the Principles, first in his Exposition, and afterwards in his True Piety. Eleven or twelve more editions were published between 1748 and 1813, and a reprint appeared in the Pamphleteer in 1819, and again with the title of The Catholic Eirenicon, in friendly response to Dr. Pusey, London 1865. On reading it Dr. Leland, the historian, is said to have declared that if such were the principles of Catholics no government had any right to quarrel with them. Charles Butler, who reprinted it, declared it to be a clear and accurate exposition of the Catholic creed on some of its most important principles. John Milner, however, asserted in an official charge to his clergy in 1813 that it [...] "is not an accurate exposition of Roman catholic principles, and still less the faith of catholics". Butler clained that John Joseph Hornyold had used <b>Corkers</b> work in his The Real Principles of Catholicks (1749), but Milner denied this. In consequence of some exceptions taken against the accuracy of the Propositions which form the heading of The Faith of Catholics by Joseph Berington and John Kirk, Kirk reprinted <b>Corkers</b> treatise in 1815.|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} {{knitting}} has three basic tasks: (1) the active (unsecured) stitches {{must be held}} so they don't drop; (2) these stitches must be released sometime after they are secured; and (3) new bights of yarn must be passed through the fabric, usually through active stitches, thus securing them. In very simple cases, knitting can be done without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, hand-knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles or rigid frames. Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting knobbies, knitting nancies, or <b>corkers).</b> Other tools are used to prepare yarn for knitting, to measure and design knitted garments, or to make knitting easier or more comfortable.|$|R

From their contents, it may be clearly seen the damage caused to the system, on which base the daily life was supported, by way of the existing fragmented vision of authorities, the resistance offered by feudal lords, the violence resorted against their representatives, the ambushes laid by crossbowmen which fact forced the country people to take up arms and the attempts on the family institution.
