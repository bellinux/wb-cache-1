We construct a heuristic integrated model of macroeconomic growth constrained by a geophysical system with climate feedbacks, including extreme weather damages from global warming driven by greenhouse gas emissions, and ‘tipping point’ for catastrophic runaway warming. A variety of options for technology development and implementation, and the dynamic relationships among them will be examined. Technology options differ in terms of their primary functionality and in emission characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|This proposal’s key {{premise is}} the {{importance}} – and urgency – of creating favorable conditions for sustainable FDI flows to meet future investment needs. Governments must muster {{the political will to}} put an international support program for sustainable investment facilitation in place. Transitioning to a <b>carbon-free</b> world <b>economy</b> and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 requires, annually, trillions of dollars. Massive private investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI), has to be mobilized for this purpose. However, developing countries, especially the least developed countries, simply lack the capacity to compete successfully in the highly competitive FDI world market to obtain the required funds. They need assistance – not only to obtain more FDI but sustainable FDI. What is needed, therefore, is an international support program for sustainable investment facilitation...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Chemistry, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2016. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 66 - 75). The {{demand for the}} energy has been increasing exponentially and {{it is expected to}} double by 2050 as a result of population increase in the world. The fact that fossil-based fuels are limited and they releases CO 2 gas, which affects the environment negatively. This situation encourages researchers to two important disciplines of science: 1) removal of CO 2 from atmosphere and 2) developing alternative sources of energy that are clean and efficient. Low carbon future will be realized by post-combustion CO 2 capture with air separation therefore adsorbents are needed for CO 2 capture. Since surface volume, adsorption enthalpy, and functional groups inside the pores affect the interactions between CO 2 and surface, new porous materials should be designed specifically that possess all of the aforementioned features. In this thesis study, a new metal dicyanamide compound, Co(hmt) (dca) 2, with free nitrogen atoms in the pores were synthesized. A high adsorption of CO 2 was observed while the material exhibits almost no N 2 uptake at room temperature. In the Co(hmt) (dca) 2 crystal, the pore opening defined as almost 3. 8 Å and kinetic diameters of N 2 and CO 2 are 3. 6 Å and 3. 3 Å, respectively. There is a similarity between kinetic diameter of the crystal and N 2 resulting in limited diffusion of N 2 and it is the origin of the high selectivity obtained in this study. Although metal dicyanamides have widely been studied in different fields it is the first study in the area of CO 2 gas storage. The negative effects of the CO 2 level can also be overcome by developing alternative sources of energy that are <b>carbon-free.</b> Hydrogen <b>economy,</b> which involves splitting water using light to produces O 2 and H 2 has received much attention in the recent years since it is carbon-free and it is based on only water and sun light that are of great abundance. Novel catalysts should be developed to overcome one of the most challenging steps of hydrogen economy, water oxidation, {{which is one of the}} half reactions of water splitting. In this thesis study, simple metal dicyanamides have been investigated as water oxidation catalysts. A new family of metal dicyanamides with the formula, M(dca) 2 (DMF) 2, (M = Co, Ni, and Fe), was synthesized and characterized. A current density of 1 mA. cm- 2 obtained at an overpotential of 580 mV and by Ni doping the value could be decreased down to 513 mV. This is the first study that involves the application of cobalt-dicyanamide systems in electrochemical water oxidation catalysis. Electrocatalytic studies as well as long term (70 h) electrolysis studies show that these materials can efficiently oxidize water and are robust during long courses catalytic processes. by Aysun Başaran.

40|$|After {{the failure}} of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, which was unable to reach a {{consensus}} regarding measures needed to fight global warming (see SourceMex, 2009 - 12 - 16), Brazil began to prepare for the challenges of a <b>carbon-free</b> <b>economy</b> and other sustainability issues that cannot wait for large international decisions to become a reality. One of the most important pieces will be to implement the Politica Nacional de Mudancas Climaticas, in accordance with the climate-change law (Lei de Mudancas Climaticas) signed Dec. 29 by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Congress had been debating the bill since 2007. The lawmakers finally approved it and the president signed it just days after the Copenhagen conference ended. However, Lula vetoed several provisions of the bill that reached his desk, indicating, say environmentalists, that Brazil will clearly have difficulty in effectively changing to a post-carbon economy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarbon {{sequestration}} (CO 2 disposal) {{may be only}} {{a temporary}} measure for bridging from the current situation in which carbon emissions to the atmosphere are unacceptably high and increasing, to a <b>carbon-free</b> <b>economy,</b> {{but it is a}} practical and immediate process that can be undertaken. Sequestration methods vary in effectiveness and cost, and each may have different opportunities, benefits, and drawbacks and periods of time over which the CO 2 is retarded from emitting into the atmosphere. Sequestration methods need to be tested on an appropriate scale as quickly as possible because carbon sequestration may help reverse the trend of increasing carbon emissions and remediate the atmosphere for a significant period of time. Among proposed carbon sequestration technologies, temporary storage of CO 2 in the deep ocean may be the most practicable for many locations, and possibly the most energy efficient and cost-effective. In addition, an important added value benefit may be derived from deep ocean sequestration. A CO 2 hydrate industrial crystallization desalination/disposal process is particularly applicable to oceanic islands and coastal areas adjacent to narrow continental shelves where abyssal depths can be reached by the dense, dissolved CO 2 -rich water gravity mass flows composed of processed water rejected from the desalination process...|$|E

40|$|Optimal climate {{policy is}} studied in a Ramsey growth model with exhaustible oil reserves, an infinitelyelastic supply of renewables, stock-dependent oil {{extraction}} costs and convex climate damages. Weconcentrate on economies {{with an initial}} capital stock below that of the steady state of the carbon-freeeconomy and the initial cost of oil (extraction cost plus scarcity rent and social cost of carbon) below thatof renewables. There are then two regimes. If the oil stock is small, the social optimum path consists of aninitial oil-only phase followed by a renewables-only phase. With a lower cost of renewables or a lowerdiscount rate, more oil is left in situ and renewables are phased in more quickly. The optimal carbon taxrises along its development path during the oil-only phase, but the rise flattens off as less accessiblereserves are explored and the social cost of carbon increases. Subsidizing renewables without an optimalcarbon tax induces more oil to be left in situ and a quicker phasing in of renewables, but oil is depletedmore rapidly initially. The net effect on global warming is ambiguous. The second regime occurs if theinitial oil stock is large. The social optimum then consists of an initial oil-only phase followed with a finaloil-renewables phase. This regime converges to the steady state of the <b>carbon-free</b> <b>economy</b> as well. Thepaper also gives a full characterization of two other regimes that occur if the initial capital stock is aboveits steady state or renewables have an initial cost advantage.

40|$|The United States {{requires}} a substantial investment in transmission capacity {{over the next}} several decades. This investment is needed to ensure system reliability, to accommodate growth in demand for electricity, and to allow the integration of significant amounts of renewable generating capacity. In this paper I survey the need for new transmission capacity and consider the financial and regulatory obstacles that {{stand in the way of}} this new investment. This paper makes three points. First, the historical pace of transmission investments will not be adequate to enhance grid reliability or to allow largescale penetration of renewable generating capacity. Second, the replacement of a vertically integrated electric utility industry in many parts of the country by a more disaggregated one composed of merchant generators has added to the challenge of transmission planning and investment. Third, the focus on federal funding for grid improvements is misplaced. There is no evidence that the private sector is incapable of raising the funds needed for critical investment, provided a rationalized regulatory structure is put into place. Making changes to our regulatory and political systems that facilitate transmission investment and siting will not be easy. But the costs of underinvesting in an improved and enlarged national transmission grid are high. Moving to a largely <b>carbon-free</b> <b>economy</b> by the middle of the century will require a transformation of the power system in this country, one that cannot be successful without a strong interstate high-voltage transmission backbone. Financial support for this project was provided by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. I have benefited from the helpful comments of Ignacio Pérez-Arriaga and Bill Hogan.
