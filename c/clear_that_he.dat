5|$|Following his conviction, Brady {{was moved}} to Durham Prison, where he asked to live in solitary confinement. He spent 19 years in {{mainstream}} prisons before being diagnosed as a psychopath in November 1985 {{and sent to the}} high-security Park Lane Hospital, now Ashworth Psychiatric Hospital, in Sefton; he made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never wanted to be released.|$|E
5|$|The Colts {{placed their}} {{franchise}} tag on Manning on February 15, 2011. On July 30, 2011, the Colts signed Manning to a 5-year, $90 million contract after negotiations {{in which he}} made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not need to}} be the highest-paid player in the NFL.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} {{started on}} a sour note, however, when an ownership dispute forced Benson to pull San Antonio out on the same evening the franchise was to be formally introduced. Anderson decided {{to continue with the}} venture after Bensons's withdrawal, but made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not want to be}} the only American franchise after 1993.|$|E

5|$|According to his Life of King Alfred, Asser was a monk at St David's in {{what was}} then the kingdom of Dyfed, in {{south-west}} Wales. Asser makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was brought up in the area, and was tonsured, trained and ordained there. He also mentions Nobis, a bishop of St David's who died in 873 or 874, as being a kinsman of his.|$|E
5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The scholaster, or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first {{introduced}} him to Latin. From the Historia it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also knew French and possibly Italian, {{but there is not}} enough evidence to determine whether he learned Greek, Persian, and Arabic, as is sometimes claimed.|$|E
5|$|Britten died of {{congestive}} heart failure on 4 December 1976. His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone. The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of Pears. A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E
50|$|In Tagaytay, Vanessa takes drastic {{steps in}} seducing JB for real. She enters his bedroom {{in the middle}} of the night but JB brushes off her overtures. JB makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he’s</b> really {{committed}} to Celine so Vanessa ends up being friends with him instead.|$|R

5|$|Jones {{stayed with}} the Browns until early 1968, when he quit and was {{replaced}} by Nick Skorich. The Browns had offered him a part-time coaching job but made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not stay on as offensive coordinator; Jones declined the reduced role. After leaving the Browns, Jones moved back to Ruston and did occasional scouting for the team at the nearby Grambling State University. He was also a volunteer coach of receivers on Grambling's football team. Later in life, he worked for his son Tom's general contracting business in Ruston.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with a}} monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.|$|E
5000|$|On the contrary, Can Xue {{says she}} treats each {{story as a}} kind of life {{experiment}} in which she is the subject. “In very deep layers,” she says, “all of my works are autobiographical.” As for those who struggle to find meaning in her stories, Can Xue has this to say: [...] "If a reader feels that this book is unreadable, then it’s quite <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he’s</b> not one of my readers.” ...|$|R

5|$|Sanchez {{became the}} first USC quarterback to leave school early for the NFL since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season. During the press conference, head coach Pete Carroll made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not agree with}} Sanchez's decision, and advised him of the low success-rate of quarterbacks who left college early. Despite the public disagreement, the two {{remained}} close afterward.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> began to identify himself with the work {{and it is possible}} that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 {{that he would}} never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E
50|$|His famous jokes were {{available}} as three booklets but some pirated versions were also published. Currently, his jokes are popular over the Internet and several facebook pages. Most of these jokes are in Nepali, lingua franca of Darjeeling, Nepal and surrounding areas {{but many of}} them have been translated to English. In 1985 he was screened for about two minutes in a popular Nepali movie Kusume Rumal and it <b>cleared</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not just an imaginary character.|$|R
5000|$|Robin goes {{cruising}} in {{the public}} toilets where he meets Julian (James Wilby). They both exchange knowing glances and are intending to enter one of the cubicles together, when they are interrupted. Robin leaves. He waits outside briefly, but doesn't see Julian come out. He heads to a dinner party being held by Roger (Tom Beard) and Belinda (Rachel Blake), where Roger makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> unhappy in his marriage and {{wants to be able}} to [...] "play the field again".|$|R

5|$|Bryennios had camped at {{the plain}} of Kedoktos (a name {{deriving}} from the Latin aquaeductus) {{on the road}} to Constantinople. His army comprised 12,000 mostly seasoned men from the regiments (tagmata) of Thessaly, Macedonia and Thrace, as well as Frankish mercenaries and the elite tagma of the Hetaireia. Alexios's forces included 2,000 Turkish horse-archers, 2,000 Chomatenoi from Asia Minor, a few hundred Frankish knights from Italy, and the newly raised regiment of the Immortals, which had been created by Michael VII's chief minister Nikephoritzes and was intended to form the nucleus of a new army. Estimates of Alexios's total force vary from 5,500–6,500 (Haldon) to some 8,000–10,000 (Birkenmeier), but it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was at a considerable disadvantage against Bryennios; not only was his force considerably smaller, but also far less experienced than Bryennios's veterans.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{aiming for}} the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both {{at the finish line}} and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well {{before the end of the}} stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E
50|$|The {{story begins}} with Furgul being {{born in a}} racing {{greyhound}} breeder's home, believed to be full greyhound because he is so young. As he grows, however, it becomes more <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> not full greyhound, and his mother has him run away with his sisters. He promises {{to go back and}} save his mother, Keeva, but along the way he discovers much more to life, such as being a pet, being a fugitive, being in the animal shelter, being in love, and revolting.|$|R
50|$|When Windows (Kristian Scott) turns up, it's <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a shy, {{ordinary}} guy {{who just}} {{likes to play}} video games {{for hours at a}} stretch. He doesn't seem keen on being interviewed, but puts up with the film makers - until their visits become too intrusive. As he begins to lose his grip on the project, Joe come up with a few strategies to draw Windows from his shell, but he fails to anticipate the consequences his disruptive film making may have on the game's loyal fans.|$|R
5000|$|Hayden Woolley of Drowned in Sound commented <b>that</b> [...] "it's <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> {{not just}} wearing Wiley's Rolex, rather he's nicked off with it {{altogether}} and is parading it round as his own". The Guardian music section commented that it liked Kele's new direction, [...] "even {{if it does}} stray close to other electro anthems" [...] such as Wiley's [...] "Wearing My Rolex". Writing for Pitchfork, Ryan Dombal gave the song an overall positive review, commenting that after listening to the song, he [...] "suddenly felt the urge {{to go to the}} gym".|$|R
5|$|Free {{from any}} {{constitutional}} duties {{during the time}} between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost {{from the beginning of}} his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as his campaign manager. Hailing from Morganfield, only a short distance from Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign instead of Rhea's. Instead, by virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, in {{response}} to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Christian, Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought {{on the side of the}} Prussians, though he made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not fight against his mother's country. In the same year, on 8 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.|$|E
5|$|In October 1974 Abu Nidal {{formed the}} ANO, calling it Fatah: The Revolutionary Council. In November that year a Fatah court {{sentenced him to}} death in {{absentia}} for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas. Seale writes that {{it is unlikely that}} Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas, and just as unlikely that Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal. He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence, and was allowed to leave again, but it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had become persona non grata. As a result, the Iraqis gave him Fatah's assets in Iraq, including a training camp, farm, newspaper, radio station, passports, overseas scholarships and $15 million worth of Chinese weapons. He also received Iraq's regular aid to the PLO: around $150,000 a month and a lump sum of $3–5 million.|$|E
2500|$|Ernest Edward [...] "Ernie" [...] Dell {{became the}} prime suspect after he {{was linked to the}} first three murders through {{employment}} records and club memberships. Upon investigating Ernie’s home, numerous models were found, making it <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could be the Miniature Killer. Ernie was taken into custody but was released since there was not enough evidence to charge him. After being interrogated by the CSI’s, Ernie left a message on the killer’s answering machine, telling her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw her models, and knew that she was the killer before stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was heading over to talk. After Ernie killed himself, the CSI team discovered <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had only been covering for someone else.|$|R
