5|$|Selbie {{also made}} a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> attract the wealthy classes to the railway. Stations such as Sandy Lodge (now Moor Park) were built to serve golf courses and hunts along the route, and horse-vans were {{provided}} at stations serving hunts and point to points. Two Pullman cars were introduced in 1909 on selected services between the City of London and Chesham, Aylesbury and Verney Junction {{for the benefit of}} businessmen travelling to work and theatregoers returning from London.|$|E
5|$|When Paramount {{announced}} its first slate of DVD releases in August 1998, First Contact {{was one of}} the first ten titles released in October, announced in a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> showcase effects-driven films. This version contained the feature and two trailers, but no other special features. The film was presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio, with a surround sound Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mix.|$|E
5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers' <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> have more professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not {{be ready for the}} 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected.|$|E

50|$|Eugenics is {{a social}} {{philosophy}} which advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through various forms of intervention. <b>Conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> influence intelligence raise ethical issues. Eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history, falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E

25|$|On August 13, both {{prosecution}} and defense attorneys delivered their closing arguments {{to the jury}} (these arguments concluded the following day). Prosecuting attorney William Delhey argued first, recounting the evidence the state had presented and Collins' <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> destroy physical evidence at the Leik household before informing the jury their collective application of common sense could only dictate a guilty verdict.|$|R
50|$|It {{started as}} a group of young men and women, {{primarily}} students, that was concerned with the military oppression of arts and cultural activities in Pakistan. The group cherished a society that has gender equity and democratic values, respects all humans and offers equal economic opportunities to all. Rahs believes in organized and <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> realize this dream. Theater is its medium.|$|R
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E

50|$|Football is {{the number}} one sport in the Central African Republic. The {{national}} association has made <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> participate in all of the top international and regional championships. A 2-0 win over the Côte d'Ivoire in the qualifiers for the African Cup of Nations in 1972 still ranks as the nation's most significant success, although the return leg ended in a 4-1 defeat.|$|R
40|$|Networks {{influence}} {{human behavior}} and well being, and realizing this, individuals make <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> shape their own networks.

50|$|Areas with noticed frog extinctions, like Australia, {{have few}} {{policies}} that have been created to prevent the extinction of these species. However, local initiatives have been placed where <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> decrease global warming will also turn into a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> towards saving the frogs. In South America, where {{there is also an}} increased decline of amphibian populations, there is no set policy to try to save frogs. Some suggestions would include getting entire governments to place a set of rules and institutions as a source of guidelines that local governments have to abide by.|$|R
25|$|Onitsha's {{role as a}} {{strategic}} gateway for trade and commerce continues to expand and deepen and the Anambra State government has made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> encourage industrialization {{over the past few}} years through infrastructure renewal and directed investment.|$|E
25|$|The 2006/7 {{school year}} saw the Council make a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> be more known {{throughout}} the school, {{through a variety}} of methods including sponsoring showings of various films, posters around the school, and running charity events such as the Five Ways interpretation of World AIDS Day.|$|E
25|$|Other magazines, such as Granta, Tin House, and Boston Review {{have responded}} to The Count by making a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> remedy the gender {{disparity}} within their journals. Not only do the editors of these publications {{say that they are}} making these efforts, but the numbers of The Count show this to be the case.|$|E
5|$|While some nudes {{by foreign}} artists {{were held in}} private English collections, the country had no {{tradition}} of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> try to reflect moral lessons in his work.|$|R
50|$|Though {{a pioneer}} {{comes up with}} {{innovative}} ideas very often the initial response to a pioneer is one of indifference, ridicule or even one of outright hostility. If the pioneer persists and succeeds in an initiative, that person's efforts may eventually get {{the endorsement of the}} public. That endorsement tempts others to imitate the pioneer. If they also succeed, news spreads and brings wider acceptance. <b>Conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> lend organizational support to the new initiative helps institutionalize the new innovation.|$|R
5000|$|Fugazi downplayed any <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> make Kill Taker more {{experimental}} or diverse. According to Picciotto “I don’t {{really think}} {{of any of the}} records as being any more experimental than any of the others, because to us they were all experiments,” he said. “We were just trying to figure stuff out and push ourselves further each time. So to my ear every record sounds like a step forward, or sideways, or at least somewhere else from the one before it.” ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{work that}} has {{included}} direct experiences from the women raped is Ami Birangona Bolchhi ("I, the heroine, speak") by Nilima Ibrahim. The work includes in {{its name from the}} word Birangona (Heroine), given by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after the war, to the raped and tortured women during the war. This was a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> alleviate any social stigma the women might face in the society.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier's {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} chemistry were {{a result of}} a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Nintendo made a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> {{revitalize the}} Pokémon brand with the Pokémon Black & White duology, which {{streamlined}} the battle system and introduced {{an entirely new}} lineup of characters in a new region based on New York City. These games were followed up with a direct numbered sequel in 2012, a first for the main series. 2012 also saw the release of Pokémon Conquest, a crossover with the Nobunaga's Ambition series of strategy role-playing games.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, prosecutor Anatoly Zadorozhny {{delivered his}} closing argument before the judge. Harking towards the earlier testimony of psychiatrists at the trial, Zadorozhny argued that Chikatilo fully understood the criminality of his actions, {{was able to}} resist his homicidal impulses, and had made numerous <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> avoid detection. Moreover, Zadorozhny emphasized that in 19 of the charges, the material evidence of the crimes had been provided by Chikatilo himself. Zadorozhny then recited each of the charges before formally requesting the death penalty.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> {{conserve}} {{and protect}} global biodiversity are a recent phenomenon. Natural resource conservation, however, {{has a history}} that extends prior {{to the age of}} conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply {{for the rest of the}} community. This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the [...] "Tragedy of the Commons".|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} years the {{activities}} of the association consisted mainly of submissions of petitions to the Government and to the British Parliament on grievances. There was an inherent trust in the good intentions of the rulers. The association sought to take up issues on behalf of all sections of society but occasionally it made <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> protect the right of the landed aristocracy. [...] Despite its shortcomings, it was the only association of Indians which took up their causes and represented to the government.|$|R
25|$|For example, Rivers {{proposed}} that officers and soldiers {{who suffer from}} night terrors {{do so because they}} are trying to wittingly repress emotions and their associated instincts back into the unconscious. Repression, according to Rivers, is never adequate for removing conflict; it is only fruitful when a person can exert a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> do so. As a result, the repressed instincts, along with their associated emotions and memories, seep into consciousness when soldiers are sleeping. The result is night terrors.|$|E
25|$|Conservative Judaism {{holds that}} Orthodoxy has {{deviated}} from historical Judaism through excessive concern with recent codifications of Jewish law. Conservative rabbis make a <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> use historical sources {{to determine what}} kind of changes occurred, how and why they occurred, and in what historical context. With this information they believe that can better understand a proper way for rabbis to interpret and apply Jewish law to our conditions today. Like Orthodoxy, {{there is no one}} legal body that speaks for all Jews in their religious community.|$|E
25|$|An area of {{difficulty}} is whether simply visually observing something {{amounts to a}} search. If a police officer simply sees something relating to an offence {{in the course of}} their normal duty without any <b>conscious</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> find it then there will generally not be a search. However, cases have shown that even where there is some conscious action there may not be a search as requesting an individual hold their hands out to be observed or hold a bicycle up so the serial number could be seen were both not seen to be searches.|$|E
500|$|After 1832, Etty {{exhibited}} over 80 more {{paintings at}} the Summer Exhibition. He remained a prominent painter of nudes, but {{from this time}} [...] made <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> reflect moral lessons. Yet he remained, in the majority view, a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that [...] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, {{was not aware of}} the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds". Etty remained commercially successful in his lifetime, amassing £17,000 (about £ in today's terms) by his death.|$|R
50|$|Baratynsky's {{earliest}} {{poems are}} punctuated by <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> write differently from Pushkin who he {{regarded as a}} model of perfection. Even Eda, his first long poem, though inspired by Pushkin's The Prisoner of the Caucasus, adheres to a realistic and homely style, with a touch of sentimental pathos but not a trace of romanticism. It is written, like all that Baratynsky wrote, in a wonderfully precise style, next to which Pushkin's seems hazy. The descriptive passages are among the best — the stern nature of Finland was particularly dear to Baratynsky.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research findings}} generated {{from a study}} of the structure of a caresharing system for the elderly who reside in a Florida retirement community during {{the last decade of the}} twentieth century. A caresharing system is a combination of strategies employed in order to maximize pleasure and minimize losses that might otherwise be associated with communal and individual aging processes. In this instance, the caresharing system entailed a series of <b>conscious</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> hide frailty in the community. Consequences of such caresharing systems and implications for future retirement communities are discussed...|$|R
