Tensions with Iran had been strained since 1931 when the Shah cancelled the D'Arcy Concession, which gave the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company the exclusive right to sell Iranian oil, with Iran receiving only 10 percent (possibly 16 percent) of the revenue or of the profits.|$|E

The chassis itself was built by one of the team's sponsors Hercules Aerospace in the US after former Hercules apprentice and then McLaren engineer Steve Nichols had advised Barnard, who along with Dennis had been unsuccessfully searching in England for a company willing to take on the job, that the US based <b>company</b> <b>might</b> be their best choice, and quickly revolutionised car design in Formula One with new levels of rigidity and driver protection.|$|E
25|$|On 18 July 1857, U.S. Army Captain Stewart Van Vliet, an {{assistant}} quartermaster, {{and a small}} escort were ordered to proceed directly from Kansas to Salt Lake City, ahead of {{the main body of}} troops.

However, Harney's letter did not mention that Young had been replaced as governor, nor did it detail what the mission of the troops would be once they arrived and these omissions sparked even greater distrust among the Saints. On his journey, reports reached Van Vliet that his <b>company</b> <b>might</b> be in danger from Mormon raiders on the trail. The Captain therefore left his escort and proceeded alone.|$|E

25|$|Ubisoft {{executive}} Tony Key {{said that}} although the game was designed for the Wii U, the <b>company</b> <b>might</b> bring it to other platforms. Following several leaks, Ubisoft confirmed Zombi for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Developed by Straight Right (who had developed Mass Effect 3 Wii U version), it was released on August 18, 2015. The game {{is similar to the}} original, with minor updates and enhancements. Second-screen gameplay was moved to the main screen, only appearing when required. Although the cricket bat was the only melee weapon in ZombiU, Zombi added two weapons. The shovel has a longer range and the ability to hit more than one zombie at a time. The second (a nailed bat) inflicts more damage, has a higher critical-hit chance and can also hit more than one enemy at a time. ZombiU flashlight can switch to a wider, further-reaching beam which uses more battery life and increases the risk of attracting zombies. The flashlight must be kept off for 30 seconds to recharge, requiring that its use be planned. Zombi has only the solo campaign, without local multiplayer or online single-player features. The boxed game was released on January 21, 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Conceptually, {{fraudulent}} {{trading is}} similar to a fraudulent conveyance, but the key distinction is that an application to have a transaction set aside as a fraudulent conveyance usually requires to the third party beneficiary to disgorge the benefit of the conveyance to undo the loss to the company's assets, whereas a court order in relation to fraudulent trading it is the responsible parties (usually the directors) who must make up the loss and the third party beneficiaries will usually retain the benefit. [...] However, it is perfectly possible for a single transaction to be simultaneously fraudulent trading and a fraudulent conveyance, and to be the subject on concurrent applications.
