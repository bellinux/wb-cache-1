40|$|Traditionally {{petroleum}} based fluids {{are widely}} used in the manufacturing industry. However they are environmentally more harmful as well as cause significant problems to the operators. This paper presents a case study that uses an environmentally friendly soybean based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid.</b> This experimental study compared the tool wear with dry cutting, using the soybean based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> and a petroleum based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> at manufacturer suggested <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> concentrations in a CNC turning operation.

40|$|Abstract. Cutting fluid {{occupies}} {{an important}} {{position in the}} metal processing. The performance and pollution problem brought to the environment of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> are paid attention to day by day. Proceed {{from the perspective of}} green design, using castor oil which has a good biodegradability, triethanolamine, boric acid and the sodium polyacrylate whose molecular weight is less than 2 × 104 as the main raw materials, a boron-containing water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> had been obtained. The performance of B-containing water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> are measured according to GB/T 6144 - 1985 regulation which is the technical requirements of synthetic <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid.</b> And the biodegradability of mineral oil, castor oil, modified castor oil and B-containing water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> are measured by improved Storstroem Test (OECD 301 B). The test results show that the B-containing water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> has a good performance of physical and chemical. And the biodegradation rate of the <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> is 87 %, which indicates the <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> has a good biodegradability...|$|R
50|$|A <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> {{is often}} {{applied to the}} {{machining}} operation to cool and lubricate the cutting tool. Determining whether a <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> should be used, and, if so, choosing the proper <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid,</b> is usually included {{within the scope of}} cutting condition.|$|R
25|$|Besides cooling, <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> also aid {{the cutting}} process by {{lubricating}} {{the interface between}} the tool's cutting edge and the chip. By preventing friction at this interface, some of the heat generation is prevented. This lubrication also helps prevent the chips from being welded onto the tool, which would interfere with subsequent cutting.|$|E
25|$|Commonly {{processed}} materials include {{soft and}} hard steels, aluminum, bronze, brass, ceramics, and chrome. Note that gummy grades of stainless steel, aluminum, {{and all but}} the hardest grades of plastic are much tougher for this process. The gumminess problem can be overcome with special oil based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids.</b> Also, the process does not work well on thin-walled workpieces owing to a tendency to expand when the tool is inserted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> {{present some}} {{mechanisms}} for causing illness or injury in workers. Occupational exposure {{is associated with}} increases in cardiovascular disease. These mechanisms {{are based on the}} external (skin) or internal contact involved in machining work, including touching the parts and tooling; being splattered or splashed by the fluid; or having mist settle on the skin or enter the mouth and nose in the normal course of breathing.|$|E
30|$|Cutting fluid {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the manufacturing industry as lubricant [8]. It can be mainly classified into two categories: oil-based and water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid.</b> The primary functions of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> include lubrication, cooling, cleaning, and antirust. At present, the lubrication performance of oil-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> is outstanding, but its cooling property is inferior. On the contrary, water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> shows powerful ability in cooling, cleaning, and antirust, but it is relatively weak in lubrication [9]. Nowadays, increasingly strict environmental regulations result in higher operating costs for metal <b>cutting.</b> Water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> is utilized more and more popularly, owing to its low-cost and less-waste emissions than oil-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> [10]. However, the water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> is not ideal due to its inferior lubrication ability [8]. Consequently, it is necessary to find a way to enhance the lubrication property of water-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid.</b> Up to now, a great deal of research has been done on this subject [9 – 11]. One simple approach is putting additives into regular lubricants to reduce friction and wear, which has been widely applied in lubrication engineering [2].|$|R
40|$|AbstractCutting fluids {{are widely}} used in metal cutting to perform two major {{functions}} namely cooling and lubrication. The most common method of application of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> is flood or deluge cooling which involves bulk application of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> in the <b>cutting</b> zone. The copious usage of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> not only increases the production cost but also creates serious environmental and health hazards. In this present study, an {{effort was made to}} reduce the quantity of usage of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> and to optimize the <b>cutting</b> parameters and <b>fluid</b> application parameters while turning of Oil Hardened Non shrinkable steel (OHNS) with minimal <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> application using Taguchi technique. The optimized results were compared with dry turning and conventional wet turning under similar cutting conditions. The results clearly indicated that minimal <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> application enhanced the cutting performance by improving surface finish compared to dry and wet turning...|$|R
40|$|While <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> {{purchase}} typically {{accounts for}} less than 0. 5 {{percent of the total}} operating cost, disposal of spent <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> can be very expensive and troublesome, especially with the increasingly tightened environmental regulations and fluid purchase and disposal cost. Fortunately, <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> life can be extended significantly by implementing an effective fluid management program...|$|R
25|$|There are {{generally}} {{three types of}} liquids: mineral, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Semi-synthetic and synthetic <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> represent attempts to combine the best properties of oil with the best properties of water by suspending emulsified oil in a water base. These properties include: rust inhibition, tolerance {{of a wide range}} of water hardness (maintaining pH stability around 9 to 10), ability to work with many metals, resist thermal breakdown, and environmental safety.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluid {{is a type}} of coolant and {{lubricant}} {{designed specifically}} for metalworking processes, such as machining and stamping. There are various kinds of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids,</b> which include oils, oil-water emulsions, pastes, gels, aerosols (mists), and air or other gases. They may be made from petroleum distillates, animal fats, plant oils, water and air, or other raw ingredients. Depending on context and on which type of cutting fluid is being considered, it may be referred to as cutting fluid, cutting oil, cutting compound, coolant, or lubricant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> degrade {{over time}} due to {{contaminants}} entering the lubrication system. A {{common type of}} degradation is the formation of tramp oil, also known as sump oil, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid. It originates as lubrication oil that seeps out from the slideways and washes into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats bar stock to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases {{it can be seen}} as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil.|$|E
40|$|Following a {{comprehensive}} review on titanium machining and methods of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> application, this paper presents a new Controlled <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> impinging supply system (Cut‐list) developed to deliver an accurate amount of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> into the machining zone via wellpositioned coherent nozzles based on the calculation of the heat generated. The performance {{of the new system}} was evaluated against a conventional flood <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> supply system during step shoulder milling of Ti‐ 6 Al‐ 4 V using vegetable oil‐based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid.</b> The comparison was performed at different cutting speeds and feed rates. Comparison measures/indicators were cutting force, workpiece temperature, tool flank wear, burr formation and average surface roughness (Ra). The new system provided significant reductions in <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> consumption of up to 42 %. Additionally, reductions in cutting force, tool flank wear and burr height of 16. 41 %, 46. 77 %, and 31. 70 % were recorded, respectively.

40|$|Surface milling of {{hardened}} steel {{is carried out}} with copious supply of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> and is obviously associated with problems related to procurement and storage of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid.</b> The disposal of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> has to comply with environmental legislation such as OSHA regulations.

40|$|Abstract. Different {{methods of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> {{application}} are used on turning of a difficult-to-machine steel (SAE EV- 8). A semi-synthetic <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> was applied using a conventional method, minimum quantity of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> (MQCF), and pulverization. By the minimum quantity method was also applied a lubricant of vegetable oil (MQL). Thereafter, a <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> jet under high pressure (3. 0 MPa) was singly {{applied in the}} following regions: chip-tool interface; top surface of the chip; and tool-workpiece contact. Two other methods were used: an interflow between conventional application and chip-tool interface jet and, finally, three jets simultaneously applied. In order to carry out these tests, {{it was necessary to}} set up a high pressure system using a piston pump for generating a <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> jet, a Venturi for fluid application (MQCF and MQL), and a nozzle for <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> pulverization. The output variables analyzed included tool life, surface roughness, cutting tool temperature, cutting force, chip form, chip compression rate and machined specimen microstructure. It can be observed that the tool life increases and the cutting force decreases with the application of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> jet, mainly when it is directed to the chip-tool interface. Excluding the methods involving jet fluid, the conventional method seems to be more efficient than other methods of low pressure...|$|R
25|$|Motor oils have a {{slightly}} complicated relationship to machine tools. Straight-weight non-detergent motor oils are usable, and in fact SAE 10 and 20 oils {{used to be the}} recommended spindle and way oils (respectively) on manual machine tools decades ago, although nowadays dedicated way oil formulas prevail in commercial machining. While nearly all motor oils can act as adequate <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> in terms of their cutting performance alone, modern multi-weight motor oils with detergents and other additives are best avoided. These additives can present a copper-corrosion concern to brass and bronze, which machine tools often have in their bearings and leadscrew nuts (especially older or manual machine tools).|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{technique to}} measure oil concentration in cutting fluid samples is manual titration: 100ml of the fluid under test is titrated with a 0.5M HCl solution to an endpoint of pH 4 and {{the volume of}} titrant used to reach the endpoint {{is used to calculate}} the oil concentration. This technique is accurate and not affected by fluid contamination, but needs to be performed by trained personnel in a laboratory environment. A hand-held refractometer is the industrial standard used to determine the mix ratio of water-soluble coolants that estimates oil concentration from the sample refractive index measured in the Brix scale. The refractometer allows for in situ measurements of oil concentration within industrial plants. However, contamination of the sample reduces the accuracy of the measure. Other techniques are used to measure the oil concentration in <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids,</b> such as measure of the fluid viscosity, density, and ultrasound speed. Other test equipment is used to determine such properties as acidity and conductivity.|$|E

2500|$|Bacterial {{growth is}} {{predominant}} in petroleum-based <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids.</b> Tramp oil along with human hair or skin oil {{are some of}} the debris during cutting which accumulates and forms a layer {{on the top of the}} liquid; anaerobic bacteria proliferate due to a number of factors. An early sign of the need for replacement is the [...] "Monday-morning smell" [...] (due to lack of usage from Friday to Monday). Antiseptics are sometimes added to the fluid to kill bacteria. Such use must be balanced against whether the antiseptics will harm the cutting performance, workers' health, or the environment. Maintaining as low a fluid temperature as practical will slow the growth of microorganisms.|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>cutting</b> <b>fluids</b> {{are used}} in aerosol (mist) form (air with tiny {{droplets}} of liquid scattered throughout). The main problems with mists have been that they are rather bad for the workers, who have to breathe the surrounding mist-tainted air, and that they sometimes don't even work very well. Both of those problems come from the imprecise delivery that often puts the mist everywhere {{and all the time}} except at the cutting interface, during the cut—the one place and time where it's wanted. However, a newer form of aerosol delivery, [...] (minimum quantity of lubricant), avoids both of those problems. The delivery of the aerosol is directly through the flutes of the tool (it arrives directly through or around the insert itself—an ideal type of cutting fluid delivery that traditionally has been unavailable outside of a few contexts such as gun drilling or expensive, state-of-the-art liquid delivery in production milling). MQL's aerosol is delivered in such a precisely targeted way (with respect to both location and timing) that the net effect seems almost like dry machining from the operators' perspective. The chips generally seem like dry-machined chips, requiring no draining, and the air is so clean that machining cells can be stationed closer to inspection and assembly than before. MQL doesn't provide much cooling in the sense of heat transfer, but its well-targeted lubricating action prevents some of the heat from being generated in the first place, which helps to explain its success.|$|E

40|$|Applying <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> in a {{metal-cutting}} {{process can}} reduce the rate of tool wear and improve surface quality. However, <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> has negative effects on the working environment {{and the use of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> also increases the total production cost. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} reduce the use of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> during machining. To serve that purpose, a minimal-cutting-fluid technique was studied. In the present work the <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> was applied in a form of a high-velocity, narrow, pulsed jet at a rate of 2 ml/min. The performance of machining with pulsed-jet application was studied in high-speed milling of hardened steel, compared to dry machining and machining with flood application. The results clearly show that compared to dry machining and machining with flood application, machining with pulsed-jet application lowers cutting forces, reduces tool wear, increases tool life, and improves surface roughness, especially when machining with high cutting velocity. Moreover. the amount of <b>cutting</b> <b>fluid</b> consumed at the rate of 2 ml/min is a drastic reduction compared to flood application. Also, no harmful oil mist is generated during the pulsed-jet application. In conclusion, the pulsed-jet application can be applied to milling process of hardened steel using ball end mills; it reduces the negative effects to the environment, improves machining performances, and consequently reduces total production cost.
