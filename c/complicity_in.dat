These included former Republican governor William S. Taylor (18991900) and Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Henry Youtsey, who was convicted for <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> the assassination but turned state's evidence, was not pardoned, leading Democrats to portray the pardons of Taylor and Powers as partisan.

40|$|This article theorizes {{the concept}} of necropolitical <b>complicities</b> <b>in</b> the {{construction}} and writing of ethno-sectarian identities {{in the context of}} the war in Iraq. Drawing on Mbembe's concept of necropolitics in relation to the (re) construction of a normative somatechnics, the article argues for an acknowledgment of operative colonial epistemologies and techniques of governance that have fuelled contemporary sectarian violence in Iraq. The interplay between these epistemologies and techniques of governance and the violent assertions of Iraqi ethno-religious identities are theorized as necropolitical complicities. 15 page(s...|$|R
30|$|It {{is obvious}} that despite varying degrees of {{objection}} to CSR (e.g. Friedman, 1970; Lantos, 2001), there are many drivers of CSR (Muthuri, 2007), even if {{most of these are}} instrumental and represent the business case for CSR (WBCSD, 2002). According to Kurucz et al. (2008), these constitute a proposition for value creation in the general areas of cost and risk reduction, profit maximisation and competitive advantage, reputation and legitimacy, and synergistic value creation. This will typically rest on one or a combination of the following: human resources management, brand differentiation, license to operate and diverting attention from corporate <b>complicities</b> <b>in</b> unethical behaviours (WBCSD, 2002).|$|R

5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won the lawsuit, leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied <b>complicity.</b> <b>In</b> 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> Reinterpreting Criminal <b>Complicity</b> and Inchoate Participation Offences, Dennis J. Baker {{argues that}} the mental element <b>in</b> <b>complicity</b> is one of intention, that {{recklessness}} alone is not sufficient. This is demonstrated by showing that the ancient and modern authorities on complicity required intention. The book argues the ‘causal participation’ element <b>in</b> <b>complicity</b> means that the conduct element can only be established when there is intentional encouragement {{on the part of}} the accessory. As the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, like most of the statutory provisions found in the United States, deems that both perpetrator and accessory are perpetrators for the purpose of punishment and crime labelling, limiting the mental element <b>in</b> <b>complicity</b> to intentional participation is, the author argues, the only way to reconcile these provisions with the requirements of proportionate punishment and fair labelling. As some forms of reckless encouragement and assistance will not be criminalised if the mental element <b>in</b> <b>complicity</b> is intention only, the author suggests that the solution is to amend section 45 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 to criminalise reckless participation. In addition, the author argues that standard complicity and joint enterprise complicity have the same mental and conduct elements and thus joint enterprise complicity is not a distinct form of complicity...|$|R
40|$|This article {{outlines}} a ‘mutual inquiry’ based {{approach to}} supervision using techniques,  concepts and insights drawn from social work supervision experience, a current Ph. D.  institutional ethnographic research project and intersectionality. Good supervision of social work {{students and staff}} can progress efforts towards identifying and combatting discrimination, important steps towards a more socially just society. Reducing  discrimination also improves the quality of service provision with clients, often members  of the most marginalised groups in the community. Supervision to reduce discrimination needs to be shaped by humility rather than the more popular goal of competence. Humility is fostered when a supervisor and supervisee consider their work together from the standpoints of clients, and purposefully contemplate their <b>complicities</b> <b>in</b> the creation  and maintenance of discriminatory practices. This supervision approach aims to create the  vision, and ability, to challenge discriminatory policies and practices as they are normalised  and inflect at individual, supervision, organisational and societal levels...|$|R

Following the violence, dozens of Uzbek community and religious leaders were arrested by the Kyrgyzstani government and accused of inciting ethnic violence, among them Azimzhan Askarov, who had been filming killings and arson attacks during the riots.

5|$|Morton {{was elected}} to Mar's office and proved {{in many ways the}} most {{effective}} of James's regents, but he made enemies by his rapacity. He fell from favour when Frenchman Esmé Stewart, Sieur d'Aubigny, first cousin of James's father Lord Darnley and future Earl of Lennox, arrived in Scotland and quickly established himself as the first of James's powerful favourites. Morton was executed on 2 June 1581, belatedly charged with <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> Darnley's murder. On 8 August, James made Lennox the only duke in Scotland.

5|$|On 27 February 2002, a train {{carrying}} Hindu pilgrims {{was burned}} {{outside the town}} of Godhra, killing 59 people. The incident {{was seen as an}} attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks. The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced. Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread. The then-Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and several high-ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim-owned properties. In April 2009, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases. In 2012, Modi was cleared of <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> the violence by the SIT and BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, who later held a cabinet portfolio in the Modi government, was convicted of having orchestrated one of the riots and sentenced to 28 years imprisonment. Scholars such as Paul Brass, Martha Nussbaum and Dipankar Gupta have said that there was a high level of state <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> the incidents.|$|E

With Baumholtz batting right-handed {{for the first time}} in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.|$|E
5|$|Auriga, however, is {{sometimes}} described as Myrtilus, who was Hermes's {{son and the}} charioteer of Oenomaus. The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions of the constellation, which rarely show a chariot. Myrtilus's chariot was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus's daughter Hippodamia. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia's successful suitor, Pelops, killed him, despite his <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus's father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is Theseus's son Hippolytus. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother Phaedra, who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his chariot was wrecked, but revived by Asclepius. Regardless of Auriga's specific representation, {{it is likely that}} the constellation was created by the ancient Greeks to commemorate the importance of the chariot in their society.|$|E
