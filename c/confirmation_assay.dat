40|$|Two {{conventional}} PCR-enzyme immunoassays (PCR-EIAs) and two real-time PCR assays (LightCycler system; Roche Diagnostics) {{were evaluated}} as <b>confirmation</b> <b>assays</b> with cppB and 16 S rRNA genes as targets. Of 765 {{male and female}} genitourinary and nasopharyngeal specimens positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the COBAS AMPLICOR Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae PCR test (Roche Diagnostics), 229 (30 %) were confirmed positive; 13 of these (5. 7 %) were lacking the cppB gene. Of the 534 samples (70 %) {{that could not be}} confirmed, 81 (15 %) showed a positive crossing point. However, melting curve analysis revealed an aberrant melting temperature in the LightCycler 16 S rRNA assay; therefore, these samples were considered non-N. gonorrhoeae Neisseria species. Both of the 16 S rRNA assays performed well, with positive predictive values of 99. 1 % and 100 % for the PCR-EIAs and the real-time assays, respectively, and a negative predictive value of 99. 8 % for both. The cppB assays were compromised by the absence of the cppB gene in 5. 7 % of the N. gonorrhoeae-positive samples, resulting in negative predictive values of 96. 8 % and 97. 6 % for the PCR-EIAs and the real-time assays, respectively.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the {{prevalence of}} sera containing specific IgE antibodies to latex proteins using immunoenzymatic methods. A population of 500 unselected adult voluntary blood donors was the source of the sera used in this study. Two different immunoenzymatic methods (EAST and CARLA) were used to analyze the presence of specific IgE antibodies. <b>Confirmation</b> <b>assay</b> was carried out by inhibition ELISA and immunoblotting. Sera from healthy non-atopic individuals were also used as control. Two hundred and twenty five sera showed higher than normal total IgE levels. Of those, three presented latex specific IgE antibodies, which could be inhibited in a dose-response manner with the natural rubber latex and glove extracts. Several latex allergens were recognized by the IgE antibodies from these positive sera. This low seroprevalence (0. 66 %) indicates that latex hypersensitivity is not an important problem {{in the general population}}.

After human and/or veterinary consumption, pharmaceuticals can be excreted in unchanged form, as the parent compound, and/or as free or conjugated metabolites. Determination of most pharmaceuticals and metabolites in the environment is commonly made by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). LC coupled to tandem MS is the technique of choice nowadays in this field.

The World Health organization (WHO) has raised concerns of autochthonous transmission of the virus in regions where the vector is endemic. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the occurrence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in western Austria (Tyrol) especially after a history of travel to A. albopictus endemic regions. The study participants were healthy blood donors at randomly selected donation sites in the west Austrian region Tyrol. Rest blood (plasma) samples were tested for the presence of ZIKV nucleic acid and antibodies against the virus. Mean age of the study participants was 44. 6 (SD = 12. 9) and 58. 8 % were men. Eighty percent reported to have received vaccine against TBEV, whereas only 4. 9 and 0. 9 % had received YFV and JEV vaccines. Three out of 1001 (0. 03 %) participants tested positive solely for ZIKV IgM antibody but not for other flaviviruses. Only one individual had ZIKV IgG antibody. All four donors were negative in the neutralization (<b>confirmation)</b> <b>assay.</b> No viral RNA was detected in any of the samples. The null finding of our study refutes WHO's initial fear of global expansion of ZIKV infection including its occurrence in Europe.

The system relies on the detection of an increased production of clear plaque mutants (CPM) arising from turbid plaques, in response to DNA damage. A number of L 5 phage experimental tools were developed and optimized, including a lysogen-based CPM <b>confirmation</b> <b>assay.</b> The mutant induction system was applied to wild type M. smegmatis mc 2155 and its recA mutant, dinP mutant as well as an M. smegmatis(L 5) lysogen. The lysogen system proved to be insensitive with respect to mutant induction since elevated CPM frequencies could not be detected. Interestingly, the wild type M. smegmatis mc 2155 system demonstrated slightly elevated CPM frequencies in response to transfection of untreated L 5 on UV irradiated host cells. This result suggests that a host SOS mutagenic system is able to act on normal, undamaged DNA bases. The involvement of the SOS response in untargeted mutagenesis was confirmed by the abrogation of increased CPM frequency, in an M. smegmatis recA mutant. This data supports suggestions that RecA is responsible for the control of the SOS response. The M. smegmatis dinP mutant system showed a decrease in CPM frequency which supports evidence that this gene does have mutator polymerase activity, as is in seen E. coli dinP homologues...|$|E

40|$|IgA {{nephropathy}} is {{a chronic}} renal disease characterized by mesangial immunodeposits that contain autoantigen, which is aberrantly glycosylated IgA 1 with some hinge-region O-glycans deficient in galactose. Macroscopic hematuria during an {{upper respiratory tract}} infection is common among patients with IgA nephropathy, which suggests a connection between inflammation and disease activity. Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) is an inflammatory cytokine involved in IgA immune response. We previously showed that IL- 6 selectively increases production of galactose-deficient IgA 1 in IgA 1 -secreting cells from patients with IgA nephropathy. Methods: We characterized IL- 6 signaling pathways involved in the overproduction of galactose-deficient IgA 1. To understand molecular mechanisms, IL- 6 signaling was analyzed by kinomic activity profiling and Western blotting, followed by <b>confirmation</b> <b>assays</b> using siRNA knock-down and small-molecule inhibitors. Results: STAT 3 was differentially activated by IL- 6 in IgA 1 -secreting cells from patients with IgA nephropathy compared with those from healthy control subjects. Specifically, IL- 6 induced enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of STAT 3 in the cells from patients with IgA nephropathy, which resulted in overproduction of galactose-deficient IgA 1. This IL- 6 −mediated overproduction of galactose-deficient IgA 1 could be blocked by small molecule inhibitors of JAK/STAT signaling.

Currently, other investigational pharmaceutical products are able to produce an effect similar to EPO but without having chemical structures related to EPO; these are the synthetic erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Peginesatide (also known as Hematide?) is being developed by Affymax and Takeda and, if approved by regulatory authorities, could soon be released on the international market. To detect potential athletic abuse of this product and deter athletes who consider cheating, we initiated a collaboration to implement a detection test for anti-doping purposes. Peginesatide is a synthetic, PEGylated, investigational, peptide-based erythropoiesis-stimulating agent that is designed and engineered to stimulate specifically the erythropoietin receptor dimer that governs erythropoiesis.

We investigated the presence of antibodies against the most prevalent arboviruses. OBJECTIVES This study was aimed at evaluating some clinical and physical parameters of domestic pigeons, including the presence of antibodies to Amazon-endemic arboviruses. METHODS Eighty-five healthy pigeons were captured in Mangal das Garças Park, in Belém, and were bled. Upon capture, the birds were subjected to a clinical examination in search of alterations that could indicate the presence of arboviruses. Blood samples were converted to serum and tested using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) technique with a panel of 19 antigens of arboviruses circulating in the Amazon. The <b>confirmation</b> <b>assay</b> for the positive reactions to the viral species tested by HI was a neutralisation test in new-born Swiss albino mice (Mus musculus) [mouse neutralisation test (MNT) ]. FINDINGS A total of 10 (11. 8 %) serum samples tested positive for antiflavivirus antibodies by HI. All the samples positive for the HI test were subjected to MNT for detection of viruses and yielded negative results (logarithmic neutralisation index < 1. 7). MAIN CONCLUSION The results represent the first serological detection of antiarbovirus antibodies in domestic pigeons as potential hosts of arboviruses in Brazil. The detection of haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against genus Flavivirus indicated that there was recent contact between the analysed domestic pigeons and these arboviruses.

HIV- 1 nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) was performed in negative or indeterminate specimens by Geenius HIV 1 / 2 or WB. Among 140 reactive specimens by HIV Ag/Ab assay, 82 (58. 6 %) were positive for HIV- 1 Ab by Geenius HIV 1 / 2. Among 58 negative or indeterminate specimens by Geenius HIV 1 / 2, four specimens (6. 9 %) were positive by HIV- 1 NAT. The sensitivity and specificity of Geenius HIV 1 / 2 were 95. 3 % and 100. 0 %, respectively.

Our results suggest that anti-HCV core ELISA is more accurate for detecting HCV infection than anti-c 100 / 3. Although the risk associated with the duration of HD treatment and blood transfusion was high, additional factors such as a significant non-transfusional spread of HCV seems to play a role as well. The identification of infective patients by more sensitive methods for HCV genome detection should help to control the transmission of HCV in the unit under study...|$|E
40|$|The {{performances}} of three commercially available immunoassays (Chlamydiazyme/Antibody Blocking Assay [Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Ill. ], IDEIA [Analytab Products, Plainview, N. Y. ], and Microtrak EIA [Syva Co. Palo Alto, Calif. ]) were evaluated {{for the detection}} of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine specimens from asymptomatic males. Assay results were compared with direct specimen immunofluorescence (DFA) analysis of urine sediment (Syva Microtrak; Syva Co.), which was chosen as the study <b>confirmation</b> <b>assay.</b> An overall Chlamydia prevalence of 7 % (24 of 340) was found in our study population, with peak incidences occurring in the adolescent (8 of 93 specimens) and young adult (11 of 146 specimens) age groups. Sensitivity and specificity data among the Chlamydiazyme, IDEIA, and Microtrak enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were determined to be 79. 1 and 99 %, 91. 7 and 98 %, and 95. 8 and 99 %, respectively. The Microtrak EIA and IDEIA products demonstrated sensitivities and specificities equal to or greater than those claimed for urine specimens. The diagnostic accuracies of these assays on asymptomatic subjects, along with the ease of this collection method, suggest a role for these products as screening tools. The sensitivity of the Chlamydiazyme assay was lower than that claimed previously in symptomatic patients, with 5 of 24 positive specimens demonstrating false-negative results. In those cases, centrifugation of the original immunoassay aliquot material and then DFA examination confirmed specimen positivity. Urine immunoassay screening in combination with DFA confirmation (which was chosen because it has antibody epitopic specificity {{different from that of the}} primary assay) provides a high degree of diagnostic precision. The use of noninvasive collection methods could result in greater testing compliance among asymptomatic males and, subsequently, could reduce the incidences of both symptomatic and silent chlamydial infections...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMepolizumab, a humanized IgG 1 {{monoclonal}} antibody that blocks native homodimeric interleukin- 5 (IL- 5) from binding to the IL- 5 receptor, {{has recently been}} approved for treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. Our initial immunogenicity assay method for phase I and II studies utilized a bridging electrochemiluminescence format with biotin and ruthenium-labelled mepolizumab linked by anti-drug antibodies (ADA). We discovered that IL- 5 significantly increased in dosed subjects from a phase II study and that the increased IL- 5 was {{in the form of}} a drug-bound complex. We demonstrated that the elevated drug-bound IL- 5 produced false-positive response in the in vitro ADA assay, in which drug-bound IL- 5 dissociated and then bridged mepolizumab conjugates to yield positive signal. To eliminate the IL- 5 interference, we compared two strategies: a solid-phase immunodepletion of IL- 5 and an in-solution IL- 5 immunocompetition. We identified the best competitive antibody for each purpose. We found both methods demonstrated similar effectiveness in reducing the false positive signal in IL- 5 spiked samples; however, the in-solution immunocompetition for IL- 5 had fewer false positives in study samples. Additionally, the in-solution immunocompetition method was experimentally simpler to execute. We modified the ADA assay by adding a pre-treatment step with a mepolizumab competitive anti- IL- 5 antibody. Using this new method, we retested clinical samples from two phase II studies (MEA 112997 and MEA 114092). The confirmed ADA positive incidence was reduced from 29 % and 61 % to 1 % and 8 % with the modified in-solution immune inhibition method. Target interference is a fairly common problem facing immunogenicity testing, and target-induced false positive cannot be distinguished from true ADA response by the commonly used drug competitive <b>confirmation</b> <b>assay.</b> The approach and method used here for resolving target interference in ADA detection will be useful for differentiating between a true ADA response and target induced false positive as well as similar challenges in other programs...|$|E

40|$|RELIABLE IDENTIFICATION OF CARBAPENEMASE PRODUCING ENTEROBACTERIACEAE IS NECESSARY TO LIMIT THEIR SPREAD: This study {{aimed at}} {{developing}} a diagnostic flow-chart suitable for implementation {{in different types}} of clinical laboratories using phenotypic screening and confirmation tests. In total, 334 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates genetically characterized with respect to carbapenemase, extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL), and AmpC genes were analyzed. 142 / 334 isolates (42. 2 %) were suspicious for carbapenemase production, i. e. intermediate or resistant to ertapenem AND/OR meropenem AND/OR imipenem according to EUCAST clinical breakpoints (CBPs). A group of 193 / 334 isolates (57. 8 %) showing susceptibility to ertapenem AND meropenem AND imipenem was considered as negative control group for this study. CLSI and EUCAST carbapenem CBPs and the new EUCAST MEM screening cut-off were evaluated as screening parameters. ETP, MEM and IPM +/- aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) or EDTA combined-disc tests (CDTs), and the Carba NP-II test were evaluated as <b>confirmation</b> <b>assays.</b> EUCAST temocillin cut-offs were evaluated for OXA- 48 detection. The EUCAST MEM screening cut-off (< 25 mm) showed a sensitivity of 100 %. The ETP APBA-CDT on Muller-Hinton agar containing cloxacillin (MH-CLX) displayed 100 % sensitivity and specificity for class A carbapenemase confirmation. ETP and MEM EDTA-CDTs showed 100 % sensitivity and specificity for class B carbapenemases. Temocillin diameters/MIC testing on MH-CLX was highly specific for OXA- 48 producers. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the Carba NP-II test were 78. 9 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 98. 7 %, respectively. Combining the EUCAST MEM carbapenemase-screening cut-off (< 25 mm), ETP (or MEM) APBA- and EDTA-CDTs, and temocillin disk diffusion on MH-CLX agar promises excellent performance for carbapenemase detection...|$|R
40|$|Background: AmpC β-lactamases {{are often}} plasmid {{mediated}} that hydrolyze all β-lactam antibiotics except cefepime and carbapenems. Aim of the study: We aimed {{to evaluate the}} presence of AmpC β-lactamase among Enterobacteriaceae isolates separated from patients with nosocomial infections, and to detect the genetic basis for AmpC production in these strains. Subjects and methods: 50 AmpC β-lactamase Enterobacteriaceae were analyzed {{for the presence of}} AmpC production. Three phenotypic AmpC <b>confirmation</b> <b>assays</b> (AmpC E test, the disk approximation test, Amp C EDTA disc) were able to detect the majority of AmpC-positive strains correctly. Molecular detection of plasmid mediated AmpC by multiplex PCR was conducted on them. Results: The results show that from the 148 total isolates obtained from ICU admitted patients with suspected nosocomial infections, 50 (33. 8 %) were AmpC β-lactamase isolates. For the 50 AmpC isolates, all phenotypic Amp C tests gave a positive result. Among these isolates, plasmid encoded AmpC genes were detected by multiplex PCR in 46 (92 %) isolates, which included Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =  22) (47. 8 %), Escherichia coli (n =  15) (32. 6 %), and Proteus mirabilis (n =  9) (19. 6 %). One E. coli, one K. pneumoniae, and two P. mirabilis isolates showed no AmpC gene. The most prevalent AmpC gene was that belonging to family CMY- 1 which was detected in 73. 9 % (34 / 46) of all isolates. Conclusion: It could be concluded that: Amp C producing isolates among Enterobacteriaceae strains have been increasingly recognized in the Ain Shams University Hospital. Thus, molecular identification of the genes encoding AmpC would be essential for a reliable epidemiological investigation of their transmission in hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies in porcine sera against {{glycoprotein}} E (gE) of pseudorabies virus (PRV) {{are usually}} measured in blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) {{with one or}} two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against gE. Our aim was to develop a <b>confirmation</b> <b>assay</b> which is based on another principle and which is able to detect antibodies directed against most potential binding sites on gE with high specificity. Therefore, we developed an indirect double-antibody sandwich assay (IDAS) using recombinant gE expressed by baculovirus (BacgE 960). A fragment of the gE gene consisting of nucleotide positions + 60 to + 1020 of gE, coding for the major antigenic sites of gE but not the transmembrane region, was cloned behind the signal sequence of PRV gG and the p 10 promoter in a baculovirus vector. Immunoblot analysis showed that the expressed protein reacted with MAbs directed against five of the six antigenic sites on gE. Although the conformation of some antigenic sites, notably antigenic sites E and C, was not identical to their natural conformation, the expressed protein bound gE-specific antibodies in porcine sera in Western blots (immunoblots) and ELISAs. For the IDAS, a coating MAb directed against the nonimmunodominant antigenic site A on gE was chosen. A major obstacle in binding ELISAs, such as the IDAS, appeared to be the high nonspecific binding activity observed in porcine sera. As a result, sera could be tested only in relatively high dilutions in the BacgE 960 IDAS, in contrast to the testing of sera in blocking ELISAs. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed BacgE 960 IDAS were evaluated and compared with those of five commercially available blocking ELISAs by using several sets of sera of known PRV disease history. The BacgE 960 IDAS assay had a high diagnostic specificity and a moderate sensitivity. The five blocking ELISAs differed remarkably in sensitivity and specificity, thereby illustrating the need for standardization and confirmation. We conclude that the BacgE 960 IDAS is a useful and specific additional (confirmatory) test for the detection of antibodies to gE...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of {{immunoglobulin}} A (IgA) antibody {{responses to}} various Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen complexes, usually involving multiple serological assays, {{is important for}} the early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Through combination of two synthetic peptides representing immunodominant epitopes of EBNA 1 and viral capsid antigen (VCA) -p 18 we developed a one-step sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the specific detection of EBV reactive IgG and IgA antibodies in NPC patients (EBV IgG/IgA ELISA). Sera were obtained from healthy donors (n = 367), non-NPC head and neck cancer patients (n = 43), and biopsy-proven NPC patients (n = 296) of Indonesian and Chinese origin. Higher values of optical density at 450 nm for EBV IgG were observed in NPC patients compared to the healthy EBV carriers, but the large overlap limits its use for NPC diagnosis. Using either EBNA 1 or VCA-p 18 peptides alone IgA ELISA correctly identified 88. 5 % and 79. 8 % of Indonesian NPC patients, with specificities of 80. 1 % and 70. 9 %, whereas combined single-well coating with both peptides yielded sensitivity and specificity values of 90. 1 and 85. 4 %, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) for the combined EBNA 1 plus VCA EBV IgA ELISA were 78. 7 % and 93. 9 %, respectively. In the Indonesia panel, the level of EBV IgA reactivity was not associated with NPC tumor size, lymph node involvement, and metastasis stage, sex, and age group. In the China panel the sensitivity/specificity values were 86. 2 / 92. 0 % (EBNA 1 IgA) and 84. 1 / 90. 3 % (VCA-p 18 IgA) for single-peptide assays and 95. 1 / 90. 6 % for the combined VCA plus EBNA 1 IgA ELISA, with a PPV and an NPV for the combined EBV IgA ELISA of 95. 6 and 89. 3 %, respectively. Virtually all NPC patients had abnormal anti-EBV IgG diversity patterns as determined by immunoblot analysis. On the other hand, healthy EBV carriers with positive EBV IgA ELISA result showed normal IgG diversity patterns. By using EBV IgG immunoblot diversity as <b>confirmation</b> <b>assay</b> for EBV IgA ELISA-positive samples, the sensitivity and specificity for NPC diagnosis increased to 98 % and 99. 2 %, respectively, in the Indonesian NPC samples.

Prevalence rates of 32. 6 % and 41. 3 % {{were found for}} anti-c 100 / 3 and anti-HCV core antibodies, respectively, in patients with silent infections (Group 1). The rate of anti-c 100 / 3 in patients of Group 2 was 71. 15 % and reached 86. 5 % for anti-HCV core antibodies. The recognition of anti-c 100 / 3 and anti-core antibodies was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1.

Dois grupos de pacientes em tratamento hemodialítico foram avaliados quanto às respostas de anticorpos contra as proteínas não estrutural c 100 / 3 (anti-c 100 / 3) e estrutural core (anti-HCV core) do vírus da hepatite C (HCV). Quarenta e seis pacientes (Grupo 1) nunca apresentaram alterações dos níveis de alanina aminotransferase (ALT) durante o tratamento hemodialítico, ao passo que 52 pacientes (Grupo 2) têm ou já tiveram elevações desta enzima hepática. Em pacientes sem alterações bioquímicas evidentes (Grupo 1) foram encontradas prevalências de 32. 6 % e 41. 3 % para anti-c 100 / 3 e anti-HCV core, respectivamente. No Grupo 2, estas prevalências foram de 71, 15 % e 86, 5 %. Um teste composto de peptídeos estruturais e não estruturais imobilizados separadamente e dispostos em bandas paralelas em fitas de nailon, foi usado como teste confirmatório. A infecção pelo HBV, avaliada pela presença de anticorpos anti-HBc foi observada em 39. 8 % dos pacientes; 6 eram portadores crônicos de HBsAg e 13 possuiam anti-HBs adquiridos naturalmente. O tempo de tratamento hemodialítico teve correlação com a positividade para anti-HCV. A prevalência de 96, 7 % (Grupo 2) foi encontrada em pacientes que tiveram mais de 5 anos de tratamento. Nossos resultados sugerem que o anti-HCV core é um marcador mais preciso para detectar a infecção pelo HCV do que o anti-c 100 / 3. Apesar dos riscos associados com a duração do tratamento e transfusões sanguíneas, uma significante disseminação não transfusional do HCV parece ocorrer dentro da unidade.

40|$|The Hedgehog {{signaling}} pathway, {{first discovered}} in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, was later found to be largely conserved in vertebrates and is crucial within diverse aspects of animal development, {{as well as for}} stem cells’ maintenance. Dysregulation of the pathway has been linked to various diseases, e. g. autoimmune disorders and cancer. Modern drug discovery aims to identify small molecule modulators of protein functions, because such molecules may become new drug candidates targeting cancers dependent on aberrant Hedgehog signaling. Prior to this study a high-throughput screen of a compound library consisting of 20, 000 unique structures was performed. Assay conditions designed to e%amine Hedgehog activity reduction resulted in 96 compound hits.

Two thousand uninjured drivers (Study 1) who had provided an evidential blood alcohol sample, were also tested for cannabis, methamphetamine, benzodiazepines and morphine to determine the incidence of drug use by drinking drivers. To determine the proportion of drivers killed in car crashes who had used drugs and/or alcohol, two hundred and twenty nine fatally injured drivers (Study 2) were tested for alcohol, cannabis, methamphetamine, morphine, benzodiazepines and neutral and basic medicinal drugs that might have an effect on driving performance. Alcohol, cannabis and their combination were found to be the most prevalent drugs used by drivers. The analytical methodologies used were developed and validated by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd., where this work was carried out. These techniques involved liquid-liquid and liquid-solid extractions, immunoassays and chromatographic techniques for screening and <b>confirmation</b> <b>assays.</b> The {{statistical analysis}} of the results was done under the supervision of the Institute's biostatistician.
