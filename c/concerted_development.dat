40|$|Animal {{tissue and}} organ {{development}} requires the orchestration of cell movements, {{including those of}} interconnected cell groups, termed collective cell movements. Such movements are incredibly diverse. Recent work suggests that two core cellular properties, cell-cell adhesion and contractility, can largely determine geometry, packing, sorting, and rearrangement of epithelial cell layers. Two additional force-generating properties, the ability to generate cell protrusions and cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, contribute to active motility. These mechanical properties can be regulated independently in cells, suggesting {{that they can be}} employed in a combinatorial manner.

This challenging process requires support framework in the HLS flow to enable fast and efficient pinpointing of the incorrectness in the tool. In this paper, we present a debug framework that uses just-in-time (JIT) traces and automated insertion of verification code into the generated RTL to assist in debugging an HLS tool.

40|$|Abstract Background Interpretation of {{comprehensive}} DNA microarray data sets is a challenging task for biologists and process engineers where scientific assistance of statistics and bioinformatics is essential. Interdisciplinary cooperation and <b>concerted</b> <b>development</b> of software-tools for simplified and accelerated data {{analysis and interpretation}} {{is the key to}} overcome the bottleneck in data-analysis workflows. This approach is exemplified by gcExplorer an interactive visualization toolbox based on cluster analysis. Clustering is an important tool in gene expression data analysis to find groups of co-expressed genes which can finally suggest functional pathways and interactions between genes. The visualization of gene clusters gives practitioners an understanding of the cluster structure of their data and makes it easier to interpret the cluster results. Results In this study the interactive visualization toolbox gcExplorer is applied to the interpretation of E. coli microarray data. The data sets derive from two fedbatch experiments conducted in order to investigate the impact of different induction strategies on the host metabolism and product yield. The software enables direct graphical comparison of these two experiments. The identification of potentially interesting gene candidates or functional groups is substantially accelerated and eased. Conclusion It was shown that gcExplorer is a very helpful tool to gain a general overview of microarray experiments. Interesting gene expression patterns can easily be found, compared among different experiments and combined with information about gene function from publicly available databases. </p...|$|E

It follows a literature review conducted {{as part of the}} same tender, delivered in January 2012. Conclusion The Temple Review urged that medical education and training make ‘every moment count’, meaning that medical education should be embedded in medical practice, and that service delivery should be aware of its educational component. This is not yet the case for many trainees, and there is an increasing separation between work and education that may be adding new stressors to the trainee population. Moves to further implement the recommendations of the Temple Review (a consultant-delivered service, <b>concerted</b> faculty <b>development,</b> and greater integration of education into service) should address some of the concerns arising from this research. If working time is to be considered as a component of educational governance and quality improvement, monitoring processes need to be reviewed, and their acceptance and trust by organisations and trainees ensured, to guarantee that any links between working time and education are reliably identified. The GMC has power as the regulator of medical education, and may be able to redress the balance of education and service through its role in quality assurance. Education and training should be placed at the heart of service delivery. Education is not seen as at the expense of patient care, but as a means of maintaining it...|$|R
40|$|How does aid impact {{democracy}} in sub-Saharan Africa? Drawing on existing literature, this study elaborates {{on the various}} channels, direct and indirect, through which development and democracy aid has influenced transitions to multi-party regimes and democratic consolidation within the region. The study's findings are at least threefold. First, development aid was effective at promoting democratic transitions during the 1990 s in those African countries that were beset by economic crisis, faced domestic discontent, or possessed a high dependence on aid, as well as when major donors took <b>concerted</b> action. Second, <b>development</b> and democracy aid demonstrate disparate effects on key elements of consolidation, including the avoidance of democratic erosion, the enhancement of accountability, {{and the promotion of}} competitive party systems. Development aid's most direct influence is with respect to preventing democratic backsliding, though this is often done in an inconsistent manner. Democracy aid plays a more direct role with respect to enhancing accountability and party systems but, its cumulative impact remains hindered by the dispersion of assistance across different activities and its temporal focus on elections.

40|$|Progress {{in human}} {{development}} {{is threatened by}} the complexities of global environmental change - a defining challenge of our time. Appropriate societal responses are needed to address disturbances and increasing vulnerability of social-ecological systems. This changing context calls current development thinking into question and requires new approaches, policies, and tools to cope with growing uncertainty. With a focus on capacities instead of vulnerabilities, an approach is needed emphasizing the role of communities in planning interventions and strengthening community resilience. This research draws on vulnerability, social-ecological systems and drylands development theory to advance an integrated understanding of resilience at community level and its role towards sustainable development. To develop a general approach for development actors to characterize a community's resilience and plan locally targeted interventions is the overall objective of this research. A participatory approach towards defining and assessing community resilience forms the basis, as it is assumed this would enable development actors to more efficiently address development concerns and empower communities to strengthen their resilience. Underlying factors that determine community resilience in selected dryland communities in Tigray, northeastern Ethiopia are identified. Here, most of the population depends on subsistence agriculture, while food insecurity and poverty persist despite <b>concerted</b> regional <b>development</b> efforts. This research compares and consolidates local perceptions of determinants of community resilience that {{form the basis for}} guidelines towards a methodological framework for determining levels of community resilience in Tigray. The guidelines were used to compare levels of community resilience of communities, with implications for operationalizing community resilience in the context of drylands development practice. Findings reflect the importance of recognizing that resilience is not about maintaining a status quo, but about addressing how societies can develop in a changing environment. Prominence of resilience thinking can promote a development practice better suited to address the challenges and opportunities that changes create for poor dryland communities. Resilience thinking does not provide quick solutions, but contributes a long-term, multi-dimensional perspective of building capacities for improved responses to current needs and future change. Resilience is not a solution in itself but can contribute towards developing more resilient trajectories for drylands development...|$|R

A particular focus is placed on People Mapping, a hands-on practice in which people represent their own place of living on maps or relief models according to their local knowledge, everyday experience and sense of belonging. Geographic Information Technologies are here analysed as an added value to People Mapping, to make its outcomes more communicative, authoritative and, in particular, reusable as a base to build upon by planners.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the legacy of}} Derrida?s thought {{in the context of}} the future challenge of contemporary politics: the construction of world polity. It rehearses, first, the steps of the recent ?reconciliation? between J?rgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida, and suggests, from out of the terms of this reconciliation, that the deconstruction of reason has been caught out by the contemporary movements of irrationalism. It then deepens this historical viewpoint by giving a neo-Marxist account of modern history in economic and political terms and by setting up from out of this history the continuing problematic of modernity above and beyond recent distinctions between the modern and the postmodern. The third section of the paper returns to Derrida?s late work on world democracy, underlines its critical rigour with regard to modernity, the dilemma of law and world sovereignty, and shows how this rigor can be considered to address critically our future political challenge. The fourth section then contends that the way in which Derridean thought disposes itself to the real but nevertheless occludes <b>concerted</b> <b>development</b> of our historical actuality and, in this sense, falls short of the critical. I conclude, accordingly, by arguing for a renewed engagement between critical philosophy and social science, with a focus on the promotion of international institutions and strong interdisciplinary work between international relations, international economics, and political philosophy.

40|$|Efficiency {{in the use}} of the {{herbivore}} {{resources in}} Asia is discussed in the context of their diversity, extent of current use and potential contribution. The reference to herbivores includes various ruminants and equines, both indigenous and introduced. Among these, cattle have received overwhelming research and development attention, in comparison to buffaloes, goats and sheep. Camels and equines have received little or no attention and resource support. Increased contribution from herbivores requires more <b>concerted</b> <b>development</b> based on clear objectives of production, and their potential importance in sustainable systems that are closely identified with more efficient and intensive use of the feed resources. Prevailing ruminant production systems are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future since such changes would need to be supported by large resource inputs. However, shifts within the systems are likely due to intensification, increased demand for animal products, consumer preferences, marketing opportunities, sustainability and environmental integrity. Particular emphasis therefore needs to be given in Asia to the application of the results of feeding and nutrition experiments and rural-oriented developing strategies that can give priority to more efficient use of available feeds on-farm. The elements of extending information on fibrous crop residues to on-farm situations, including criteria for such activities, are considered in two phases. 1) The information needed by farmers and their advisers, and 2) Mechanisms for delivering information to farmers. Increasing the contribution from herbivores requires more balance development of these resources based on priorities, relevance to agriculture, and national needs...|$|E
50|$|Although these {{developments}} were well known within the industry, only the US Army Air Corps and US Navy put any <b>concerted</b> effort into <b>development.</b> During the 1920s, the Navy funded {{development of the}} Norden bombsight while the Army funded development of the Sperry O-1. Both systems were generally similar; a bomb sight consisting of a small telescope was mounted on a stabilizing platform to keep the sighting head stable. A separate mechanical computer was {{used to calculate the}} aim point. The aim point was fed back to the sight, which automatically rotated the telescope to the correct angle to account for drift and aircraft movement, keeping the target still in the view. When the bomb aimer sighted through the telescope, he could see any residual drift and relay this to the pilot, or later, feed that information directly into the autopilot. Simply moving the telescope to keep the target in view had the side effect of fine-tuning the windage calculations continuously, and thereby greatly increasing their accuracy. For a variety of reasons, the Army dropped their interest in the Sperry, and features from the Sperry and Norden bombsights were folded into new models of the Norden. The Norden then equipped almost all US high-level bombers, most notably the B-17 Flying Fortress. In tests, these bombsights were able to generate fantastic accuracy. In practice, however, operational factors seriously upset them, to the point that pinpoint bombing using the Norden was eventually abandoned.|$|R

The {{research is}} based on evidence from documentary evidence, web search, and the opinions of FM stakeholders such as practitioners, academicians, professional bodies’ officials, researchers and government officials in Tanzania. Stakeholders were requested to rank {{the progress of the}} key factors essential {{for the development of the}} industry which include FM Organisation Practice, FM Supply Market, FM Education, FM Professional Bodies, FM Research and the FM Business Environment. The research also assesses the integration between the factors and their overall contributions towards the development of the FM industry within the country. The research identified that the FM profession in Tanzania is disintegrated. There is no single unifying professional body. Service providers, suppliers, and other FM practitioners identify themselves with different profession bodies. In the case of outsourcing; the use of traditional vendor-client contracts are dominant. The profession is barely known. Generally, there is a lack of awareness of the potentials of FM as a profession. On the brighter side, the government of Tanzania has recently enacted a law that will regulate Public-Private Partnership and Private Financing Initiatives which will further create opportunities for development of FM. Despite this <b>development,</b> <b>concerted</b> efforts are required from FM stakeholders to deal with the identified challenges to enable the country to reap the benefits of FM as strategic tool in dealing with resource allocation issue.

40|$|Linking {{smallholder}} {{farmers to}} large enterprises {{could be a}} powerful mechanism to improve input and output markets {{as well as other}} productivity-enhancing services for liquidity constrained smallholders. Dairy hubs promoted by East African Dairy Development project are collective farmer-owned milk bulking and/or chilling plants through which farmers get access to output markets and inputs as well as other services necessary for their dairy enterprises. The hubs act as a linkage between large processors and smallholder dairy farmers. They enable farmers to supply milk to large dairy processors who are emerging key players in the East African dairy industry. In addition to the different forms of linkages with large processors, these hubs also differ in their level of growth toward sustainability. In light of this background, this work aims to provide evidence on the effects, at farm level, of different types of linkages between smallholder dairy farmers and large processors through dairy hubs. The study uses cross-sectional survey data collected from 993 smallholder livestock keeping households living within the dairy hubs’ catchment areas in Kenya and Uganda. Statistical tests on technical efficiency estimates from dairy farm enterprises were conducted in order to provide evidence {{of the effects of the}} types of processor linkages on the performance of the dairy farm enterprises. The results provide evidence of no strong influence at farm levels that can be attributed to different forms of linkages with processor that dairy hubs adopt. Moreover, though hub sustainability is directly linked to the producer organization’s efficiency level, our results show that it does not sufficiently translate to more productive farmers. These findings call for <b>concerted</b> efforts by <b>development</b> agents in the dairy sector, policy makers, and even large processors to intervene in order to support improved farm performance. As evident from the study, one direct policy tool at the disposal of these agents is extension messages. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{formation}} is a pivotal process in plant reproduction and dispersal. It begins with megagametophyte {{development in the}} ovule, followed by fertilization and subsequently coordinated development of embryo, endosperm, and maternal seed coat. Two closely related MADS-box genes, SHATTERPROOF 1 and 2 (SHP 1 and SHP 2) are involved in specifying ovule integument identity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The MADS box gene ARABIDOPSIS BSISTER (ABS or TT 16) is required, together with SEEDSTICK (STK) {{for the formation of}} endothelium, part of the seed coat and innermost tissue layer formed by the maternal plant. Little is known about the genetic interaction of SHP 1 and SHP 2 with ABS and the coordination of endosperm and seed coat development. In this work, mutant and expression analysis shed light on this aspect of <b>concerted</b> <b>development.</b> Triple tt 16 shp 1 shp 2 mutants produce malformed seedlings, seed coat formation defects, fewer seeds, and mucilage reduction. While shp 1 shp 2 mutants fail to coordinate the timely development of ovules, tt 16 mutants show less peripheral endosperm after fertilization. Failure in coordinated division of the innermost integument layer in early ovule stages leads to inner seed coat defects in tt 16 and tt 16 shp 1 shp 2 triple mutant seeds. An antagonistic action of ABS and SHP 1 /SHP 2 is observed in inner seed coat layer formation. Expression analysis also indicates that ABS represses SHP 1, SHP 2, and FRUITFUL expression. Our work shows that the evolutionary conserved Bsister genes are required not only for endothelium but also for endosperm development and genetically interact with SHP 1 and SHP 2 in a partially antagonistic manner...|$|E
40|$|Embryogenesis in {{the beetle}} Tribolium castaneum {{relies on the}} {{morphogenetic}} movements of the two extraembryonic membranes, amnion and serosa. It is due to their function and <b>concerted</b> <b>development</b> that the embryo is able to survive. During formation of both membranes, their movements include tissue expansion, as well as intra-tissue fusion and inter-tissue separation. In late development, the coordinated withdrawal and subsequent degeneration of both membranes facilitates embryonic dorsal closure, during which the amnion replaces the serosa as a transient yolk cover. To {{learn more about the}} amnion, the transcription factor Tc pannier (Tc-pnr). The wild type expression pattern of Tc-pnr was determined and the observed defects after parental RNA interference were analyzed. Tc-pnr deficient embryos display a pronounced hole in the dorsal cuticle and a characteristic bending towards the dorsal side. This specific phenotype {{is the result of a}} defect during dorsal closure. In Drosophila melanogaster, the dorsal hole is due to a loss of Dm decapentaplegic (Dm-dpp) expression in the dorsal most cells. It could be shown that in Tribolium, Tc-pnr and Tc-dpp are co-expressed in corresponding cells of the dorsal ectoderm as well. This suggests that Tc-pnr has an essential function in dorsal closure. After loss of Tc-pnr expression in the amnion, where it was shown to be expressed at least until mid embryogenesis, the amnion displays various defects around the process of dorsal closure. Intriguingly, the amnion ruptures ectopically and withdraws independent from the serosa. To investigate the disturbed interplay between the serosa and the amnion, an existing enhancer trap line expressing EGFP in the amnion was modified, by using a combination of CRISPR/Cas 9 and homology directed repair, to express DsRed 2 instead. The DsRed 2 expressing amnion line can now be crossed to another line expressing EGFP in the serosa...|$|E

Using the sensor package to track orientation and a motion-capture system to track the marker positions, a model of the surrogate is placed in the virtual environment at a position which corresponds with the real-world location relative to the user's VR Head Mounted Display (HMD). A set of control mechanisms is then projected onto the surface of the surrogate such that to the user, immersed in VR, the control interface appears to be attached to the object they are holding. The VT project was taken from an early stage where the sensor package, motion-capture system, and physical surrogate had been constructed or tested individually but not yet combined or incorporated into the virtual environment. My contribution was to combine the pieces of hardware, write software to incorporate each piece of position or orientation data into a coherent description of the object's location in space, place the virtual analogue accordingly, and project the control interface onto it, resulting in a functioning object which has both a physical and a virtual presence. Additionally, the virtual environment was enhanced with two live video feeds from cameras mounted on the robotic device being used as an example target of the virtual interface. The working VT allows users to naturally interact with a control interface with little to no training and without the issues found in previous efforts...|$|E
40|$|While {{biologists}} {{have been aware}} of the existence of native Mexican trouts for over a century, they have received little study. The few early studies that did muchmore than mention their existence began in the 1930 s and continued into the early 1960 s, focusing primarily on distributional surveys and taxonomic analyses. Starting in the 1980 s the Baja California rainbow trout became the subject of more detailed studies, but very little remains known of mainland trouts of the Sierra Madre Occidental. We review earlier studies and report on our own collections and observations made between 1975 and 2000. We present newly discovered historical evidence that leads us to conclude that a "lost" cutthroat trout, a lineage not previously known from Mexico, was collected {{more than a century ago}} from headwaters of the Rio Conchos (a major tributary of the Rio Grande (= Rio Bravo)), a basin not previously considered to harbor a native trout. We review the last century of regional natural resource management and discuss our own observations of trout habitats. Impacts of logging, road building and overgrazing are widespread and expanding. Many streams suffer from heavy erosion, siltation and contamination, and though long-term hydrologic data are generally not available, there is evidence of decreased discharge in many streams. These problems appear related to region-wide land management practices as well as recent regional drought. Trout culture operations using exotic rainbow trout have rapidly proliferated throughout the region, threatening genetic introgression and/or competition with native forms and predation on them. Knowledge of distribution, abundance, relationships and taxonomy, not to mention ecology and population biology, of native trouts of the Sierra Madre Occidental remains inadequate. Vast areas of most mainland drainages are still unexplored by fish collectors, and even rudimentary information regarding basic biology, ecology and population structure of stocks remains lacking. Concentrated exploration, research and management of this long overlooked and undervalued resource are all urgently needed. The history of natural resources exploitation that placed so many native trouts of the western United States on threatened and endangered species lists is repeating itself in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Without <b>concerted</b> action and <b>development</b> of region-wide socio-economic solutions for current, largely non-sustainable resource management practices, native Mexican trout gene pools will soon be in grave danger of extinction...|$|R
40|$|Objective Emerging economies like India are {{investing}} heavily in rapid development of {{urban transport infrastructure}} for public transport. Though the initial efforts started with three modes - metro rail, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and surface rail; currently investments are being made mainly in metro rail and BRT. In spite of lack of patronage, surface rail, which helped develop many cities in India, is playing {{a prominent role in}} movement of urban commuters. The objective of research is to assess the viability of surface rail for movement of urban commuters in comparison to metro rail and BRT. To achieve this objective research questions asked were: •	How do cost, capacity and cost per unit capacity compare between metro rail, surface rail and BRT systems? •	What is the current urban form of Indian cities and policy framework to accommodate future urbanisation? •	What does this imply for planning of public transport? •	Can the surface rail serve the city core in addition to serving the peripheral areas? If so, what should be the planning strategies for the surface rail systems? •	What are the implications for public transport in India and can the BRT, metro rail and surface rail be symbiotically combined to generate a more purposeful and distinct public transport for Indian UAs? If so, what are the investment implications? •	If the answer to the above is affirmative, what policy measures are required to integrate surface rail into transit systems of Indian UAs? Methodology The methodology adapted was : •	Comparative assessment of cost, capacity and cost per unit capacity for the three modes which established that cost per unit capacity for surface rail is one twentieth of metro and one fourth of BRT •	Review of urbanisation trends and policies •	Finally, review of rail network in the 50 urban agglomerations (UAs) with population more than million to see the extent of rail network serving them and whether it can serve the core city. Results The results indicate that during the 12 th plan 747 kilometres (kms) of metro rail and 989 kms of regional rail systems are being developed to serve 10 large UAs. As against this, by reallocation of the resources a more elaborate urban rail network of 6628 kms can be upgraded and 3000 kms of new system can be added in all the 49 UAs. Another major finding is the hidden benefits given to metro rail compared to surface rail systems. Implications for Policy Immediate policy implication is to undertake surface rail development on priority before metro rail development is taken up. Policy implication would be to set up an institutional mechanism for fast development of surface rail. This would be possible if apex policy making bodies of Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) for urban transport, Ministry of Railways (MoR) for surface rail and the Planning Commissions jointly review and formulate guidelines for surface rail and metro rail projects. This would facilitate <b>concerted</b> action for <b>development</b> of surface rail at all levels. ...|$|R
40|$|In modern times, {{not many}} primary {{industries}} have consistently recorded high yearly growth {{over a period}} of two decades. Aquaculture has sustained a global growth, continues to grow, and is expected to increasingly fill the shortfall in aquatic food products resulting from static or declining capture fisheries and population increase well into the year 2025. Its further growth and development will have to occur under a different socio-economic milieu in the new millennium. The basic paradigm changes will be from an increased production at almost any cost, to a sustainable increase in production with minimal environmental perturbations. Despite such paradigm changes, aquaculture will increasingly contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and social equity. The contribution of aquaculture to world food supply of aquatic products has been increasing over the past 10 years, in comparison to capture fisheries, growing from 15 to 28 percent of total production between 1988 and 1997. As the bulk of aquaculture is rural and subsistence, it plays a major role as a provider of direct and indirect employment to the rural poor and, thereby, to poverty alleviation. In many developing countries, aquaculture provides opportunities for diversification on agriculture farms and productive use to otherwise idle land during certain seasons. The main cause for the upsurge in the sector has been the transformation of aquaculture from an “art” form to a “science”. This brought many advantages, ranging from less dependence on wild stock to the development of techniques that optimized yields, such as polyculture, or enabled the achievement of high yields with low inputs. Two major developments also enabled the sector to maintain growth momentum, appropriate institutional frameworks and <b>concerted</b> research and <b>development.</b> Regions or continents have many commonalities. These include the predominance of finfish among the cultivated species, and the predominance of species that feed lower in the food chain, although shrimp, which does not naturally feed high in the trophic level but is mostly reared on artificial feed, has become a significant culture commodity. Notable differences, however, include the fact that all regions, except Africa and the countries of the former USSR, have recorded a significant increase in per capita production between 1984 and 1997. While Asia continues to dominate world aquaculture in overall tonnage, as well as in every major commodity, South America has registered a very high (72. 8 percent) average annual growth between 1984 and 1997. The global and regional trends over the last 20 years in the sector from a number of perspectives, such as production trends, contribution of aquaculture to aquatic food consumption etc., are evaluated. Based on these different trends and in the light of changing socio-economic conditions globally, and in particular, in developing nations, the potential changes in the sector in the new millennium are highlighted. Finally, projections are made for the next 20 years, where opportunities, constraints and strategies for achieving the targets are presented and discussed. <br /...|$|R
