5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at the National <b>Coalition</b> <b>Against</b> Censorship. In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based censorship of material on the Internet was far too broad and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National <b>Coalition</b> <b>Against</b> Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Author Marjorie Heins, an {{attorney}} {{with a focus on}} civil liberties, received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1967.

5|$|In 1806 the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Charles William Ferdinand, was fatally wounded {{during the}} Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. Following Prussia's defeat and the {{collapse}} of the Fourth <b>Coalition</b> <b>against</b> Napoleon, his duchy remained under French control. Rather than permit the Duke's heir, Frederick William, to succeed to his father's title, Napoleon seized the duchy and, in 1807, incorporated it into his newly created model Kingdom of Westphalia ruled by his brother Jérôme. Two years later in 1809 the Fifth <b>Coalition</b> <b>against</b> Napoleon was formed between the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom. The dispossessed Frederick William, who had been a strenuous critic of French domination in Germany, seized this opportunity to seek Austrian help to raise an armed force. To finance this venture he mortgaged his principality in Oels. In its initial incarnation (dated to 25 July 1809), the 2300-strong 'free' corps consisted of two battalions of infantry, one Jäger battalion, a company of sharpshooters, and a mixed cavalry contingent including hussars and uhlans.|$|E
5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new <b>coalition</b> <b>against</b> France, and by April 1805, Britain and Russia had signed an alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Karijotas {{was baptized}} as Mikhail and {{inherited}} Navahrudak in Black Ruthenia. In 1348 {{he was sent}} by Algirdas to Khan Jani Beg to negotiate a <b>coalition</b> <b>against</b> the Teutonic Knights, but was handed over to Moscow for ransom. He died about 1363. It is uncertain how many children he had: the number varies between four and nine.|$|E

5|$|The Free Expression Policy Project (FEPP) is an {{organization}} devoted to assisting researchers with assembling information related to freedom of speech, media democracy, and copyright, and advocating for these issues.

5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all {{the blame}} on M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, {{it is clear that}} Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the <b>coalition</b> <b>against</b> Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First <b>Coalition</b> <b>against</b> France in April 1792, Schmitt was a staff officer in the main Imperial army in the Austrian Netherlands. He distinguished himself in the defense of the pass of the Croix-aux-Bois (14 September 1792) and in the battles of Raismes and Vicoigne on (both on May 8, 1793). On 3 September 1793, after his promotion to colonel, he served under Field Marshal Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. In the autumn of 1794, Schmitt organized the retreat of the main Imperial Army, now under the command of Coburg's successor, Feldzeugmeister Count Clerfayt from their untenable positions in the Austrian Netherlands eastward to the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|Demonstrators in Milwaukee protested peacefully against Trump and Senator Ron Johnson, and {{in support}} of {{immigration}} and women's rights. They marched from Zeidler Union Square to the Federal Building. Milwaukee <b>Coalition</b> <b>Against</b> Trump organized the demonstration; Citizen Action Organizing Cooperative was also represented. Mystic, Connecticut held a protest of around 60 demonstrators who marched through the downtown area. In Rapid City, South Dakota, hundreds of anti-Trump and Trump supporters turned out at a rally that began at noon. The groups stood opposite {{each other at the}} intersection of Omaha Street and Mount Rushmore Road, near Memorial Park. The event was organized by Joyce Patton.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{participation}} of the three Smolensk regiments, Russians saw the battle as a victory of a Polish–Lithuanian–Russian <b>coalition</b> <b>against</b> invading Germans. Chronicler Jan Długosz praised the Smolensk banners, who fought bravely and were the only banners from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania not to retreat. In Soviet historiography, the Battle of Grunwald was styled as a racial struggle between Slavs and Germanics. The Teutonic Knights were portrayed as the medieval forerunners of Hitler's armies, while the battle itself was seen as the medieval counterpart to the Battle of Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity to form a new <b>coalition</b> <b>against</b> France. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge, Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer and {{his wife}} were both Republicans in the 1940s. After {{witnessing}} political corruption and voter fraud in their own ward and around the city, they became disillusioned with the party organization in the city and joined the reform effort led by Joseph S. Clark, Jr., and Richardson Dilworth. Clark and Dilworth brought together Democrats, independents, and disaffected Republicans like Sawyer in a <b>coalition</b> <b>against</b> the Republican political machine, which they regarded as irredeemably corrupt. In 1949, Sawyer served as a Democratic committeeman and Clark and Dilworth won city offices that year.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National <b>Coalition</b> <b>Against</b> Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E
5|$|Tautvilas, Edivydas, and Vykintas {{formed a}} {{powerful}} coalition with the Samogitians, the Livonian Order, Daniel of Galicia (Tautvilas and Edivydas' brother-in-law), and Vasilko of Volhynia {{in opposition to}} Mindaugas. Only Poles, invited by Daniel, declined {{to take part in}} the <b>coalition</b> <b>against</b> the Lithuanians. The dukes of Galicia and Volhynia managed to gain control over Black Ruthenia, an area ruled by Mindaugas' son Vaišvilkas. Tautvilas traveled to Riga, where he was baptized by the Archbishop. In 1250, the Order organized two major raids, one against Nalša land and the other against the domains of Mindaugas and those parts of Samogitia that still supported him.|$|E
50|$|Von Hügel {{was born}} in Regensburg, Bavaria, on 25 April 1795.

5|$|Aldona (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name {{is known}} {{only from the}} {{writings}} of the 16th century chronicler Maciej Stryjkowski) married Casimir III of Poland, son of Władysław I of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The marriage took place on either 30 April or 16 October 1325, and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish–Lithuanian <b>coalition</b> <b>against</b> the Teutonic Knights (an alliance foreshadowing the Union of Krewo in 1385 and the Union of Lublin in 1569, with the latter resulting in a stable and powerful new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). This preliminary coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, but {{there is no evidence of}} military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz {{volunteered to}} help defend Ceuta against the Moors in 1790 {{and was given}} command of an {{artillery}} battery. He remained in North Africa {{to assist with the}} defence of Oran in 1791, spending part of the time with a unit of miners. Daoíz was commended by his superiors, including artillery Brigadier Andres Aznar, for his courage and zeal in the battles and was promoted to lieutenant on 28 February 1792. After Spain joined the First <b>Coalition</b> <b>against</b> Revolutionary France, Daoíz participated in the War of Roussillon, in the Pyrenees, from March 1794 but was captured in a French counterattack on 25 November 1794. He was held as a prisoner of war at Toulouse where he turned down an offer of freedom and a commission in the French Army, which was short of artillery officers. After the Peace of Basel ended the war between France and Spain on 22 July 1795, Daoíz was released and made his way back to El Puerto de Santa Maria.|$|E
40|$|Contemporary historians usually {{attribute}} the East India Company's military success in India to its military strength. In contrast, we argue that, on its own, military strength was a mixed blessing: {{it could have}} {{led to the formation of}} <b>coalitions</b> <b>against</b> the Company. This did not happen because the Company's commitments to Indian regimes were more credible than their commitments to each other. In this sense, commitment was the key to conquest. ...|$|R
50|$|The peace {{signed in}} 1428 inaugurated {{a period of}} {{internal}} crisis, as Dan had to defend himself against Radu Prasnaglava, who led {{the first in a}} series of boyar <b>coalitions</b> <b>against</b> established princes. Victorious in 1431 (the year when the boyar-backed Alexandru I Aldea took the throne), boyars were dealt successive blows by Vlad II Dracul (1436-1442; 1443-1447), who nevertheless attempted to compromise between the Porte and the Holy Roman Empire.|$|R
