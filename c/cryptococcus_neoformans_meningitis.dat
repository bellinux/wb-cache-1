40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{document}} the trend of AIDS-associated <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> <b>meningitis</b> (CM) in Kigali, Rwanda, during 1983 - 1992, and to highlight some diagnostic and epidemiological features of the disease. METHODS: during the study period, 3476 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 2824 adults (1578 men, 1246 women) were analysed in the Laboratory of Microbiology at the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, Rwanda, Central Africa, using direct examination, culture and detection of the cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in the CSF. RESULTS: CM was diagnosed among 549 (19 %) patients (347 men, 202 women) and {{was by far the}} leading cause of meningitis before Neisseria meningitidis (n= 115), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n= 68), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n= 26). E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, non-typhoid Salmonella (n=l 5) and streptococci (n= 4). The number of CM increased from one case in 1983 to 130 new cases in 1992. All 293 tested CM patients had HIV- 1 antibodies. The male/female ratio declined from 3. 31 during 1983 - 1987 to 1. 58 during 1988 - 1992. CM showed a seasonal fluctuation, the highest number of infections being observed during the long rainy season. The sensitivity and specificity of the latex test for diagnosing CM was 98 % and 99 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: Caution is of {{paramount}} importance in the interpretation of flow cytometric white blood cell counts in specimens with a high lymphocyte percentage {{as it is in the}} interpretation of bacterial counts in hemorrhagic and ventricular drainage CSF specimens. Recently, flow cytometry using a semiconductor laser along with forward and sideward scatter detection and also a dedicated bacterial channel has been developed (Sysmex UF- 1000 i). We explored the possible applications of this novel approach in the differential diagnosis of meningitis. Methods: Flow cytometry, microscopy and biochemical data of 161 CSF samples were analyzed. Microbiological analysis was performed in 53 suspected cases of meningitis. Results: Good agreement for leukocytes was obtained between UF- 1000 i (p= 0. 614) and UF- 100 (p= 0. 582) and microscopy and between both flow cytometers (p= 0. 734). Lymphocytes were correctly classified as WBC by UF- 1000 i. Bacterial count on UF- 1000 i showed to be reliable in hemorrhagic samples and in samples collected by ventricular drainage for which interference by blood platelets and cell debris forms a known caveat on UF- 100. Bacterial background signal in sterile CSF samples was absent on UF- 1000 i. One case of <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> <b>meningitis,</b> missed by UF- 100 was properly detected by UF- 1000 i.

40|$|<b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> causes <b>meningitis</b> in 6 to 8 % of {{individuals}} with AIDS. Recently, immunotherapeutic modalities including antibody therapy have been proposed {{for the treatment of}} cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients. This is a rational approach because existing antifungal agents fail to eradicate the infection in the setting of profound immunosuppression. Both murine and human antibodies elicited by the investigational cryptococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine glucuronoxylomannan-tetanus toxoid (GXM-TT) {{have been shown to be}} biologically functional in different model systems. The human immunoglobulin M (lambda) GXM monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2 E 9 expresses idiotypes that are also found in naturally occurring anti-GXM antibodies and opsonic GXM-TT sera. However, the specificity of human anti-GXM antibodies and their possible role in protection against cryptococcosis are not known. In an effort to discover epitopes that are recognized by human anti-GXM antibodies, we screened a random decapeptide phage display library with the human anti-GXM MAb 2 E 9. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) -based screening method led to the selection of phages with peptide inserts that bound 2 E 9 and inhibited 2 E 9 -GXM binding. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of these phages revealed an increased frequency of combinations of QTGLD residues. Inhibition ELISAs demonstrated that phages with QTG/TL/D motifs inhibited 2 E 9 -GXM binding better than phages with different motifs. A peptide synthesized from one of the inhibitory phages, peptide 13 (GMDGT QLDRW), inhibited GXM binding to solid-phase 2 E 9 and 2 E 9 binding to solid-phase GXM. Peptide 13 also inhibited the GXM binding of GXM-TT immune sera and naturally occurring serum antibodies from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -negative, but not HIV-positive, individuals. Taken together, our data indicate that the peptide epitopes selected by 2 E 9 mimic GXM epitopes and that peptide 13 may be a mimotope of a GXM epitope that is recognized by human anti-GXM antibodies...|$|R

40|$|The {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> causes life-threatening <b>meningitis</b> in immunocompromised individuals. The {{expression of}} virulence factors, including capsule and melanin, {{is in part}} regulated by the cyclic-AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signal transduction pathway. In this study, we investigated the influence of PKA on {{the composition of the}} intracellular proteome to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the regulation that underpins virulence. Through quantitative proteomics, enrichment and bioinformatic analyses, and an interactome study, we uncovered a pattern of PKA regulation for proteins associated with translation, the proteasome, metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and virulence-related functions. PKA regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in C.  neoformans showed a striking parallel with connections between PKA and protein degradation in chronic neurodegenerative disorders and other human diseases. Further investigation of proteasome function with the inhibitor bortezomib revealed an impact on capsule production as well as hypersusceptibility for strains with altered expression or activity of PKA. Parallel studies with tunicamycin also linked endoplasmic reticulum stress with capsule production and PKA. Taken together, the data suggest a model whereby expression of PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits and the activation of PKA influence proteostasis and the function of the endoplasmic reticulum to control the elaboration of the polysaccharide capsule. Overall, this study revealed both broad and conserved influences of the cAMP/PKA pathway on the proteome and identified proteostasis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cryptococcosis...|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{fungal infections}} (IFI) are serious {{complications}} in immunocompromised hosts. Neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies or after transplantation {{are at risk}} of developing deep Candida or Aspergillus infections. HIV-infected patients with T-cell defects are, on the other hand, predisposed to <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> <b>meningitis</b> and mucosal candidosis. Early diagnosis of IFI is of crucial importance since mortality is high even in treated patients. The first aim was to assess the incidence of deep Candida infections and to improve their laboratory diagnosis. Candida colonisation and candidemia were retrospectively studied in patients with haematological diseases. Most patients were colonised by Candida and in the majority the same Candida species was isolated from at least two body sites. However, candidemia was diagnosed in only 3 (1. 1 %) patients. Possible causes of this low incidence were fluconazole prophylaxis, empirical amphotericin B treatment, and restrictive use of antibiotics. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for diagnosis of deep Candida infections. Candida albicans DNA was detected in senim and organ samples from experimentally infected mice as well as in senim from patients with candidemia or invasive Candida infection. Serum and urine specimens, prospectively collected from transplant recipients with clinically suspected IFI before, during, and after empirical antifungal treatment, were analysed by PCR for detection of C. albicans DNA in serum and by measurement of D/L- arabinitol ratio in urine. Serum was also tested for concentration of (1 -> 3) -ß-glucan and commercial Candida antigens. Invasive fungal infection (IFI) was verified in 4 candidiasis and 1 aspergillosis patients (13 %). Positive non-culture assay was recorded in 3 of 5 IFI patients. Of the empirically treated patients 36 % had > 2 positive non-culture assays. The second aim was to investigate an&mgal susceptibility of fungi. Fluconazole resistance (MIC > 32. 0 mg/l) was found in 7 (14 %) of the oral C. albicans strains isolated from HIV-infected patients. Two of the resistant strains showed cross-resistance to other azoles. A correlation between reduced susceptibility to fluconazole, low CD 4 + cell count, and time interval from the first fluconazole treatment, indirectly reflecting the total fluconazole exposure, was observed. Equal fluconazole MIC 90 (8 mg/l) was obtained by macrodilution, microdilution, and E- test methods for C. neoformans strains, isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. In comparison with the reference NCCLS macrodilution method, good agreement was obtained by both microdilution and E-test techniques. Both amphotericin B and itraconazole IRC 90 was 1 mg/l for Aspergillus strains isolated from lower respiratory tract. Acquired itraconazole resistance (MIC> 32 mg/l) was found in A. fumigatus strains isolated from 3 patients during long term itraconazole therapy. Conclusions: Combination of several non-culture assays is needed for laboratory diagnosis of IFI in high risk patients. No single test is sufficient for diagnosis. Antifungal susceptibility testing by standardised methods is important since resistance to azoles may develop during prolonged treatment...|$|E

Cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure had been measured for 13 (50 %) of these 26 patients, and major {{deviations from the}} guidelines with respect to ICP manage-ment were observed {{in the care of}} 14 (54 %). Seven (50 %) of these 14 patients developed neuropathies during therapy, compared with 1 of the 5 patients whose care had minor or no deviations from the guidelines (). Major depar-Pp. 024 tures from the IDSA guidelines for management of ICP due to C. <b>neoformans</b> <b>meningitis</b> are common and can be asso-ciated with neurological injury during therapy. <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> is a major cause of meningitis in im-munocompromised patients [1]. Cryptococcal meningitis is frequently associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Pressures of 250 mm H 2 O correlate with a higher pathogen burden, a higher incidence of neuropathies, and decreased sur-vival [2]. Elevated ICP can be managed with removal of CS...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> causes life-threatening <b>meningitis</b> in immunocompro-mised individuals. The {{expression of}} virulence factors, including capsule andmelanin, {{is in part}} regulated by the cyclic-AMP/ protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signal transduction pathway. In this study, we investigated the influence of PKA on the composi-tion of the intracellular proteome to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the regulation that underpins virulence. Through quantitative proteomics, enrichment and bioinformatic analyses, and an interactome study, we uncovered a pattern of PKA reg-ulation for proteins associated with translation, the proteasome, metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and virulence-related functions. PKA regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in C. neoformans showed a striking parallel with connections between PKA and protein degradation in chronic neurodegenerative disorders and other human diseases. Further investigation of proteasome function with the inhibitor bortezomib revealed an impact on capsule production as well as hypersusceptibility for strains with altered expression or activity of PKA. Parallel studies with tunicamycin also linked endoplasmic reticulum stress with capsule production and PKA. Taken together, the data suggest a model whereby expression of PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits and the activation of PKA influence proteostasis and {{the function of the}} endoplasmic reticulum to control the elabora-tion of the polysaccharide capsule. Overall, this study revealed both broad and conserved influences of the cAMP/PKA pathway on the proteome and identified proteostasis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cryptococcosis. IMPORTANCE Fungi cause life-threatening diseases, but very few drugs are available to effectively treat fungal infections. Th...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> {{infections are}} {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent and remain a life-threatening clinical issue in immune-compromised hosts. The microorganism evades a variety of endogenous anti-fungal mechanims of host immune cells. The signaling pathways in human immune cells that become activated in response to <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> infection {{have yet to be}} fully characterized. Methods: Human monocytes were incubated with <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans,</b> and the whole transcriptome of monocytes was sequenced before and after exposure to <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> using mass parallel sequencing techniques. Based on the genes that demonstrated altered expression patterns, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analysis to further characterize the pathways involved in monocyte activation by <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans.</b> Results: We found that immune and inflammatory responses, as well as chemotaxis, were the most heavily activated cellular events. Specifically, the toll-like receptor, tumor necrosis factor, NF-kB and Jak-STAT pathways were the most active pathways in response to <b>Cryptococcus</b> <b>neoformans</b> infection. The sequencing data of selected genes from the transcriptome analysis were further validated by real-time polymerase chain reactions. Conclusion: Taken together, our study is the first characterization of the transcriptome alterations in human immune cells upon C. neoformans infection, providing additional information that may be helpful in discovering novel anti-fungal targets...|$|R
