This came after authorities frightened a club owner into withdrawing his promise to host the event.

2500|$|In 1955 he {{left for}} the Netherlands and first lived in Amsterdam and later in The Hague, where he became a zealous activist for the {{preservation}} of Indo culture. Initially he wrote columns reflecting on repatriation in Dutch newspaper 'Het Parool', where he became a direct colleague of Simon Carmiggelt, and simultaneously kept catering for the Indos still in Indonesia by writing for Surabaya based 'De Vrije Pers' (The Free Press). He originally attempted to find connection with the cultural and literary establishment of the Netherlands, but unwilling to assimilate he wanted to establish his own <b>cultural</b> <b>network</b> of Indo authors and artists. To groom the 62-year-old Indo author Maria Dermoût who successfully debuted in 1955 he wrote her: [...] "I am Mrs Dermoût, a barefoot child of the free seas and free mountains. Even when death would be my prediction, I will keep fighting an injustice that does not threaten me personally, but our cultural conscience (if there is such a thing)." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the mid 1940s Tejada again neared Carlism, at {{that time}} with no king, divided into few factions and {{politically}} bewildered. First commencing co-operation with their periodicals, in the Madrid cafes he mixed with Carlists of different persuasions, including the pro-collaborationist Carloctavistas and the intransigent orthodox Javieristas; he also took part in their minor public manifestations against the regime. In unspecified circumstances, though most likely acting in agreement if not on request of the then Carlist political leader Manuel Fal Conde, Tejada ventured to co-organize a semi-official Traditionalist <b>cultural</b> <b>network,</b> which materialized as the Madrid Academia Vázquez de Mella; in the late 1940s he was among its most active lecturers. Now openly confronting the regime and in 1947 advocating a [...] "no" [...] vote in the Ley de Sucesión referendum, politically Tejada avoided clear identification {{with any of the}} Carlist groupings. He seemed closest to supporters of Dom Duarte Nuño de Braganza as a potential Carlist heir; according to other sources he merely considered the Portuguese claimant a viable candidate. The period of vacillation ended in 1950, when Tejada aligned with the Javieristas and accepted seat in their national executive, in 1951 nominated by Don Javier commissioner of Comunión Tradicionalista external affairs.|$|E

40|$|The {{intersection}} of urban and cultural policies {{has recently been}} at the center of international debate. The cultural planning approach argued that cultural policies can generally display positive effects in contemporary cities. The economic literature put forth spatial organization models of cultural institutions and producers, sometimes confirming policy makers’ expectations. Concerning the urban implications of cultural policies, many authors tended to be more skeptical and made several critical observations that can be better disclosed by analyzing <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> in urban policy making. Drawing on an extended case of Baltimore’s Mount Vernon Cultural District, I show that these critical factors are relevant but not determinant since they do not explain how and why <b>cultural</b> policy <b>networks</b> intervene in urban policy making. The analysis of Mount Vernon showed how a self-interested network promoted revitalization by framing a specific area as a ‘common campus’ and by integrating public, private, and nonprofit on this spatial basis. I suggest considering the implications of <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> in further urban research and policy making. ...|$|R

The colonial {{efforts by}} the Spanish and subsequent generations resulted {{in the formation of}} <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> that were based on the reliance and access to key ecological resources (such as fertile lands for ranching and agriculture or access to freshwater from the San Diego River) that ultimately influenced the settlement of the San Diego River watershed and the surrounding region. Utilizing a historical anthropological approach, this study examines these Spanish and Mexican Period <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> and compares them to the traditional Native American settlement networks that formed prior to contact. An analysis of ethnographies, historical journals, autobiographies, archaeological literature, and reports of previous archaeological investigations of Late Prehistoric, historical Native American, and early Spanish and Mexican Period archaeological sites establish a baseline for settlement patterns that developed during each of these time periods. Using geographic information systems, a series of maps including site densities, a suitability model, and cultural interaction diagrams were built compared. Viewing these comparisons through a behavioral archaeological lens, coupled with actor-network and world systems theoretical frameworks, the overlapping <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> were analyzed. The analysis of these networks resulted in identifying settlement patterns that informed the social stratification of the Spanish and Mexican Periods which in turn, influenced the future development of the city and region of San Diego...|$|R

The material accumulated by MI 5 now allows scholars to understand the involvement of Storm in key <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> and aesthetic debates, and also demonstrates the methods used by security agencies monitoring the radical intellectual movements of the period. Overall, this article suggests that, far from attempting to suppress such literary magazines, they were instead used as efficient hubs for surveillance, allowing MI 5 to map out the rapidly shifting leftist <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> during the decade...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters, armed conflict, economics and <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> are key drivers of migration. The dearth of geo-referenced ethnic data, however, limits {{the value of}} econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions {{of the risk of}} being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. <b>Cultural</b> <b>networks</b> temper an agent's security calculus, with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time, but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering {{is a product of the}} confluence of event location and magnitude, ethnic tension, demographic factors and breadth of networks. Initial finding suggest that crisis-driven migration patterns are influenced by shock size and magnitude...|$|R
