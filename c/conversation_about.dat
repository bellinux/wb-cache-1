Also, mothers' <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> {{the future is}} more complex than their <b>conversations</b> <b>about</b> the past. <b>Conversations</b> <b>about</b> the future, which use more hypothetical language and conventional time markers (e.g., [...] "tomorrow", [...] "next week", [...] "next year"), tend to relate to general knowledge about events, compared to specific events about the past. In addition, mothers' future talk actively involves children in their future and planning, which also gives children opportunities to learn time-related concepts and gain knowledge about the future.|$|R

5|$|Smashed was {{conceived}} by James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke {{after they had}} a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> things they had done while drunk. Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years old, when she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script. Since they lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, they communicated by email, dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately. The entire writing process took six months.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) {{begin to}} believe that Noah is being held by fresh water, so the search is narrowed. Bud is also cleared of {{voluntary}} manslaughter, and him, Curtis, Megan and Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) suspect that the kidnapping may be an inside job, meaning that someone close to Noah kidnapped him. Bud checks his parents, Tom (Stephen Barker Turner) and Jennifer (Keira Naughton) {{but they are not}} the culprits. They then find that Helen's friend, Jason's girlfriend, Rena Talbot (Wrenn Schmidt) looked after Noah whilst Helen was on taking care of her boyfriend Oscar Mendez who had been injured badly in a fight. They find Rena, and result in finding Noah, who is sick but alive, and is reunited with his parents. Whilst Rena is arrested, Derek asks Megan to have a ride on her motorbike, to which she rejects and instead goes to see Joan, having a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> her father.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Booker {{attended}} a {{dinner at a}} conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million of his personal fortune to the Newark school system. According to an article in the New York Times, Booker and Zuckerberg continued their <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> Booker's plans for Newark. The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education. The gift was formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by some as a move for damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network, a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On her show, however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.|$|E

5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a <b>conversation</b> <b>about</b> Foma’s faults, {{especially}} lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E
