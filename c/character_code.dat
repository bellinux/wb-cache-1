2500|$|Much of the {{controversy}} surrounding Han unification {{is based on the}} distinction between glyphs, as defined in Unicode, and the related but distinct idea of graphemes. Unicode assigns abstract characters (graphemes), as opposed to glyphs, which are a particular visual representations of a character in a specific typeface. One character may be represented by many distinct glyphs, for example a [...] "g" [...] or an [...] "a", both of which may have one loop (a, g) or two (a, g). Yet for a reader of Latin script based languages the two variations of the [...] "a" [...] character are both recognized as the same grapheme. Graphemes present in national <b>character</b> <b>code</b> standards have been added to Unicode, as required by Unicode's Source Separation rule, even where they can be composed of characters already available. The national <b>character</b> <b>code</b> standards existing in CJK languages are considerably more involved, given the technological limitations under which they evolved, and so the official CJK participants in Han unification may well have been amenable to reform.|$|E

To represent a negative offset, ISO 8601 specifies using either a hyphenminus or a minus sign character.

[...] ASCII does not have a minus sign, so its hyphenminus <b>character</b> (<b>code</b> is 45 decimal or 2D hexadecimal) would be used.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{study of}} the morphological data sets used for the most recent analyses of metazoan cladistics exposes a rather cavalier attitude towards <b>character</b> <b>coding.</b> Binary absence/presence coding is ubiquitous, but without any explicit justification. This uncompromising application of Boolean logic in <b>character</b> <b>coding</b> is remarkable since several recent investigations have nominated absence/presence coding as the most problematic coding method available for standard cladistic analysis. Moreover, the prevalence of unspecified “absence” character states in the published data sets introduces a discrepancy between the theoretical foundations of phylogenetic parsimony and current practices in metazoan cladistics. Because phylogenetic parsimony assumes transformation of character states, its effective operation breaks down when not all character states are carefully delimited. Examples of resulting meaningless character state transformations are discussed in two categories: 1) when unspecified “absence” states are plesiomorphic; and 2) when unspecified “absence” states are apomorphic (character reversals). To facilitate future progress in metazoan cladistics, the mandatory link between comparative morphology and <b>character</b> <b>coding</b> needs to be reestablished through a more explicit study of morphological variation prior to <b>character</b> <b>coding,</b> and through a more explicitly experimental approach to <b>character</b> <b>coding...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Varicode {{is a kind}} of Fibonacci code {{where the}} {{boundaries}} between character codes are marked by two or more consecutive zeros. Like all Fibonacci codes, since no <b>character</b> <b>code</b> contains more than one consecutive zero, the software can easily identify the spaces between characters, regardless of the length of the character. The idle sequence, sent when an operator is not typing, is a continuous sequence of phase-shifts, which do not print on the screen. Martinez arranged the character alphabet so that, as in Morse code, the more frequently occurring characters have the shortest encodings, while rarer characters use longer encodings.
