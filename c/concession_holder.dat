25|$|As {{early as}} 1907, there were {{calls from the}} valley {{population}} and Zermatt hoteliers for the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn to operate also im Winter. The SBB and the VZ refused to conduct such operations, however, due to the high costs that would result, and the consequent lack of profitability. Also, the danger of accidents due to avalanches and flooding was regarded as an incalculable risk. In addition, {{for a long time}} there was, {{on the part of the}} VZ, a stance that in any event Zermatt was not suited to being a winter resort. The Valais Council of State, which viewed the prospect of winter traffic positively, therefore considered the possibility of extending the obligation to operate the VZ to the winter months, at least for the section from Visp to St. Niklaus. As the concession text was limited to stipulating running times, and as, in the absence of any precedent, an amendment to the concession against the wishes of the <b>concession</b> <b>holder</b> would not be feasible, further efforts were abandoned until 1914. With the outbreak of World War I, the demand for continuous operations became obsolete for the time being.|$|E

40|$|Berau {{district}} {{has been one}} of East Kalimantan’s largest sources of timber since the mid- 1980 s. Until the fall of the Suharto regime in 1998, most of the district’s formal timber production was conducted by large-scale HPH <b>concession</b> <b>holders,</b> {{and the vast majority of}} the fiscal revenues generated flowed to the national government. Over the last several years, considerable volumes of logs have also been harvested illegally both by timber concessionaires and by small-scale manual loggers. Following the onset of Indonesia’s regional autonomy and decentralization processes in late 1998, district officials moved aggressively to establish greater administrative control over the forest resources within their jurisdiction. They did so by allocating large numbers of small-scale forest conversion licenses, known as IPPK permits. Many of these were assigned to ‘foundations’ established by local entrepreneurs to coordinate the creation of logging ventures with village cooperatives and other community groups in parts of Berau with valuable stands of timber. When the central government pressured district governments to stop issuing IPPK permits within the officially designated ‘Forest Estate’ in late 2000, Berau officials shifted tactics and began allocating a new type of logging permit, nown as IPKTM, in forested areas where individuals or community groups held titles of ownership or other types of land certificates. District officials have also pressured PT Inhutani I, the state forestry enterprise owned by the central government, and other HPH <b>concession</b> <b>holders</b> to enter into equity partnerships with the district government. This has given the district government a direct stake in protecting the operations of HPH <b>concession</b> <b>holders,</b> and Berau’s bupati has publicly discouraged local stakeholders from making claims against the companies—a phenomenon that has been common in much of East Kalimantan. In cases where local communities have made such claims, the district government has generally encouraged the various parties to negotiate a peaceful solution to the dispute without outside mediation. In many cases, this process has led HPH holders to relinquish small portions of their concessions to community groups and to make modest compensatory payments. However, such agreements have frequently provided uncertain benefits for the communities’ long-term livelihoods, as they are structured as short-term fixes rather than a fundamental restructuring of the company-community relationship that was established during the New Order period...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFollowing {{the reform}} of energy sectors, some {{countries}} have used engineering norm models in incentive regulation of network utilities. In 2003, Sweden adopted this approach to regulation of electricity distribution networks. This paper examines whether the norm models represent the real networks and create incentives for performance improvement. We analyse data from 138 network <b>concession</b> <b>holders</b> between 2000 and 2007. The results show that norm models are not adequate representations of real networks. Also, utilities that perform better than their norm models tend to behave opportunistically. Finally, we find that private utilities respond more strongly to incentives...|$|R
