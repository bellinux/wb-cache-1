40|$|Abstract. Finish {{machining}} of {{sintered steel}} is increasingly important for near net shape technology. However, {{the life of}} a cutting tool for machining sintered steel is generally much shorter than for carbon steel and thus, finish machining increases the manufacturing cost of sintered products. For this reason, wear characteristics of several grades of cutting tools in turning sintered steel were investigated under different lubrication conditions. As a result, it is found that a P 10 grade of cermet and an S 01 grade of AlTiN coated carbide are recommended for dry machining. When cutting fluid is necessary for <b>chip</b> control and <b>disposal,</b> air jet assisted wet machining with a K 10 uncoated cemented carbide and wet machining with a P 10 cermet are recommended. It is also found that a small amount of cutting fluid remained in the workpiece during wet machining caused an intense thermal impact to a P 10 uncoated cemented carbide leading to short tool life...|$|R
40|$|Gears are {{components}} in mechanical assemblies used for transmitting power and motion. Gear form cutting (broaching, milling) and gear generating (shaping and hobbing) {{are two of}} the main gear manufacturing methods. Usually production involves three stages: (i) soft machining, (ii) heat treatment, and (iii) hard machining. Limitations introduced by conventional methods can be listed as follows: - In machining difficult to cut materials, high cost of specialized cutting tools, high cutting tool failures is a major issue and high cost of machine tools. - Stresses generated due to heat (thermal stresses) and cutting force affect the component life and cost. This demands alternative ways of material removal without affecting the mechanical properties while delivering right quality in a cost effective way which is the goal of the industry. - Increasing standards on environmental impacts associated with products force the modern manufacturing industry to take critical approach on making processes environmental friendly. Large volume of material is removed during conventional gear production resulting in higher lead time, more use of cutting fluids (and its <b>disposal),</b> <b>chip</b> handling (and its disposal) and dust. In this context, abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting {{is considered to be a}} good addition to the current production system due to the low amount of applied force, negligible heat generated during machining, minimal change in material properties, versatility, lower initial investment and environmental friendliness (no chip generation and no need for cutting fluids). To demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in manufacturing spur gears and helical gears, forged gear blanks typically used on automobile industry were used for initial tests and two gears were produced using 3 -axis KimTech and 5 -axis FineCut precision AWJ machine tools. Individual teeth have been separated from each gear and tested against each other from different perspectives. The metrological, surface integrity, productivity and production cost comparisons were presented. While improvements were achieved from environment and surface integrity perspectives, AWJ cutting cannot replace soft machining stage due to increased lead time and production cost. Novel hybrid gear manufacturing method was proposed from the experiences from this research and compared against the conventional method employed in the automotive industry. Proposed hybrid approach comprises AWJ cutting process as the major material removal method and conventional 5 -axis machining for final finishing or maintenance of tight tolerances and at the same time, decreasing initial investment and adding further flexibility to production system.

40|$|The cost {{of turning}} on NC-lathes is {{substantially}} sensative to cutting conditions. The use of optimum cutting conditions {{is limited by}} {{a large number of}} constraining factors such as <b>chip</b> <b>disposal,</b> chucking possibility, available power, required accuracy etc. The present way of work preparation, even when using the available workpiece programming systems, does hardly allow of generating acceptable values for the cutting variables. Moreover, the combination of geometrical and a technological processor in one workpiece programming system will save substantial time in work preparation. Starting from a former reported development, this article deals with the development of a technological processor of improved design and extended possibilities, as for instance the handling of the chucking problem, {{as a part of a}} complete workpiece programming system. At choice the output of this processor may be presented in graphes, showing the limited working area and indicating the preferential working point.

30|$|Spline shaft is an {{important}} part of a machine to transmit power or bear torque. Its section contour is like a gear. It suffers from great loads and alternating stress during the runtime. The tooth root of the spline shaft has a risk of fracture due to fatigue stress [1 – 4]. Thus, it is essential to conduct a surface hardening process such as rolling after machining. In order to control the quality of product, a rolling performance evaluation becomes essential. The commonly used evaluation parameters of surface integrity involve the surface roughness, the surface residual stress and the micro-hardness. However, measurement of surface roughness or through-thickness residual stresses in difficult locations or complex geometries is not easy. Many measurement techniques are destructive, such as the centre-hole drilling method, the ring core method and the block removal method. There are non-destructive techniques (e.g., X-ray and neutron diffraction, optical, magnetic or ultrasonic methods) [5], but they often require the off-machine measuring. Note that for the rolling process, it is an efficient alternative to conventional cutting processes to manufacture spline shaft as it possesses several advantages i.e. shorter process times, no material loss and no <b>chip</b> <b>disposal,</b> high surface quality [6]. The residual stress is only induced by the residual strain and the residual strain appears as the dimensional change in the macroscopic view. Therefore, it is probably feasible to use the dimensional change of tooth root as an alternative evaluation parameter.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate {{the two sides of}} the flute, the face and the heel of a twist drill. The flute face was designed to yield straight diametral lips which could be extended to eliminate the chisel edge, and consequently a single cutting edge will be obtained. Since drill rigidity and space for chip conveyance have to be a compromise a theoretical expression is deduced which enables optimum <b>chip</b> <b>disposal</b> capacity to be described in terms of drill parameters. This expression is used to describe the flute heel side. Another {{main objective}} is to study the effect on drill performance of changing the conventional drill flute. Drills were manufactured according to the new flute design. Tests were run in order to compare the performance of a conventional flute drill and non conventional design put forward. The results showed that 50 % reduction in thrust force and approximately 18 % reduction in torque were attained for the new design. The flank wear was measured at the outer corner and found to be less for the new design drill than for the conventional one in the majority of cases. Hole quality, roundness, size and roughness were also considered as a further aspect of drill performance. Improvement in hole quality is shown to arise under certain cutting conditions. Accordingly it might be possible to use a hole which is produced in one pass of the new drill which previously would have required a drilled and reamed hole. A subsidiary objective is to design the form milling cutter that should be employed for milling the foregoing special flute from drill blank allowing for the interference effect. A mathematical analysis in conjunction with computing technique and computers is used. To control the grinding parameter, a prototype drill grinder was designed and built upon the framework of an existing cincinnati cutter grinder. The design and build of the new grinder is based on a computer aided drill point geometry analysis. In addition to the conical grinding concept, the new grinder is also used to produce spherical point utilizing a computer aided drill point geometry analysis...|$|E
40|$|Chip {{control and}} tool wear {{estimation}} {{are two major}} concerns in automated machining systems. Chip control {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined part, the convenience of <b>chip</b> <b>disposal,</b> and possible power reduction; while tool wear estimation is vital to an effective tool change policy and quality control strategy, especially in finish-machining. This thesis first presents a new method for quantifying chip breaking and chip shapes with a fuzzy rating system, and further for predicting the chip breakability for arbitrary combinations of machining conditions through a fuzzy-set mathematical model. A predictive expert system for off-line assessment of machining performance, with chip control as a major criterion and due consideration to surface finish and power consumption, is then developed. A knowledge-based system for designing optimum chip breakers is set up with a criterion of efficient chip breaking at reduced power consumption. The method is based on the analysis of three-dimensional chip flow in oblique machining for a wide range of work materials, cutting conditions, tool geometries, chip breaker styles/sizes and restricted contact lengths. Experimental results of tool wear patterns in finish-machining show that estimation of more than one type of tool wear is required to assure the quality of a finished product. In order to achieve this, a dispersion analysis algorithm, derived from the established multivariate time series models, is used for the overall estimation of tool wear, including major flank wear, crater wear, minor flank wear and groove wear at the minor cutting edge. Finally, neural network techniques are used for modelling the dynamic interrelationship between the chip forming behaviour and different tool wear states. By integrating the developed methods for predicting chip breakability/shapes and for estimating comprehensive tool wear, the initially-predicted chip forming/breaking patterns can be updated with tool wear progression during the machining process through the use of neural network techniques. The results show that the methods developed in this thesis, for predicting chip breaking and shapes, and for evaluating machining performance, including chip control, surface finish and power consumption, m a y be used to form a basis for the off-line assessment of 2 ̆ 2 total machinability 2 ̆ 2 for automated machining systems. The strategy of comprehensive tool wear estimation provides a feasible means for on-line tool wear monitoring to assure product quality, especially under finish-machining conditions. The results also show that by using neural networks, chip forming behaviour with tool wear progression can be evaluated in-process, thus providing a feasible approach for achieving the on-line assessment of machining performance including chip forming patterns, surface finish and overall tool wear progression...|$|E
40|$|With the {{expanding}} use of automation in machining technology, the modern manufacturing aims toward achieving high productivity without close human supervision. This aim requires reliable machining processes. The chip control {{is one of}} major concern in automated machining system. It {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined parts, the convenience of <b>chip</b> <b>disposal,</b> and the possible power reduction. This thesis major deals with theoretical modelling for the 3 -D chip curling process, including geometry and mechanics consideration. These models are then used to develop a computer animation system to simulate the process of chip curling in 3 -D metal cutting. Hence the work described in this thesis is devoted to developing an effective theoretical technique for chip control in automated machining systems. Firstly, a new method to describe the development process of 3 -D chip curling is developed in accord with the mechanics and kinematics characters of chip curling in 3 -D machining. This analysis divided the process of 3 -D chip development into different stages based on the deformation mechanism and characteristics, i. e. chip forming stage, chip curling stage, chip breaking stage, and the kinematical characters according to whether the curled chip, after leaving the rake face, hits the backwall of breaker/groove, or/and workpiece, or/and backface of tool, or/and extends along the chip breaker. Then new basic chip curling forms, up-curling, side-curling and twisting, are proposed based on the continuum mechanics theory. It reveals that a 3 -D curling chip body m a y undergo longitudinal bending, transversal bending and torsional deformations. The analysis provides the fundament for the theoretical modelling of the 3 -D chip curling and breaking. Secondly, a general geometric model of 3 -D chip curling generated by typical chip breakers is developed by introducing the three-dimensional deformation state of the chip curling. The model, so developed, can be used to predict the 3 -D chip curling forms. The prediction includes a group of criteria for the effects of ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηo on the chip forms/shapes. The varying tendency of the chip radius and chip pitch with varying ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηO is further discussed based on a sensitivity analysis the results of which are summarised graphically. The sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the significance of three basic chip curling forms, namely up-curling, side-curling and twisting to the general helical chip form. Thirdly, a set of 3 -D mechanics models of chip curling with chip breaker for the internal resisting forces is developed for the 4 basic chip deformation cases of chip curling process based on the structural mechanics theory, These internal forces, in particular the bending moments and torques are expressed as variations along the length of the curled chip. The set of models considers a spatial force system including the longitudinal bending moment, transversal bending moment and the torsional torque. Then the distribution of the bending moments and torques along the chip body are discussed based on graphically presented calculated results. The models reveal, in theory, new insights into the chip breaking mechanisms. More importantly it provides a new approach to theoretically asses the curling chip breakability. Notably it is shown that the bending moment and torque are the main causes of chip breaking. Furthermore the bending moment and torque in the chip body are caused by the chip breaker and the obstacle the curling chip contacts. Finally, a computer animation system for 3 -D chip curling in machining process is developed based on the 3 -D chip curling developing process, geometry model and mechanics models of 3 -D chip curling presented in the research work. The 3 -D chip animation integrates the chip flow equation, chip curling patterns, chip geometrical features and mathematical expressions for the 3 -D helix surface. Based on the input conditions (namely chip breaker parameters and cutting conditions), a computer program is developed to convert the parametric prediction into a series of dynamic graphs demonstrating the chip formation process. Then the animation results are analysed and compared with the experimental observations. The methodology presented will provide assistance for machine operators to select machining conditions or for process planning designers to confidently and thoroughly plan the cutting process, control chip breakage and evaluate the chip control effect...|$|E
