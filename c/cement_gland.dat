60|$|As the {{individuals}} grow and increase in size, {{so do the}} glands and cement-ducts; but it seems often to happen, that when a specimen is immovably attached, the cementing apparatus ceases to act, and the cellular contents of the duct become converted into a thread of transparent tough cement; the investing membrane, also, of the ducts, in Conchoderma sometimes becomes hard and mamillated. I have already alluded {{to the case of}} a Pollicipes, in which both glands and ducts, and even {{a small portion of the}} two adjoining ovarian tubes, had become thus filled up. As in sessile Cirripedes, at every fresh period of growth a new <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> is formed, it has occurred to me, that possibly in Pollicipes something similar may take place. In sessile Cirripedes, the old cement-glands are all preserved in a functionless condition, adhering to the membranous or calcareous basis, each new larger one attached to that last formed, and each giving out cement-ducts, which, bifurcating in the most complicated manner, pass outside the shell and thus attach it to some foreign body.|$|E

40|$|The {{status and}} {{composition}} of the Diplosentidae Tubangui et Masiluñgan, 1937 are reviewed. The type species of the type genus, Diplosentis amphacanthi Tubangui et Masiluñgan, 1937 from Siganus canaliculatus (Park, 1797) in the Philippines, is concluded to have been described inaccurately in supposedly possessing only two <b>cement</b> <b>glands</b> and lemnisci enclosed in a membranous sac. The species is almost certainly very close to species of Neorhadinorhynchus Yamaguti, 1939 and Sclerocollum Schmidt et Paperna, 1978 which have also been reported from siganids from the tropical Indo-Pacific. Species of these genera have four <b>cement</b> <b>glands</b> and unexceptional lemnisci. As a result, Diplosentis Tubangui et Masiluñgan, 1937 is best considered to have affinities with the Cavisomidae Meyer, 1932. The Cavisomidae has priority over the Diplosentidae; thus the Diplosentidae becomes a synonym of the Cavisomidae. Neorhadinorhynchus and Sclerocollum are considered synonyms of Diplosentis. The affinities of the other species and genera formerly included in the Diplosentidae (other species of Diplosentis, Allorhadinorhynchus Yamaguti, 1959, Amapacanthus Salgado-Maldonado et Santos, 2000, Pararhadinorhynchus Johnston et Edmonds, 1947, Golvanorhynchus Noronha, de Fábio et Pinto, 1978 and Slendrorhynchus Amin et Sey, 1996) are discussed. It is concluded that all but Pararhadinorhynchus, two species of Diplosentis and Amapacanthus can be accommodated elsewhere satisfactorily. A new family, Transvenidae, is proposed for {{a small group of}} acanthocephalans that genuinely possess only two <b>cement</b> <b>glands.</b> Transvena annulospinosa gen. n., sp. n. is described from the labrids Anampses neoguinaicus Bleeker, 1878 (type host), A. geographicus Valenciennes, 1840, A. caeruleopunctatus Rüppell, 1829, Hemigymnus fasciatus (Bloch, 1792), and H. melapterus (Bloch, 1791) from the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Transvena gen. n. is distinguished from all other acanthocephalan genera by having a combination of a single ring of small spines on its trunk near or at the junction between the neck and trunk, two <b>cement</b> <b>glands,</b> a double-walled proboscis receptacle and hooks which decrease in length from the apex {{to the base of the}} proboscis. A second new genus within the Transvenidae, Trajectura, is proposed for T. perinsolens sp. n. from Anampses neoguinaicus, also from the Great Barrier Reef.

40|$|Abstract Background Trigeminal nerves {{consist of}} ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular {{branches}} that project to distinct {{regions of the}} facial epidermis. In Xenopus embryos, the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve extends toward and innervates the <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> in the anterior facial epithelium. The <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> has previously been proposed to provide a short-range chemoattractive signal to promote target innervation by mandibular trigeminal axons. Brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF is known to stimulate axon outgrowth and branching. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine whether BDNF functions as the proposed target recognition signal in the Xenopus <b>cement</b> <b>gland.</b> Results We found that the <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> is enriched in BDNF mRNA transcripts compared to the other neurotrophins NT 3 and NT 4 during mandibular trigeminal nerve innervation.

A frog-like head forms directly with no appearance of a <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> or several jaw cartilages characteristic of tadpoles, and limbs appear early in development. The numerous differences in the embryogenesis ofE. coquiprovide an opportunity to examine developmental causes for the evolutionary shift from biphasic to direct development. We have cloned DNA fragments corresponding to fourE. coquigenes related to theDrosophiladistal-less geneDll. While the expression patterns of the distal-less genes are generally conserved, there are some spatiotemporal differences when embryos ofE. coquiare compared to those ofXenopus laevis. The changes in gene expression are correlated with the embryonic changes in head structures including craniofacial cartilages and in particular, the <b>cement</b> <b>gland.</b> We have then examined inductive interactions involved in <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> formation by interspecific transplants and recombinants.

40|$|AbstractThe {{homeobox}} geneotx 2 {{is a key}} regulator for {{specifying the}} rostral part of the vertebrate head. InXenopus, otx 2 directly controls the differentiation of the <b>cement</b> <b>gland,</b> the anterior-most organ formed in the tadpole. Since embryos of a direct developing frog,Eleutherodactylus coqui,lack a <b>cement</b> <b>gland,</b> {{we are interested in}} whether altered expression of theotx 2 gene is involved in this evolutionary change. We have cloned theE. coquihomologue ofotx 2, Ecotx 2. The homeodomain of theEcotx 2 protein is identical to the mouse and zebrafish Otx 2 proteins and differs by a single amino acid from theXenopusOtx 2 protein. Study of the spatiotemporal expression pattern shows thatEcotx 2 RNA is progressively restricted to the anterior region of the embryo during gastrulation and becomes further restricted to the future forebrain and midbrain during neural development. InXenopus,in addition to the conserved expression in the anterior neuroectoderm, the expression in ectoderm expands more anteriorly to the <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> primordium. This anterior expansion ofotx 2 expression is not found inE. coqui,correlating with the loss of a <b>cement</b> <b>gland.</b> When misexpressed inXenopus laevisectoderm,Ecotx 2 can activate expression of the cement-gland-specific genesXCGandXAG 1,indicating that the function of activating the pathway of <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> formation is retained by the Ecotx 2 protein.

40|$|Xenopus Pitx 1 is a {{homeobox}} gene whose {{family members are}} structurally and functionary conserved in organisms as diverse as Drosophila, chick, mouse, human, and frog. Present as a maternal transcript, the gene is zygotically expressed during gastrulation in a dorsal streak of cells. This streak restricts to a small circular domain underlying the center of presumptive neural plate. Shortly thereafter, a crescent of expression develops at the border of anterior neural ectoderm, and as the central plate domain diminishes, the crescent coalesces to define the presumptive <b>cement</b> <b>gland.</b> Expression remains high throughout <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> development, and subsequently expands to include ectodermal cells involved in stomodeal invagination. During early organogenesis, expression ensues in developing eye, posterior lateral mesoderm, and first branchial arch derivatives. Ectopic expression of xPitx 1 causes head deformities including enlarged <b>cement</b> <b>gland,</b> ectopic cement glands, and posterior deformities or, in extreme cases, inhibition of recognizable structures posterior to the <b>cement</b> <b>gland.</b> Expression of markers such as XCG- 1, xOtx 2, xPax 6, neural beta tubulin, and xTwist suggest that increases in <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> and lower mandibular size are likely {{at the expense of}} other head tissues.

40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} {{showed that}} otx 2 regulates Xenopus <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> {{formation in the}} ectoderm. Here, we show that otx 2 is sufficient to direct anterior neural gene expression, and that its activity is required for <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> and anterior neural determination. otx 2 activity at midgastrula activates anterior and prevents expression of posterior and ventral gene expression in whole embryos and ectodermal explants.

A dominant negative otx 2 -engrailed repressor fusion protein (otx 2 -En) ablates endogenous <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> formation, and inhibits expression of the mid/hindbrain boundary marker engrailed- 2. Ectoderm expressing otx 2 -En is not able to respond to signals from the mesoderm to form <b>cement</b> <b>gland,</b> and is impaired in its ability to form anterior neural tissue.

40|$|The {{process of}} head {{development}} {{is complex and}} {{with the exception of}} the hindbrain region, it is unlike trunk development in as much as it does not involve discrete segmentation. Recent evidence suggests that the paired-like family of genes play a role in regulating anterior development. To further understand the role that these genes possess, we have cloned the Xenopus homolog of Prix 1. XPitx 1 is present as a maternal transcript with expression observed as a dorsal streak during gastrulation. This streak restricts to a small circular domain underlying the centre of presumptive neural plate. Concomitantly, a crescent of expression is observed at the border of anterior neural ectoderm. Expression of xPitx 1 persists throughout the <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> anlage during gastrulation. At the onset of organogenesis, xPitx 1 is expressed within the <b>cement</b> <b>gland,</b> eye, lateral plate mesoderm, and first branchial arch derivatives. Misexpression of xPitx 1 in whole embryos leads to the formation of enlarged or ectopic cement glands. In addition, variable posterior deficits are observed with extreme cases where the embryo exhibits no recognizable structures posterior to the <b>cement</b> <b>gland.</b> Expression of markers such as XCG- 1, xOtx 2, xPar 6, and xTwist suggest that increases in <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> and lower mandibular size are likely at the expense of other head tissues. Conversely, antagonization of xPitx 1 with a mutant form of the gene results in <b>cement</b> <b>gland</b> inhibition and head malformations.

Interestingly, however, whilst in most species these glands take their developmental origin in ectodermal layer, in bichir, a member of a primitive actinopterygian lineage, their origin was suggested to be endodermal already at the beginning of 20 th century. Since then, however, the former study has become almost forgotten and even recent analyses do not come with new findings on this topic. Because of the essential importance of study of bichir <b>cement</b> <b>glands</b> for understanding the relationship between these structures among chordates, I have decided to focus on this subject. To obtain appropriate comparative data Xenopus, Weather loach and Ribbed newt embryos were included in this study as well. By using combination of immunohistochemical and histological techniques the endodermal origin of <b>cement</b> <b>glands</b> in bichir was proven and their morphogenesis was described into considerable details.
