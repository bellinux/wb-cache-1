5|$|The sheer {{magnitude}} of the flood event in the Anilao–Malbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events. Hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris, raising their water levels and widening their banks. In a post-disaster assessment in October 1992, it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future. It was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas; however, {{by the time of}} the report, people had already begun repopulating the area. As a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank, it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled. Several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed: reforestation, <b>contoured</b> farming, and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater. Long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in Ormoc.|$|E
5|$|Janáček's {{deep and}} lifelong affection for Russia and Russian culture {{represents}} another {{important element of}} his musical inspiration. In 1888 he attended the Prague performance of Tchaikovsky's music, and met the older composer. Janáček profoundly admired Tchaikovsky, and particularly appreciated his highly developed musical thought {{in connection with the}} use of Russian folk motifs. Janáček's Russian inspiration is especially apparent in his later chamber, symphonic and operatic output. He closely followed developments in Russian music from his early years, and in 1896, following his first visit of Russia, he founded a Russian Circle in Brno. Janáček read Russian authors in their original language. Their literature offered him an enormous and reliable source of inspiration, though this did not blind him to the problems of Russian society. He was twenty-two years old when he wrote his first composition based on a Russian theme: a melodrama, Death, set to Lermontov's poem. In his later works, he often used literary models with sharply <b>contoured</b> plots. In 1910 Zhukovsky's Tale of Tsar Berendei inspired him to write the Fairy Tale for Cello and Piano. He composed the rhapsody Taras Bulba (1918) to Gogol's short story, and five years later, in 1923, completed his first string quartet, inspired by Tolstoy's Kreutzer Sonata. Two of his later operas were based on Russian themes: Káťa Kabanová, composed in 1921 to Alexander Ostrovsky's play, The Storm: and his last work, From the House of the Dead, which transformed Dostoyevsky's vision of the world into an exciting collective drama.|$|E
40|$|AbstractClosed <b>contours</b> {{are often}} better {{perceived}} than those not fully enclosing an area, i. e., open <b>contours.</b> This facilitation of <b>contour</b> integration by closure, however, {{has been questioned}} arguing that in earlier studies closed <b>contours</b> were often “smoother” than open ones, because open <b>contours</b> usually had turning points. To solve this controversy, we compared detection performance for closed circles or ellipses of a higher curvature with open <b>contours</b> of a lower curvature neither having any turning points. Performance for circles and ellipses declined with increasing gap size and recovered only for <b>contours</b> with very low curvatures. Furthermore, performance increased with increasing number of <b>contour</b> elements and was better for smooth compared to S-shaped <b>contours</b> that change direction of curvature. Our results clearly demonstrate that closure improves <b>contour</b> detection, even though this advantage might be minor.

40|$|Abstract. When {{a figure}} is only {{partially}} visible and its <b>contours</b> represent {{a small fraction}} of total image <b>contours</b> (as when there is much background clutter), a fast <b>contour</b> classification mechanism may filter non-figure <b>contours</b> in order to restrict the size of the input to subsequent <b>contour</b> grouping mechanisms. The results of two psychophysical experiments suggest that the human visual system can classify figure from non-figure <b>contours</b> {{on the basis of a}} difference in some <b>contour</b> property (eg length, orientation, curvature, etc). While certain <b>contour</b> properties (eg orientation, curvature) require only local analysis for classification, other <b>contour</b> properties (eg length) may require more global analysis of the retinal image. We constructed a pyramid-based computational model based on these observations and performed two simulations of experiment 1 : one simulation with classification enabled and the other simulation with classification disabled. The classification-based simulation gave the superior account of human performance in experiment 1. When a figure is partially visible, with few <b>contours</b> relative to the number of non-figure <b>contours,</b> <b>contour</b> classification followed by <b>contour</b> grouping can be more efficient than <b>contour</b> grouping alone, owing to smaller input to grouping mechanisms. ...|$|R

The {{traditional}} approach to environmental <b>contours</b> is based on the well-known Rosenblatt transformation. However, due to the effects of this transformation the probabilistic properties of the resulting environmental <b>contour</b> can be difficult to interpret. An alternative approach to environmental <b>contours</b> uses Monte Carlo simulations on the joint environmental model, and thus obtain a <b>contour</b> without the need for the Rosenblatt transformation. This <b>contour</b> have well-defined probabilistic properties, but may sometimes be overly conservative in certain areas. In this paper we give a precise definition of the concept of the exceedance probability which is valid for all types of environmental <b>contours.</b> Moreover, we show how to estimate the exceedance probability of a given environmental <b>contour,</b> and use this to compare different approaches to <b>contour</b> constructions.

40|$|<b>Contour</b> {{integration}} {{is a fundamental}} form of perceptual organization. We introduce a new method of studying the mechanisms responsible for <b>contour</b> integration. This method capitalizes on the perceptual persistence of <b>contours</b> under conditions of impending camouflage. Observers viewed arrays of randomly arranged line segments upon which circular <b>contours</b> comprised of similar line segments were superimposed via abrupt onset. Crucially, these <b>contours</b> remained visible {{for up to a}} few seconds following onset, but eventually disappeared due to the camouflaging effects of surrounding background line segments. Our main finding was that the duration of <b>contour</b> visibility depended on the distance and degree of co-alignment between adjacent <b>contour</b> segments such that relatively dense smooth <b>contours</b> persisted longest. The stimulus-related effects reported here parallel similar results from <b>contour</b> detection studies, and complement previous reported top-down influences on <b>contour</b> persistence (Strother et al., 2011).
