50|$|The <b>Curled</b> <b>Dock</b> {{is found}} mostly in meadowland, wasteland, sand dunes, and dry soils. The <b>Curled</b> <b>Dock</b> can be annual, biennial, or perennial, and can produce 3000 to 4000 seeds per plant. Although said to {{contribute}} to animal wellbeing by providing nutrients which would otherwise be absent, it also contains high levels of oxalic acid which could be damaging to stock.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this series of trials {{was to determine if}} recently introduced herbicide formulations give better weed control in cereals and grassland than those presently in use. Effect on crop yield and quality was also examined where appropriate. In 1995, field trials were carried out with a new diflufenican/flurtamone formulation, Bacara, in winter wheat and barley. In both cases, the results showed that this new formulation gave commercially acceptable weed control {{of a wide range of}} annual weeds and grasses, when applied at doses between 260 and 350 g a. i. per hectare. None of the products tested had any adverse effects on crop yield or quality. Between 1996 and 1998 a number of new sulfonylurea herbicides, based on carfentrazone and flupyrsulfuron methyl (Lexus series), were tested at trial sites in Carlow and Clonmel. Most of the formulations gave weed control similar to Cougar, which was included in all these trials as standard comparison treatment, without affecting crop yield or quality. New herbicide trials for the control of broad and <b>curled</b> leaf <b>dock</b> (Rumex spp.) in pasture were carried out. Most of the herbicides investigated gave better overall control of both species than the standard dicamba/mecoprop based products. One of the sulfonylyurea-based herbicides controlled broad leaf dock only, and occasionally retarded grass development, but had no effect on clover. Fluroxypyr-based products gave long term control of both dock species without any effect on the grass, but eliminated clover present in the sward. In all trials some dock regrowth was evident one year after treatment. End of Project Repor...|$|R

50|$|Rumex crispus, the curly dock, <b>curled</b> <b>dock</b> {{or yellow}} dock, is a {{perennial}} flowering {{plant in the}} family Polygonaceae, native to Europe and Western Asia.|$|E
50|$|In Western Europe, dock {{leaves are}} a {{traditional}} remedy for {{the sting of}} nettles, and suitable larger docks (such as broad-leaved dock R. obtusifolius or <b>curled</b> <b>dock</b> R. crispus) often grow conveniently in similar habitats to the common nettle (Urtica dioica).|$|E
50|$|Parietin is the {{predominant}} cortical pigment of lichens in the genus Caloplaca, a secondary {{product of the}} lichen Xanthoria parietina, and a pigment found in the roots of <b>Curled</b> <b>Dock</b> (Rumex crispus). It has an orangy-yellow color and absorbs blue light.|$|E
50|$|The adults feed on nectar from flowers. Weeds {{are often}} {{preferred}} to crops by the larvae. Some favoured species include bluegrass, <b>curled</b> <b>dock,</b> lambsquarters, yellow rocket and redroot pigweed. Among crop plants, the larvae favour most vegetable plants, alfalfa, clover, cotton, rice, sorghum, strawberry, sugarbeet, tobacco and sometimes grains and grasses.|$|E

5000|$|The Weeds Act 1959 (7 & 8 Eliz. II c. 54) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{regarding}} {{the control of}} several injurious weed species throughout the UK. It received Royal Assent on 16 July 1959, and aims {{to prevent the spread}} of the Broad Leaved Dock, Common Ragwort, Creeping Thistle, <b>Curled</b> <b>Dock</b> and the Spear Thistle. It allows the Secretary of State, or any person acting on their behalf or the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to use measures of enforcement {{to prevent the spread of}} weeds on private land, which, if not adhered to by the owner of said land, can lead to a fine up to £1000 and further punishment.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation such as Marram Grass is {{essential}} for dunes to work, dominating the stabilised parts of the dunes. Other grasses that grow there include Dune Fescue and Red Fescue. Dogs off leads can easily run around the dunes, and destroy the vegetation. Horses being ridden over the dunes will have a similar effect. The Climping dunes are an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). In 2006 {{the total number of}} full species at Climping Gap stood at 256. It supports important populations of wintering birds and the numbers of wintering Sanderling, in particular, are of European significance. Vegetated shingle beaches are a nationally uncommon habitat. The beach at Climping is broad in the west but narrows to the east. Plant communities include Yellow horned poppy, Sea Kale, Sea Beet, <b>Curled</b> <b>Dock,</b> Eryngium maritimum, Sand Catchfly, Viper’s Bugloss and Nottingham Catchfly.|$|E

40|$|Phytochrome-enhanced {{germination}} of <b>curled</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex crispus L.) seeds {{is further}} stimulated by pretreatments in solutions of 0. 5 to 2 molar methanol and 0. 03 to ≥ 0. 3 molar 2 -propanol during a 2 -day 20 °C imbibition. Similar pretreatments in 0. 1 molar ethanol, acetaldehyde, and n-propanol inhibit phytochrome-enhanced germination. If exposure to ethanol is delayed until 16 {{hours after a}} red irradiation, seeds escape the ethanol inhibition indicating a mechanism other than toxicity. The rate of escape from ethanol inhibition roughly parallels the escape from phytochrome control in seeds held in water only, indicating possible ethanol effects on phytochrome. It was found that ethanol pretreatment prevents the far-red absorbing form of phytochrome (Pfr) from acting but does not accelerate dark decay or prevent transformation. Ethanol inhibition may be prevented if ethanol pretreatment is at 10 °C instead of 20 °C, or may be overcome by transferring ethanol-pretreated seeds to 10 °C in water. Similarly, ethanol inhibition can be overcome by a 2 -hour 40 °C temperature shift concluding the pretreatment. It is proposed that the ethanol causes perturbations at a membrane which prevent Pfr from acting...|$|E
40|$|The current {{mechanisms}} of herbicide selectivity in poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{were examined in}} glasshouse and field experiments. Through measurements of contact angles of diquat solutions it was established that poppy, and the weeds fumitory, fat hen and field poppy are 'hard' to wet, whilst shepherds purse, wild radish, spear thistle and <b>curled</b> <b>dock</b> are relatively 'easy' to wet. It was revealed that diclofop-methyl has properties characteristic of a weak surfactant, compared with Agral®, a finding supported through measurements of dynamic surface tension. The structure of the surface wax on the adaxial surface of poppy, field poppy, fumitory and fat hen leaves are described as seen under the scanning electron microscope. Chemical analysis of these waxes are also given. It appears the wax of fumitory and fat hen are influenced by application of ethofumesate. Chemical analysis shows that ethofumesate can inhibit the deposition of primary alcohols, long chain aldehydes and alkanes on the developing leaves of fumitory and fat hen, making these plants more susceptible than poppy plants to future applications of diquat + diclofop-methyl. Field trials conducted on the east and north-west of Tasmania, highlighted the difficulties that exist in extrapolating results from glasshouse experiments to field conditions. Measurements of spray retention and efficacy, revealed that plant responses to applications of diquat treatments were influenced, in addition to ethofumesate, by environmental conditions. Plant responses at both sites demonstrated that the inert ingredients of the commercial formulation of diclofop-methyl, would, in admixture with diquat produce the same result compared with the current diquat/diclofop-methyl treatmen...|$|E
40|$|The {{perennial}} weed species Rumex crispus L., or <b>curled</b> <b>dock,</b> {{is a major}} problem in agriculture in Sweden as well as in many other parts of the world. Its ability to establish quickly from seed, its persistent taproot system, high capacity of regrowth after cutting, and massive production of seed that remain viable in the seed bank for decades all contribute {{to the success of the}} weed. It is particularly problematic on dairy farms and in organic agriculture and difficult to control effectively, especially without the use of chemical herbicides. R. crispus and other weedy dock species have been well studied since the early 1900 's. However, the constant changes in agricultural practices and policies, affecting both the abundance and performance of the weed and the conditions for its control, call for a continuous renewal of the knowledge of the species. This thesis work was based upon a set of experimental studies dealing with several different processes in the life cycle of R. crispus. I have investigated time and pattern of seedling emergence, the effects of competition on the performance of juvenile plants, vegetative regeneration from underground parts, and population dynamics in an agricultural field. I found that R. crispus seedlings can emerge throughout the growing season and that seeds that remain on the parent plant over winter posses a certain level of dormancy, leading to later and more intermittent emergence compared to seeds dispersed in autumn. Tillage that leads to fragmentation of the root system can stimulate sprouting of new shoots from the regenerative tissue of the taproot. Severed top fragments of roots sprouted faster and produced more shoot biomass than intact rootstocks. Further, it was found that R. crispus seedlings are very sensitive to root competition in its early life stages, while it makes some morphological adaptations in response to shoot competition. To establish successfully in grassland, a large gap in the sward is required. Vegetation density during establishment of R. crispus plants will affect their performance also in the long term. Low frequency cuttings had no effect on population size, but can reduce the rate of seed bank accumulation...|$|E
