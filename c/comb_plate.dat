40|$|Patterns {{of water}} flow around {{steadily}} beating <b>comb</b> <b>plates</b> of Pleurobrachia pileus were tracked using suspended plastic beads. The {{positions of the}} beads and the <b>comb</b> <b>plates</b> in {{the plane of the}} central longitudinal axis of the comb row were digitised from high-speed ciné films covering several beat cycles. All of the data from each sequence were combined using a computer program which integrated them into a standard cycle, and the resulting data were plotted by a second computer program to produce charts for different stages in the beat cycle showing the flow velocity at a grid of points. On these charts, contour maps were drawn to indicate the speed and direction of the water flow. Water is drawn towards each comb row from ahead and from the sides and accelerates strongly backwards in a fairly narrow stream which joins those from the other seven comb rows {{at the rear of the}} animal. At a beat frequency of 10 Hz the <b>comb</b> <b>plates</b> move with a tip speed of up to 70 mms 21 in their effective stroke; they have an estimated Reynolds number of 9 in this stroke. Changes in inter-plate volume between adjacent antiplectically coordinated plates are very important in propulsion, particularly near the end of the effective stroke when pairs of adjacent plates close together and cause the high-speed water from around the ciliary tips to be shed into the overlying stream as a series of jets at speeds of 50 mms 21 or more.

50|$|The {{track system}} {{is built into}} the truss to guide the step chain, which {{continuously}} pulls the steps from the bottom platform and back to the top in an endless loop. One track guides the front wheels of the steps (called the step-wheel track) and another guides the back wheels of the steps (called the trailer-wheel track). The relative positions of these tracks cause the steps to form a staircase as they move out from under the <b>comb</b> <b>plate.</b> Along the straight section of the truss the tracks are at their maximum distance apart. This configuration forces the back of one step to be at a 90-degree angle relative to the step behind it. This right angle forces the steps into a shape resembling a staircase. At {{the top and bottom of}} the escalator, the two tracks converge so that the front and back wheels of the steps are almost in a straight line. This causes the stairs to lay in a flat sheetlike arrangement, one after another, so they can easily travel around the bend in the curved section of track. The tracks carry the steps down along the underside of the truss until they reach the bottom landing, where they pass through another curved section of track before exiting the bottom landing. At this point, the tracks separate and the steps once again assume a staircase configuration. This cycle is repeated continually as the steps are pulled from bottom to top and back to the bottom again.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the giant ciliary comb plates of ctenophores to record {{electrical}} activity directly from cilia. A compound action potential was recorded extracellularly {{over most of the}} length of the <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> cilia in response to electrical stimulation of the ectodermal nerve net. The ciliary action potential was correlated with intracellularly recorded action potentials, selectively blocked by Ca 2 +-channel antagonists, and correlated with ciliary reorientation and reversed beating. Dual-electrode recording from different sites on the same <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> showed that, unlike protistan cilia, the approximately 1 -mm-long cilia of comb plates are not isopotential. Rather, action potentials are generated 150 - 200 microns from the base and propagate to the tip of the cilia.

To determine whether Ca 2 + is directly involved in activating the ciliary reversal mechanism and/or is required for synaptic triggering of the response, we (a) determined the effects of ionophore A 23187 and Ca 2 + on the beat direction of isolated nerve-free comb plates dissociated from larvae by hypotonic, divalent cation-free medium, and (b) used permeabilized ATP- reactivated models of comb plates to test motile responses to known concentrations of free Ca 2 +. We found that 5 microM A 23187 and 10 mM Ca 2 + induced dissociated <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> cells to beat in the reverse direction and to swim counterclockwise in circular paths instead of in the normal clockwise direction. Detergent/glycerol-extracted comb plates beat actively in the presence of ATP, and reactivation was reversibly inhibited by micromolar concentrations of vanadate. Free Ca 2 + concentrations greater than 10 (- 6) M caused reversal in direction of the effective stroke but no significant increase in beat frequency. These results show that ciliary reversal in ctenophores, like that in protozoa, is activated by an increase in intracellular free Ca 2 + ions. This allows the unique experimental advantages of ctenophore <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> cilia to be used for future studies on the site and mechanism of action of Ca 2 + in the regulation of ciliary motion...|$|E

40|$|To image {{changes in}} intraciliary Ca {{controlling}} ciliary motility, we microinjected Ca Green dextran, a visible wavelength fluorescent Ca indicator, into eggs or two cell {{stages of the}} ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. The embryos developed normally into free-swimming, approximately 0. 5 mm cydippid larvae with cells and ciliary comb plates (approximately 100 microns long) loaded with the dye. Comb plates of larvae, like those of adult ctenophores, undergo spontaneous or electrically stimulated reversal of beat direction, triggered by Ca influx through voltage-sensitive Ca channels. Comb plates of larvae loaded with Ca Green dextran emit spontaneous or electrically stimulated fluorescent flashes along {{the entire length of}} their cilia, correlated with ciliary reversal. Fluorescence intensity peaks rapidly (34 - 50 ms), then slowly falls to resting level in approximately 1 s. Electrically stimulated Ca Green emissions often increase in steps to a maximum value {{near the end of the}} stimulus pulse train, and slowly decline in 1 - 2 s. In both spontaneous and electrically stimulated flashes, measurements at multiple sites along a single <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> show that Ca Green fluorescence rises within 17 ms (1 video field) and to a similar relative extent above resting level from base to tip of the cilia. The decline of fluorescence intensity also begins simultaneously and proceeds at similar rates along the ciliary length. Ca-free sea water reversibly abolishes spontaneous and electrically stimulated Ca Green ciliary emissions as well as reversed beating. Calculations of Ca diffusion from the ciliary base show that Ca must enter the <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> along the entire length of the ciliary membranes. The voltage-dependent Ca channels mediating changes in beat direction are therefore distributed over the length of the <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> cilia.

They noted that the ciliate and the amoeba {{were found on the}} subsagittal, subtentacular, and the auricular comb plates. The amoeba had a maximum width of about 15 μm and cells were crescent shaped. Ultrastructural evidence suggested that these protists were parasites although the exact nature of the association remained to be determined. This was the background for the present study. The present investigation documented the frequency of occurrence of gymnamoebae on ctenophores around Florida to assess the universality of this association. In addition, the study estimated the number of Flabellula-like <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> amoebae per comb surface. The study also set out to isolate all surface associated amoebae, including the Flabellula-like amoeba ‘symbiont’, using a variety of media formulations. The goal was to provide material to facilitate the identification and characterization of this amoeba. Over the 2 year duration of the project, 140 Mnemiopsis sp. were collected from 16 locations around Florida and surface tissue was processed for attached gymnamoebae. Eleven morphotypes of amoebae were isolated from 52 of the 140 Mnemiopsis sp. The Flabellula-like gymnamoeba was present on 85 % of the specimens, and the greatest concentration on Florida ctenophores was 946 amoebae mm- 2 of <b>comb</b> <b>plate</b> surface. One isolated amoeba closely resembled the Flabellula-like amoeba described by Moss et al. (2001). It {{is interesting to note that}} although most ctenophores harbored the ‘symbiont’ it was only isolated into culture 2 % of the time. No geographic factors appeared to favor the presence of amoebae on ctenophores. The shortest generation time (ie. fastest growth) calculated for the flabellulid amoeba was 20. 9 hours at a salinity of 10 ppt and a temperature of 23 °C. The amoeba grew best in seawater supplemented with malt/yeast extract to stimulate the growth of attendant prey bacteria. The results suggest that this amoeba, which was numerous on the surface, was predisposed to life on the ctenophore surface and could only be switched to laboratory conditions with difficulty. The amoeba had an unusual stage in the life cycle forming large fused, multinucleate cells in old cultures. This, together with its unique appearance (not resembling any published species) and the problems in amplifying its DNA by PCR (encountered by collaborators at Wood’s Hole Oceanographic Center) suggest that it an interesting amoeba new to science...|$|E

The fabricated ohmic contact SPDT RF MEMS silicon switch moves both laterally and vertically, to improve the isolation at high frequencies by initially misaligning the contact part of the switch over a Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) transmission line. The lateral and vertical movement of the switch is operated by using <b>comb</b> and parallel <b>plate</b> actuators, respectively. The proposed switch was fabricated using Silicon-On-Glass (SiOG) bonding process. The insertion loss of the fabricated switch is measured according to the different operation states of the switch, {{in the range from}} 50 to 100 GHz. The fabricated length of the transmission line is 4. 6 mm and the measured insertion loss and isolation are 9. 13 dB and 24. 37 dB at 70 GHz, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} a novel architecture {{for increasing the}} sensitivity of bulk mode gyroscopes. It is based on adding parallel <b>plate</b> <b>comb</b> drives to the points of maximum vibration amplitude, and tuning the stiffness of the combs. This increases the drive strength and results in a significant sensitivity improvement. The architecture is targeted for technologies with ~ 100 nm transducer gaps {{in order to achieve}} very high performance devices. In this work, this sensitivity enhancement concept was implemented in SOIMUMPs, a commercial relatively large gap technology. Prototypes were measured to operate at frequencies of ~ 1. 5 MHz, with quality factors of ~ 33, 000, at a 10 mTorr vacuum level. Measurements using discrete electronics show a rate sensitivity of 0. 31 μV/°/s, corresponding to a capacitance sensitivity of 0. 43 aF/°/s/electrode, two orders of magnitude higher than a similar design without combs, fabricated in the same technology...|$|R
