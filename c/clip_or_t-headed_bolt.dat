50|$|What about {{concrete}} spacers with {{a plastic}} <b>clip</b> <b>or</b> fixing mechanism? Does the plastic <b>clip</b> <b>or</b> fixing mechanism in the concrete spacer {{have a negative effect}} on material integrity? Does it weaken the corrosion protective cover over the reinforcement? The answer is no! The plastic <b>clip</b> <b>or</b> fixing mechanism is hinged from the top of the spacer and does not come into contact with the soffit of the concrete. The plastic <b>clip</b> <b>or</b> fixing mechanism is embedded only 5 mm into the spacer, which maintains the material integrity at the product’s surface. The plastic in the <b>clip</b> <b>or</b> fixing mechanism is used only for easily attaching to and holding the reinforcement, leaving the concrete part to do the work of the spacer.|$|R
