A large-scale search failed to find her. Then in mid-July, Georgia Abbott, Burton Abbott's <b>cosmetologist</b> wife, reported finding personal effects which had belonged to the girl, including a purse and an ID card, in the basement of the Abbotts' home in Alameda. [...] The basement was in the home she shared with her husband, their son Christopher, and his mother, Elsie Abbott (née Moore).

40|$|Women {{from diverse}} ethnic/racial {{backgrounds}} have higher chronic disease mortality rates {{when compared to}} White non-Hispanic women. Community-based programs, such as beauty salons, {{have been used to}} reach diverse ethnic/racial women, yet little is known about diverse ethnic/racial women cosmetologists' involvement in health promotion and their health behaviors, which is the purpose of this review. The growing beauty salon health promotion literature indicates that their roles in these studies have been varied, not only as health promoters but also as recruiters, facilitators, and in general major catalysts for investigator-initiated studies. However, the review also identified a major void in the literature in that there were few studies on health behaviors of diverse ethnic/racial women <b>cosmetologists,</b> especially African American women <b>cosmetologists.</b> Recommendations include increasing the capacity of diverse ethnic/racial women <b>cosmetologists</b> as community health leaders and investigating their health status, knowledge, attitudes, and practices...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{from the}} North Carolina BEAUTY and Health Project {{conducted}} an observational study in 10 North Carolina beauty salons to {{gain insight into}} naturally occurring conversations between <b>cosmetologists</b> and customers, and to assess features of the salon environment that {{might be used to}} inform the development of salon-based health promotion interventions. Results revealed that the social environment of a salon is a place where <b>cosmetologists</b> and customers talk openly about many subjects, including health. Information, advice, appraisal, humor, and empathy are typically shared in these health conversations. Several features of the physi-cal environment of the salon may be mobilized to support health—access to healthy foods, snacks, and bever-ages; smoking restrictions; and availability of print or video materials, signs, or displays that include healthy messages. Implications for planning salon-based health promotion interventions—including the training of licensed <b>cosmetologists</b> to deliver health messages—are discussed in light of these findings...|$|R

2500|$|The red {{and white}} pole outside barber shops {{references}} a time when barbers were expected to perform bloodletting and other medical procedures to heal the sick; red represented blood and white represented bandages. [...] "Barber surgeons" [...] in Rome also performed teeth extraction, cupping, leeching, bloodletting, surgery and enemas. However, today's barber poles represent little more than being a barber shop that cuts hair and does shaves. Barber poles have actually become a topic of controversy in the hairstyling business. In some states, such as Michigan in March 2012, legislation has emerged proposing that barber poles should only be permitted outside barbershops, but not traditional beauty salons. Barbers and <b>cosmetologists</b> have engaged in several legal battles claiming {{the right to use}} the barber pole symbol to indicate to potential customers that the business offers haircutting services. Barbers claim that they are entitled to exclusive rights to use the barber pole because of the tradition tied to the craft, whereas <b>cosmetologists</b> argue that they are equally capable of cutting men's hair (though many <b>cosmetologists</b> are not permitted to use razors, depending on their state's laws).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{included}} a systematic literature review, yielding studies on three employment categories: hairdressers, <b>cosmetologists</b> and laboratory workers. The original research examined pregnancy outcomes for Finnish singleton births between 1990 and 2010. The parameters were increased male gender, low birth-weight, high birth-weight, pre-term delivery, post-term delivery, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, stillbirth and early neonatal death. Finnish Birth Registry data included 507, 659 prima gravida women who delivered singletons {{with at least}} 22 weeks’ gestation 1990 - 2010.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the complex interactions that occur in some contemporary beauty salons and barbershops, focusing on barbers, <b>cosmetologists</b> and clients in a white, working- to middle-class area of rural Northwestern Pennsylvania and in two middle- to upper-class urban areas in Chicago, Illinois, and Los Angeles, California. Through participant observation and in-depth interviews, this study finds that salons and barbershops are gender and class-marked environments where barbers, <b>cosmetologists</b> and their clients come to manage gender and class identities. Most importantly this research reveals two interesting, somewhat inverse trends in this workforce. On the one hand, there is increasing class stratification in different types of hair salons from upscale to mass franchise operations. On the other hand, there is a declining level of gender segregation among both hair workers and their clients...|$|R
