2500|$|The {{neurodegenerative}} syndrome {{of copper}} deficiency {{has been recognized}} for some time in ruminant animals, {{in which it is}} commonly known as [...] "swayback". The disease involves a nutritional deficiency in the trace element copper. Copper is ubiquitous and daily requirement is low making acquired copper deficiency very rare. Copper deficiency can manifest in parallel with vitamin B12 and other nutritional deficiencies. The most common cause of copper deficiency is a remote gastrointestinal surgery, such as gastric bypass surgery, due to malabsorption of <b>copper,</b> <b>or</b> <b>zinc</b> toxicity. On the other hand, Menkes disease is a genetic disorder of copper deficiency involving a wide variety of symptoms that is often fatal.|$|E

2500|$|Intaglio [...] is {{a family}} of printmaking {{techniques}} in which the image is incised into a surface, known as the matrix or plate. Normally, <b>copper</b> <b>or</b> <b>zinc</b> plates are used as a surface, and the incisions are created by etching, engraving, drypoint, aquatint or mezzotint. Collographs may also be printed as intaglio plates. [...] To print an intaglio plate the surface is covered in thick ink and then rubbed with tarlatan cloth to remove most of the excess. The final smooth wipe is usually done by hand, sometimes {{with the aid of}} newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink from the recesses of the plate to the paper.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} uses {{proteomics}} {{to assess the}} effects of metal contamination on Sydney Rock oyster haemolymph. Saccostrea glomerata were exposed in aquaria for four days to three environmentally relevant metals (<b>copper,</b> lead <b>or</b> <b>zinc).</b> Oyster haemolymph proteins from metal-exposed oysters were then compared to haemolymph from non-exposed controls using 2 -dimensional electrophoresis to identify proteins that differed significantly in intensity.

The data {{suggest that there are}} unique protein expression profiles for each metal. Exposure to 1002 g/l of <b>copper,</b> lead <b>or</b> <b>zinc</b> yielded a total of 25 differentially expressed proteins. However, only one of these protein spots exhibited altered intensities in response to all three metals. Eighteen of the 25 spots were significantly affected by just one of the three metals. Differentially expressed proteins were assigned to five different categories of biological function. Proteins affecting shell properties were the most common functional group accounting for 34 % of the identified proteins.

50|$|In {{intaglio}} printmaking, {{the artist}} makes {{marks on the}} plate (in the case of aquatint, a <b>copper</b> <b>or</b> <b>zinc</b> plate) {{that are capable of}} holding ink.

This can be repeated a number of times, depending on the particular technique.|$|E
50|$|This {{process may}} {{be done with}} a {{monotype}} as well. Inking the acrylic or plexiglass plate with one ink with a very high viscosity, and following that, rolling a very loose ink over it, produces two tones on a single plate.

Typical solutions are 1 part FeCl3 to 1 part water and 1 part nitric to 3 parts water. The strength of the acid determines the speed of the etching process.|$|E

50|$|MgAr+ can {{interfere}} with determination of <b>copper</b> <b>or</b> <b>zinc</b> isotopes when using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, particularly when using a desolvated plasma. When analysing mineral specimens, magnesium is a common element found in rock matrix. It can react with the argon ions present in the plasma. In analysis of soil, MgAr+ interferes with detection of 65Cu, though common isotopomer has a molecular weight of 64.95 compared to 64.93 for the copper 65 isotope. This is called isobaric interference.|$|E
50|$|Prints {{are created}} by {{transferring}} ink from a matrix or through a prepared screen to {{a sheet of paper}} or other material. Common types of matrices include: metal plates, usually <b>copper</b> <b>or</b> <b>zinc,</b> or polymer plates for engraving or etching; stone, aluminum, or polymer for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts and wood engravings; and linoleum for linocuts. Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the screenprinting process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below.|$|E

50|$|As well {{as their}} use in medicine, antifungals are {{frequently}} sought after to control mold growth in damp or wet home materials. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) blasted on to surfaces acts as an antifungal. Another antifungal serum applied after or without blasting by soda {{is a mix of}} hydrogen peroxide and a thin surface coating that neutralizes mold and encapsulates the surface to prevent spore release. Some paints are also manufactured with an added antifungal agent for use in high humidity areas such as bathrooms or kitchens. Other antifungal surface treatments typically contain variants of metals known to suppress mold growth e.g. pigments <b>or</b> solutions containing <b>copper,</b> silver <b>or</b> <b>zinc.</b> These solutions are not usually available to the general public because of their toxicity.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{precautions}} {{should be}} taken to keep the cultures healthy. The use of reactive metals such as aluminium, <b>copper,</b> <b>or</b> <b>zinc</b> should be minimized, since the acidity of the solution can draw these metals out, damaging the culture. The beverage should not be stored in metal containers, as these may leach into it over time. Instead, use stainless steel, plastic, non-lead-glazed ceramic or glass containers. Culturing grains in a glass jar and using clean stainless steel or plastic utensils when handling the grains is recommended.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of vitreograph printmaking {{is its ability}} to withstand the pressure of the printing press with no discernible breakdown of the imagery, even after numerous runs. Printmaker Ken Kerslake wrote, “The glass plate will last indefinitely because, unlike of <b>copper</b> <b>or</b> <b>zinc,</b> it will always return to its original configuration no matter how much pressure is applied.” A disadvantage to this is that unwanted lines or marks on the glass plate cannot be burnished out, as they can on a zinc or copper plate.|$|E
50|$|As about 30-40% of {{all known}} {{proteins}} contain {{one or more}} metal ion cofactors (e.g., ceruloplasmin, ferritin, amyloid precursor protein, matrix metalloproteinase), especially native metalloproteins have to be isolated, identified and quantified after liquid biopsy. Many of these cofactors (e.g., iron, <b>copper,</b> <b>or</b> <b>zinc)</b> {{play a key role}} in vital enzymatic catalytic processes or stabilize globular protein molecules. Therefore, the high-precision electrophoresis and other native separation techniques are highly relevant as initial step of protein analysis followed by mass spectrometric and magnetic resonance methods for quantifying and identifying the soluble proteins of interest.|$|E
