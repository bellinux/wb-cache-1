50|$|The TrueType GX and Multiple <b>Master</b> <b>formats</b> were {{introduced}} in the 1990s, but were not widely adopted. Adobe later abandoned support for the Multiple <b>Master</b> <b>format.</b> This has led to questions as to whether a re-introduction of similar technology could succeed. By 2016, however, the industry landscape had changed in several respects. In particular, emergence of Web fonts and of mobile devices had created interest in responsive design and in seeking ways to deliver more type variants in a size-efficient format. Also, whereas the 1990s was an era of aggressive competition in font technology, {{often referred to as}} “the font wars”, OpenType Font Variations was developed in a collaborative manner involving several major vendors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} sound {{transfer}} from magnetic tape to LP {{is a highly}} complicated process. Apprentice engineers typically spend several years learning how to become an expert in disc mastering. A mastering engineer may need to adjust and or compromise the sound quality of a record {{in order to maintain}} loudness and make the groove traceable by the stylus a record player using a low quality phono cartridge. Often, sounds have been mastered with additional compression, limiting, and equalization. In order to reduce wear on the master most discs are not sourced from the original master tape. The source tape used may be many generations removed from the original. Typically, the engineer cut the first pressing and a [...] "cutting master" [...] tape in parallel. Subsequent pressings were cut directly from the <b>cutting</b> <b>master.</b> Some pressings were even cut from copies of the <b>cutting</b> <b>master</b> tape. Each subsequent tape copy added additional levels of tape hiss, and wow and flutter, degrading sound quality.|$|R

50|$|From the 1950s {{until the}} advent of digital {{recording}} in the late 1970s, the mastering process typically went through several stages. Once the studio recording on multi-track tape was complete, a final mix was prepared and dubbed down to the master tape, usually either a single-track mono or two-track stereo tape. Prior to the <b>cutting</b> of the <b>master</b> disc, the master tape was often subjected to further electronic treatment by a specialist mastering engineer. After {{the advent of}} tape it was found that, especially for pop recordings, master recordings could be made so that the resulting record would sound better.
