40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} study of British policy towards Poland from 194 to 1947. It traces the British attempt to {{negotiate}} a postwar political settlement for Poland that would met he expectations of both the Polish government-in-exile, to which Britain had committed its support in return for Poland’s substantial wartime military contribution, and the Soviet Union. During {{the last year and}} a half of the war, British policy makers struggled to mediate between the two sides and accommodate their competing demands. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, which saw the former prime minister of the exile government, Stanisław Mikołajczyk, return to Poland at he end of the war to join the provisional government. Mikołajczyk agreed to return on the basis of a British commitment to provide ongoing support in reconstituting a sovereign Polish state and establishing a democratic government. This thesis charts the outcome of that commitment, from the negotiations for the formation of the new Polish government under the auspices of the Three Power Commission in the summer of 1945, to the Polish referendum of June 1946, and the elections in January 1947. It shows that British policy makers struggled to met the commitment to Poland within the changing context of the postwar international system. In the circumstances of the emerging Cold War, as the reality of the Soviet resolve to absorb Poland into its sphere grew clearer, Britain’s political promises to the Polish democratic opposition became increasingly difficult to fulfil. Not al sections of the British policy making establishment were immediately prepared to accept heir dramatically <b>circumscribed</b> <b>power</b> to influence the shape of the Polish political settlement. Whereas the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin reconciled himself to the new circumstances with pragmatic sped, the Warsaw embassy, and many of the Foreign Office Northern Department officials, were less wiling to abandon the original terms of the British commitment. Thus, while some diplomatic and Foreign Office officials continued to lend support to the democratic Polish opposition parties, Bevin increasingly sought to limit Anglo-Polish relations to bilateral issues, including negotiations for financial and trade agreements, the repatriation of former members of the Polish armed forces, the final demarcation of Poland’s western frontier, and the transfer of the German population from western Poland to the British occupation zone. The result of these different priorities was a lack of uniformity in British policy. Much of the scholarship on Britain’s early postwar policy towards Poland takes one of two approaches: either it assumes that Britain understood immediately in 1945 that Poland was ‘lost’ to the Soviet Union, or it sets a reprehensible cynicism in the British approach, without due acknowledgement of the limits which constrained British policy options. This thesis offers a different interpretation; it argues that Britain adjusted much more slowly and unevenly to its diminished position after the war, and that its limited capacity to shape the Polish political settlement was understood only gradually, and at different times in different parts of the policy making establishment, creating an overall inconsistency in policy...|$|E

40|$|After drawing {{relatively}} brief {{remarks to}} some general aspects concerning the competition, the private economic initiative {{and the importance}} of these concepts within the market, the survey object of this work has focused on the development of judicial review in the antitrust matters. The division of jurisdiction is dealt in the Article 33, comma 1 and 2 of the Law n. 287 / 1990. In Italy, even before the Antitrust Law of 1990 and its establishment of the AGCM, was in force a system that was based on the provisions of the Civil Code (primarily in the Book V Title X entitled "the discipline of competition and consortia", articles 2595 - 2620 Civil Code). According to this ancient model in the past it was resorted to the ordinary courts on the basis of allotment of the courts ruled in Articles 102 and 103 of the Constitution. Also deduced from the nature of the legal situations of individual right that arose from such legislation. Before the 1990 s, therefore, the lesions on competition could come about only through legal situations of individual rights. In light of this brief exposition concerning jurisdiction of the ordinary courts, we understand how the law n. 287 of 1990 {{had an impact on the}} protection of competition and on the market, not only in terms of distribution of powers, but also with regard to subjective legal situations involved. In fact, currently if the Authority which is charged with the protection in this area is an administrative authority, this means that for develop that protection its evaluation should result in an administrative measure. Against this decision is competent the administrative courts and the legal situation for protection, against a possible injury suffered by that measure, falls into the category of a legitimate interest. Below, we will examine the judicial orders to which is entrusted the new division of jurisdiction for disputes pertaining to the subject matter of this work. At first, according to a part of the doctrine, it could share the knowledge between the ordinary courts and the administrative courts taking as a criterion of reference the type of subjective legal injured situations. Indeed, as stated in the art. 33 of the Law 287 / 90 is assigned to the administrative judge (namely the Lazio TAR at first instance and the Consiglio di Stato in the appeal) an exclusive jurisdiction (only) on appeals against the actions taken by the Competition Authority (art. 33, paragraph 1), as also supported by the administrative law over the years. It should be noted, therefore, as with this legal provision has not been given exclusive jurisdiction to the administrative judge for the entire antitrust matter, in fact, as regards the nullity actions and the disputes between private parties which relate to claims for damages or contractual cognition is entrusted to the ordinary courts, namely the Court of Appeals with territorial jurisdiction (art. 33, paragraph 2 of the Law 287 / 90). The Antitrust Authority exercises a <b>circumscribed</b> <b>power</b> based on undetermined legal situations and on technical standards, these rules provide the abstract cases that need to be punished. The Authority in the exercise of its powers performs the complex technical evaluations, case by case, aimed at understanding whether the situations that occur in the factual reality of the relevant market are or are not coming under competitive practices. This control must be examined by the administrative judge, who through an appealing judgment shall verify, through an ex post evaluation, the work of the Authority...|$|E

The differences between the {{two types of}} project approval procedures are, for example, that an authorisation process according to the Federal Immission Control Act has to be completed after seven resp. 3  months, whereas there is no strict time limit for planning permission procedures.

Marketers thus play an increasingly central role in all stages of the filmmaking process. To examine the often overlooked structures and practices of Hollywood’s marketing arm, this study adopts a media industry studies approach, employing interviews, fieldwork, and textual analysis to explore the social, technological, organizational, economic, and spatial forces that shape the contemporary context of Hollywood marketing materials’ creation. In the early 21 st century, Hollywood studios face profound challenges and opportunities wrought by the dual forces of globalization and digitization. In response, marketers have developed a novel view of their audience: as increasingly global and empowered. Globalization and digitization are thus treated as centrifugal forces, diffusing production and meaning-making capabilities across geographic space and media platforms, and threatening the centralized control traditionally held by Hollywood studios. Marketers are incentivized to embrace these decentralizing forces and the cultural labor now provided by third party marketing agencies, international distributors, and audiences. However, Hollywood studios’ institutional inertia, risk aversion, and inclination to maintain firm control of their marketing messages and intellectual property preclude a whole-hearted embrace of these changes. Studio marketers thus act with deep ambivalence toward these outside players, attempting to capitalize on their cultural labor while simultaneously acting to <b>circumscribe</b> their <b>power.</b> ...|$|R
