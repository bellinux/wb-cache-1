40|$|L'actuel régime {{juridique}} de représentation syndicale des salariés en vue de la négociation collective survivra-t-il à la transformation contemporaine des modes de production de l'entreprise? Quelle adaptation serait requise ? Répondre à ces questions conduit naturellement à confronter les traits essentiels de cette nouvelle entreprise et ceux de cet aménagement de la représentation collective. Dans le premier cas, la problématique tient en particulier aux changements dans l'environnement de l'entreprise, à l'organisation de son système de production : gestion participative, extériorisation de la production et multiplication des statuts du personnel; dans le second, elle porte notamment sur l'étendue de l'aire de représentation, sur l'objet et le caractère exclusif de la représentation, de même que sur le maintien du caractère conflictuel du régime des rapports collectifs du travail. Under {{the increasing}} competitive pressures {{of an international}} economic environment, enterprises are changing rapidly. This article considere how our legal framework might evolve {{to take account of}} these changes in the way that it regulates union representation. Drawing on both provincial and federal legislation, the first section outlines the major features of the regime of collective representation in Quebec. The second looks at the transformations currently taking place in the firm. The final section returns to each of the major features of the regime of union representation to consider how the existing legislative framework might be adapted {{in the light of the}} transformations discussed in the preceding section. Any discussion of the existing legislative regime should start from two essential prerequisites. First, union action is understood in terms of the very nature of subordination at work, seeking to mitigate the inequality inherent in the relationship between wage earner and employer. In contrast with the common law and notions of contractual equality, the current legislative framework for collective bargaining, and labour law more generally, reflects such an approach. Secondly, union representation depends on trade union freedom, not only in terms of a broader notion of freedom of association, but, more particularly, a freedom from employer interference within the firm. Once these two prerequisites are established, the current regime of collective representation, as portrayed in collective labour legislation, can be characterized by two basic features: a focus on collective work relations at the level of the firm, or some part thereof, and the notion that collective work relations are conflictual opposing subordinated workers and their employers. As regards this first feature, a focus at the level of the firm, it might be further sub-divided into five basic points. First, apart from certain important exceptions, certification units and bargaining units are generally concentrated at the level of the firm. Secondly, once in place, the certified union is the exclusive agent bargaining on behalf of the workers that it represents and receives union dues from those workers, be they members or not. Thirdly, apart from a general but quite malleable prescription concerning conditions of work, the law has little to say about the actual content of the collective agreement. Once the agreement is made, however, it constitutes a distinct and independent legal regime at the level of the firm. Fourthly, the law clearly determines which groups of workers can be represented by a union and is fairly restrictive in its approach to questions such as the inclusion of supervisory personnel in units composed of other workers or the representation, for the purposes of collective bargaining, of independent or autonomous workers. Finally, collective representation is attached to the firm and not to the employer, thus facilitating continuity of representation in the case of a transfer of ownership. As regards the conflictual nature of collective work relations in the firm, the existing legal regime institutionalizes the opposing interests of workers and their employers, particulary in terms of the potential recourse to the strike or lock-out. This opposition is carried further in the legal regulation of the collective agreement which limits what are, otherwise, unilateral management rights. There are a variety of factors which are currently affecting both firms and the collective representation of workers within them. First, most firms are experiencing a complex set of environmental changes resulting from the internationalization of markets, increased levels of competition, transformations in industrial and demographic structures, and the emergence of new sets of regulatory arrangements. Secondly, the internal re-organization of production is increasingly transforming internal labour markets within firms, intensifying the relationship of some workers with their firms while others are distanced both contractually and physically. Thirdly, new, more participative, culturally based models of production, entalling a certain restructuring of social relations within the firm, are being advanced as a model for the future. Fourthly, a proliferation of sub-contracting arrangements is transforming the traditional boundaries of both the firm and the employment relationship. Finally, there is an increasing diversity of employment status within firms and, for some groups at least, an accentuation of their professional identity. What then are the implications of all these changes for the traditional legal framework of union representation? The point of departure is that the existence of subordination in the employment relationship has not been altered; indeed, in some work situations, it has been exacerbated by both increasing internationalization and the re-organization of production activities. Protection of working conditions thus remains a legitimate concern which is not easily met by direct state prescription of minimum employment standards. Collective employee representation, particularly union representation in historical terms, retains all of its relevance but the existing legislative regime needs to be scrutinized in the light of continuing changes in the firm. First, it is suggested that there are contradictory pressures working towards both a further de-centralization of existing firm level bargaining arrangements and an enlargement of such arrangements towards both a larger company level (the linking of different certifications within the same company or group of companies) and also within the same sector. The law should provide scope for both kinds of enlargement but at lessor degrees of intensity than that which currently characterizes the relationship at <b>certification</b> <b>unit</b> level. Secondly, in as much as there is a variable move towards broader based bargaining arrangements, notions of exclusivity at these broader levels would necessarily be relaxed in favour of more pluralistic forms of representation. On the other hand, exclusivity at local level, tempered by various legal protections of the individual, continues to provide the conditions for an important counter-balance to employer power within the firm. Thirdly, there is increasing scope to afford the collective representatives of workers more systematic rights to obtain information about the evolution of the firms in which they are representative and to expand their right to maintain a physical presence within the firm. Given the increasingly important social role played by firms in the community, it is similarly necessary to envisage union action which goes beyond the traditional narrow definition of the "conditions of employment". Fourthly, in terms of whom unions might represent, the access of managers to union membership, should they so choose, should be facilitated. Such a consideration should also apply to so-called "autonomous" workers who are economically dependent on a single contracting party, particularly in the context of various, potential at least, sectoral arrangements for collective representation. Finally, it would be advisable to broaden the conception of the firm to take account of the increasingly complex corporate structures, especially in terms of the continuity of ownership. However, apart from the negotiation of new international treaties concerning collective representation across borders, our legislative regime currently provides few effective solutions to the increasing problems of cross-border representation engendered by the internationalization of production. As regards the conflictual character of labour-management relations, it should be emphasized that current trends reflect a somewhat contradictory dynamic of cooperation and conflict, itself characteristic of the employment relationship. Indeed, the law might better take account of the participative or cooperative aspects of the employment relationship by reinforcing provisions for the sharing of basic information about the firm. Nor is it impossible to envisage the imposition of employee representation at decision-making levels of the firm. Such an approach does not, however, suggest that there is a lesser need for the basic protection of trade union freedoms and independence. Similar considerations also apply to the collective agreement which therefore requires a legal framework which permits the variable expression of both the cooperative and conflictual dimensions of the employment relationship. The traditional boundaries of union representation are currently subject to considerable modification. It is important that the legal framework take account of these changes in order to ensure the continued existence of a genuine protective institution within the context of subordination which characterizes the employment relationship. In parallel to the more intense and exclusive forms of representation at local level, there is considerable scope for the expansion of a role for collective representation at both company and sectoral levels. There is yet, however, little indication of how the legal framework of collective representation can respond to the increasing challenges posed by the internationalization of production...|$|E
40|$|La {{substance}} de cet article a été présentée au congrès de l'ACFAS, à Ottawa, le 7 novembre 1964. L'auteur y résume d'abord les étapes franchies par le bill 54 avant son adoption le 22 juillet 1964. Il rattache ensuite à l’évolution générale de la législation ouvrière canadienne les principales innovations introduites par le Code du travail dans trois domaines: le droit d'association, l’unité de négociation et le règlement des conflits. The new Québec Labour Code {{came into}} effect September 1 st, 1964. It replaces the former Labour Relations Act and, in full or in part, six other related Acts. It represents Title One {{of a future}} Code which will eventually comprise all Québec legislation pertaining to labour. Bill 54 — as the proposed Labour Code was known before being adopted — was brought before the Legislative Assembly on June 5, 1963, by the Honourable René Hamel, then Minister of Labour. It was simultaneously announced that the Parliamentary Committee on Industrial Relations would be revived and public hearings were set for late June. At these hearings, objections were so strong against certain sections, and recommendations so thorough-going {{that the government had}} to abandon its first idea to pass the Bill quickly. When the second version was tabled, January 15, 1964, it was found strikingly similar to the first one, even worse {{in the eyes of the}} labour movement. Following public manifestations which included the threat of a general strike, major amendments were made to the Bill and a third version was presented to the Legislative Assembly on April 30, 1964. The amendments were intended to wider the scope of the Code, to eliminate the legal obligation of the secret ballot strike vote and to delete a reference to the Civil Code which has been introduced in the second version of the Bill. Meanwhile the case of public services had been set aside for separate study. In March, a special Parliamentary Committee sat to examine all sections of the Bill relating to these employees. The Committee presented its report in May, but due to further interventions of labour bodies, the government went far beyond the Committee's recommendations. The fourth version of Bill 54, presented July 9, 1964, incorporated basic amendments to labour relations in public services : it granted the right to strike to all public service employees except policemen and firemen (except also public school teachers and public servants whose cases still remain unsettled) with limited special powers to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council when public health or safety would be endangered by a work stoppage. Seldom did a Bill provoke so many discussions between interested groups and the government and seldom did it undergo so many changes between its first « first reading » in June, 1963, and its unanimous adoption on July 22, 1964. The main changes introduced by the new Labour Code fit properly although differently in the evolution of Canadian labour law over the past hundred years. This evolution has centered successively around three aspects of labour relations : 1) the right of association, which dominated the last century ; 2) progressive government intervention in dispute settlement, a process which began with the present century and was topped by P. C. 1003 and the Québec Labour Relations Act in 1944; 3) determination of a special type of labour-management relations through certification of labour unions, a system entrusting a union with exclusive rights of representation for bargaining purposes regarding employees of a defined unit. RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION — The Labour Code has considerably widened the scope of application of the former Labour Relations Act, bringing under the jurisdiction of the Code new categories of employees previously deprived of such legal help in the exercise of their right to organize (s. 1, m). Among those who may now apply for certification are to be found : domestic servants, farm employees, provided they number at least three, engineers, architects, doctors, accountants and other professional employees wishing to organize, provided they do so as a separate group (s. 20). But this does not mean legal sanctioning of a real unionization of cadres : all employees with managing functions remain outside of the application of the Code. In certain fields where unionization is already recognized but difficult, the Code provides new support. Thus the owner of any land or limit where logging or mining operations are carried on must allow any representative of an association of employees holding a permit of the Labour Relations Board to pass and have access to the camps (s. 8 and 9). From now on and by law the employer must make the check-off of union dues for all his employees members of a certified association who authorize him in writing to do so (s. 38). Thus the recent Québec Labour Code continues the general trend of labour legislation over the last century, which has tended to give increasing protection to the right of association and to the groups organized in accordance. BARGAINING RIGHTS AND BARGAINING UNITS — By establishing the certification system, the law has imposed a definite type of labour-management relations. A very important aspect of this relationship is the bargaining unit. In his book on LABOUR POLICY AND LABOUR ECONOMICS IN CANADA, Professor H. D. Woods has underlined the tendency of Labour Relations Acts and Labour Relations Boards to favour single-employer bargaining units. He has pointed out the advantages of redrafting the legislation to eliminate this bias toward plant or single-employer units, in order to emphasize the importance of the judgment of the interested parties and the members of the Boards. He considers also that technological change and government economic planning call for larger bargaining units. The provisions contained in the new Labour Code ignore the school of thought represented by Professor Woods's study. The Code recognizes no other <b>certification</b> <b>unit</b> than one-employer units (s. 20). It has even suppressed the few elements in the Labour Relations Act that gave some support to larger units. Multi-employer bargaining and industry-wide bargaining will have to remain on a strictly voluntary basis. The few provisions in the Code that may lead in that direction (such as the inchoative status given to recognized associations already bargaining at the industry) will prove either too weak to be significant or, as in the case of the binding character of a collective agreement made by an employers' association on all its members, present and future, it may even hamper employer organization, a prerequisite to industry-wide bargaining. From the viewpoint of the bargaining unit, the Labour Code represents no progress from the original provisions of 1944 in that field. It even appears to run counter to present economic development and seems rather inspired by economic liberalism of the past century. DISPUTE SETTLEMENT — The biggest change concerns dispute settlement. A new trend had manifested itself in the June, 1961, amendments to the Labour Relations Act, which had introduced a first restriction to government intervention in that sphere. The Labour Code, emphasizing that trend, reduces government intervention to almost its simplest expression : it leaves only one step — conciliation — and a shortened over-all waiting period (60 days from the notice to the Minister of a deadlock in negotiations, 90 days in the case of a first convention) before the strike or lock-out becomes legal. These modifications correspond to a rather new way of thinking among Canadian labour experts, according to whom the best way for government to help solve industrial conflicts is, after intervening through a relatively short conciliation effort, to leave the parties free to use the economic weapon of the strike or the lock-out at their discretion. Solving the dispute is their own responsibility, to be put squarely on their shoulders. The restitution of the right to strike to public service employees (although it appeared only in the final version of the Bill) reflects the same approach to the problem. Even where public health or safety is involved, the Cabinet has no other power than to set up a fact finding board; after the appointment of such a board, the Attorney-General may petition a judge of the Superior Court for an injunction, and the judge may grant the injunction if he considers that a work stoppage would imperil the public health or safety; but the injunction must cease not later than twenty days after the 60 -day delay allowed to the board to file its report. Further than that, the government has no power, except the general power it always has to call the Legislative Assembly for ad hoc legislation, if the case would justify such an extraordinary measure. This new approach represents a complete reversal of trend in Canadian labour legislation, which was marked, from 1900 to 1950, by ever growing and more normative government intervention. In summary and in relation to past Canadian labour law, the provisions of the Québec Labour Code reveal the following orientations. They broaden the scope of the right of association and add new supports to its exercise. Concerning the bargaining unit, they seem to go contrary to the new forces shaping our economy. In dispute settlement, they rightfully reverse an over-saturated trend of increasing government intervention. As a whole, they represent a liberalization of labour-management relations. In the second case, the term would have to be understood in reference to economic liberalism of the past century. Save for that exception, the new Code appears as a landmark of real social progress...|$|E

Crazy World was the last album to feature bassist Francis Buchholz, and by that extent, the last to feature the band's classic lineup. It also has the only Scorpions track to credit Buchholz, [...] "Kicks After Six". This album was the band's first album in {{a decade and a}} half to not be produced by Dieter Dierks and is widely considered to be the last [...] "classic" [...] Scorpions album. In the UK, it remains the only Scorpions album to attain Silver <b>certification</b> (60,000 <b>units</b> sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in November 1991.|$|R
25|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on July 24, 1990 and was available on tape, CD, vinyl and a Limited Edition version (same album but in a long box). The album would become the band's breakthrough record as it became their first album to chart in 1992, reaching #27 on the Billboard Music Charts Top Heatseekers. In March 1995 the album entered the Swedish Charts for one week managing to peak at #46. The album has since gone on to attain both Gold (500,000 units) and Platinum (1,000,000 <b>units)</b> <b>certifications</b> in the U.S. as well as Gold status in the U.K. for sales of 100,000.|$|R
50|$|Diva is {{the tenth}} studio album by Serbian singer Jelena Karleuša. It was {{released}} on 11 June 2012 via City Records. It was advertised as the fastest album on the Balkans to be certified gold: allegedly selling 200.000 copies during the first 24 hours, although those figures have never been officially certified by any institution, since in Serbia to this day {{there has been no}} serious <b>certification</b> system of <b>units</b> sold. Most of the songs on the album are covers of previously released Turkish, Indian, Israeli, Spanish and Albanian songs, with lyrics added in Serbian language, which has been Karleuša's signature method of work throughout her whole career.|$|R

Après avoir brièvement décrit certaines coordonnées juridiques relatives à ce phénomène, les auteurs précisent les sources de données auxquelles ils ont puisé leurs renseignements et ils se livrent à une analyse des résultats obtenusThis paper {{tries to}} measure, {{during a period}} of reference, the extent of union rivalry in Québec which particularizes it from other Canadian juridictions on the ground of plural unionism. As a matter of fact, many central labor bodies dispute the workers' allegiance in many sectors of activity and thus, are placed in a competitive environment. This factual situation can be prejudicial to the unity of the Québec labor movement and leads in some circumstances to strategic alliances, and in few occasions, to the elaboration of no-raiding pacts. But these sporadic attempts designed in order to eliminate inter-unions competition, are not easy to apply and they reveal an important paradox: the major portion of salaried workers is not yet unionized. It is therefore questionable to consider the usefulness of activity devoted to poaching inside the labor movement. In the theoretical context, some distinctions are made between cases relating to competition. Basically, attempts to organize simultaneously unorganized workers are contrasted with those concerned with raiding itself. In turn, one might conceive the raiding activity according to the expected result: 1) total change of allegiance; 2) splitting up the actual certification unit; 3) merger of many <b>certification</b> <b>units.</b> The main legal guidelines relating to these activities are also presented, particularly the sections devoted to the certification (section 22), to the revocation (section 41) and to the changes of affiliation when a collective agreement is in force (section 73). A summary of the legal implications of these three activities is presented in a synoptic format and a short discussion of related delays is also exposed. Finally, the theoretical frame-work is completed by a discussion of possible motives explaining these allegiance moves: one should take care in considering only one factor as determinant. The variety or real situations behind the information that has been collected necessitates elementary caution in the interpretation of the phenomenon. As far as methodology is concerned, all decisions delivered in relation to petition for certification were examined on a 13 month basis, namely from June 15 th 1978 to July 16 th 1979, and they have been manually coded according to many variables like the size of the unit, the precise sector of economic activity, and the affiliations of units involved. These sources of reference present only a partial view of the phenomenon because the construction industry, submitted to a special labour law as well as activities pertaining toCanada Labour Code, were not taken into ac-count. In matter of distinctive affiliations, the following categories were retained: a) QFL (international unions); b) QFL (national unions); c) CNTU; d) Confederation of Democratic Unions (CSD); e) Centrale de l'Enseignement du Québec (CEQ); 0 Teamster; g) Independent unions, save the Teamsters. The results show that the competition between labor organizations affects {{only a small part of}} the whole unionized labour force (2, 14 %), but this proportion expands to more than 40 % when one considers during the same period of reference, the total number of workers concerned by petitions for certification that were filed during that period. Two questions come to mind, what is the relative effectiveness of the activities conducted on this ground? And indirectly, how can we appreciate the usefulness of the resources invested by the competitive organizations? The data reveal that, in a proportion of 75 %, the winnings outnumbered the failures, on the basis of the reported attempts. Most of this reality can be attributed to the quasi-public sectors (e. g. : hospital and welfare institutions in addition to the educational sector), but the incidence in terms of workers affected by the phenomenon is much more important in the private sector. Who are the winning organizations and the targets that are more often selected in order to raid? When considering the balance between the gains and the losses, theCNTU comes first with a net number of 2, 237 workers on a total number of 9, 569, while the independent unions present a negative balance with a loss of 2, 403. In linking the number of success to the total number of attempts, one can also discover that the rate of success exceeds 70 % in all cases, leading to the conclusion that the involved organizations make realistic appraisals in their attempts. As for the targets which were more often selected, it appeared that the QFL (international unions), the CNTU and the independent unions take the first places, mainly regarding the activity of splitting up the <b>certification</b> <b>units</b> in the quasi-public sector. In conclusion, the idea of a recent noraiding pact between the CNTU and the CEQ is briefly discussed...|$|R
