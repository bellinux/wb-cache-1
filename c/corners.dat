5|$|But strategically, Smith {{was most}} {{associated}} with his implementation of John McLendon's four <b>corners</b> offense, {{a strategy for}} stalling with a lead {{near the end of}} the game. Smith's teams executed the four <b>corners</b> set so effectively that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball-control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented the four <b>corners</b> offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball: Multiple Offense and Defense, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history.|$|E

40|$|<b>Corner</b> {{detection}} {{plays an}} important role in object recognition and motion analysis. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical <b>corner</b> detection framework based on spectral clustering (SC). The framework consists of three stages: contour smoothing, <b>corner</b> cell extraction and <b>corner</b> localization. In the contour smoothing stage, wavelet decomposition is imposed on the raw contour to reduce noise. In the <b>corner</b> cell extraction stage, several atomic <b>corner</b> cells are obtained by SC. In the <b>corner</b> localization stage, the <b>corner</b> points of each <b>corner</b> cell are located by the <b>corner</b> locator based on the kernel-weighted cosine curvature measure. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Index Terms — <b>corner</b> detection, spectral clustering, mean shift 1...|$|R
5|$|East of Lewiston village, NY104 follows Ridge Road {{through a}} sparsely {{populated}} area of Niagara County. Much of this portion of NY104 is bordered on its southern end by the Tuscarora Indian Reservation. At the Lewiston hamlet of Dickersonville, the extents of the reservation head south, and development along NY104 increases slightly. NY104 meets the northern terminus of NY429 at the Lewiston–Cambria town line and crosses over NY425 at Streeters <b>Corners.</b> Just east of this location is an intersection with NY93 {{in the community of}} Molyneaux <b>Corners.</b> The two routes form a concurrency east to Warrens <b>Corners,</b> a hamlet on the Cambria–Lockport town line, where NY93 turns south to serve the city of Lockport.|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} the <b>corner</b> as {{the intersection of}} two edges or as a point {{that there are two}} dominant and different edge directions in its local neighborhood. There are several methods for <b>corner</b> detection [20 – 24]. Harris <b>corner</b> detector {{is one of the most}} well-known <b>corner</b> detectors and is based on measuring the <b>corner</b> strength. Comparison between Harris <b>corner</b> detector and other <b>corner</b> detectors like SUSAN shows the superiority of Harris <b>corner</b> detector in the case of stability and complexity (running time) [25]. Therefore, Harris <b>corner</b> detector is used for feature extraction.|$|R

5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – this becomes more pronounced at shorter focal lengths.

For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
