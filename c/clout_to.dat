5|$|Peckinpah's {{longtime}} {{composer and}} collaborator Jerry Fielding {{was hired to}} do the film score for The Getaway. He had worked previously with the director on Noon Wine (1966), The Wild Bunch (1969), Straw Dogs (1970), and Junior Bonner. After the film's second preview screening, McQueen was unhappy with the music and used his <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> hire Quincy Jones to rescore the film. Jones's music had a jazzier edge and featured harmonica solos by Toots Thielemans and vocals by Don Elliott, both {{of whom had been}} his associates. Peckinpah was unhappy with this action and took out a full-page ad in Daily Variety on November 17, 1972, including a letter he had written to Fielding thanking him for his work. Fielding would work with Peckinpah on two more films, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) and The Killer Elite (1975). Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe award for his original score.|$|E
25|$|As written above, {{the group}} was divided: Farinacci and Scorza were for a totalitarian {{solution}} together with Germany, the others for giving back the emergency war powers to the king.

However, Toohey has permeated The Banner with men loyal to him. Toohey has them quit and uses his <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> keep others out. He leads a campaign against The Banners new policy that all but kills the paper. Faced with losing the enterprise, Wynand saves The Banner by bringing back Toohey's gang to join {{the rest of the}} public in condemning Roark.|$|E
60|$|Oh, it was {{all very}} grotesque, to be sure. But then, mutiny on the high seas in the year nineteen-thirteen is also grotesque. No lists here between mailed knights for a lady's favour, but merely the trouncing of a chuckle-head for {{spitting}} on the deck of a coal-carrier. Nevertheless, the fact that my lady looked on added zest to my enterprise, and, doubtlessly, speed and weight to my blows, and {{at least half a dozen}} additional <b>clouts</b> <b>to</b> the unlucky sailor.|$|R

25|$|Del Toro {{released}} Pan's Labyrinth in 2006, and {{the film}} earned multiple Academy Awards, providing the director enough <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> begin production on the film. Guillermo del Toro began filming the film in June 2007 in Budapest and concluded in December 2007. The film was the first American production to shoot at Korda Studios in Hungary, then newly built outside Budapest. The creature shop was led by the company Spectral Motion, and Filmefex contributed work in makeup and prosthetics. The latter company designed a creature for the troll market scene and built several statues and full-sized replicas of the Golden Army.|$|E
25|$|Production Designer Keith Wilson {{stated in}} an {{interview}} in Destination: Moonbase Alpha that he was always being ordered by Producer Fred Freiberger to make sets smaller, taking away the expansive (and expensive) look of the first series' interiors. Freiberger was very budget-conscious and, despite press releases to the contrary, the production team was working with less money this series. If there had been a budget increase, the 'stagflation' economy of the seventies would have cancelled it out. When interviewed, many of the actors state they were asked to accept less money, including Landau and Bain (who were the only ones with enough <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> be able to refuse).|$|E
25|$|The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence {{made their}} first {{appearance}} on Castro Street in San Francisco in 1979. Their approach and appearance was not new or extraordinary {{for the place}} or time. Starting in the 1960s, the Castro District began transitioning from a working class Irish Catholic district going through significant economic decline. A gay bar opened on Market Street and gradually, gay men began to migrate to the neighborhood. By 1977, between 100,000 and 200,000 had moved to San Francisco {{from all over the}} United States, changing the political and cultural profile of the city. The migration created a gay community in the city with enough political <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> elect a gay representative to city government, Harvey Milk.|$|E

25|$|After 1847, California was {{controlled}} (with much difficulty due to desertions) by a U.S. Army-appointed military governor and an inadequate {{force of a}} little over 600 troops. By 1850, California had grown to have a non-Indian and non-Californio population of over 100,000 due to the California Gold Rush. Despite a major conflict in the U.S. Congress {{on the number of}} slave versus non-slave states, the large, rapid and continuing California population gains and the large amount of gold being exported east gave California enough <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> choose its own boundaries, select its representatives, write its Constitution, and be admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850 without going through territorial status as required for most other states.|$|E
25|$|Paramount {{production}} chief Robert Evans, who {{had given}} Puzo an advance to write The Godfather so that Paramount would own the movie rights, hired Coppola after many major directors had turned the movie down because he wanted an Italian-American director who could provide the movie with cultural authenticity. Coppola also came cheap. Evans was conscious {{of the fact that}} Paramount's last Mafia movie, The Brotherhood (1968) had been a box office bomb, and he believed it was partly {{due to the fact that}} the director, Martin Ritt, and the star, Kirk Douglas, were Jews and the film lacked an authentic Italian flavor. The studio originally intended the movie to be a low-budget production set in contemporary times without any major actors, but the phenomenal success of the novel gave Evans the <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> turn The Godfather into a prestige picture.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1930s Juan Trippe had coveted {{domestic}} routes for Pan Am. Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, {{and in the}} mid-1970s, there were talks of merging the airline with a domestic operator such as American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, Trans World Airlines or United Airlines. As rival airlines convinced Congress that Pan Am would use its political <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> monopolize U.S. air routes, the CAB repeatedly denied the airline permission {{to operate in the}} U.S., by growth or by a merger with another airline. Pan Am remained an American carrier operating international routes only (aside from Hawaii and Alaska). The last time Pan Am was permitted to merge with another airline prior to the deregulation of the U.S. airline industry was in 1950, when it took over American Overseas Airlines from American Airlines. After deregulation in 1978, more U.S. domestic airlines began competing with Pan Am internationally.|$|E

25|$|After the {{commercial}} {{success of their}} first two albums, the band became involved in a dispute with their record label, Sony, regarding accounting procedures, alleging that in at least 30 cases Sony had used fraudulent accounting practices, underpaying them at least $4 million (£2.7m) in royalties on their albums over the previous three years. Sony held out, and the trio walked away, with Sony suing the group for failure to complete their contract. The Chicks responded with their own $4.1-million lawsuit against Sony Music Entertainment on August 27, which added <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> claims made by singers Courtney Love, Aimee Mann, and LeAnn Rimes against the recording industry. After months of negotiation, the Chicks settled their suit privately, and were awarded their own record label imprint, Open Wide Records, which afforded them more control, a better contract, {{and an increase in}} royalty money, with Sony still responsible for marketing and distribution of albums.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} {{known as}} food sovereignty views the business practices of multinational corporations {{as a form}} of neocolonialism. It contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations, particularly in the tropics. They also have the political <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> convert these resources to the exclusive production of cash crops for sale to industrialized nations outside of the tropics, and in the process to squeeze the poor off of the more productive lands. Under this view subsistence farmers are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations. Likewise, food sovereignty holds it to be true that communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right. With several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries, technologies that include improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue. Many communities calling for food sovereignty are protesting the imposition of Western technologies on to their indigenous systems and agency.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} source of revenue is television. The 1980s saw {{competition}} between terrestrial broadcasters {{for the rights to}} show League matches, but the arrival on the scene of satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting (Sky TV), eagerly searching for attractive programming to build its customer base and willing to pay huge sums, changed the picture entirely. The League's top tier clubs had been agitating for several years {{to be able to keep}} more of the League's revenue for themselves, threatening to break away and form their own league if necessary. In 1992 the threat was realised as the First Division clubs left to establish the FA Premier League and signed a contract for exclusive live coverage of their games with Sky TV. The FA Premier League agreed to maintain the promotion and relegation of three clubs with The Football League, but The League was now in a far weaker position – without its best clubs and without the <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> negotiate high-revenue TV deals. This problem was exacerbated with the collapse in 2002 of ITV Digital, holder of TV rights for The Football League, which cost League clubs millions of pounds in revenue.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of diamonds in Sierra Leone invited {{and led to}} the civil war in several ways. First, the highly unequal benefits resulting from diamond mining made ordinary Sierra Leoneans frustrated. Under the Stevens government, revenues from the National Diamond Mining Corporation (known as DIMINCO) – a joint government/DeBeers venture – were used for the personal enrichment of Stevens and of members of the government and business elite who were close to him. When DeBeers pulled out of the venture in 1984, the government lost direct control of the diamond mining areas. By the late 1980s, almost all of Sierra Leone's diamonds were being smuggled and traded illicitly, with revenues going directly into the hands of private investors. In this period the diamond trade was dominated by Lebanese traders and later (after a shift in favor {{on the part of the}} Momoh government) by Israelis with connections to the international diamond markets in Antwerp. Momoh made some efforts to reduce smuggling and corruption in the diamond mining sector, but he lacked the political <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> enforce the law. Even after the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) took power in 1992, ostensibly with the goal of reducing corruption and returning revenues to the state, high-ranking members of the government sold diamonds for their personal gain and lived extravagantly off the proceeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} to and {{defeat of the}} agrarian law sponsored by Pompey {{was more than just}} {{opposition to}} Pompey. Nor was the law exclusively about allotting land for the settlement of Pompey's veterans. Pompey did want to allocate plots of land to his veterans. Soldiers had been expecting to be allocated land to farm after having fought in a war since Sulla had granted his soldiers land in 80 BC. Pompey wanted to fulfill this obligation. However, the law was framed {{in a way that the}} land would be distributed to the landless urban poor as well. This would help to relieve the problem of the mass of the landless unemployed or underemployed poor in Rome, which relied on the provision of a grain dole by the state to survive. It would also make Pompey popular among the plebeians. Populares politicians had been proposing this kind land reform since the introduction of the agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC. These were always strongly opposed by the optimates. This issue had led to the murder of Tiberius Gracchus. Attempts to introduce such agrarian laws since then were defeated by the optimates. Thus, the opposition to the bill sponsored by Pompey came within this wider historical context of optimate resistance to reform as well as the optimates being suspicious of Pompey. A crucial element in the defeat of the bill sponsored by Pompey was the fact what the optimates had a strong consul in Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer who vehemently and successfully resisted its enactment, while the consul sponsored by Pompey, Lucius Afrianius was ineffective. He was of no assistance. The lack of effective consular assistance had been a weakness for Pompey. As already mentioned above, Plutarch wrote that the defeat of the bill forced Pompey to seek the support of plebeian tribunes, and thus of the populares. With the return of Caesar from his governorship in Hispania, Pompey found politician who would have the strength and <b>clout</b> <b>to</b> push the bill through if he became a consul.|$|E
500|$|Zerbe's {{proposal}} led to {{the appointment}} of a committee to transmit the proposal to Congress and urge its adoption.
