25|$|What {{was unique}} about the Zisapels' {{business}} philosophy was that each company would operate independently, without a holding company, {{but all of}} the companies would be guided by them under a collective strategic umbrella. Companies may cooperate in the development of their solutions, engage in joint marketing activities and benefit from a <b>common</b> <b>management</b> structure. This decentralized business philosophy was designed to maximize the advantages inherent in smaller business units, such as flexibility, entrepreneurial spirit and management focus. As a result, since 1984, when the RAD Group came into being, it has spawned more than 185 companies, 8 IPOs and 19 mergers and acquisitions.|$|E

Longitudinal, ethnographic data gathered over 12 years about a joint venture ecotourism project between a private company and a local community show three outcomes that support <b>commons</b> <b>management</b> and three outcomes that challenge it. The outcomes in favor of <b>commons</b> <b>management</b> include: direct economic returns that act as conservation incentives, strengthened organization resulting from participatory management of ecotourism, and expanded networks of support from outside actors. Outcomes that are challenging the potential for collective action include: direct economic returns that enable expanded individual production and extraction, a new spirit of individual entrepreneurship that threatens to debilitate traditional social relations and institutions, and a conservation ethic that fosters dualistic thinking about people and nature and the zoning of places where resources are used vs. where they are preserved...|$|R

60|$|As to the {{disposition}} of the opposite party, we all remember, that {{the removal of the}} last ministry was brought about by several degrees; through which means it happened, that they and their friends were hardly recovered out of one astonishment, before they fell into another. This scene lasted for some months, and was followed by a period of rage and despair, natural to those who reflect that they have lost a secure game, by their own rashness, folly, and want of <b>common</b> <b>management,</b> when, at the same time, they knew by experience, that a watchful and dexterous adversary lay ready to take the advantage. However, some time before the session, the heads of that party began to recollect themselves, and rally their forces, like an enemy who hath been beaten out of the field, but finds he is not pursued; for although the chiefs of this faction were thought to have but little esteem or friendship for each other, yet they perfectly agreed in one general end, of distressing, by all possible methods, the new administration, wherein if they could succeed so far as to put the Queen under any great necessity, another Parliament must be called, and perhaps the power[10] devolve again into their own hands.|$|E

40|$|Vanuatu's common {{property}} {{natural resources}} provide essential ecological {{services for the}} global community and sustain the livelihoods of 80 % of the Vanuatu population. Sustainable management of natural resources is dependent on locally developed systems that govern common property resources. Understanding the drivers of <b>commons</b> <b>management</b> problems from local resource-users' perspectives is essential to know how local governance systems can be supported and strengthened. I explore locally identified drivers of <b>commons</b> <b>management</b> problems using {{a case study of}} the Tangoa Island community of South Santo, Vanuatu. Methods include participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques and 31 interviews with local people. Literature from Vanuatu as well as 18 interviews with Vanuatu government departments, NGOs, and aid donors informs how relevant the issues identified in the case study are for other communities across Vanuatu. I found that drivers at different contextual scales, from local to global, affect two main elements of a community's cooperative capacity for <b>commons</b> <b>management</b> - social cohesion and governance systems. The issues identified by the Tangoa Island community affect many Vanuatu communities because they are driven by wider processes of social, cultural, economic, and institutional change. Approaches to support and strengthen local social and governance systems can target drivers at multiple contextual scales...|$|R

It has deployed identity, traditional knowledge, science, and institutional innovation to adapt to outside challenges without destroying local <b>commons</b> <b>management.</b> This paper reviews scholarly debate on natural resource management and uses resilience theory to examine this complex adaptive system. Two disturbances to Shimshal resilience prompted by a national park and a new road are traced. Shimshali responses include social processes of learning, knowledge systems, and renewal. Ways in which adaptive renewal cycles involve Revolt, a short, fast reaction, and Remember, a larger, slower cascade, are put in perspective. Simple and powerful qualities that guide change are highlighted. We conclude that the Shimshal Nature Trust creates a resilient interface between the outside and inside worlds.

This study considers the example of localized degradation of a shared rangeland where users and rangeland sub-areas differ in characteristics. A model of land-use decisions is developed. Longitudinal data on land-use decisions are investigated. The impact of proportionate reduction and uniform quota policies are evaluated by simulating estimation results. The study finds recognizing heterogeneity allows insight into the causes of localized degradation, and explains how policies intended {{to increase the efficiency}} of exploitation can go awry if heterogeneity is not recognized. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{question}} of how economic and socio-cultural heterogeneity impacts <b>commons</b> <b>management</b> has been receiving increasing attention, but without resolution. However, the issue is increasingly important in a globalizing world. This paper builds upon recent theoretical works to provide {{a clearer understanding of}} the conditions under which we might expect economic inequality to have positive, or negative, effects. Of critical importance to the argument is the distinction between the problem of collective action, and the problem of providing collective goods. A synthetic set of predictions is subsequently developed and tested with a comparative analysis of case studies of fisheries and irrigation systems. ...|$|R
