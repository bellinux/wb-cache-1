Similarly, lower fruit severity (11. 86 %) was observed with the same treatment. In general, reduction in B. cinerea incidence and severity was lower when common horsetail extract was used, compared to cinnamon extracts.

Administration with cinnamon extracts (0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 g/kg) for 28 days significantly reduced the impact of CCl 4 toxicity on the serum markers of liver damage, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. In addition, treatment of cinnamon extract resulted in markedly increased the levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes in rats. The histopathological studies in the liver of rats also supported that cinnamon extract markedly reduced the toxicity of CCl 4 and preserved the histoarchitecture of the liver tissue to near normal. Thus, the results suggest that cinnamon extract acts as a potent hepatoprotective agent against CCl 4 induced hepatotoxicity in rats...|$|R

Each extract presented a fungicidal effect, at a concentration of 5 %, when applied on allspice (Pimenta dioica) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum). Only clove extract retained its effect at a concentration of 1 %, while allspice lost it at 3 %. <b>Cinnamon</b> (<b>Cinnamomum</b> <b>zeylanicum)</b> and yambean (Pachyrhizus erosus) extracts produced total inhibition of sclerotial production besides a poor mycelial growth. Different types of interactions were present when the extracts were mixed: all combinations presented a lost of fungicidal effect (antagonistic effect), including allspice extract; a retained fungicidal effect (single fungicidal effect) occurred in most clove mixtures and in the combination of clove and black pepper (Piper nigrum) the retained fungicidal effect was even below the minimal lethal dose (synergistic effect). The combination of extracts showed {{that the effect of}} each plant extract could be modified by the reactions of the complex mixture of plant compounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate pretreatment efficacy of <b>cinnamon</b> (<b>Cinnamomum</b> <b>zeylanicum)</b> on blood glucose level as well as oxidative changes at the liver level. Following acute restraint stress, the experimental animals (n =  6) were randomly assigned into four groups, i. e., non-stressed control, stress control and treatment groups (cinnamon decoction 10 %, 3 and 6  ml/kg, p. o, for 7  days). Anti-stress effect of cinnamon was studied by estimation of blood glucose level, liver marker enzymes; aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase, liver reduced glutathione (GSH) and liver antioxidant enzymes; super oxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR). Acute restraint stress was evidenced by reduction of blood glucose level and liver GSH and elevation of liver marker enzymes in serum. In addition, antioxidant enzymes were drastically inhibited in liver homogenate of stress control rats. Pre-treatment with cinnamon decoction 10 %, (3  ml/kg and 6  ml/kg, p. o, for 7  days) avoided the changes observed in stress control rats. This study substantiates that cinnamon is effective in minimizing stress responses thereby beneficial in stress therapy...|$|R
40|$|The anti-Candida {{activity}} of essential oil from <b>Cinnamomum</b> <b>zeylanicum</b> <b>Blume,</b> {{as well as}} its effect on the roughness and hardness of the acrylic resin used in dental prostheses, was assessed. The safety and tolerability of the test product were assessed through a phase I clinical trial involving users of removable dentures. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC) were determined against twelve Candida strains. Acrylic resin specimens were exposed to artificial saliva (GI), C. zeylanicum (GII), and nystatin (GIII) for 15 days. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey posttest (α= 5 %). For the phase I clinical trial, 15 healthy patients used solution of C. zeylanicum at MIC (15 days, 3 times a day) and were submitted to clinical and mycological examinations. C. zeylanicum showed anti-Candida activity, with MIC = 625. 0 [*]µg/mL being equivalent to MFC. Nystatin caused greater increase in roughness and decreased the hardness of the material (P< 0. 0001), with no significant differences between GI and GII. As regards the clinical trial, no adverse clinical signs were observed after intervention. The substance tested had a satisfactory level of safety and tolerability, supporting new advances involving the clinical use of essential oil from C. zeylanicum...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cinnamomum</b> <b>zeylanicum</b> <b>Blume,</b> Lauraceae, {{has long}} been known for having many {{biological}} properties. This study aimed to identify the constituents of the essential oil from C. zeylanicum leaves using GC-MS and to assess its inhibitory effect on Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa based on MIC and MBC determination and kill-time study. Eugenol (73. 27 %) was the most prevalent compound in the essential oil followed by trans-&# 946;-cariophyllene (5. 38 %), linalool (3. 31 %), and alcohol cinamic acetate (2. 53 %). The results showed an interesting antibacterial activity of the oil with MIC ranging from 1. 25 to 10 µL. mL- 1. MBC values were in the range of 20 - 80 µL. mL- 1. A concentration of 10 and 40 µL. mL- 1 of the essential oil caused a fast and steady decrease in viable cell count (2 to 5 log cycles) of all assayed strains along 24 hours. A concentration of 40 µL. mL- 1 of the oil provided a total elimination of the initial inocula of S. aureus after 2 hours. These results show the possibility of regarding the essential oil from C. zeylanicum leaves as alternative sources of antimicrobial compounds to be applied in food conservation systems...|$|R
