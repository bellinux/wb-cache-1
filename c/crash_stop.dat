At present there are several calculation methods about them, but all these methods have large error. Based on the research of the existing calculation methods, this paper simplifies vessel resistance and calculates vessel’s <b>stopping</b> distance and <b>crash</b> <b>stopping</b> distance accurately by means of physical and mathematical methods. 1 forward Vessel’s stopping distance (VSD) and Vessel’s <b>crash</b> <b>stopping</b> distance (VCSD) are two important indexes measuring the braking performance of the vessel.

As early as the 1970 s, Chinese scholars Wang FengChen and Liu ZhengJiang et al. began to make research on large vessel’s stopping performance. [1, 2, 3] These research mainly used regression method on the measured data of VCSD to get the VCSD calculation formula. Foreign scholars have carried out extensive research, such as Tani, Okamoto, Havald, respectively put forward their own views and methods about the calculation of the VCSD for different type of vessel...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{propulsion}} control aspects relating {{to some of the}} most critical emergency manoeuvres of a ship: slam start and <b>crash</b> <b>stop.</b> In these particular situations a very important role is played by the automation system that has to manage the whole propulsive chain (i. e. main engine, mechanical transmission and propeller) in a safe and efficient way. With regard to this, a simulation based design methodology is adopted to develop and test new control schemes for ship propulsion. The proposed control layout is applicable to any type of propulsion systems equipped with controllable pitch propellers, since it is mainly based on the automatic adjustment of the propeller pitch. Thus the desired performance requirements are met through adaptive control strategies able to address the complex issues of slam start, <b>crash</b> <b>stop</b> and similar stressful manoeuvres. The adaptivity of the automation process to several critical propulsive conditions reduces significantly the number of the control parameters to be estimated, as recently demonstrated by the automation design of a new twin-screw ship.

In this thesis, CheapBFT a new Byzantine Fault Tolerant state machine replication(BFT) is described. It is tuned to a minimal resource usage compared with other BFT protocols. Most BFT protocols tolerate f Byzantine failures with replication of services on 3 f + 1 replicas whereas CheapBFT requires only f + 1 replicas at the agreement as well as the execution stage during normal operation. In case of suspected or detected faults, we rapidly activate up to f  additional nodes to participate in consensus and execution. Besides the clear benefits in cost, maintenance, management, and complexity of having less replicas to tolerate a certain number of faults, our protocol is simpler than previous ones.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a typical four-stroke, medium-speed, marine diesel engine driving a Controllable Pitch Propeller (CPP) is investigated during ship maneuvering including fast propeller pitch changes. A modular model has been developed in Simulink/Matlab for the simulation {{of the dynamics of}} ship propulsion. The developed model considers the ship propulsion system as a set of three main modules: the engine, the propeller and the ship hull. The developed ship propulsion dynamics model has been validated {{with a wide range of}} experimental data from a 500 kW test engine (MAN B&W 5 L 16 / 24), coupled to a four quadrant electric brake (AEG), installed at the test-bed of the Laboratory of Marine Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA/LME).

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} two different mathematical models for the LM 2500 gas turbine, prime mover widely used on board of Italian Navy ships and selected for the propulsion plant of the new aircraft carrier ‘Cavour’. In the first gas turbine model, developed by the authors and based on physical laws, each gas turbine component (i. e. compressor, turbine, combustor) is modelled in a specific module, which combines available performance maps with the solution of time dependent momentum, energy and mass equations. In the second model, the overall gas turbine performance is described more simply by performance tables, but, {{in order to take}} into account the dynamic effects typical of transient situations, the calculation results are corrected by means of time constants. Both models, validated by comparison with manufacturer data, have been used, alternatively, for the simulation of the mentioned ship propulsion system, whose main characteristics and performance capabilities are analysed and discussed. The paper presents the simulation results of two different ship manoeuvres (slam start and <b>crash</b> <b>stop),</b> obtained by using each of the different considered approaches. The comparison of the results puts into evidence the influence of the adopted gas turbine model on the ship simulation results from the point of view of reliability and computer time...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} mainly {{focused on the}} {{mathematical}} model of the control pitch mechanism for a marine controllable pitch propeller (CPP), able to perform the propeller blade position change and to give a proper information about the oil pressures, produced inside the CPP hub. In fact, too high pressures can {{be responsible for the}} mechanism failure, then they should be always under examination by the ship automation. With regard to the traditional representation of the few spindle torque data reported in literature, in the proposed mathematical model the transportation inertial forces and the Coriolis inertial forces acting on the propeller blade are evaluated taking into account the yaw motion of the ship, the propeller speed (including shaft accelerations and decelerations) and the blade turning during the pitch change. On the basis of the introduced procedure, it is developed the CPP model which is part of an overall propulsion simulator, representing the dynamic behaviour of a twin-screw fast vessel. The aim of the work is to represent the ship propulsion dynamics by time domain simulation, on the ground of which the automation designers can develop and test several propulsion control options.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a numerical procedure for the simulation of a marine propulsion plant in transient conditions: the model describes {{in detail the}} various elements of the propulsion system and the interactions existing between each of them. The thermodynamic behaviour of the main engine {{as well as of}} the turbocharger group is modelled, in order to predict not only the mechanical stress of the plant due to the transient conditions, but also the thermal stresses and working point of the compressor and of the turbine (pressure and temperature at inlet/outlet). As a first application of the model, the case is considered of a twin screw vessel powered by two four stroke medium speed diesel engines with controllable pitch propellers. The simulations presented in the paper regard two transient manoeuvres of the ship: slam-start (from zero speed to full ahead) and <b>crash</b> <b>stop</b> (from full ahead to zero speed with a “full astern” command). The results of the simulations are compared with the available experimental data, regarding the time histories of the vessel speed, space run before a complete stop, propeller r. p. m. and shaft power, showing a good accordance. The procedure can be utilised to check the behaviour of the turbocharger group during a transient manoeuvre and to identify possible improvements in the ship control system or in the pitch-r. p. m. combination law to optimise the performances, in term of e. g. stopping space of the vessel or thermal and mechanical stresses of the plan...|$|E

40|$|Fluidised bed {{combustion}} (FBC) {{has been}} identified {{as one of the best}} technologies available for lump coal combustion. A major drawback during prolonged operation of FBC systems particularly bubbling fluidised bed (BFB) systems is sintering and agglomerate formation of bed material that affects performance efficiency and reliability in industrial applications as exemplified at Associated British Sugar (AB Sugar). The mechanisms responsible for sintering and agglomerate formation in this type of system need to be understood, to promote continual use of this technology for efficient coal utilisation. The first set of investigations focused on agglomeration properties of bed material (Garside 14 / 25 sand) used in Industrial FBC at AB Sugar. Bed material was calcinated between 800 and 1200 °C in a high temperature furnace in the absence and presence of coal (three types of bituminous coals) or coal ash. Results showed sintering and agglomerate formation of bed material can occur in the absence of coal or coal ash at a calcination temperature near 1200 °C. Addition of coal or coal ash further promotes sintering and agglomerate formation at 1000 °C. Combustion stages appears to influence surface morphology, chemistry and mechanisms of agglomerated bed material based on similarities observed in the agglomerated bed material formed from calcination of Garside 14 / 25 sand bed material mixed with coal, and those formed in industrial scale FBC during combustion of lump coal. The second set of investigations used two different lump bituminous coals classified as washed (undergone washing process to remove mud/shale stone) or unwashed (still containing the mud/shale) from the same mine (Blyth, typically referred to as Blyth coals) as those used in the AB Sugar industrial FBC. Combustion of washed and unwashed Blyth lump coals (9 to 19 mm particle size) was investigated in a 30 kW pilot scale bubbling fluidised bed combustor (PSBFBC) during normal combustion and <b>crash</b> <b>stop</b> combustion runs. This simulated conditions in the AB Sugar Industrial FBC system with a thermal rating of approximately 30 MW, which uses larger coal particle size of 12 to 25 mm. Results reveal unwashed Blyth lump coal in the PSBFBC and industrial FBC causes some sintering and agglomerate formation of the bed material over short operation periods of 52 and 240 hours respectively, which was not observed in the washed Blyth coal system over a similar operating period. Observed sintering and agglomeration formation in unwashed Blyth coal is mainly attributed to accumulation of mud/shale stones in the bed, which would have been mostly removed by the washing process. The <b>crash</b> <b>stop</b> combustion run, done to simulate the fan trip scenario in the industrial FBC system, promoted sintering and agglomerate formation in the PSBFBC, possibly due to the 30 to 50 °C temperature rise in the bed when fluidised air was stopped. Continuous deposition and increasing concentration of mud/shale stones in the bed affects the localised temperature as well as the fluidising properties and quality, eventually promoting sintering and agglomerate formation. PSBFBC bed height, bed material particle size and measured pressure drop also increase with increasing operating time and mud/shale stones deposition in the bed. Deposition of coal ash to the surface of the bed material (sand) in the PSBFBC was analysed by the use of SEM-EDX and XRF. The deposition of ash to the surface of PSBFBC bed material sand increases as the operation times increases, as identified by increasing concentration of Al, K and Ca on fluidised bed sand particle surfaces in their stable oxide forms of Al 2 O 3, K 2 O and CaO respectively...|$|E
40|$|Design and {{optimisation}} of the {{propulsion system}} is a crucial task of the ship design. In fact the behaviour of the propulsion {{system is a}} key aspect of the global behaviour of a ship, mainly if the ship is a naval vessel. Marine propulsion simulation systems {{can be used to}} predict the propulsion plant behaviour during critical situations and during normal working condition variations. Different operational speeds, acceleration, deceleration, <b>crash</b> <b>stop,</b> heavy turning and faults are some examples of transient situation that a propulsion system has to sustain without reducing the ship safety and reliability. Generally the ship has to demonstrate the ability to perform some of the above mentioned manoeuvres by sea trials, which are costly and time consuming. In this paper a rapid prototyping and testing procedure for the propulsion controller of the new Italian Aircraft Carrier “Cavour” is proposed, using real-time hardware-in-the-loop (RT HIL) simulation. The adopted approach is the following. First the propulsion control system and the propulsion system are prototyped using a simulation model for ship propulsion developed at DINAV. The performances of the ship and its control system are evaluated using non real-time simulation. Then the control system is implemented on the real hardware and tested with RT HIL simulation. RT HIL simulation consists in the real hardware controller, which interacts with the ship propulsion models (engine, shaft line, propeller, etc.) that are simulated in real-time. This technique increases the realism of the simulation, providing access to issues not usually available in software-only simulation models, making the test of the new propulsion controller fast, safe and reliable. Consequently, it let to significantly reduce the time spent to tune the control system during the ship delivery sea trials...|$|E
