5|$|Feeling a {{vocation}} {{to minister to}} the urban poor, Henson served in the East End of London and Barking before becoming chaplain of an ancient hospice in Ilford in 1895.

5|$|Fingleton {{was dropped}} after this Test, and was <b>controversially</b> {{overlooked}} for the 1934 tour of England despite strong performances for New South Wales.

Other factors speculated to have contributed to his omission included a dispute that Fingleton had with Woodfull during a Sheffield Shield match, and interstate rivalries between New South Wales and Victoria causing Fingleton's omission at the expense of an additional Victorian.|$|E
5|$|Given {{was part}} of the team for most of the 2006 FIFA World Cup {{qualifying}} campaign; however a draw with Switzerland meant Ireland failed to qualify for the finals of the competition in Germany.

5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, <b>controversially</b> and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E
5|$|In England, {{tuition fee}} caps rose with the Higher Education Act 2004. Under the Act, {{universities}} in England {{could begin to}} charge variable fees of up to £3000 a year for students enrolling on courses as from the academic year of 2006-07 or later. This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006-07 and introduced in Wales in 2007-08. In 2009-10 the cap rose to £3225 a year {{to take account of}} inflation.

5|$|In September 2000, Tillingbourne <b>controversially</b> {{reduced the}} number of {{journeys}} on contracted route 516, which linked Dorking, Leatherhead and Epsom.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the show}} has been {{broadcast}} on terrestrial television on BBC Two. Although <b>controversially</b> it was broadcast at 11:20 pm and catchup was not available on BBC iPlayer.

5|$|James VI's {{inheritance}} of the English crown in 1603 led to rule via the Privy Council from London. He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly and increased the number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most <b>controversially</b> kneeling for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were {{seen by many as}} a step back to Catholic practice.|$|E
5|$|Links in some areas, {{especially}} lower-income and lower-traffic areas, {{are expected}} to not display advertisements {{because it is not}} worthwhile for CityBridge to advertise in these areas. <b>Controversially,</b> the Links that lack advertising {{are expected to}} exhibit network speeds that may be as slow as one-tenth of the network speeds of advertisement-enabled Links. , wealthier neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens are expected to have the most Links with advertisements and fast network speeds, while poorer neighborhoods and Staten Island would get slower Links with no advertising.|$|E
5|$|Now with Jock Stein as manager, Celtic enjoyed another {{successful}} run in Europe in 1965–66, {{reaching the}} semi-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup by knocking out Go Ahead Deventer, AGF Aarhus and Dynamo Kyiv.

5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, framing Lépine's actions {{as the result}} of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong <b>controversially</b> suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E
5|$|Some Mauritanian {{dolphins}} {{cooperate with}} human fishermen. The dolphins drive {{a school of}} fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch {{a large number of}} fish as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. <b>Controversially,</b> Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of cetacean culture. Similar cases have been observed in Laguna, Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well.|$|E
5|$|The Interzonal tournament {{was held}} in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, in November and December 1970. The top six players of the interzonal (shown in bold in the table below) {{qualified}} for the Candidates Tournament. Bobby Fischer had not qualified {{to play in this}} event, as he had not participated in the 1969 US Championship (Zonal). However, Benko (and the reserve Lombardy) gave up his spot, and FIDE President Max Euwe <b>controversially</b> allowed Fischer to participate instead. A compensation of US$1,500 was paid to Benko for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|The club {{played at}} Glenmalure Park from 1926 to 1987, when the owners <b>controversially</b> sold the stadium to {{property}} developers.

They moved into Tallaght Stadium {{prior to the start}} of the 2009 season after years of delays and legal disputes, during which time the club's supporters saved them from extinction.|$|E
5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the {{neoconservative}} movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More <b>controversially,</b> it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E
