500|$|Why Sibelius {{should have}} failed to prepare The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> for {{publication}} {{is a question that}} has perplexed scholars. On the advice of Ferruccio Busoni, Sibelius in 1895 offered The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> to the Russian music publisher Mitrofan Belyayev but it was not published. Murtomäki has suggested that Sibelius, despite having been fond of The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph,</b> was [...] "unsure about the true value" [...] of his output from the 1890s, an ambivalence that is perhaps best illustrated by the piecemeal publication history of, and multiple revisions to, the four Lemminkäinen legends (appearing in the composer's 1911 diary under a list of works to be rewritten, The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph,</b> too, seems to have been scheduled by Sibelius for a reexamination, albeit one that never came to pass). Scholars have offered a number of explanations as to why Sibelius may have [...] "turned his back" [...] on his early compositions. Perhaps, as master, he looked back on the works of his youth as technically [...] "inferior" [...] to his mature output; or, as evolving artist, he sought distance from passionate, nationalistic exclamations as he developed his own, unique musical style and aimed to transition from [...] "local hero" [...] to [...] "international composer"; or, as elder statesman, he feared he might have [...] "revealed himself too much" [...] in early [...] "confessional" [...] works, such as En saga, Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island, and The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph.</b> In the absence of any new information from Sibelius's papers, however, the reason why The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> was never published ultimately [...] "appears doomed to remain a subject of speculation".|$|R

500|$|Guy Rickards, concurring that The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> [...] "never quite escapes a {{dependence}} on the verses", has echoed Tawaststjerna in wondering {{what might have been}} had Sibelius returned in his maturity to The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph,</b> as with [...] Finnish composer Kalevi Aho's response has been similar, calling the ballade [...] "an interesting work" [...] in need of [...] "more polishing". Finnish conductor Osmo Vänskä, however, has championed the ballad. [...] "It's a tremendous piece," [...] Vänskä has said in interview. [...] "He [...] never managed to revise it, but nothing is wrong with the music. Sibelius never forbade performance of The Wood Nymph." [...] Stylistically, scholars have detected in The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> the influence of Richard Wagner. Murtomäki, for example, discerns the [...] "erotic harmonic vocabulary" [...] of Tristan und Isolde in the third section and the [...] "motive of the forbidden question" [...] from Lohengrin in the funereal march from the finale. In light of Sibelius's [...] "Nietzschean response" [...] to Wagner's operas (initially enamored, Sibelius by July 1894 had repudiated Wagner's ideas as [...] "calculated" [...] and [...] "manufactured"), such observations are of particular interest in that they illustrate the extent to which Sibelius, at the time of The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph,</b> had not yet succeeded in breaking with the German master.|$|R

500|$|Although well {{received}} upon its premiere, critical opinion {{as to the}} merit of The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> has varied. Following the 1895 premiere, Oskar Merikanto, writing in Päivälehti, praised Sibelius for having [...] "masterfully" [...] recreated Rydberg's plot {{with the use of}} [...] "unique and fascinating colors", while critic Karl Flodin complained in Nya Pressen that it was [...] "unquestionably too long". Modern day opinion has been similarly equivocal. While conceding that The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> contains [...] "some splendid melodic ideas" [...] and [...] "luxuriant scoring", Erik Tawaststjerna has characterized the work as the [...] "experiment" [...] of a composer [...] "still trying to find his feet as a tone-poet", suggesting that Sibelius is too dependent on the source material's narrative structure. Murtomäki, though praising the ballade for its [...] "unforced freshness of vision and tonal audacity" [...] and [...] "well elaborated, original and inventive characters", agrees with Tawaststjerna that The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> is too episodic in construction: ...|$|R
500|$|After 1936, The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> again {{disappeared}} from the repertoire. Throughout his career, Sibelius was troubled with creative 'blocks' and bouts of depression. This led him to commit score to the flames when he felt unable to revise them to the level he demanded. This was the fate most notoriously of the Symphony No. 8, but also of many works from the 1880s and 1890s. He did not, however, destroy The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph.</b> The ballade lay neglected amongst the more than 10,000 pages of papers and scores which the composer's family had deposited in 1982 at the University of Helsinki Library archive. The work was 'rediscovered' by the manuscript expert Kari Kilpeläinen; its subsequent inspection by Fabian Dahlström [...] "caught Finland, and the musical world, by surprise": the tone poem, 22 minutes in length and scored for full orchestra, was {{far more than the}} melodrama [...] "recast without the speaker" [...] many in the Sibelius establishment had assumed it to be. The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> received its modern day 'world premiere' on 9 February 1996 by the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, with Osmo Vänskä conducting. Vänskä had received permission from Sibelius's family to perform the work. Out of necessity, Vänskä supplemented the manuscript—full of edits and, thus, [...] "very difficult to read" [...] in isolation—with notes from the 1936 performance. In 2006, Breitkopf & Härtel published the first edition of The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph.</b>|$|R

500|$|A few musicologists {{have speculated}} that The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> is {{potentially}} autobiographical. Murtomäki, most notably, {{has argued that the}} tone poem's depiction of [...] "a fatal sexual conjunction" [...] between Björn and the [...] is a possible allusion to the composer's own youthful indiscretions. [...] "The strong autobiographical element in Skogsrået is unmistakable", Murtomäki has written, adding that in the ballade, [...] "Sibelius probably confesses an affair to Aino". For Murtomäki, the balladic nature of The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> is key, as in the genre [...] "it was expected that the singer/storyteller/composer should reveal himself". At the time, it was common for the first sexual partners of men of Sibelius's class to be prostitutes. Murtomäki says that [...] "In their concealed or [...] "unofficial" [...] sexual life, they experienced a certain type of female sexual adventurousness that their wives could not easily match." [...] He hypothesizes that The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> and other contemporaneous compositions were Sibelius's method of dealing with the emotional consequences of this and his guilt towards his wife Aino.|$|R

500|$|The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> (Swedish title: subtitled [...] ), Op. 15, is a {{programmatic}} tone poem for orchestra {{composed in}} 1894 and 1895 by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. The ballade, which premiered on 17 April 1895 in Helsinki, Finland, with Sibelius conducting, follows the Swedish writer Viktor Rydberg's 1882 poem {{of the same}} name, in which a young man, Björn, wanders into the forest and is seduced and driven to despair by a , or <b>wood</b> <b>nymph.</b> Organizationally, the tone poem consists of four informal sections, each of which corresponds {{to one of the}} poem's four stanzas and evokes the mood of a particular episode: first, heroic vigor; second, frenetic activity; third, sensual love; and fourth, inconsolable grief.|$|R
500|$|The tone poem premiered on 17 April 1895, at the Great Hall of the University of Helsinki, with Sibelius himself {{conducting}} the Helsinki Orchestral Society; the programme also included the tone poem [...] (Spring Song) and {{selections from the}} Karelia Suite. A repeat performance was given two days later. Despite its positive reception, The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> would only be played another five times in Sibelius's lifetime: twice in Turku on 29 and 30 November 1897; twice in Helsinki at the premiere of his Symphony No. 1 on 26 and 30 April 1899 (a highly important event in Sibelius's career, and {{a sign that he}} viewed The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> as a worthy counterpoint to the symphony); and, after a 37-year hiatus, once in Helsinki on 27 October 1936. Sibelius, who was in his seventies and had retired to Ainola, was not present for this final performance, although he appears to have personally selected The <b>Wood</b> <b>Nymph</b> for the programme; Georg Schnéevoigt, who cut the score extensively in order to fit the performance into the radio broadcast's allotted time, conducted the Helsinki Philharmonic, with President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, Prime Minister Kyösti Kallio, and Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in attendance.|$|R
