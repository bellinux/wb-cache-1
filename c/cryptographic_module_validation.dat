Successful validation results in being listed on the NIST validations page. This testing is a pre-requisite for the FIPS 140-2 <b>module</b> <b>validation</b> described below. However, successful CAVP validation in no way implies that the <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module</b> implementing the algorithm is secure. A <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module</b> lacking FIPS 140-2 validation or specific approval by the NSA is not deemed secure by the US Government and cannot be used to protect government data.|$|R

For other areas that do not provide for different levels of security, a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module</b> receives a rating that reflects fulfillment {{of all of the}} requirements for that area.|$|R

50|$|The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{issued the}} FIPS 140 Publication Series to {{coordinate}} the requirements and standards for cryptography modules that include both hardware and software components. Protection of a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module</b> within a security system is necessary to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information protected by the module. This standard specifies the security requirements that will be satisfied by a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module.</b> The standard provides four increasing, qualitative levels of security intended to cover {{a wide range of}} potential applications and environments. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design and implementation of a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module.</b> These areas include <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module</b> specification; <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module</b> ports and interfaces; roles, services, and authentication; finite state model; physical security; operational environment; cryptographic key management; electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design assurance; and mitigation of other attacks.|$|R

Intentional excursions beyond the normal operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module's</b> defenses. A <b>cryptographic</b> <b>module</b> is required to either include special environmental protection features designed to detect fluctuations and delete CSPs, or to undergo rigorous environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal operating range {{in a manner that}} can compromise the security of the module.|$|R
