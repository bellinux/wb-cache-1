40|$|Abstract. The {{capacity}} of thermal power plants takes up 75 per cent of whole power generation capacity in China, {{and so a}} reserve of generation <b>capacity</b> <b>margin</b> that may adapt to the variations in power network load is of paramount importance. This paper proposes a concept: installed <b>capacity</b> <b>margin,</b> and basic mathematic modeling and example is analyzed. It would be supply theoretical help for real little thermal power plants shutdown schedules based on building detailed mathematical models after investigation of region-specific load structure characteristics and installed generator compositions...|$|E
30|$|In clear {{spectral}} opportunity scenarios, the RAP framework exploits the sender-selected spectrum at {{the maximum}} permissible power/rate {{only with a}} certain probability p (since a SU-TX does not know for sure if its transmission will interfere with any ongoing primary receptions or not). Besides, such a non-greedy medium access approach does not allow a SU-TX to fully utilize the available capacity of a given spectral opportunity since the SU-TX does not transmit at the highest possible power and rate. Instead, a SU-TX probabilistically leaves a <b>capacity</b> <b>margin</b> by using a lower power/rate with probability (1 -p). Hence, if there exists a neighboring SU transmission, it can exploit such a <b>capacity</b> <b>margin</b> to announce its presence. Consequently, different SU transmissions adjust their powers and rates to share such an opportunity.|$|E
30|$|The {{short circuit}} {{capacity}} reflects the anti-disturbance performance of each node {{and the network}} connection strength [21]. In this paper, current limiting measures are tried not to destroy the integrity and tightness of power grid. Thus, the minimum short circuit <b>capacity</b> <b>margin</b> is chosen as one target. At the same time, taking the current limiting effect into account, the short circuit current upper limit can be specified according to the engineering experience.|$|E
50|$|If demand {{increases}} {{such that}} the firm is now operating at 90% capacity and facing a reduced average total cost of C, then margin will increase to C,D and profit will be P*,D,C,P90%. If demand were to decrease so the firm was operating at 60% <b>capacity,</b> <b>margins</b> would be reduced to E,F and the firm would have to increase prices to maintain their desired margin. This is a questionable decision. It is seldom a good strategy to increase prices {{in the face of}} falling demand. The net result is usually further reductions in demand. That explain why this strategy is used only by market leaders and monopolists.|$|R

It is found that with different fractions and distributions of distributed generation, varied dynamics are possible. An important parameter is found to be the ratio of the variability of the distributed generation to the generation <b>capacity</b> <b>margin.</b> Somewhat counter-intuitively, in some of these cases the robustness of the transmission grid can be degraded with the potential for an increased risk of large failures with increased distributed generation if not done carefully. 1...|$|E

30|$|However, the {{distribution}} of power load and substation capacity is usually uneven. Therefore, the general capacity-load ratio cannot accurately reflect the <b>capacity</b> <b>margin</b> of a single substation. The reasonable capacity-load ratio can be ascertained according to the expense of unit expansion, the rate of load increment and other special details. The reality of distribution networks should also {{be taken into consideration}} when selecting the capacity-load ratio of transformers. Optimal capacity-load ratio of multi-voltage distribution network is researched in [13] where the cost of construction and operation of distribution networks is set as the optimization objective and the service life of substation is considered as an optimization variable.|$|E

The simulation results of the planning regional power grid in China demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the method. The branch selection strategy considering sensitivity ranking can effectively reduce the search range of decision variables, therefore avoid the optimization falling into the curse of dimensionality. Combining this strategy with NSGA-II can improve the convergence characteristics of the optimizing process. Considering the total cost, short circuit <b>capacity</b> <b>margin</b> and weighted multi-infeed short-circuit ratio, the Pareto optimal schemes can be obtained, which provides the decision-makers with more comprehensive and enriched choices.|$|E

40|$|Underwriting cycles are {{unexpected}} in a structurally {{competitive industry}} where financial capital {{is the major}} determinant of output capacity. "Arbitrage" theories explain underwriting cycles as largely an artifact of institutional lags and reporting practices; "capacity-constraint" theories view insurance markets as characterized by real frictions that cause underwriting cycles by temporarily reducing the industry's capacity to insure risks. Arbitrage theories imply no systematic relationship between <b>capacity</b> and underwriting <b>margins,</b> while capacity-constraint hypotheses predict a negative relationship. This article provides {{a test of the}} two theories by examining the empirical relationship between <b>capacity</b> and underwriting <b>margins.</b> The results, using data on four insurance lines, generally support the capacity-constraint hypothesis; unanticipated decreases in capacity cause higher profitability and prices. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} major risks {{associated}} with a rapidly changing United Kingdom (UK) electricity sector have been identified and quantified {{with the aid of}} various stakeholder groups (academic researchers, civil servants, electricity cornpanies, 'green' groups, power system engineers, and various others), who completed an online internet questionnaire. Each stakeholder ranked potential risks according to the perceived 'severity of impact' and 'likelihood of occurrence' using a three-point scale. The data were then used to perforin a ranking of the risks by multiplying scores for impact and occurrence. There was some variation between the different stakeholder groups, but similar risks were ranked highly by each group. The main risks were identified as being energy security issues (the highest score), lack of investment in new infrastructure, the closure of old coal and nuclear plants leading to reduced network capacity, severe weather events, and inadequate spare <b>capacity</b> <b>margins</b> generally The trial illustrates the potential of using risk assessment techniques to evaluate developing risks to the UK power landscape.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for electricity {{over the last}} few decades has not been followed by adequate growth in electric infrastructure. As a result, the reliability and safety of the electric grids are facing tremendously growing pressure. Large blackouts in the recent past indicate that sustaining system reliability and integrity turns out to be more and more difficult due to reduced transmission <b>capacity</b> <b>margins</b> and increased stress on the system. Due to the heavy loading conditions that occur when the system is under stress, the protection systems are susceptible to mis-operation. It is under such severe situations that the network cannot afford to lose its critical elements like the main generation units and transmission corridors. In addition to the slow but steady variations in the network structure over a long term, the grid also experiences drastic changes during the occurrence of a disturbance. One of the main reasons why protection relays mis-operate is due to the inability of the relays to adjust to the evolving network scenario. Such failures greatly compound the severity of the disturbance, while diminishing network integrity leading to catastrophic system-wide outages. With the advancement of Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS), it is no...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} peat {{power production}} in Ireland under the three pillars of energy policy [...] security, competitiveness and environment. Peat contributes to energy security [...] as an indigenous fuel, it reduces dependency on imports. During {{a period of}} low <b>capacity</b> <b>margins,</b> {{the operation of the}} peat plants is useful from a system security perspective. Peat generation is being financially supported by consumers through an electricity levy. The fuel also has high carbon intensity. It is not politically viable to consider peat on equal economic criteria to other plant types because of history and location. This paper reviews electricity generation through combustion of peat in Ireland, and quantifies the costs of supporting peat utilising economic dispatch tools, finding the subsidy is not insignificant from a cost or carbon perspective. It shows that while peat is beneficial for one pillar of energy policy (security), the current usage of peat is not optimal from a competitiveness or environmental perspective. By switching from the current 'must-run' mode of operation for peat to the 'dispatched' mode used for the other generation, significant societal savings (in the range [euro] 21 Â m per annum) can be achieved, as well as reducing system emissions by approximately 5 % per year.

40|$|The prime {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the long run relationship between real GDP per capita and electricity consumption for Pakistan over the period 1971 to 2008.

The unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption to economic growth indicates that electricity is a limiting factor to economic growth and hence shocks to electricity supply will have a negative impact on economic growth.

30|$|The {{study in}} [3] focuses on proposing {{a method to}} {{schedule}} the dispatched power of the wind farm-dual BESS scheme, so as to meet the prevailing power market requirements.

Indeed frequency regulation is even recognized as the most profitable application of energy storage in power system [12]. It is in the context of providing frequency control that the proposed scheme has excellent potential. The variable nature of wind has often resulted in the dispatched output power of the dual-BESS scheme at levels much less than the rated power of the wind farm/converters. Therefore, the <b>capacity</b> <b>margin</b> between the dispatched power and the rated power of the converters can be used to support the frequency regulation function: an ancillary service which is also profitable to the wind farm operator, in addition to the sale of the dispatched power [1].|$|E

The context is the UK market, after the reforms introduced in March 2001, analysed with an original set of price drivers reflecting economic, technical, strategic, risk, behavioural and market design effects. Models are estimated separately as daily time-series of the 48 half-hourly trading periods.

The complexity of these challenges over the future development of the UK electricity generation sector has motivated this study which aims to develop a policy-informed optimal electricity generation scenario to assess the sector's transition to 2050. The study analyses the level of deployment of electricity generating technologies in line with the 80 % by 2050 emission target. This is achieved by using an excel-based “Energy Optimisation Calculator” which captures the interaction of various inputs to produce a least-cost generation mix. The key results focus on the least-cost electricity generation portfolio, emission intensity, and total investment required to assemble a sustainable electricity generation mix.

The method involves assessing available energy resources, environmental and social issues, and economic activities. A spectrum of development options is identified for a given region and a Reference Energy Demand is calculated for each representative level. A spectrum of conceptual Reference Energy System Models is generated for each development level with a range of renewable energy penetration. The outcome is a matrix of energy system investment and resource utilization for the range of energy service level defined by the development level. These models are then used for comparative risk assessment. The result is an easily understood visual based investment and risk assessment for both development and adaptation to constrained resource availability. The above approach is being applied to a relatively simple case study on Rotuma, an isolated Pacific Island society.

30|$|While {{potentially}} degrading the CRN goodput, {{the use of}} low power/rate transmission {{reduces the}} probability of intercepting ongoing unidentified PRN transmissions since the lower the rate, the lower its power. Starting from the minimum values, a SU-TX increases the rate and power used with probability (1 - p) to the next higher values upon a successful transmission until either the second highest values are reached or a transmission failure occurs. The purpose of the former condition is to not sacrifice the goodput of the CRN if there does not exist any nearby SU transmissions by gradually shrinking the unutilized <b>capacity</b> <b>margin.</b> Meanwhile, if a nearby secondary transmission decides to explore the same spectrum, it will cause the high rate transmission to fail. In this case, our scheme will have a SU-TX reverting to the lowest power/rate for future transmissions.

It was shown that multiple low power and low rate transmissions successfully coexist without explicit interference suppression [21].|$|E

40|$|Data center power {{infrastructure}} incurs massive capital costs, {{which typically}} exceed energy costs {{over the life}} of the facility. To squeeze maximum value from the infrastructure, researchers have proposed over-subscribing power circuits, relying on the observation that peak loads are rare. To ensure availability, these proposals employ power capping, which throttles server performance during utilization spikes to enforce safe power budgets. However, because budgets must be enforced locally—at each power distribution unit (PDU) —local utilization spikes may force throttling even when power delivery capacity is available elsewhere. Moreover, the need to maintain reserve capacity for fault tolerance on power delivery paths magnifies the impact of utilization spikes. In this paper, we develop mechanisms to better utilize installed power infrastructure, reducing reserve <b>capacity</b> <b>margins</b> and avoiding performance throttling. Unlike conventional high-availability data centers, where collocated servers share identical primary and secondary power feeds, we reorganize power feeds to create shuffled power distribution topologies. Shuffled topologies spread secondary power feeds over numerous PDUs, reducing reserve capacity requirements to tolerate a single PDU failure. Second, we propose Power Routing, which schedules IT load dynamically across redundant power feeds to: (1) shift slack to servers with growing power demands, and (2) balance power draw across AC phases to reduce heating and improve electrical stability. We describe efficient heuristics for scheduling servers to PDUs (an NP-complete problem). Using data collected from nearly 1000 servers in three production facilities, we demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce the required power infrastructure capacity relative to conventional high-availability data centers by 32 % without performance degradation...|$|R
