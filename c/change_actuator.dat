30|$|Gas/liquid phase changes produce {{large volume}} changes in working fluids. These volume changes {{are used as}} the driving power sources in {{actuators}} such as micro-pumps and valves. Most of these actuators are utilized in ordinary temperature environments. However, the temperature range in which the phase <b>change</b> <b>actuator</b> can operate depends {{on the characteristics of}} the working fluid. We hypothesized that proper selection of the working fluid and the structure of the actuator can enable such actuators to be applied not only in ordinary environments but also in high temperature environments. Consequently, in this paper, we discuss the design and fabrication of a new gas/liquid phase <b>change</b> <b>actuator</b> for use in high temperature environments. Our proposed actuator consists of a bellow body, spring, heater, and working fluid. We used the Inconel super alloy, which is highly heat and corrosion resistant, for the bellow and moving parts of the actuator. For the working fluid, we prepared triethylene glycol, which has a boiling point of 287.3  °C and very low vapor pressure at ordinary temperature. As a result, our proposed actuator can be utilized in high temperature environments up to 300.0  °C. The results of several experiments conducted confirm that our proposed actuator generates 1.67  mm maximum displacement in a 300.0  °C atmospheric environment. In addition, we confirmed that the operation of the actuator is stable in that environment. Our results confirm that a gas/liquid phase <b>change</b> <b>actuator</b> can be used in high temperature environments.|$|E

Studies {{have shown that the}} high inherent efficiency previously demonstrated by low speed turboprop propulsion systems may now be extended to today's higher speed aircraft if advanced high-speed propeller blades having thin airfoils and aerodynamic sweep are utilized. Hamilton Standard has designed a 9 -foot diameter single-rotation Large-Scale Advanced Prop-Fan (LAP) which will be tested on a static test stand, in a high speed wind tunnel and on a research aircraft. The major objective of this testing is to establish the structural integrity of large-scale Prop-Fans of advanced construction in addition to the evaluation of aerodynamic performance and aeroacoustic design. This report describes the operation, design features and actual hardware of the (LAP) Prop-Fan pitch control system. The pitch control system which controls blade angle and propeller speed consists of two separate assemblies. The first is the control unit which provides the hydraulic supply, speed governing and feather function for the system.

40|$|The Large-scale Advanced Prop-fan (LAP) hub {{assembly}} forms a semi-rigid {{link between the}} blades, which provide the thrust, and the engine shaft, which provides the torque. The hub and tailshaft is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A single row ball bearing restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the tailshaft secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two cone seats that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan retaining nut. The hub also forms the support for the pitch <b>change</b> <b>actuator</b> system, the control and the spinner. The retention transmits the loads from the blades to the hub while allowing the changes in blade pitch. The single row ball bearing retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum blade shank and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator. The rotational speed of the propeller keeps the retention submerged in the oil which is contained in the hub by a seal. Stress and strain analysis, material hardness requirements, weight predictions, and stiffness characteristics are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of a small}} solid launch vehicle has been investigated. This launcher consists of a liquid upper stage and three fundamental solid rocket boosters aligned in series. During the ascent flight phase, lateral jets and grid fins are adopted by the flight control system to stable {{the attitude of the}} launcher. The launcher is a slender and aerodynamically unstable vehicle with sloshing tanks. A complete set of six-degrees-of-freedom dynamic models of the launcher, incorporation its rigid body, aerodynamics, gravity, sloshing, mass <b>change,</b> <b>actuator,</b> and elastic body, is developed. Dynamic analysis results of the structural modes and the bifurcation locus are calculated {{on the basis of the}} presented models. This complete set of dynamic models is used in flight control system design. A methodology for employing numerical optimization to develop the attitude filters is presented. The design objectives include attitude tracking accuracy and robust stability with respect to rigid body dynamics, propellant slosh, and flex. Later a control approach is presented for flight control system of the launcher using both State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) method and Fast Output Sampling (FOS) technique. The dynamics and kinematics for attitude stable problem are of typical nonlinear character. SDRE technique has been well applied to this kind of highly nonlinear control problems. But in practice the system states needed in the SDRE method are sometimes difficult to obtain. FOS method, which makes use of only the output samples, is combined with SDRE to accommodate the incomplete system state information. Thus, the control approach is more practical and easy to implement. The resulting autopilot can provide stable control systems for the vehicle...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a methodology}} to select materials which deliver {{the best performance}} for thermally actuated pneumatic and phase change microactuators. The material selection is based on performance metrics estimated using simple closed form solutions for classical linear elastic theory for axisymmetric plates/membranes and lumped heat capacity thermal models. Although the elastic moduli of the diaphragm materials dictate the volume expansion for a given temperature rise, their influence on the achievable pressure difference is much less. It is found that engineering polymers are most suitable for thermopneumatically actuated diaphragms for delivering large displacements and work for the achievable pressures at frequencies of a few hundreds of Hertz. The membrane stresses due to in-plane pre-tension are found to have an adverse effect on the actuator performance.

30|$|The {{actuators}} {{described above}} were developed {{for use in}} ordinary environments. In contrast, our aim is to utilize these phase <b>change</b> <b>actuators</b> in special environments. In particular, driving actuators in high temperature environments is a typical example of the special environments being considered. For example, in the hydrothermal synthesis method, {{which is one of}} the methods used to fabricate piezoelectric devices, the water solution inside the high temperature chamber needs to be agitated [15]. In one instance where this process was used, the water solution was agitated using an autoclave—an end-over-end shaker with heat. Fabrication of the (Pb, La)(Zr, Ti)O 3 (PLZT) film took 24  h. Not only the rotation condition but also the attitude of the sample will affect the quality of the fabrication. The actuators, which produce the inclination of the shaker, are predictably effective devices. Another example is the fabrication process for the ferric oxide crystal via the floating-zone melting method [16]. In this process, the partially melted sample is turned and pulled inside the chamber for growth. Both the processes require 8 – 24  h and a single directional drive in order to fabricate the tiny sample. We believe that an actuator that can realize linear motion in high temperature environments can rectify these quality problems.|$|R
