50|$|Clarion is an {{imperative}} {{programming language}} which supports an Object Orientated Programming syntax.The Clarion programming language is case insensitive. Line Endings {{are treated as}} implicit statement terminators (unless an explicit line <b>continuation</b> <b>character</b> is used.)Data and program Labels are always declared in column 1, code is always indented from column 2 onwards. (Further indentation is optional.)The code syntax most resembles BASIC and PASCAL in structure, although the language itself is quite different to those.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2010, Microsoft {{released}} Visual Basic 2010. Microsoft {{had planned}} to use Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) for that release but shifted to a co-evolution strategy between Visual Basic and sister language C# to bring both languages into closer parity with one another. Visual Basic's innate ability to interact dynamically with CLR and COM objects has been enhanced to work with dynamic languages built on the DLR such as IronPython and IronRuby. The Visual Basic compiler was improved to infer line continuation {{in a set of}} common contexts, in many cases removing the need for the [...] "_" [...] line <b>continuation</b> <b>character.</b> Also, existing support of inline Functions was complemented with support for inline Subs as well as multi-line versions of both Sub and Function lambdas.|$|E
50|$|In the show, Amy is a witch. Although {{initially}} {{a seemingly}} good-natured individual, Amy gradually begins misusing her magic, eventually becoming an enemy to Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and her friends. In the series' comic book <b>continuation,</b> the <b>character</b> {{is more of}} an outright villain.|$|R

5000|$|Director Jeremy Kagan said, [...] "The Sting II is {{inspired}} by and is {{an expansion of the}} first Sting, rather than a <b>continuation.</b> The principal <b>characters</b> of Fargo Gondorff and Jake Hooker are based on two very famous real-life con men, and are totally different from the two characters in the original." ...|$|R
5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Ira Steven Behr originally pitched season {{three with}} the <b>continuation</b> of the <b>character,</b> but {{was told by}} the network to write her out of the show for [...] "business reasons". Laura Allen, the actress who played Lily, subsequently accepted a role on another show. The season three opening episode presents Lily as an aged woman, portrayed by Tippi Hedren.|$|R
5000|$|... 6 was a <b>{{continuation}}</b> field: a <b>character</b> {{other than}} a blank or a zero here caused the card to {{be taken as a}} continuation of the statement on the prior card. The continuation cards were usually numbered 1, 2, etc. and the starting card might therefore have zero in its continuation column - which is not a continuation of its preceding card.|$|R
5000|$|As stated, The Knightly Tale of Gologras and Gawain is {{considered}} a pastiche of materials taken from the First Perceval <b>Continuation,</b> though the <b>character</b> name Gologras is unique, and the Holy pilgrimage setting do not parallel the French romance.(As an aside, the First Perceval continuation provided the source for another surviving English-language poem, The Jeaste of Sir Gawain, which likewise depicts King Arthur's nephew Sir Gawain engaging in single combat.) ...|$|R
50|$|Veronica Mars is {{the fictional}} protagonist, {{occasional}} narrator (through voiceovers), and antiheroine of the American television series Veronica Mars, which aired on UPN from 2004 to 2006 and on The CW from 2006 to 2007. The character was portrayed by Kristen Bell through {{the duration of}} the series. Following the show's cancellation, Bell reprised the role in the 2014 film <b>continuation.</b> The <b>character,</b> created by Rob Thomas, was originally male and the protagonist of his unproduced novel Untitled Rob Thomas Teen Detective Novel, which eventually became the basis of the series. After the work's transition from novel to television series, Thomas changed the character's gender from male to female as he believed a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting.|$|R
50|$|Another common {{practical}} {{reason for the}} <b>continuation</b> of traditional <b>characters</b> is the expansive cultural legacy of Chinese history and art prior to simplification. The written form did evolve over the centuries but the traditional character set used today is much {{more closely related to}} the written Chinese which has been in use for thousands of years. As such the traditional characters are said to provide access to Chinese culture prior to simplification.|$|R
5000|$|Christopher Ewing is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American prime time drama series, Dallas, and the <b>continuation</b> series. The <b>character</b> was first {{written into the}} series in the episode [...] "Starting Over", which first aired on December 11, 1981. The role was portrayed by Joshua Harris from 1985 until {{the conclusion of the}} original series in 1991. In the continuation series, the role is portrayed by Jesse Metcalfe. Christopher is the adopted son of Bobby and the late Pam Ewing and the biological son of Kristin Shepard (Sue Ellen Ewing's sister) and Jeff Faraday.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>character's</b> <b>continuation</b> as a {{major role}} in the second season was a [...] "surprise" [...] to Callies since the second season {{revolves}} around the lives of the eight fugitives outside the prison. The actress states that it is [...] "some of the most creative storytelling for women on TV right now" [...] and that she was given [...] "lot of latitude in establishing a sense of who character is". As the characterization of Sara continues to develop, Scheuring describes the character as [...] "one of series' strongest components".|$|R
5000|$|The {{video was}} based on an {{original}} idea by Björk, who saw [...] "Bachelorette" [...] as a <b>continuation</b> of the <b>character</b> portrayed in [...] "Isobel" [...] and [...] "Human Behaviour". The song lyrics of [...] "Isobel" [...] were also written by Björk's longstanding co-writer Sjón. As Gondry describes it, [...] "this character is leaving the forest and she decides to go to the city to have a normal life. She tries her best and it doesn't work out and she comes back to the forest and she is happier there." ...|$|R
50|$|John Ross Ewing III is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from American prime time soap opera, Dallas and the 2012 <b>continuation</b> series. The <b>character</b> was first {{written into the}} series in the episode named John Ewing III: Part 2 which first aired on April 6, 1979. Omri Katz prominently played the role in the series from 1983 until its conclusion in 1991 and the subsequent follow-up movie Dallas: J.R. Returns. In the continuation series, actor Josh Henderson stepped into the role. John Ross is the son and namesake of show's most iconic character, J.R. Ewing, and his longtime love, Sue Ellen Ewing.|$|R
5000|$|A {{floating}} timeline {{is usually}} abstracted {{from that of}} actual historical events, but may contain subtle references {{to the real world}} timelines. There may also be attempts made to maintain certain characters' historic timelines if it is felt to be essential to the character's personality, while allowing the rest of the world's timelines to continue to develop. For example, in the 2000s comic book miniseries The Punisher and its subsequent <b>continuation,</b> the title <b>character</b> is shown to be a Vietnam War veteran, just as he was in his earliest appearances in the Marvel comics of the 1970s. However, the stories place him in contemporary New York, where he meets fellow Marvel characters such as Spider-Man, who is barely much older than he was when introduced in 1962.|$|R
5000|$|Robbie Collin of The Telegraph {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, stating that [...] "the scares are mostly very scary indeed, {{and that means}} the film does its job." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety praised the [...] "artfully eerie" [...] cinematography work of John R. Leonetti and the [...] "pervasively unsettling atmosphere" [...] constructed by sound designer and editor Joe Dzuban. Foundas further wrote that [...] "where so many sequels seem like mere remakes of their predecessors, with bigger budgets and less imagination, Insidious: Chapter 2 feels like a genuine <b>continuation</b> of <b>characters</b> we enjoyed getting to know the first time around, and wouldn’t at all mind returning to again." [...] Conversely, Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times commented, [...] "After the pleasurable free fall into old-fashioned nightmare artistry that was last summer's The Conjuring, this busy-yet-dull sequel feels like Wan robotically flexing his manipulation of fright-film signposts, an exercise more silly than sinister." [...] Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Setting aside the movie’s tediously lame dialogue, self-conscious performances and frequently predictable scares, the narrative’s compulsively shifting chronology intermittently manages to engage, although it does little to obscure the distracting shortcomings of both plot and character development." ...|$|R
5|$|Balzac {{had written}} more than seventy novels {{when he began}} La Cousine Bette, and {{populated}} them with recurring characters. Many {{of the characters in}} the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, Célestin Crevel first appeared in Balzac's 1837 novel César Birotteau, working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in La Cousine Bette enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who first appeared as a colonel in Les Chouans. In the years between that story and La Cousine Bette, he became the Count of Forzheim; {{in a letter to the}} Constitutionnel, Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot– among others– in La Cousine Bette allows a <b>continuation</b> of each <b>character's</b> life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.|$|R
5000|$|The {{screenplay}} {{for the movie}} initially began as a <b>continuation</b> of the <b>characters</b> in Who's That Knocking. Scorsese changed the title from Season of the Witch to Mean Streets, a reference to Raymond Chandler's essay [...] "The Simple Art of Murder", wherein Chandler writes, [...] "But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid." [...] Scorsese sent the script to Corman, who agreed to back the film if all the characters were black. Scorsese was anxious to make the film so he considered this option, but actress Verna Bloom arranged a meeting with potential financial backer Jonathan Taplin, who was the road manager for the musical group The Band. Taplin liked the script and was willing to raise the $300,000 budget that Scorsese wanted if Corman promised, in writing, to distribute the film. The blaxploitation suggestion was to come to nothing when funding from Warner Bros. allowed {{him to make the}} film as he intended with Italian-American characters.|$|R
5|$|Pool of Radiance {{is based}} on the same game {{mechanics}} as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set. As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each player character in Pool of Radiance has a character race and a character class, determined {{at the beginning of the}} game. Six races are offered, including elves and halflings, as well as four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief). Non-human characters have the option to become multi-classed, which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class, but advance in levels more slowly. During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes. The player also chooses each character's alignment, or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character's actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions. The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character's combat icon. Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated party to be used for introductory play. These characters are combined into a party of six or less, with two slots open for NPCs. Players create their own save-game files, assuring <b>character</b> <b>continuation</b> regardless of events in the game. On an MS-DOS computer, the game can be copied to the hard-disk drive. Other computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, require a separate save-game disk.|$|R
40|$|A {{revolution}} has occurred within {{the practice and}} dissemination of archaeology {{over the past three}} decades. The advent of widespread computational applications, the development of digital technology and the growth of the internet as a public and institutional research tool have ensured that archaeologists have reshaped the approach to their discipline whilst ‘archaeology’ has become far more accessible to wider society. This {{revolution has}} been accompanied by an inevitable period of self—reflection for archaeologists as they seek to define themselves and their work within the new media that has emerged. Traditional ideas have been disrupted as new technologies enable developments in how archaeology engages with a public audience, the role of the discipline within real and ‘virtual’ environments has been questioned and the reliance on digital simulacra over artefacts have ensured that discipline appears to have entered into a ‘crisis of the real’. The search to adjust to this environment has been based upon the principle that archaeology is adjusting to a challenge of the new; how technological innovation demands that an alternative archaeology should emerge, one which is equipped both methodologically and theoretically for {{the way in which the}} discipline has been transformed. However, the focus on change has perhaps been overstated. The principles of archaeological investigation and analysis may not be dramatically altered with a ‘digital age’. Perhaps a concern for process and development will enable the <b>continuation</b> of the <b>character</b> of the discipline within this new field. How archaeology may be useful in defining this new media landscape can be more significant than how this new technology will alter archaeology. This article explores the role of archaeology in providing a mode of analysis through the use of approaches defined through critical code studies to examine the site of Stonehenge within the online landscape...|$|R
