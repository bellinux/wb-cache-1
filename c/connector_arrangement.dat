50|$|The IBM T220 was {{introduced}} in June 2001 {{and was the first}} monitor to natively support a resolution of 3840&times;2400. In order to support such a high resolution, it features an unusual <b>connector</b> <b>arrangement.</b> On the rear of the display are two LFH-60 connectors. A pair of cables supplied with the monitor attaches to the connectors and splits into two single-link DVI connectors each, for a total of four DVI channels. One, two or four of the connectors may be used at once.|$|E
50|$|As {{long as the}} hot-swap {{connector}} {{is sufficiently}} rigid, {{one of the four}} corner pins will always be the first to engage. For a typical two-row <b>connector</b> <b>arrangement</b> this provides four first-to-make corner pins that are usually used for grounds. Other pins near the corners can be used for functions that would also benefit from this effect, for example sensing when the connector is fully seated. This diagram illustrates good practice where the grounds are in the corners and the power pins are near the center. Two sense pins are located in opposite corners so that fully seated detection is confirmed only when both of them are in contact with the slot. The remaining pins are used for all the other data signals.|$|E
40|$|The debug {{connectors}} for Cortex microcontrollers will be {{migrating to}} new debug connectors. Currently the KEIL ULINK 2 already supports {{one of the}} new debug connector arrangements and the coming ULINK-Pro supports both new debug connector arrangements. A number of Cortex microcontroller evaluation boards from KEIL already support the new connectors. This document covers the basic information of these debug connectors. This is for general information only and should not be used as a specification. The details covered in this document are taken from various ARM and KEIL documents / web sites. Additional details are covered in specifications documents listed in the Reference section. Why change? Most existing ARM products use a 20 -pin IDC connector for JTAG debug, and 38 -pin Mictor connectors for trace. However, {{there are a number of}} issues with the existing arrangement:- 20 -pin IDC connectors are too big for today’s microcontroller boards. - 20 -pin IDC connectors do not support trace. - The 0. 05 ” micro header in the new <b>connector</b> <b>arrangement</b> has a lower cost for trace. Since the Cortex-M 3 trace port only requires 5 signals (4 bit data and trace clock), the trace signals can easily be merged into a 20 -pin debug connector. For microcontroller products that do not require trace (e. g. Cortex-M 0 or Cortex-M 3 without trace), an even smaller connector can be used. The new connectors are called...|$|E
50|$|Contact Arrangement or Pattern is the gauge, number, spacing and {{arrangement}} of contacts in a <b>connector.</b> Contact <b>arrangement</b> selections {{are based on}} the current and voltage requirements of the application, and the space available for the connector package.|$|R
5000|$|Solid tips - {{are used}} to connect on/with a {{breadboard}} or female header <b>connector.</b> The <b>arrangement</b> of the elements and ease of insertion on a breadboard allows increasing the mounting density of both components and jump wires without fear of short-circuits. The jump wires vary in size and colour to distinguish the different working signals.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of five full-scale coupling beam specimens has been conducted to investigate the seismic behavior of strengthened RC coupling beams by bolted side steel plates using a reversed cyclic loading procedure. The strengthened coupling beams are fabricated with different plate thicknesses and shear <b>connector</b> <b>arrangements</b> to study their respective effects on load-carrying capacity, strength retention, stiffness degradation, deformation capacity, and energy dissipation ability. The study revealed that putting shear connectors along the span of coupling beams produces no significant improvement to the structural performance of the strengthened beams. Translational and rotational partial interactions of the shear connectors that would weaken the load-carrying capacity of the steel plates were observed and measured. The hierarchy of failure of concrete, steel plates, and shear connectors was identified. Furthermore, detailed effects of plate buckling and various <b>arrangements</b> of shear <b>connectors</b> on the post-peak behavior of the strengthened beams are discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|With the 40-wire cable, it {{was very}} common to {{implement}} cable select by simply cutting the pin 28 wire between the two device connectors; putting the slave device {{at the end of}} the cable, and the master on the middle <b>connector.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> eventually was standardized in later versions. If there is just one device on the cable, this results in an unused stub of cable, which is undesirable for physical convenience and electrical reasons. The stub causes signal reflections, particularly at higher transfer rates.|$|R
5000|$|MIL-DTL-5015 (formerly MIL-C-5015) {{describes}} electrical circular connectors with solder or removable crimp contacts (both {{front and}} rear release). These connectors are for use in electronic, electrical power, and control circuits and are used in large numbers for defense, civil, and industrial applications due to their versatility, reliability, and ease of supply. These connectors are rated for operation within a temperature range of -55 °C (-67 °F) to either 125 °C (257 °F), 175 °C (347 °F), or 200 °C (392 °F) depending upon the class of the <b>connector.</b> The insert <b>arrangements</b> are provided in MIL-STD-1651.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the post and swivelling <b>connectors</b> is an <b>arrangement</b> whereby a series of interconnecting swivels can be set in position by tightening or loosening a central member. This member may be made from wire rope as {{it has to be}} extremely flexible yet strong in tension, the possibilities for positioning this type is probably no more than the two post type but its advantage {{lies in the fact that}} there is only one mechanism (screw) to loosen or tighten the arrangement making it easier to use, unlike the other where a third hand is often wished for.|$|R
5000|$|MIL-DTL-83527, (formerly DoD-C-83527 and MIL-C-83527) {{describes}} the requirements, quality assurance criteria and test {{procedures for the}} design and fabrication of an environment resisting low insertion force, multiple insert rectangular connector used in the electrical/electronic bay areas of military aircraft. The connector provides the electrical interface between the avionics equipment and the equipment rack or tray. These connectors are military unique because they must operate satisfactory at high altitude 50,000 feet (15.2 km), endure 500 hours of salt spray, vibration testing (functional and endurance), shock (30 g's), and temperatures from -65 to +125 °C. These connectors must be {{used in conjunction with}} DoD-STD-1842 which {{describes the}} insert arrangements for use with MIL-DTL-83527 Rack-to-Panel <b>connectors.</b> The insert <b>arrangements</b> are provided in DOD-STD-1842.|$|R
50|$|Glad-hand {{connectors}} (also {{known as}} palm couplings) are air hose connectors, {{each of which}} has a flat engaging face and retaining tabs. The faces are placed together, and the units are rotated so that the tabs engage each other to hold the <b>connectors</b> together. This <b>arrangement</b> provides a secure connection, but allows the couplers to break away without damaging the equipment if they are pulled, as may happen when the tractor and trailer are separated without first uncoupling the air lines. These connectors are similar in design to the ones used for a similar purpose between railroad cars. Two air lines typically connect to the trailer unit. An emergency or main air supply line pressurizes the trailer's air tank and disengages the emergency brake, and a second service line controls the brake application during normal operation.|$|R
50|$|MIL-DTL-26482 (formerly MIL-C-26482) {{describes}} the general requirements for two series of environment resisting, quick disconnect, miniature, circular electrical connectors (and accessories). Each series includes hermetic receptacles. The two series of connectors are intermateable when using power contacts {{and are not}} intermateable when using shielded contacts. The various connector classes and types include: (i) Classes E, F, J, and P connectors are used in environment-resisting applications with an operating temperature range of -55-to-125 degree Celsius (-67-to-257 degree F); and (ii) Class H receptacles are used applications wherein pressures must be contained across the walls or panels on which the connector is mounted. Many applications for this connector deviate from the official military specification; for an example, a robust metallic shell based on the MIL-DTL-26482 design supports the use of Ethernet 10/100/1000BaseT data communications networks in harsh environments while maintaining compatibility with IEC 60603-7-7 requirements. MIL-DTL-26482 include two series of circular connectors: Series I includes MS3110, MS3111, MS3112, MS3114 and MS3116 connectors, while Series II includes MS3470, MS3474, MS3475 and MS3476 <b>connectors.</b> The insert <b>arrangements</b> are provided in MIL-STD-1669.|$|R
