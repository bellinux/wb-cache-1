40|$|Softness of apparel {{textiles}} {{is a major}} attribute {{sought by}} consumers. There is surprisingly little objective information on the softness properties of rare animal fibres, particularly cashmere, alpaca and mohair. Samples {{of these and other}} rare animal fibres from different origins of production and processors were objectively measured for fibre diameter, fibre curvature (FC, crimp) and resistance to compression (softness). While there were curvilinear responses of resistance to compression to FC and to mean fibre diameter, FC accounted for much more of the variance in resistance to compression. Fibre type was an important determinant of resistance to compression. The softest fibres were alpaca, mohair and <b>cashgora</b> and all of the fibres measured were softer than most Merino wool. Quivet, llama, camel, guanaco, vicuña, yak wool, bison wool, dehaired cow down and Angora rabbit were also differentiated from alpaca, mohair and cashmere. There were important differences in the softness and FC of cashmere from different origins with cashmere from newer origins of production (Australia, New Zealand and USA) having lower resistance to compression than cashmere from traditional sources of China and Iran. Cashmere from different origins was differentiated on the basis of resistance to compression, FC and fibre diameter. <b>Cashgora</b> was differentiated from cashmere by having a lower FC and lower resistance to compression. There were minority effects of colour and fibre diameter variation on resistance to compression of cashmere. The implications of these findings for the identification and use of softer raw materials are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Felting is {{a unique}} {{attribute}} of animal fibres used {{for the production of}} a range of industrial and apparel textiles. Felting can be an adverse attribute as a consequence of dimensional shrinkage during laundering. As there is little objective information regarding the feltability of rare animal fibres or the factors which may affect felting three investigations were undertaken. A survey (n = 114) of the feltability of cashmere from different origins of production, <b>cashgora,</b> quivet, camel hair, llama, guanaco, bison wool, cow fibre and yak wool quantified the large variation between and within these fibre types. Cashmere from some origins and <b>cashgora</b> produced higher feltball density than the other fibres. Different nutritional management of cashmere goats (n = 35) showed that cashmere grown by poorly fed goats had a lower propensity to felt compared with cashmere grown by better fed goats. A consequence of the progressive blending of cashmere (n = 27) with a low propensity to felt superfine wool (high fibre curvature) increased the propensity of the blend to felt, but when the same cashmere was blended with low curvature superfine wool, there was little or no effect on feltability. The mechanisms which lead to variance in feltability of these fibres were quantified with multiple regression modelling. The mechanisms were similar to those reported for wools, namely variations in the resistance to compression, fibre curvature and mean fibre diameter, with likely effects of fibre crimp form. It is possible to source cashmere and other animal fibres which have different propensities to felt and therefore to produce textiles which are likely to have different textile properties. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{yield and}} quality of animal fibres such as mohair, {{cashmere}} and <b>cashgora</b> are primarily influenced by the expression of various keratin associated protein genes, such as KAP  1. 1, KAP  8. 1, and KAP  13. 3. Recent developments in molecular genetics provide the opportunity to characterize KAP genes at a base-pair level, {{which can lead to}} improved selection and genetic progress in mohair fibre production. PCR and sequencing technology was used to identify and characterize KAP  1. 1, KAP  8. 1, and KAP  13. 3 in 108 goats, representing the South African Angora, Boer and Angora x Boer goat populations. The three genes showed varying degrees of polymorphism with between 4 and 18 alleles identified per locus. Some discrepancies in the current gene sequence of KAP  1. 1 were discovered. Nineteen novel variants were identified in total, seven for KAP  1. 1, one for KAP  8. 1 and eleven for KAP  13. 3. Observed heterozygosity values closely matched expected heterozygosity values, with Boer goats consistently having the lowest levels of expected and observed heterozygosity (approximately 0. 5) for all three of the genes. The greatest variation for each gene existed between the Angora and Boer goat breeds, with FST values of 0. 28, 0. 13, and 0. 24 for KAP  1. 1, 8. 1, and 13. 3 respectively. Predominant alleles differed between the various populations, indicating the need for further research into possible allelic and fibre quality associations. [URL] and Wildlife Science...|$|E
