5|$|Shortly {{after the}} law was passed, {{questions}} arose about {{the legal status of}} marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in <b>Catalonia</b> were denied a marriage license on the grounds that India did not permit same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in <b>Catalonia</b> married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner (the first same-sex marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|General Manuel Goded Llopis (1882–1936), who {{was born}} in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was a {{high-ranking}} officer in the Spanish Army.

5|$|In 1897 an Italian anarchist assassinated Prime Minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, {{motivated}} by {{a growing number of}} arrests and the use of torture by the government. The loss of Cuba, Spain's last valuable colony, in the Spanish–American War of 1898 hit exports from <b>Catalonia</b> hardest; there were acts of terrorism and actions by agents provocateurs in Barcelona. In the first two decades of the 20th century, the industrial working class grew in number. There was a growing discontent in the Basque country and <b>Catalonia,</b> where much of Spain's industry was based. They believed that the government favoured agrarianism and therefore failed to represent their interests. The average illiteracy rate was 64%, with considerable regional variation. Poverty in some areas was great and mass emigration to the New World occurred {{in the first decade of}} the century.|$|E

5|$|The {{blue and}} red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several {{competing}} theories have been put forth for the {{blue and red}} design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it {{was the idea of}} his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In <b>Catalonia</b> the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of <b>Catalonia</b> has also been used many times.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} super Barcelona {{has often been}} political. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona {{gradually}} became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, <b>Catalonia</b> became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as {{a focal point for}} Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became {{one of the few places}} the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for <b>Catalonia</b> to become an independent state.|$|E

There were more than 100 aircraft operating over the city and, while a Ju 87 was dive-bombing a ship, a Republican Polikarpov I-15 pilot, Francisco Alférez Jiménez, claimed it destroyed near el Vendrell, in Coma-ruga, but the Stuka was capable of landing on the beach without crashing. That {{was the only time}} a Stuka attacked the capital of <b>Catalonia.</b> On 24 January 1939, a group of Stukas prevented the destruction of a bridge near Barcelona by strafing the demolition engineers on Molins de Rei. During the attack the Republican ground defenders, equipped with a quadruple PM M1910 mounting, hit one pilot (Heinz Bohne) in both legs and the Stuka crashed, seriously injuring Bohne, and his machine gunner, Albert Conrad. Those two were the only Stuka casualties of the war.|$|E
