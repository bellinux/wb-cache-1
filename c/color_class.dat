25|$|Note that, in {{a minimal}} k-coloring of any graph G, {{contracting}} each <b>color</b> <b>class</b> of the coloring {{to a single}} vertex will produce a complete graph Kk. However, this contraction process does not produce a minor of G because there is (by definition) no edge between any two vertices in the same <b>color</b> <b>class,</b> thus the contraction is not an edge contraction (which is required for minors). Hadwiger's conjecture states that there exists {{a different way of}} properly edge contracting sets of vertices to single vertices, producing a complete graph Kk, {{in such a way that}} all the contracted sets are connected.|$|E

[...] The film version alludes to many more deaths than the highest counts by eyewitnesses. Gary Moore believes that creating an outside character who inspires the citizens of Rosewood to fight back condescends to survivors, and he criticized the inflated death toll specifically, saying the film was [...] "an interesting experience in illusion". On the other hand, in 2001 Stanley Crouch of The New York Times described Rosewood as Singleton's finest work, writing, [...] "Never {{in the history of}} American film had Southern racist hysteria been shown so clearly. <b>Color,</b> <b>class</b> and sex were woven together on a level that Faulkner would have appreciated." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} constrained proper edge colorings of {{the following}} type: Given a positive integer j and a family F of connected graphs on 3 or more vertices, we require that the subgraph formed by the union of any j <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> has no copy of any member of F. This generalizes some well-known types of colorings such as acyclic edge colorings, distance- 2 edge colorings, low treewidth edge colorings, etc. For such a generalization of restricted colorings, we obtain an upper bound of O(dmax(θ, 1)) on the minimum number of colors sufficient for such a coloring. Here, d refers to the maximum degree of the graph and θ is a parameter defined by θ = θ(j,F) = maxH∈F (|V (H) |− 2) (|E(H) |−j). Our proof is based on probabilistic arguments. In particular, we obtain O(d) upper bounds for proper edge colorings with various interesting restrictions placed on the union of <b>color</b> <b>classes.</b> For example, we obtain O(d) upper bounds on edge colorings with restrictions such as (i) the union of any 3 <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> should be an outerplanar graph, (ii) the union of any 4 <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> should have treewidth at most 2, (iii) the union of any 5 <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> should be planar, (iv) the union of any 16 <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> should be 5 -degenerate, etc. We also consider generalizations where we require simultaneously for several pairs (ji,Fi) (i = 1, [...] ., s) that the union of any ji <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> has no copy of any member of Fi and obtain upper bounds on the corresponding chromatic indices. As a corollary, we obtain {{that each of the}} four restrictions above can be satisfied simultaneously using O(d) colors.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for color segmentation, in which colors are not only mapped to unambiguous but also to ambiguous <b>color</b> <b>classes.</b> The ambiguous <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> are resolved based on their unambiguous neighbors in the image. In contrast to other approaches, the neighborhood is determined {{on the level of}} regions, not on the level of pixels. Thereby, large regions with ambiguous <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> can be resolved. The method is fast enough to run on a Sony AIBO in real time (30 Hz), leaving enough resources for the other tasks that have to be performed to play soccer. In addition, the paper discusses the problem of motion compensation, i. e. reversing the effects of a rolling shutter on the images taken by a moving camera. ...|$|R

2500|$|The star K1,5 {{shown in}} the {{illustration}} is a complete bipartite graph, and therefore may be colored with two colors. However, the resulting coloring has one vertex in one <b>color</b> <b>class</b> and five in another, and is therefore not equitable. The smallest number of colors in an equitable coloring of this graph is four, as {{shown in the}} illustration: the central vertex must be the only vertex in its <b>color</b> <b>class,</b> so the other five vertices must be split among at least three color classes {{in order to ensure that}} the other color classes all have at most two vertices. More generally, [...] observes that any star K1,n needs [...] colors in any equitable coloring; thus, the chromatic number of a graph may differ from its equitable coloring number by a factor as large as n/4. Because K1,5 has maximum degree five, the number of colors guaranteed for it by the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem is six, achieved by giving each vertex a distinct color.|$|E
2500|$|It is NP-complete to {{determine}} whether a given directed graph is skew-symmetric, by a result of [...] that it is NP-complete to find a color-reversing involution in a bipartite graph. Such an involution exists if and only if the directed graph given by orienting each edge from one <b>color</b> <b>class</b> to the other is skew-symmetric, so testing skew-symmetry of this directed graph is hard. This complexity does not affect path-finding algorithms for skew-symmetric graphs, because these algorithms assume that the skew-symmetric structure is given as part of the input to the algorithm rather than requiring it to be inferred from the graph alone.|$|E

For each <b>color</b> <b>class,</b> include one edge from the center to one of the polygon vertices, and all of the perpendicular edges connecting pairs of polygon vertices.

50|$|The {{first part}} of this formula ensures that the three <b>color</b> <b>classes</b> cover all the {{vertices}} of the graph, and the second ensures that they each form an independent set.

Perfect graphs may also be described as the graphs in which, in every induced subgraph, the size of the largest independent set is equal to the number of cliques in a partition of the graph's vertices into a minimum number of cliques. In a rook's graph, the sets of rows or the sets of columns (whichever has fewer sets) form such an optimal partition.

[...] For, suppose that an infinite partial order P has width w, meaning that there are at most a finite number w of elements in any antichain. For any subset S of P, a decomposition into w chains (if it exists) may be described as a coloring of the incomparability graph of S (a graph that has the elements of S as vertices, with an edge between every two incomparable elements) using w colors; every <b>color</b> <b>class</b> in a proper coloring of the incomparability graph must be a chain. By the assumption that P has width w, and by the finite version of Dilworth's theorem, every finite subset S of P has a w-colorable incomparability graph.

In the same paper, Karloff and Shmoys also present a linear time algorithm for coloring multigraphs of maximum degree three with four colors (matching both Shannon's and Vizing's bounds) that operates on similar principles: their algorithm adds a new vertex to make the graph Eulerian, finds an Euler tour, and then chooses alternating sets of edges on the tour to split the graph into two subgraphs of maximum degree two. The paths and even cycles of each subgraph may be colored with two colors per subgraph. After this step, each remaining odd cycle contains at least one edge that may be colored with one of the two colors belonging to the opposite subgraph. Removing this edge from the odd cycle leaves a path, which may be colored using the two colors for its subgraph.|$|E
