40|$|Fragment {{production}} in central collisions of Xe+Sn has been systematically studied with the INDRA multidetector from 25 to 150 AMeV.

For beam energies 50 AMeV and above, a promising agreement with suitably modified Antisymmetrised Molecular Dynamics calculations has been achieved. Intriguingly the same reactions have recently been interpreted as evidence for a liquid-gas phase transition in thermodynamically equilibrated systems. The universal fluctuation theory, thanks to its lack of any equilibrium hypothesis, shows clearly that in all but a tiny minority of carefully-selected central <b>collisions</b> <b>fragment</b> production is incompatible with either critical or phase coexistence behaviour.

40|$|After {{more than}} fifty years of space activities, the near-Earth {{environment}} is polluted with man-made orbital debris. The collision between Cosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium 33 in 2009 signaled a potential collision cascade effect, also known as the "Kessler Syndrome", in the environment. Various modelling studies have suggested that the commonly-adopted mitigation measures will not be sufficient to stabilize the future debris population. Active debris removal must be considered to remediate the environment. This paper summarizes the key issues associated with debris removal and describes the technology and engineering challenges to move forward. Fifty-four years after the launch of Sputnik 1, satellites have {{become an integral part of}} human society. Unfortunately, the ongoing space activities have left behind an undesirable byproduct orbital debris. This environment problem is threatening the current and future space activities. On average, two Shuttle window panels are replaced after every mission due to damage by micrometeoroid or orbital debris impacts. More than 100 collision avoidance maneuvers were conducted by satellite operators in 2010 to reduce the impact risks of their satellites with respect to objects in the U. S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) catalog. Of the four known accident collisions between objects in the SSN catalog, the last one, collision between Cosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium 33 in 2009, was the most significant. It was the first ever accidental catastrophic destruction of an operational satellite by another satellite. It also signaled the potential collision cascade effect in the environment, commonly known as the "Kessler Syndrome," predicted by Kessler and Cour-Palais in 1978 [1]. Figure 1 shows the historical increase of objects in the SSN catalog. The majority of the catalog objects are 10 cm and larger. As of April 2011, the total objects tracked by the SSN sensors were more than 22, 000. However, approximately 6000 of them had yet to be fully processed and entered into the catalog. This population had been dominated by fragmentation debris throughout history. Before the anti-satellite test (ASAT) conducted by China in 2007, the fragmentation debris were almost all explosion fragments. After the ASAT test and the collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251, the ratio of <b>collision</b> <b>fragments</b> to explosion fragments was about one-to-one.

40|$|By mid 2013, four {{accidental}} hypervelocity collisions among cataloged objects {{have been}} recorded in low Earth orbit. Three were debris-intact impacts, generating very few cataloged fragments (2000 cataloged fragments. In order to evaluate the past, current and future average collision rates, the results of debris evolution simulations carried out in 1999 - 2000 were carefully re-analyzed and the corresponding collision rates, among objects > 10 cm, were estimated from 1980 to 2040. The value predicted for mid 2013, 0. 240 events per year, was further validated by analyzing the current unclassified debris catalog and assessing its qualitative and quantitative incompleteness. It was {{also found that the}} intact-intact average collision rate is approximately 30 % of the total, while debris-debris impacts account for < 2 %, the majority of the events involving debris-intact collisions. The potential benefits of a wide adoption of collision avoidance practices for maneuverable spacecraft was analyzed as well. If applied to 50 % of the current operational spacecraft below 2000 km, it would lead to an 11 % reduction of the overall collision rate and to a 16 % reduction of the intact-intact collision rate. The model estimates from 1980 to mid 2013 were then used to compute the probability of collision occurrence {{as a function of the}} time interval considered. It was found that the number of accidental collisions observed so far is in extremely good agreement with the model predictions, corresponding to the maximum likelihood of the probability distributions. Moreover, even the proportion between debris-intact and intact-intact events reflects well what should be expected. Concerning the projections up to 2040, the probability of avoiding further collisions is < 1 %, while there is a probability of more than 50 % of having 8 additional collisions, or more. Focusing the attention on the intact-intact events, the probability of avoiding another intact-intact collision is around 8 %. At least 1 further collision will have therefore a probability to occur higher than 90 %, 2 or more collisions will have a probability higher than 70 %, and 3 or more collisions will have a probability higher than 45 %, even though the broad adoption of collision avoidance for maneuverable spacecraft might reduce these figures. Finally, the concept of catastrophic collision was re-analyzed, taking into account the observational record and the basic assumptions usually adopted by the long-term debris evolution models. Potential sources of <b>collision</b> <b>fragments</b> over- and underestimation were identified and discussed, coming to the preliminary conclusion that after one century the number of <b>collision</b> <b>fragments</b> currently predicted by the evolutionary models might be overestimated...|$|R

If the nuclear equation of state can be elucidated in terms of the N/Z dependent component and how the N/Z dependent component varies with density, then the equilibrium ratio of protons to neutrons inside high density neutron stars can be inferred, allowing for prediction of cooling rates and supernovae mechanisms. In the current study, isotopic and isobaric ratios at thetalab= 40 o with cuts of 10 % and 20 % most central events, respectively, are studied for their N/Z equilibration signals. Light charged particles, or LCPs, are found to be emitted from systems which have not yet fully N/Z combined; the fragments with A= 3 are emitted from the least equilibrated systems. Intermediate mass fragments, or IMFs, are seen to be emitted by N/Z equilibrated sources, within statistical error bars. The N/Z tracer method is used with ratios of isotopes and isobars to see how the amount of nuclear stopping or N/Z mixing changes as a function of the centrality of the event. The N/Z observable is used to reinvestigate earlier findings of the isotope and isobar ratio observables and shows the progression (or lack of it, in some cases) of the N/Z equilibration.

In laboratory experiments we simulated the formation, evolution, and properties of decimetre-scale dusty bodies in protoplanetary discs. Small sub-mm size dust aggregates consisting of micron-size SiO 2 particles randomly interacted with dust targets of varying initial conditions in a continuous sequence of independent collisions. Impact velocities were 7. 7 m/s on average and in the range expected for collisions with decimetre bodies in protoplanetary discs. The targets all evolved by forming dust crusts with up to several cm thickness and a unique filling factor of 31 % ± 3 %. A part of the projectiles sticks directly. In addition, some projectile fragments slowly return to the target by gravity. All initially porous parts of the surface, i. e. built from the slowly returning fragments, are compacted and firmly attached to the underlying dust layers by the subsequent impacts. Growth is possible at impact angles from 0 ◦ (central collision) to 70 ◦. No growth occurs at steeper dust surfaces.

40|$|Several {{pairs of}} {{planetary}} satellites {{may have been}} involved, during {{the history of the}} Solar System, in mutual mass transfer processes. Such processes can be triggered by catastrophic collisions of a satellite (parent body) with a third object. As a consequence, the <b>collision</b> <b>fragments</b> are injected into independent orbits that can cross the trajectory of the another satellite (target). These swarms of secondary impacts may be of some importance influencing the properties of the target body. Even the formation of the atmosphere around some giant satellites may have been triggered by the gas released after the impacts of fragments onto the target's surface. Moreover, the different albedos and the different surface density of impact craters within the same satellite system may be connected to peculiar collisional phenomena, such as those we are dealing with. A quantitative modelling of the role of mass transfer processes obviously requires an estimate of how much material the parent bodies are able to supply, and under what circumstances the process may take place. A general analysis of the various pairs throughout the major satellite systems present in the Solar System has been performed in the present paper. Our analysis uses a statistical algorithm, computing, {{as a function of the}} initial properties of the fragments (masses and ejection velocities from their parent body), the mean intrinsic probability of impact, and then the mean lifetime of a fragment before impacting the target, as well as the distribution of the relative velocity.
