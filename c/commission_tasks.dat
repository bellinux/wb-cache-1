50|$|The ICAR Air Rescue Commission {{consists}} of experts, pilots, HEMS crew members and hoist operators from all ICAR member organizations. The ICAR Air Rescue <b>Commission</b> <b>tasks,</b> goals and targets {{are the same}} as for ICAR: sharing our experience, learning from others and working on prevention.The commission is run by a president assisted by a vice-president. The Commission President {{is a member of the}} ICAR Executive Board. Usually the Air Rescue Commission meets once a year during the annual ICAR Convention.The ICAR Air Rescue Commission has to deal with different systems, different rules, different operations and therefore the commission is used to work on best practices more than hard rules. The Commission takes its benefits from the exchange of the members and other international entities.The knowledge and experience amongst the members of the ICAR Air Rescue Commission is huge and the commission provides expertise all over the world. The database of the commission is for sure one of the largest in the world concerning Mountain Air Rescue. The ICAR Air Rescue Commission publishes recommendations available to all via the ICAR website.The ICAR Air Rescue Commission and the EHA European Helicopter Association have worked together to obtain an alleviation for the rescuers during the EASA PCDS (Personal Carrying Device System) consultation. Thanks to the cooperation the success was confirmed in May 2016 with the withdrawal of the regulation on single PCDS.|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{activity}} {{has long been}} considered as a psychophysiological marker of adaptive psychological adjustment. Irregularities in autonomic nervous system activity have long been implicated in both externalizing and disinhibitory behaviors. The present study used a battery of assessments in children ages 4. 5 – 5. 5 years to examine the relation among disinhibitory measures. Additionally, cardiovascular activity and reactivity was examined. Mothers rated impulsivity and internalizing/externalizing behaviors. Reward-dominance and passive-avoidance response inhibition (i. e., via errors of <b>commission)</b> <b>tasks</b> were included. Results showed that behaviorally uninhibited children began with an attenuated sympathetic response (i. e., lengthened pre-ejection period) to {{an interview with a}} novel experimenter, while inhibited children began {{with a high level of}} sympathetic activity. Further, behavioral impulsivity was related to low sympathetic activity at rest. Consistent with theories of disinhibition, externalizing behaviors and measures of behavioral impulsivity were related to a reward-dominant response style. Findings are discussed with regard to motivational theories of behavior...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. A. thesis. March 2011. Major: Psychology. Advisors: Shmuel Lissek, William G. Iacono. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 46 pages. Previous {{research has found}} that individuals with obsessive-compulsive (OC) traits show larger error-related negativity (ERN) and correct-response negativity (CRN) amplitudes than controls during error of <b>commission</b> <b>tasks,</b> such as the flanker task. However, a recent study found that individuals with OC tendencies showed smaller ERN amplitudes during a probabilistic learning task. A probabilistic learning task uses a reinforcement learning paradigm in which correct responses are reinforced a certain percentage of the time; therefore, the correct choice is less obvious in a probabilistic learning task than in a flanker task. This study hypothesized that uncertainty regarding the correct response may moderate ERN and CRN amplitudes in both the probabilistic learning task and the flanker task. In addition, individuals with OC traits were predicted to show smaller ERN and CRN amplitudes when the task was difficult. These hypotheses were tested by manipulating the uncertainty of both the probabilistic learning task and the flanker task. The results of this study show that the level of uncertainty during the probabilistic learning task had little effect on ERN or CRN amplitudes, suggesting that the smaller amplitudes found during probabilistic learning are not due to the difficult nature of the task. Additionally, individuals with high OC traits show attenuated ERN and CRN amplitudes during the difficult flanker task. The {{results of this study suggest}} that task uncertainty may moderate response monitoring processes during motor errors of commission but not during reinforcement learning paradigms...|$|E
