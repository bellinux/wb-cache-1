5|$|This is a categorized, {{alphabetical}} list {{of people}} who are known to have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> including those who have died. AIDS is a pandemic. In 2007, an estimated 33.2million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it killed an estimated 2.1million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, HIV <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases. During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of {{the immune system}} to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E
25|$|All sexual {{behaviors}} that involve {{contact with the}} bodily fluids of another person should be considered to contain some risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Most attention has focused on controlling HIV, which <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> but each STI presents a different situation.|$|E

Ibanez agreed to the penalty to settle charges that she <b>caused,</b> <b>aided</b> and abetted.....|$|R
25|$|The 1829 Treaty of Adrianople allowed Moldavia {{to again}} {{maintain}} its own troops, no longer acting as an auxiliary under strict Ottoman supervision, and assigned red over blue pennants (see Flag and {{coat of arms}} of Moldavia). Their renewed existence under Mihail Sturdza was a major symbol and rally point for the nationalist <b>cause,</b> <b>aiding</b> in bringing about the 1848 Moldavian revolution.|$|R
25|$|Any {{foreigner}} {{found to}} be infected with HIV, the virus which <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> (or, indeed, any other serious medical condition), is deported to their country of origin. Condoms are available in hospitals and pharmacies, and in some supermarkets as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} is that the Duesberg hypothesis has been refuted by a large and growing mass of evidence showing that HIV <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> that the amount of virus in the blood correlates with disease progression, that a plausible mechanism for HIV's action has been proposed, and that anti-HIV medication decreases mortality and opportunistic infection in people with AIDS.|$|E
25|$|Chlamydia, human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), {{can be transmitted}} through oral sex. Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, the virus that <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.|$|E
25|$|Octavian's {{two young}} sons are {{snatched}} away by a lion and an ape during their journey into exile with their mother. Margaret in the verse romance Sir Tryamour has her <b>cause</b> <b>aided</b> by Sir Roger's intelligent dog. Cristobel, in the English romance Sir Eglamour of Artois, has her baby son snatched away by a griffin and delivered stork-like to the King of Israel. William and Emelior, in the mid-14th century Middle English version of William of Palerne, dress themselves in deerskins as another disguise, when the bearskins they are wearing have become a handicap to them.|$|R

50|$|Around 1700, Louis XIV {{reached out}} again, {{this time to}} Francis II Rákóczi, {{in his attempt to}} {{mitigate}} Austrian power. Francis was arrested for this correspondence but eventually escaped to Poland. The War of the Spanish Succession forced much of the Austrian army to leave Hungary, creating an opportunity to revolt. The Kurucs, or the anti-Habsburg rebels, began an uprising headed by Rákóczi. However, very few nobles supported the revolution. Additionally, Austrian military victories over the French and the Bavarians <b>caused</b> <b>aid</b> to the revolution to falter. By 1706, Rákóczi was forced to retreat. Peace negotiations were largely unsuccessful, and Hungarian defeat at the Battle of Trencsén solidified Austrian victory.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, {{as part of}} {{a routine}} medical exam, Maggiore tested {{positive}} for HIV, as did a former boyfriend. Subsequently, Maggiore became involved in volunteer work for a number of AIDS charities, including AIDS Project Los Angeles, L.A. Shanti, and Women at Risk. However, following an interaction with prominent AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg in 1994, Maggiore began to question whether HIV <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Maggiore came to believe that her positive test may have been due to influenza vaccination, pregnancy, or a common viral infection.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a Kaiser Family Foundation {{study found}} that 95% of public {{secondary}} schools offered sex education programs. More {{than half of the}} schools in the study followed a comprehensive approach that included information about both abstinence and contraception, while approximately one third of schools provided students with abstinence-only sex education. In 2002, most Americans favored the comprehensive approach. A 2000 {{study found that}} almost all schools included information about HIV, the virus that <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS,</b> in their curricula. There have been efforts among social conservatives in the US government to limit sex education in public schools to abstinence-only sex education curricula. The effectiveness of abstinence-only programs has been an issue of controversy.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, first genital herpes {{and then}} AIDS emerged {{into the public}} {{consciousness}} as sexually transmitted diseases {{that could not be}} cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic period—during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS)</b> can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others—followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States from Haiti in about 1969. Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} obtaining {{scholarships}} {{does not help}} the student or her/his family. Scholarships reduce financial need, {{and the amount of}} the scholarship can <b>cause</b> Need-based <b>aid,</b> which the student would have received anyway, to be reduced by the amount of the scholarship.|$|R
30|$|The pitfall of {{top-down}} approach to development {{is identified as}} a major <b>cause</b> of <b>aid</b> inefficiency. The approach is fraught with corruption and unethical practices that have bedeviled aid administration. Meanwhile, the impact of remittances has been widely acknowledged in the national development process.|$|R
50|$|Because {{barriers}} to entry protect incumbent firms and restrict competition in a market, they can contribute to distortionary prices and are therefore most important when discussing antitrust policy. Barriers to entry often <b>cause</b> or <b>aid</b> the existence of monopolies or give companies market power.|$|R
25|$|HIV, the {{retrovirus}} that <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> in humans, {{produces a}} single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among differentially spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different {{products that are}} required for viral multiplication. One of the differentially spliced transcripts contains the tat gene, in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) overlap. If A1 repressor protein binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5’ donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the core splicing factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5’ donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome. Competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mRNA types (with and without exon 2) are produced.|$|E
500|$|Shilts accused Ronald Reagan of {{neglecting}} {{to address}} AIDS to the American people until 1987—calling his behavior [...] "ritualistic silence"—even after Reagan called friend Rock Hudson {{to tell him}} to get well. After Hudson's death and in the face of increasing public anxiety, Reagan directed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to provide a report on the epidemic. Though Koop was a political conservative, his report was nevertheless clear about what <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> and what people and the U.S. government should do to stop it, including sex and AIDS education provided for all people.|$|E
500|$|Healthy {{for most}} of his childhood, he became {{extremely}} ill with pneumonia in December 1984. On December 17, 1984, during a lung biopsy, Ryan was diagnosed with AIDS. By this time the scientific community had studied the epidemic in great detail. Earlier that year that HTLV-III was identified and isolated by American research scientists, confirming the work done by French research scientists who called it LAV. A lengthy public battle to determine who should be recognized as the discover of the human retro virus delayed development of a test for what would later be called HIV. Ryan had apparently received a contaminated treatment of FactorVIII that was infected with HIV, as did thousands of other Americans with hemophilia and hemophiliacs around the world. At that time, because the retrovirus that <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> had been recently identified, much of the pooled Factor VIII concentrate [...] was tainted. Blood banks and pharmaceuticals dismissed calls by the CDC to use a Hepatitis B test as a surrogate until a HIV test could be developed. Late plasma products were screen and heat treated to deactivate both HIV and Hepatitis. Among hemophiliacs treated with blood-clotting factors between 1979 and 1984, nearly 90% became infected with HIV and/or Hepatitis C. At the time of his diagnosis, his T-cell count had dropped to 25 (a healthy individual without HIV will have around 5001200). Doctors predicted Ryan White had only six months to live.|$|E
50|$|Haston {{was also}} a member of the Delta company which was sent to Ireland early in the war to prepare a fall back party center in the event of being made illegal, and having to {{function}} underground as had happened to revolutionaries in the previous war. In the event they remained legal, although they were persecuted at one point and the Government spied on them, and the delegation returned to Britain one by one. While in Ireland, they recruited additional supporters to their <b>cause,</b> <b>aiding</b> in the establishment of an Irish Trotskyist movement. Haston was the last to return from Ireland and was arrested and jailed as he was travelling on false papers, his own having been passed to a comrade evading military service.|$|R

2500|$|Wells and Johnson {{have been}} criticized, along with others, for their {{questioning}} of the scientific and medical consensus that HIV <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS.</b> [...] In the Washington University Law Review, Matthew J. Brauer, Barbara Forrest, and Steven G. Gey faulted Wells, Johnson, and others for denying the HIV/AIDS connection and promoting denialism via a petition designed to garner publicity but which {{did not have any}} scientific support.|$|E
2500|$|Lang's most {{controversial}} political stance was as an AIDS denialist; he {{maintained that the}} prevailing scientific consensus that HIV <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> has not been backed up by reliable scientific research, yet for political and commercial reasons further research questioning the current {{point of view is}} suppressed. [...] In public he was very outspoken about this point and a portion of Challenges is devoted to this issue.|$|E
2500|$|Questioning whether HIV is {{the cause}} of AIDS, {{claiming}} manifestations of AIDS (including opportunistic infections and death) {{may be the result of}} [...] "psychological stress" [...] brought on by the belief that HIV is harmful. The scientific community considers the evidence that HIV <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> conclusive. [...] Mercola.com has also featured positive presentations of the claims of AIDS denialists, a fringe group which denies the existence of AIDS and/or the role of HIV in causing it.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, suction {{devices are}} used to clear airways of {{materials}} that would impede breathing or <b>cause</b> infections, to <b>aid</b> in surgery, and for other purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Orbison {{was also}} {{involved}} with charitable <b>causes</b> in <b>aid</b> of the homeless. For Showtime, in 1990, she produced a Roy Orbison tribute at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles that raised {{in excess of}} $1 million for the city's homeless. She personally funded [...] "Orbison House", a 21-unit residence for the mentally impaired homeless of Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that a tunnel once existed under the business district of Janesville. The tunnel ran between basements and below buildings {{on both sides of}} Janesville's Main Street, crossing below the street {{in the center of town}} and continuing westward to the Cedar River. One branch of the tunnel continued northward, connecting to the site of Fort John, a shelter built to protect settlers during the Ho-Chunk uprising in June, 1854. The tunnel terminated in the basement of the home of Abel Crail, who later served in Union Army in the American Civil War, and was the first Commander of Janesville Post No. 172, Grand Army of the Republic. According to local legend, the Barricks and other townsfolk sympathetic to their <b>cause</b> <b>aided</b> in the escape of runaway slaves as part of the Underground Railroad. Slaves were moved through Janesville from Grinnell, Iowa and continued to Decorah, Iowa and into Southeastern Minnesota. The tunnel has since been filled in and no longer exists.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{release of}} the biography, President Mbeki's {{defenders}} have tried hard to clarify his position as being an AIDS [...] "dissident" [...] {{as opposed to an}} AIDS [...] "denier". That is, he accepts that HIV <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> but is a dissident in that he is at odds with prevailing AIDS-focused public health policies, stating that it {{is only one of many}} immune deficiency diseases, many of which are associated with poverty, and that political attention and resources should be directed to poverty and immune deficiency diseases generally rather than AIDS specifically.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, a {{panel of}} the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found that [...] "the {{evidence}} that HIV <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> is scientifically conclusive." [...] That same year, Science published Blattner, Gallo, and Temin's [...] "HIV causes AIDS", and Duesberg's [...] "HIV is {{not the cause of}} AIDS". Also that same year, the Perth Group, a group of denialists based in Perth, Western Australia led by Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos, [...] published in the non-peer-reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses their first article questioning aspects of HIV/AIDS research, arguing that there was [...] "no compelling reason for preferring the viral hypothesis of AIDS to one based on the activity of oxidising agents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, in {{addition}} to recreational drugs, Duesberg argues that anti-HIV drugs such as zidovudine (AZT) can cause AIDS. Duesberg's claim that antiviral medication <b>causes</b> <b>AIDS</b> is regarded as disproven by the scientific community. Placebo-controlled {{studies have found that}} AZT as a single agent produces modest and short-lived improvements in survival and delays the development of opportunistic infections; it certainly did not cause AIDS, which develops in both treated and untreated study patients. With the subsequent development of protease inhibitors and highly active antiretroviral therapy, numerous studies have documented the fact that anti-HIV drugs prevent the development of AIDS and substantially prolong survival, further disproving the claim that these drugs [...] "cause" [...] AIDS.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{weeks before}} the 2009 mid-term elections, Justice Minister Aníbal Fernández issued a {{statement}} saying that he was in favor of starting a same-sex marriage debate in Congress, that a gender-neutral law would [...] "end discrimination", and that [...] "many people are demanding it." [...] Fernández also said that former President Néstor Kirchner, late husband of at that moment President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, supported having a wider discussion on same-sex marriage in the country. President Fernández de Kirchner's position on same-sex marriage was unknown at the time. Justice Minister Fernández said he was presently [...] "working toward" [...] presenting a draft law to Congress, and that his ministry must first [...] "evaluate all the different aspects of the issue." [...] The bill was never presented. At this time, LGBT rights groups gradually won over members of the Chamber of Deputies to their <b>cause,</b> <b>aided</b> by the decentralized nature of Congressional parties which allowed advocacy groups to post incremental gains.|$|R

5|$|Maximus {{is among}} those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths. The vindication of Maximus' {{theological}} position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his <b>cause</b> was <b>aided</b> by the accounts of miracles at his tomb. In the Roman Catholic Church the veneration of Maximus began prior to {{the foundation of the}} Congregation for the Causes of Saints.|$|R
