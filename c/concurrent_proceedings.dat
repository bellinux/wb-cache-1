2500|$|Justice Brennan {{wrote for}} the majority. [...] He first {{determined}} that the McCarran Amendment did not create an express or implied exception to § 1331 or § 1345, {{and then turned to}} the {{issue of whether or not}} the district court should have dismissed the suit because of the <b>concurrent</b> <b>proceedings</b> in state court. [...] The McCarran Amendment permitted adjudication of the Native American tribes' rights in state court, and Brennan held there was no strong policy argument to eliminate the state courts' jurisdiction in this area. [...] Moreover, the circumstances necessitating abstention were not present here, largely because this case did not present complex issues of state law or policy to be resolved, as was the case in past abstention cases such as Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. (1941), Burford v. Sun Oil Co. (1943), or Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux (1959). [...] Nor was this an attempt to enjoin state criminal proceedings, as in Younger v. Harris (1971).|$|E

40|$|The book {{contains}} {{a full and}} up-to-date account {{of the implications of}} concurrent enforcement of EC and UK competition law. It addresses the interaction of criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings in the UK and the EU as regards procedure, evidence, and remedies. The volume {{contains a}}n in-depth examination of the principles regulating <b>concurrent</b> <b>proceedings</b> and explains in detail the practical solutions following from the construction of EU and UK legislation. <b>Concurrent</b> <b>Proceedings</b> in Competition Law offers a thorough review of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as analysing the English authorities in the area of procedure and evidence insofar as relevant to the interplay between criminal, civil and administrative proceedings in competition law. The main focus is on stays, binding effect of administrative decisions and judgments, and disclosure and admissibility of evidence in English law and its relationship with Community Law and Human Rights standards. The analysis expands to the practical consequences of case allocation within the European Competition Network, choice of forum within the EU, litigation in the US, and leniency applications in multiple jurisdictions. The impact of Council Regulation 1 / 2003 and the Commission Notices on cooperation within the Network of Competition Authorities and on cooperation with the courts of EU member states is fully explored. Criminalization of cartels in the UK adds a further dimension to the interplay of <b>concurrent</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Issues of stays, binding effect of administrative decisions and disclosure and admissibility of evidence are also studied when they arise in a dispute that is being decided by an arbitral tribunal...|$|E

40|$|On 14 th December 2010, the EU Commission {{presented}} {{a proposal for}} a revised version of the Brussels I Regulation. The Brussels I Regulation may be regarded as the most important measure which has been adopted at the European Union level in the sphere of private international law. Ihe Regulation applies to most gpes of civil matters. It is at present in force in all 27 EU Member States and has in substance been extended to three other countries The Revision Proposal envisages the adoption of a new Regulation which would replace the Brussels I Regulation Major changes envisaged by the Revision Proposal concern the assimilation of external defendants to internal defendants, the relation between jurisdiction clauses and <b>concurrent</b> <b>proceedings,</b> elimination of the need for a declaration of enforceability in respect of a judgement from a Member State, restriction of the grounds on which recognition or enforcement may be refused and strengthening of the effectiveness of arbitration clauses. A major feature, comprising the assimilation of the treatment of external defendants to that of internal defendants, deserves an enthusiastic welcome. Other changes proposed may be regarded as variable in quality but the proposed provisions regarding recognition and enforcement of judgments amount to major steps in entirely the wrong direction...|$|E
40|$|Australia and New Zealand {{have created}} a single civil {{judicial}} area, which gives all courts in each country a complete adjudicative jurisdiction and a barely qualified enforcement jurisdiction throughout the whole trans-Tasman market area. The risk of <b>concurrent</b> <b>proceedings</b> and incompatible judgments is minimised only {{by the power of}} courts to stay proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens or when enforcing a choice-of-court agreement. The scheme rests on the ‘strikingly similar’ quality of the two countries’ legal systems. However, New Zealand’s Accident Compensation Act 2001 maintains a unique, comprehensive no-fault compensation scheme for accidents which also prohibits all court-based claims for compensation for personal injuries. It is ‘strikingly dissimilar’ to the common law systems of personal injuries compensation found in the Australian states. And, given that the Australian common law systems are often much more generous in the awards given for personal injuries, the New Zealand scheme has been a significant motivation for New Zealanders’ forum shopping in Australia. This {{does not appear to have}} been addressed well by the new trans-Tasman scheme for civil jurisdiction. The article considers the confounding role that the Accident Compensation Act may continue to play in trans-Tasman civil jurisdiction, and its implications for the principles of forum conveniens, choice-of-law and the enforcement of personal injuries awards between Australia and New Zealand. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper anticipates the 2012 {{revision}} of the European Insolvency Regulation, which is the sole Union legislation {{on the subject of}} cross border insolvency proceedings. The paper first describes the historical background of the Regulation. The salient point of the historical discussion is that the Regulation is the product of forty years of negotiation and arises from a historical context that is no longer applicable to current economic realities, i. e. it provides for liquidation, not reorganization, it doesn’t deal with cross border groups of companies, and it lacks an effective mechanism for transparency and creditor participation. The paper then reviews the unique hybrid jurisdictional system of concurrent universal and territorial proceedings that the Regulation imposes. It looks at this scheme from a practical viewpoint, i. e. what issues arise with <b>concurrent</b> <b>proceedings</b> in two states, involving the same assets, the same creditors, and the same company. The paper then focuses on a significant issue raised by the European Court of Justice in the Eurofoods case, i. e. the need to comply with fundamental due process principles that, while not articulated in the Regulation, lie at the core of Union law. Specifically, the paper considers the ramifications of the Court’s holding that “a Member State may refuse to recognize insolvency proceedings opened in another Member State where the decision to open the proceedings was taken in flagrant breach of the fundamental right to be heard. ” In response to the Court’s direction, this paper proposes a package of due process rights, consisting principally of an accessible, efficient and useful insolvency database, the infrastructure of which already exists, but the content and use of which has not yet been developed. As part of a cohesive three part due process package, the paper also proposes the formation of cross border creditors' committees and the establishment of a European Insolvency Administrator. Finally, on the institutional level, this paper proposes that the {{revision of}} the Regulation and the development of the insolvency database not only need to be coordinated, but need to be conceptualized, managed and undertaken, not as the separate efforts of diverse institutions, but as a single, unified endeavor...|$|E

After a week of controversy, Gillard announced that she was asking Slipper to delay his return to the Chair pending the conclusion of <b>concurrent</b> civil <b>proceedings,</b> in an effort to dispel what she described as a [...] "dark cloud" [...] over her government (a reference also to the ongoing Craig Thomson affair involving a Labor MP linked to corruption allegations).|$|R
5|$|Most <b>concurrent</b> use <b>proceedings</b> {{result in}} a legal {{settlement}} between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its concurrent use claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|R
40|$|Model {{checkers}} for systems {{represented by}} labelled transition {{systems are not}} as extensively used as those for systems represented by Kripke structures. This is partially {{due to the lack}} of an elegant formal language for property specification which would not be as raw as, for example, HML yet also not as complex as, for example, -calculus. This paper proposes a new action-based propositional branching-time temporal logic ACTLW, which enhances popular computation tree logic (CTL) with the notion of actions in a similar but more comprehensive way than action-based CTL introduced by De Nicola and Vaandrager [R. De Nicola, F. W. Vaandrager, Action versus logics for transition systems, in: Semantics of Systems of <b>Concurrent</b> Processes, <b>Proceedings</b> LITP Spring School on Theoretical Computer Science, LNCS 469, 1990, pp. 407 - 419]. ACTLW is defined by using temporal operators until and unless only, whereas all other temporal operators are derived from them. Fixed-point characterisation of the operators together with symbolic algorithms for globalmodel checking are shown. Usage of this new logic is illustrated by an example of verification of mutual-exclusion algorithms...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues arising in {{cross-border}} or international insolvency is the local recognition and effect of <b>concurrent</b> foreign insolvency <b>proceedings.</b> As a foreign company may be wound up in Australia (see Pt 5. 7 and Pt 5 B. 2 of the Corporations Law), a local liquidation may be taking place when {{the company is also}} being wound up in its place of incorporation. If this occurs, the foreign winding up is regarded as the principal winding up and the local one as merely ancillary: Re English Scottish & Australian Chartered Bank [1893] 3 Ch 385. The local ancillary winding up concentrates on getting in and realising local assets and may result in funds being remitted to the principal winding up for distribution. If any issue in the local winding up comes before the local court, it must apply local law, including local insolvency law, to its resolution: Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 10) [1997] Ch 213. ...|$|R

Strumenti di coordinamento tra giurisdizioni statali in materia civile", Naples, Jovene Editore, 2008. Thereby, it moves form the general features of lis alibi pendens and related actions as instruments of coordination among state jurisdictions to address more closely the European regulation of the subject as contained in EC Regulation No. 44 / 2001. The study focuses on the main problems raised by the practical implementation of the said regulation, from {{the determination of the}} identity of the parties of the two <b>concurrent</b> sets of <b>proceedings,</b> to the determination of the identity of the cause of action. In this respect, the author points to the risk of forum shopping inherent in the broad characterization of the said requirement adopted by the European Court of Justice in its case law. The analysis offered by the article is completed by an assessment of the main proposals for reform of the said regulation as advanced in the Green Paper on the review of the Brussels I Regulation (COM(2009) 175 final), with particular regard to troublesome issues such as the relationship between exclusive choice of forum agreements and lis alibi pendens, the requirement of identity of cause of action in relation to actions for a negative declaration and the specific problems posed by lis pendens, exclusive jurisdiction and related actions in the field of intellectual property...|$|R
