5|$|Gregory's work {{received}} little scholarly {{attention in the}} West until the mid-twentieth century, and he was historically treated as a minor figure in comparison to Basil the Great or Gregory of Nazianzus. As late as 1942, Hans Urs von Balthasar wrote that his work was virtually unknown. In {{part due to the}} scholarship of Balthasar and Jean Daniélou, by the 1950s Gregory became the subject of much serious theological research, with a critical edition of his work published (Gregorii Nysseni Opera), and the founding of the International <b>Colloquium</b> on Gregory of Nyssa. This attention has continued to the present day. Modern studies have mainly focused on Gregory's eschatology rather than his more dogmatic writings, and he has gained a reputation as an unconventional thinker whose thought arguably prefigures postmodernism. Major figures in contemporary research include Sarah Coakley, John Zizioulas and Robert Jenson.|$|E

25|$|Like acceleration, <b>colloquium</b> {{provides}} {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In <b>colloquium,</b> students take Advanced Placement courses. However, <b>colloquium</b> is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in <b>colloquium</b> also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes {{in a different way}} than students enrolled in AP classes do. <b>Colloquium</b> is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In <b>colloquium,</b> subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have <b>colloquium</b> in certain subjects. In schools where <b>colloquium</b> is only offered in English and History, <b>colloquium</b> students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|A {{range of}} {{systematic}} incidents {{in one of}} my master courses has puzzled me ever since. The experience spurred my interest in language and communication problems in institutions caused by lack of mastery in language. Several Erasmus students registered for the course were severely limited in their presentation of academic work in English. The problems {{did not seem to be}} their academic qualities, probably far surpassing our own, but their limited mastery of English. This challenge made several students question the value of and academic limitations to having <b>colloquiums</b> with (Erasmus) students without satisfactory mastery of English. This led again to (unintended? and) hopeful expectations that only Norwegian students would attend the course; hence the lecture or discussion could be done in Norwegian, the language most of us knew best. The most unfortunate was probably that most Erasmus students sustained from the course, even though the course in my opinion was one of the best courses available at the time. This incident gave me reason to ask three elementary questions: First, does choice of language influence the academic quality of <b>colloquiums,</b> and second, do Erasmus students keep away from <b>colloquiums</b> because of limited mastery in language. Finally, what can be done t...|$|R
