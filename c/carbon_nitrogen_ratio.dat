30|$|The higher <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> in soil of {{the study}} area can be related to high {{temperature}} and low precipitation that limits the decomposition or mineralization rate of organic matter. According to Landon (1991), the higher <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> indicates that organic matter is not fully decomposed through microbial activities. However, the lower <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> in grazing land relative to the exclosure could be due to the low amount of organic materials accumulation through the litter fall from the immature grasses/shrubs, and addition of cow dung, which is enriched with total nitrogen. The Pearson correlation result also showed a significant inverse relationship with total nitrogen (r = − 0.860; p =  0.05). The lower <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> in grazing land relative to exclosure was due to the breakdown of litter fall and the organic matter that enhance microorganisms to decompose into fine particles, which eventually decreases soil organic carbon in grazing land (Caravaca et al. 2002).|$|R

Direct pile measurements on the date of sampling included pile temperature (surface and core), height, width and curvature. Samples were removed from the windrow during each sampling meeting to determine the percent dry matter content.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine if tapping sugar maple trees alters the {{decomposition}} of their leaf litter. To do this, leaf litter collection baskets were placed in tapped and untapped stands of maple trees in Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill, Vermont. Litter was allowed to collect in the baskets throughout the fall 2016 season, and then the leaves were dried, weighed, and run through a nutrient analyzer. The nutrient analysis yielded percent nitrogen by weight, percent carbon by weight, and <b>carbon</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratios</b> for each sample. It was found that the leaf litter of untapped samples had significantly more nitrogen and significantly lower <b>carbon</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratios</b> than the leaf litter collected in the tapped stand. This indicates a likely change in the decomposition of the leaves in each stand, because nutrient ratios have been shown to alter decomposition rates for leaves. One of the implications of slowed decomposition is retarded nutrient cycling, which could lead to a reduction in available nitrogen, a limiting nutrient for sugar maples, in the forest’s soil. More research should be done to determine the origin of the difference in nutrients. Additionally, a longer-term study is necessary to monitor the decomposition rates in this forest...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the phytotoxicity of thin-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings. Three different CNTs, including hollow multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), Fe-filled carbon nanotubes (Fe-CNTs), and Fe-Co-filled carbon nanotubes (FeCo-CNTs), were evaluated. The CNTs significantly inhibited rice growth by decreasing the concentrations of endogenous plant hormones. The carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) significantly increased in rice roots after treatments with CNTs, and all three types of CNTs had the same effects on the C:N ratio. Interestingly, the increase in the C:N ratio in roots was largely because of decreased N content, indicating that the CNTs significantly decreased N assimilation. Analyses of the Fe and Co contents in plant tissues, transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis proved that the CNTs could penetrate the cell wall and the cell membrane, and then enter the root cells.

30|$|It is the {{reflection}} of organic matter (OM) decomposition and its increase is a positive sign of humification. Present study results depicted that {{with the rise of}} composting time there is a fall in carbon and nitrogen ratio in enriched and unenriched composts. The bio-oxidation of carbon into carbon dioxide is due to the impact of rock phosphate and other inorganic additives in early stage of composting. C/N data elucidated that it did not show variation in first 15 days in both composts, later on it decreased rapidly and became stable on 35 th day of composting process in enriched compost and was 57.9 % less C/N than unenriched compost (Fig.  1 a). There was a great significant difference was found in C/N {{at the end of the}} experiment between enriched (C/N: 10.61) and unenriched compost (C/N: 23.13).

40|$|General EcologyAnts and aphids have a mutualistic {{relationship}} in which ants tend the aphids for honeydew, a sugary substance that aphids excrete, and in turn, aphids receive protection from predators that the ants provide. We {{looked at this}} relationship on milkweed plants in the UVB field at the University of Michigan Biological Station in Cheboygan County, Michigan. We investigated how this mutualism affected <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratios</b> of the plants, and how the ratio differed between the original and novel plants. We also looked at how the <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> was affected by aphid density on the plant. Finally, we investigated interspecific ant competition over a novel aphid resource. To do this, we clipped leaves with aphids from an original plant, and moved them to a novel plant without aphids. We took leaf samples of the original plant and the novel plant that aphids were being moved to. We then recorded aphid colonization of the novel leaf and ant recruitment and tending on that plant. At the end of four days, we took a final sample of leaves from each novel plant. We used these to determine <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratios</b> of the original plants, and before and after of the novel plants. There was no significant relationship between ant and aphid densities on the plants to effectively determine that a mutualism is present. There {{was no significant difference}} in the <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratios</b> in the original plants compares to the novel plants before aphid transfer. There were no differences in the changes of plant chemistry of the plants with only aphids, plants with ants tending aphids, and plants with no aphids. There was no relationship between the <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> and the aphid density on the plant. We also saw only 5 % of plants being tended by two ant species, so we could not conclude anything from this.

Particle size fraction (sand, silt, and clay), effective cation exchange capacity, base saturation, pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, <b>carbon</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio,</b> available phosphorus, exchangeable bases (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium) and acidity are frequently used in agriculture for soil management. The objective of this study therefore was to identify soil management factors from these set of 15 soil properties and spatial distribution of representative soil management properties. The study {{was carried out in}} the University of Uyo Teaching and Research Farm measuring 8. 19 hectares in University of Uyo Annex, Uyo in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria. Nine and ten traverses were made horizontally and vertically respectively at 40 meters intervals. A total of 58 soil samples were collected at 0 - 15 cm depth on the grid nodes of the traverses. Particle size distributions, exchangeable bases and acidity, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), available phosphorus (avail. P), base saturation (BS), organic carbon, total nitrogen, <b>carbon</b> <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> (CNR) and pH of the samples were determined in the laboratory. Coefficient of variation indicated that 26. 6 % of the soil properties (sand content, pH, CNR and sodium) were least variable, 40. 1 % comprising silt, clay contents, ECEC, base saturation, phosphorus and magnesium were moderately. Whereas 33. 3 % of the soil properties comprising clay content, organic carbon, total nitrogen, exchangeable Ca, K and acidity (i. e.) were highly variable. There were significant correlation (p < 0. 05) in 26. 6 % of the soil properties, the strongest negative significant (p < 0. 01) correlations were between sand and clay (r = – 0. 85), exchangeable acidity and base saturation (r = – 0. 85), whereas the strongest positive significant correlations were between ECEC and Ca (r = 0. 80), Ca and BS (r = 0. 74), organic carbon and total nitrogen (r = 0. 80). Principal component analysis indicated the existence of six factors including mineralogical or weathering, soil organic matter, cation exchange activity, soil texture, and dispersion and soil phosphorus based on either management or pedological considerations. Semivariance statistics showed that sand and clay contents, ECEC, BS and total N were moderately (≥ 25. 7 % ≤ 47. 3 %), while silt content, pH, organic carbon, CNR, avail.

These areas, generally, are {{the top of the}} mound, bottom of the pit, side of the mound, edge of the pit, and an undisturbed forest floor area.Studies have observed that both pits and mounds {{generally have}} lower <b>carbon</b> and <b>nitrogen</b> soil content than the undisturbed forest floor, although they have <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratios</b> that are not significantly different from the ratios observed on the forest floor.|$|R
40|$|Background: Surfactants {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} raw materials used in various industrial fields as emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, foaming agents, detergent products, and so on. However, commercial surfactant production is costly, and its demand is steadily increasing. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of typical strains of Bacillus sp. to produce biosurfactants through fermentation. It also included the investigation of the effect of initial glucose concentration and the <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio.</b> Results: The biosurfactant yield was in the range of 1 – 2. 46  g/L at initial glucose concentrations of 10 – 70  g/L. The optimum fermentation condition was achieved at a <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio</b> of 12. 4, with a decrease in surface tension of up to 27  mN/m. Conclusions: For further development and industrial applications, the modified Gompertz equation is proposed to predict the cell mass and biosurfactant production as a goodness of fit was obtained with this model. The modified Gompertz equation was also extended to enable the excellent prediction of the surface tension...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine the}} impacts of small (85. 12 m 2), medium (325. 21 m 2), large (512. 11 m 2) and very large (723. 85 m 2) gaps on soil {{properties}} in a mixed beech – hornbeam stand of northern Iran. As well as the value of pH, organic matter and <b>carbon,</b> total <b>nitrogen,</b> cation exchange capacity (CEC), phosphorus, potassium, calcium, nitrogen mineralization, microbial respiration, earthworms density and biomass of soil samples (0 – 15, 15 – 30 and 30 - 45 cm depths from gap center, edge and closed canopy positions) were measured in laboratory. Significantly effects of gaps size were found on soil properties as the highest values of CEC, density and biomass of earthworms observed in small gaps. The highest values of <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio,</b> phosphorus, potassium and calcium were detected in medium gaps. The most amounts of organic matter and <b>carbon,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> mineralization devoted in very big gaps. Greater amounts of pH, total nitrogen and microbial respiration were detected in big and very big gaps. It was found that gap position {{had a profound effect}} on soil characters as the highest values of pH, organic matter and <b>carbon,</b> total <b>nitrogen,</b> phosphorus, potassium, calcium, nitrogen mineralization, microbial respiration observed in gap center. The greatest amounts of <b>carbon</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ratio,</b> CEC, density and biomass of earthworms were detected in closed canopy. According to the results, soil upper layers showe...|$|R
