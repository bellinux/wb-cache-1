MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty two extracted and endodontically treated premolar teeth were used and divided into four groups (n = 8) depending on the post used (Group 1 - 4). 1 : one single conventional post, 2 : one main conventional and one <b>collateral</b> <b>post,</b> 3 : one flexible post, 4 : one main flexible and one <b>collateral</b> <b>post.</b> After cementation and core build-up the specimens were submitted to static fracture toughness test. Fracture thresholds and fracture patterns were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The multi-post techniques (group 2 and 4) showed statistically higher fracture resistance compared to group one. Regarding fracture patterns there was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the tested groups. CONCLUSION: The application of multiple posts seems to be beneficial regarding fracture resistance independent from the used FRC post.

40|$|A bank {{borrowing}} some money {{has to give}} some securities to the lender, which is called collateral. Different kinds of <b>collateral</b> can be <b>posted,</b> like cash in different currencies or a stock portfolio depending on {{the terms of the}} contract, which is called a Credit Support Annex (CSA). Those contracts specify eligible collateral, interest rate, frequency of <b>collateral</b> <b>posting,</b> minimum transfer amounts, etc. This guarantee reduces the counterparty risk associated with this type of transaction. If a CSA allows for posting cash in different currencies as collateral, then the party <b>posting</b> <b>collateral</b> can, now and at each future point in time, choose which currency to post. This choice leads to optionality that needs to be accounted for when valuing even the most basic of derivatives such as forwards or swaps. In this thesis, we deal with the valuation of embedded optionality in collateral contracts. We consider the case when <b>collateral</b> can be <b>posted</b> in two different currencies, which seems sufficient since collateral contracts are soon going to be simplified. This study is based on the conditional independence approach proposed by Piterbarg [8]. This method is compared to both Monte-Carlo simulation and finite- difference method. A practical application is finally presented with the example of a contract between Natixis and Barclays. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the reinforcing effect of fibre-reinforced composites (FRC) applied in premolar teeth with different techniques and minimally invasive post space preparation. Fifty extracted and endodontically treated premolar teeth were used. The teeth were divided into five groups (n = 10) depending on the restorative technique (Groups 1 - 5). Group 1 : one single conventional post, Group 2 : one main conventional and one <b>collateral</b> <b>post,</b> Group 3 : one elastic post, Group 4 : one main elastic and one <b>collateral</b> <b>post,</b> and Group 5 : individual post formed of elastic posts. After cementation and core build-up, the specimens were submitted to static fracture resistance test. Fracture thresholds and fracture patterns were measured and evaluated. Group 4 showed the highest average fracture resistance among the tested groups. The multi-post techniques (group 2 and 4) exhibited statistically higher fracture resistance compared to group 1. Regarding fracture patterns, there was no statistically significant difference between the tested groups. Within the limitations of this study, the application of multiple elastic or conventional FRC posts or a single elastic post in the same root canal is beneficial in terms of fracture resistance compared to a single conventional FRC post. The elasticity or the number of posts did not influence the fracture patterns...|$|R

5000|$|Insurance companies: Corporations such as AIG provide {{insurance}} products called credit default swaps, which {{are intended to}} protect against credit defaults, {{in exchange for a}} premium or fee. They are required to post a certain amount of collateral (e.g., cash or other liquid assets) {{to be in a position}} to provide payments in the event of defaults. The amount of capital is based on the credit rating of the insurer. Due to uncertainty regarding the financial position of the insurance company and potential risk of default events, credit agencies may downgrade the insurer, which requires an immediate increase in the amount of <b>collateral</b> <b>posted.</b> This risk-downgrade-post cycle can be circular and destructive across multiple firms and was a factor in the AIG bailout. Further, many major banks insured their mortgage-backed assets with AIG. Had AIG been allowed to go bankrupt and not pay these banks what it owed them, these institutions could have failed, causing risk to the entire financial system. Since September 2008, the U.S. government has since stepped in with $150 billion in financial support for AIG, much of which flows through AIG to the banks.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{introducing}} rigorous methods and formulas for bilateral counterparty risk credit valuation adjustment (CVA) on interest-rate portfolios. In doing so, we summarize the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including the default of the investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net present value of the contract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor and counterparty, and for correlation of each with the underlying risk factor, namely interest rates. We also analyze the often neglected impact of credit spread volatility. We include close-out netting rules in our examples, although other agreements, such as periodic margining or <b>collateral</b> <b>posting,</b> are left for future work.

30|$|In {{the present}} paper we apply this {{framework}} to the concrete setup of a bank engaged in bilateral trade portfolios. In this context, the discounted expectation of losses due to the default of counterparties or of the bank itself are respectively known as CVA (credit valuation adjustment) and DVA (debt valuation adjustment). Counterparty risk mitigants include the variation margin (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the initial margin (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its variation margin during liquidation periods. The cost of funding cash collateral for the variation margin is known as funding valuation adjustment (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated <b>collateral</b> <b>posted</b> as initial margin is the margin valuation adjustment (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment). The contra-liability component of a unilateral CVA is dubbed CVACL.|$|E

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has shown that small firms, due to their opaqueness, may {{find it difficult to}} access the credit market.

However, in some cases, {{due to a lack of}} collateral or of a long credit history, small enterprises may still find it very difficult to raise external finance unless alternative contracting schemes emerge. In particular, group lending or similarly micro-finance are examples of such alternative lending contracts. In this paper, we investigate the effect of mutual guarantee institutions (MGI) on loan interest rates. We argue that, similarly to group lending and micro-finance, firms affiliated to a MGI are linked by a joint responsibility for the loan providing MGI affiliates with peer monitoring incentives. Indeed, each MGI member contributes to the guarantee fund that is then <b>posted</b> as <b>collateral</b> to loans granted to MGI members.
