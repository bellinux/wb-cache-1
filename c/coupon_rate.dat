They managed to raise £504million in just under two weeks, meaning {{that they were able}} to pay off almost all of the £509million owed to international banks. The bonds were issued in two tranches, one with a <b>coupon</b> <b>rate</b> of 8.75% worth £250million, and the other with a <b>coupon</b> <b>rate</b> of 8.375% worth $425million. The annual interest payable on the bond came to approximately £45million per annum, with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017. Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants that would allow the Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015. These include the carving out of £95million in cash, the sale and lease-back of the Trafford Training Centre at Carrington, and the ability of the Glazers to pay themselves 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the club every year.|$|E
5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing the discount rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on the <b>coupon</b> <b>rate</b> of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere is a {{new wave}} of {{external}} borrowing by African governments on private sovereign bond markets. The findings in this paper indicate that African economies pay higher-than-normal <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> on these markets; observed risk measures like agency ratings and debt to GDP ratios do not explain the deviation from the norm.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{securitization}} on two dimensions of consumer mortgage costs: <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> and loan origination fees. We find no evidence that securitization reduces the <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> on fixed- or adjustable-rate mortgages. Instead, securitization appears to lower mortgage loan origination fees, resulting in substantial savings for consumers. Securitization activity includes passthrough creation and collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) creation. We test for differences between the effects of passthrough and CMO creation on primary mortgage costs. Surprisingly, these activities appear to have indistinguishable effects on loan rates and origination fees, suggesting that a large derivatives market for mortgage loans is not creating value for consumers.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the term {{structure}} of interest rates. We show that the term structure of interest rates is a static function that relates the term to maturity to the yield to maturity for a sam- ple of bonds at a given point of time. We also short describe four mainstream theories attempt to explain {{the shape of the}} yield curve. The yield curve is a basic instrument for understanding the relationship between the interest rate of bonds and the maturity of a financial instrument. It has the same relevance for all economic subjects in the form of interest rates determination. Estimation of the term structure discussed in the paper involves obtaining zero <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates,</b> or discount functions from a set of coupon bond prices. The bootstrapping method is used here to determinate the particular zero <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates</b> of bonds, where the method consists of iteratively extracting zero <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates</b> using a sequence of increasing maturity coupon bond prices. Using these rates it becomes possible to derive interest rates for all maturities by making a few assumptions including linear in- terpolation as we discuss in conclusion of this paper. The particular spot and forward zero <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates</b> resulting from the bootstrapping method can be used as input in different economic categories like financial management, portfolio management, actuary science, company valuation, management of firm value, financial risk management, etc. The matrix approach derived and described in this paper can be used instead of solving the zero <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> sequentially for obtaining a direct solution with particular zero <b>coupon</b> <b>rates.</b> This helps us to diminish the computing severity related to the sequential determination of interest rates using an iterative approach. Fortunately, however, the application of matrix theory helps us to solve this issue very well...|$|R
40|$|During the Last {{three years}} {{mortgage}} rates have risen relative to yields on comparable maturity bonds. The questions {{addressed in the}} present paper are what is the extent of this increase and to what is it attributable? We find the increase between early 198 and early 1981 in <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> on GNMA mortgage pools relative to ''the" rate on a comparable portfolio of Treasury bonds to be about 100 basis points. We attribute the increase to {{a rise in the}} terminations premia built into mortgage <b>coupon</b> <b>rates.</b> The premia is the price borrowers are charged for the option to repay the mortgage when it is to their benefit (to refinance if interest rates decline). This price has risen in response to an increase in interest rate uncertainty. Our empirical results suggest that the increase is due to both greater uncertainty regarding the inflation premium in interest rates and the lesser weight the monetary authorities give to interest rate stability in their deliberations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} divided into four broad parts, {{beginning}} with an exploratory {{analysis of the data}} on expost returns on corporate equities and bonds for the 1926 - 80 period. In Part 2, we estimate the relationships between one-month expost returns on corporate bonds and equities andvariations in Treasury bill rates, economic activity, and other variables. The major other variable is unanticipated changes in new issue <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> on long-term Treasury bonds. Parts 3 and 4 contain econometric investigations of the determinants of one-month Treasury bill rates and unanticipated changes in long-term Treasury <b>coupon</b> <b>rates,</b> respectively. These parts extend the analysis of Part 2 by explaining variables that determine expost corporate bond and equity returns and provide evidence on the determination of new-issue yields on short- and long-term default-free debt. The last three parts ofthe study report econometric results based on data from the 1953 - 83 period. A number of important issues are addressed in the econometric parts of the paper. These include: the validity of the Modigliani-Cohn valuation-error hypothesis, the measurement of Merton's "excess return on the market", the relationship between real new-issue debt rates and real economic activity, and the usefulness of the Livingston survey data in explaining financial returns. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a dynamic {{model of the}} capital structure of a firm in which debt is callable and where equity holders act strategically to force renegotiations of debt when the bankruptcy threat is imminent. Far away from the bankruptcy threat the equity holders use the call feature to replace the existing debt in order to increasing the tax advantage of debt. On the other hand, when the bankruptcy threat is imminent, we do not, as in the existing literature, assume that the existing debt is called. Both the lower and upper reorganization points are derived endogenously. The endogeneity of the lower boundary is similar in spirit to the strategic debt service models of e. g. Anderson and Sundaresan (1996) and Mella-Barral and Perraudin (1997). However, in our model the entire debt is renegotiated. It {{is not just the}} current coupon payment which is fine tuned. The problem of finding the value process for the firm’s assets is solved by allowing for a fixed number of restructuring options and looking at the limit as this number goes to infinity. We investigate how firm value, equity value, debt value, par <b>coupon</b> <b>rates,</b> leverage, and credit spreads change with the number of remaining renegotiation options left. Our results show that initial debt value and leverage decrease as the firm is allowed to renegotiate debt more often, whereas firm value and par <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> increases. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{success in}} {{marketing}} original issue high-yield bonds has generated significant {{interest in their}} default experience. Studies comparing defaults to the par value of outstanding issues such as Altman (1987), Altman and Nammacher (1985), and Weinstein (1987) have found relatively low default rates. However, these studies understate default rates because of the rapid increase in the par value of outstanding issues and because cumulative default rates increase with years from issuance. Two recent studies by Altman (1989) and Asquith, Mullins and Wolff (AMW) (1989) have corrected these problems by using aging analysis to follow rated nonconvertible high-yield bonds over time; they find cumulative default rates for such bonds 10 years after issuance exceeding 30 percent.; This study extends the literature on high-yield default rates to convertible and nonrated securities, not examined in previous studies. The high-yield market can be partitioned into rated nonconvertible, rated convertible, nonrated nonconvertible, and nonrated convertible securities. Other things equal, one would expect higher default risk {{to be associated with}} higher yields; however, other things are not equal. For example, securities may have high yields because of differences in liquidity or differences in conversion options. Therefore, yields reflect more than just expected default risk; they also incorporate premiums for other characteristics of individual securities.; When the securities are partitioned by rating and convertibility, the results of this paper show that the cumulative default rates are lower for rated convertible securities than for rated nonconvertible securities. Because investors value convertibility, convertible bonds carry substantially lower <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> than nonconvertible bonds. These lower <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> may reduce the likelihood of an issue defaulting.; In addition, this study examines nonrated securities. Many securities are nonrated because the graduated fee structure charged by rating agencies makes ratings prohibitively expensive for smaller issues. Despite some potential biases that are discussed below, the default rate on nonrated convertible bonds is significantly less than that of rated nonconvertible securities, and the default rate on nonrated nonconvertible bonds appears to be less than that for rated nonconvertible securities.; The next section of the paper discusses the data and shows that the default rates for rated nonconvertible securities are higher than those for rated convertible, nonrated convertible, and nonrated nonconvertible securities. Each category of security is further examined for explanations for lower default rates, in Sections II through IV. Section V estimates a logit model that shows that default differences based on security characteristics persist even after controlling for <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> and size.
