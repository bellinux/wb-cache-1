5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> was small enough to fit into a knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, two of {{the small}} water <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> D Company were using to {{withdraw}} to Gili Gili encountered the Japanese landing force. In the firefight that followed, one of the craft– Elevala– was forced to beach and its occupants forced to return {{to take to the}} jungle on foot, eventually reaching Gili Gili some time later; the other, Bronzewing, was holed and of its passengers, 11 were killed either in the engagement or by the Japanese following their capture.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, unbeknown {{to their}} commanders and each other, and having lost communications, the seven landing <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> had been {{reported}} missing made for their assigned beaches, determined to press on with the attack. In the end two parties landed, one party consisting of six craft carrying approximately 120 men under Captain R.L Willis landed on the beach opposite Le Petit Berneval {{to the east of}} the battery—Yellow I—while the other, consisting of only one craft of 20 men from No. 6 Troop under Captain Peter Young landed to the west at Yellow II.|$|E

5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before they hit the beach, {{and three of the}} landing <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> the Commandos were travelling in were hit by high-velocity shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in the end they were lower than had been expected.|$|E
5|$|As rations {{and water}} dwindled, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made}} on 10 June to rescue {{the men in the}} stranded barge with support from artillery and aircraft. While Corsairs flew close support missions, Beaufort and Mitchell bombers dropped life rafts but the survivors were unable to reach them due to machine-gun fire. Further casualties occurred when, in the early morning of 11 June, a Japanese soldier managed to reach the vessel and fired upon the occupants with a machine-gun, killing two and wounding others before he was killed himself. Shortly after this a Japanese anti-tank gun fired two shells at the landing craft, destroying its stern. Further shots were prevented when Australian artillery ranged in on the gun, having been directed by Captain John Whitelaw, an artillery observer on one of two landing <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> had been despatched with canvas assault boats, crewed by engineers from the 16th Field Company.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} French majority in numbers, {{the attack was}} a disaster: nearly 1,000 French soldiers were killed as the boats were caught in open water under the island's gun batteries: several were sunk with all hands. Heavy fire from batteries and Royal Marines prevented a single French soldier from landing and the retreating fleet was subject to heavy fire from the smaller island to the north, inflicting further losses. British casualties were negligible. Although this operation indicated the probable result of a full-scale invasion of Britain, the threat remained and British forces began a close blockade of the surviving landing <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> were anchored in the Cotentin ports. A month after the battle this strategy resulted in a secondary success when a French frigate and corvette passing along the coast were intercepted and defeated by the blockade squadron.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} quality and <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> went into the compilation's design. Jaz Rignall (USgamer) was {{impressed}} by the compilation's presentation and balance between frills and efficiency, and Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer) felt that the theatrical theme fit Rare's character. Reviewers considered Rare Replay a high-water mark for video game compilations—Kotaku called it the best since Valve's The Orange Box. On the other hand, Jeremy Parish (USgamer) found the contemporaneous Mega Man Legacy Collection Criterion Collection-style presentation to be a more authentic appreciation of its original material. Chris Plante (The Verge) saw Rare Replay slight hardware improvements and added touches as a viable model for putting retrogames back on the market and slowing the tide of unlicensed downloads.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{two types of}} single-player {{gameplay}} including a strategic map and battle mode. The overworld-like map mode is where the player takes command of several ships. The mode is used to get ships into the battle mode and is essentially a simple turn-based strategy game. Up to four ships can be maneuvered at a time. The object of the mode is to prevent the enemy ones from reaching the Great Fox. It also allows players to fire missiles from the Great Fox that they have picked up from exploring in this mode, or from meeting certain conditions in the battle mode (usually destroying all enemies). When a <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> {{is controlled by the}} player encounters an enemy group or missile in this mode, the gameplay switches to the battle mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. Depending on the level, the player can control several different air, {{land and water}} vehicles. Aircraft are the Naboo N-1 Starfighter, the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser, while land and watercraft are the Flash and Gian speeders, the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy STAP. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> falls within its air, land or watercraft specification. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Seven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} heavily silted, {{limiting}} navigation to shallow <b>crafts</b> <b>that</b> can cross the muddy flats. Tidal conditions dictate the timing {{to cross the}} bar at the river mouth.|$|R

5|$|The {{second wave}} came in LCIs. These were <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> had no ramps; {{infantry}} disembarked from the down gangways. That {{they were not}} suitable for an assault landing was not overlooked, {{but they were all}} that was available. The first wave's mission had been to capture Scarlet Beach and the foreshore. Since that had not been done, they came under fire from the Japanese bunkers. Despite explicit orders not to, they replied with their Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Some helped to suppress the Japanese machine guns, while others fired wildly and caused casualties among the Australian troops ashore. Like the first wave, they veered off to the left, adding to the chaos. At least three of the LCIs grounded on a sand bar, but were able to retract and make better landings, although still on the wrong beach.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May, {{the first}} full day of the evacuation, one cruiser, eight destroyers, and 26 other craft were active. Admiralty {{officers}} combed nearby boatyards for small <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically {{taking part in the}} effort. The same day, the Luftwaffe heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished. An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town. The Luftwaffe was met by 16 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft. Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo. The RAF continued to take a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and strafed while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.|$|E
5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E
50|$|Such {{houses were}} often also freihauses. There were {{frequent}} disputes {{between the people}} of the burglehn and the adjacent town, about whether the inhabitants of these houses could exercise <b>crafts</b> <b>that</b> were otherwise regulated by the town's guilds.|$|R
50|$|The Chalands de débarquement d'infanterie et de chars are two landing <b>crafts</b> <b>that</b> {{operate in}} the French Navy. They are {{designed}} to operate from mother ships such as BPCs (Mistral type) or TCDs (Foudre type), or for coastal support.|$|R
50|$|The town is visited for the {{textiles}} and <b>crafts</b> <b>that</b> its people create. The town has a basic medical clinic (Posta Medica). It {{is connected to}} the provincial capital by a road and by railroad, both about 15 kilometers long.|$|R
5|$|During the Song dynasty {{there was}} also great amount of {{attention}} given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as paddle wheel craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century, and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful paddle wheel warship design of Li Gao. In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had paddle wheel warships constructed {{with a total of}} nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels. However, there were paddle wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured {{on each side of the}} vessel. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103–1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their paddle wheel craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and paddle wheel crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183 the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety paddle wheel craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged paddle wheel craft into junk ships and galleys) not to limit the number of paddle wheel craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> won the Chinese victory at Caishi. However, paddle wheel craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou, the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that paddle wheel ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.|$|E
25|$|The {{next project}} of Jacques Charles and the Robert {{brothers}} {{was to build}} an elongated, steerable <b>craft</b> <b>that</b> followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals (1783–85) for a dirigible balloon. The design incorporated Meusnier's internal ballonnet (air cells), a rudder and a method of propulsion.|$|E
25|$|A {{craftsman}} often {{adopted a}} son {{to learn the}} craft. He profited by the son's labour. If he failed to teach his son the <b>craft,</b> <b>that</b> son could prosecute him and get the contract annulled. This {{was a form of}} apprenticeship, and {{it is not clear whether}} the apprentice had any filial relation.|$|E
50|$|Yanagi's book The Unknown Craftsman {{has become}} an {{influential}} work since its first release in English in 1972. Yanagi's book examines the Japanese way of viewing and appreciating art and beauty in everyday <b>crafts</b> <b>that</b> include pottery, lacquer, textiles, and woodwork.|$|R

25|$|Catarafts are {{constructed}} {{from the same}} materials as rafts. They can either be paddled or rowed with oars.

Oar-propelled catarafts have the occupants sitting on seats mounted on the frame. Virtually all oar-powered catarafts are operated by a boatsman with passengers having no direct responsibilities. Catarafts can be of all sizes; many are smaller and more maneuverable than a typical raft.|$|E
50|$|Exhibits {{include a}} {{handloom}} and a spinning jenny, invented by James Hargreaves.
