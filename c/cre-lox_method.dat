40|$|SummaryMuscle {{regeneration}} declines {{with aging}} and myopathies, and reprogramming of differentiated muscle cells to their progenitors {{can serve as}} a robust source of therapeutic cells. Here, we used the <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>method</b> to specifically label postmitotic primary multinucleated myotubes and then utilized small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases and apoptosis to dedifferentiate these myotubes into proliferating myogenic cells, without gene overexpression. The reprogrammed, fusion competent, muscle precursor cells contributed to muscle regeneration in vitro and in vivo and were unequivocally distinguished from reactivated reserve cells because of the lineage marking method. The small molecule inhibitors downregulated cell cycle inhibitors and chromatin remodeling factors known to promote and maintain the cell fate of myotubes, facilitating cell fate reversal. Our findings enhance understanding of cell-fate determination and create novel therapeutic approaches for improved muscle repair...|$|E
40|$|Retinal laser {{injuries}} are {{often associated with}} aberrant migration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which can cause expansion of the scar {{beyond the confines of}} the original laser burn. In this study, we devised a novel method of laser-induced injury to the RPE layer in mouse models and began to dissect the mechanisms associated with pathogenesis and progression of laser-induced RPE injury. We have hypothesized that the proto-oncogene receptor, c-Met, is intimately involved with migration of RPE cells, and may be an early responder to injury. Using transgenic mouse models, we show that constitutive activation of c-Met induces more robust RPE migration into the outer retina of laser-injured eyes, while abrogation of the receptor using a <b>cre-lox</b> <b>method</b> reduces these responses. We also demonstrate that retinal laser injury increases expression of both HGF and c-Met, and activation of c-Met after injury is correlated with RPE cell migration. RPE migration may be responsible for clinically significant anatomic changes observed after laser injury. Abrogation of c-Met activity may be a therapeutic target to minimize retinal damage from aberrant RPE cell migration...|$|E
40|$|The {{tail of the}} Xenopus tadpole will {{regenerate}} following amputation, and {{all three}} of the main axial structures - the spinal cord, the notochord and the segmented myotomes are found in the regenerated tail. We have investigated the cellular origin of each of these three tissue types during regeneration. We produced Xenopus laevis embryos transgenic for the CMV (Simian Cytomegalovirus) promoter driving GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) ubiquitously throughout the embryo. Single tissues were then specifically labelled by making grafts at the neurula stage from transgenic donors to unlabelled hosts. When the hosts have developed to tadpoles, they carry a region of the appropriate tissue labelled with GFP. These tails were amputated through the labelled region and the distribution of labelled cells in the regenerate was followed. We also labelled myofibres using the <b>Cre-lox</b> <b>method.</b> The results show that the spinal cord and the notochord regenerate from the same tissue type in the stump, with no labelling of other tissues. In the case of the muscle, we show that the myofibres of the regenerate arise from satellite cells and not from the pre-existing myofibres. This shows that metaplasia between differentiated cell types does not occur, and that the process of Xenopus tail regeneration is more akin to tissue renewal in mammals than to urodele tail regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Cited 2 (CBP/p 300 -interacting transactivators with {{glutamic acid}} (E) and aspartic acid (D) -rich tail 2) {{is a member}} of a new family of {{transcriptional}} modulators. Cited 2 null embryos exhibit hyaloid hypercellularity consisting of aberrant vasculature in the eye. The purpose of the study is to address whether abnormal lenticular development is a primary defect of Cited 2 deletion and whether deletion of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α or an HIF- 1 α target gene, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), could rescue abnormal hyaloid vascular system (HVS) in Cited 2 deficient adult eyes. Methods: Le-Cre specific Cited 2 knockout (Cited 2 CKO) mice with or without deletion of HIF- 1 α or VEGF were generated by standard <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>methods.</b> Eyes collected from six-eight weeks old mice were characterized by Real Time PCR and immunohistological staining. Results: Cited 2 CKO mice had smaller lenses, abnormal lens stalk formation, and failed regression of the HVS in the adult eye. The eye phenotype had features similar to persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), a human congenital eye disorder leading to abnormal lenticular development. Deletion of HIF- 1 α or VEGF in Cited 2 knockout eyes partially rescued the abnormal HVS but had no effect on the smaller lens and abnormal lens stalk differentiation. Intravitreal injection of Topotecan (TPT), a compound that inhibits HIF- 1 α expression, partially eliminated HVS defects in Cited 2 CKO lenses...|$|R
40|$|Stem and {{progenitor}} {{cells from}} the adult pancreas could be a potential source of therapeutic beta-like cells for treating patients with type 1 diabetes. However, it is still unknown whether stem and progenitor cells exist in the adult pancreas. Research strategies using cre-lox lineage-tracing in adult mice have yielded results that either support or refute the idea that beta cells can be generated from the ducts, the presumed location where adult pancreatic progenitors may reside. These in vivo <b>cre-lox</b> lineage-tracing <b>methods,</b> however, cannot answer the questions of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation-two criteria necessary to define a stem cell. To begin addressing this technical gap, we devised 3 -dimensional colony assays for pancreatic progenitors. Soon after our initial publication, other laboratories independently developed a similar, but not identical, method called the organoid assay. Compared to the organoid assay, our method employs methylcellulose, which forms viscous solutions that allow the inclusion of extracellular matrix proteins at low concentrations. The methylcellulose-containing assays permit easier detection and analyses of progenitor cells at the single-cell level, which are critical when progenitors constitute a small sub-population, {{as is the case}} for many adult organ stem cells. Together, results from several laboratories demonstrate in vitro self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation of pancreatic progenitor-like cells from mice. The current protocols describe two methylcellulose-based colony assays to characterize mouse pancreatic progenitors; one contains a commercial preparation of murine extracellular matrix proteins and the other an artificial extracellular matrix protein known as a laminin hydrogel. The techniques shown here are 1) dissociation of the pancreas and sorting of CD 133 (+) Sox 9 /EGFP(+) ductal cells from adult mice, 2) single cell manipulation of the sorted cells, 3) single colony analyses using microfluidic qRT-PCR and whole-mount immunostaining, and 4) dissociation of primary colonies into single-cell suspensions and re-plating into secondary colony assays to assess self-renewal or differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} (Nav) {{are responsible}} for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells. The channels isoforms Nav 1. 1, Nav 1. 2, Nav 1. 3 and Nav 1. 6 are dynamically expressed in the developing central nervous system and are essential for proper network function. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SCN 1 A, the gene encoding Nav 1. 1, leads to Dravet Syndrome (DS), a pharmacoresistant infantile-onset epilepsy syndrome with co-morbidities of cognitive impairment and premature death. Previous studies using a mouse model of DS heterozygous for a global deletion of Scn 1 a (Scn 1 a+/-), revealed reduced sodium currents and impaired excitability in GABAergic interneurons. We generated a floxed Scn 1 a mouse line and used the <b>Cre-Lox</b> <b>method</b> driven by an enhancer from the DLX 1, 2 locus to conditionally delete one or both copies of Scn 1 a in forebrain GABAergic neurons. Mice with this specific deletion had selective loss of NaV 1. 1 channels in GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, died prematurely following generalized tonic-clonic seizures, were equally susceptible to thermal induction of seizures as global Scn 1 a+/- mice, and demonstrated impaired cognitive function. Evidently, loss of NaV 1. 1 channels in forebrain GABAergic neurons is sufficient to cause epilepsy, premature death, and cognitive impairments in DS. Initial characterization of the DS mouse revealed a striking strain difference with respect to survival and seizure susceptibility. Studies also found an interneuron-specific increase in Nav 1. 3 with complete loss of Nav 1. 1, suggesting Nav 1. 3 as a possible precipitating factor or genetic modifier in DS. To evaluate the role of Nav 1. 3 in DS progression, we measured channel expression in non-epileptic mouse and human cortical tissue. We found Nav 1. 3 was expressed at high levels in embryonic life and declined after birth coincident with increased NaV 1. 1 channel expression in both species. The onset of seizures in mouse and human follows the developmental decrease in Nav 1. 3 to less than half of its maximal level suggesting that its loss, coupled with failure of normal expression of NaV 1. 1 channels, may contribute to the time of onset of seizures in DS. We tested whether genetic deletion of NaV 1. 3 channels would exacerbate the early phase of DS in mice and found that heterozygous loss of Nav 1. 3 does not lead to impaired survival or increased sensitivity to thermally induced seizures in DS mice. Our results support the hypothesis that declining expression of NaV 1. 3 channels to below 50 % of maximum, in the face of heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the NaV 1. 1 channel, {{may be one of the}} precipitating factors contributing to the time of onset of DS...|$|E
