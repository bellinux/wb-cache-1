40|$|Structural {{materials}} in the reactor pressure vessels are exposed to a harsh environment, resulting {{in a number of}} material degradation processes. Irradiation generates a number of point defects in the atomic structure of a material. In addition, plastic slip localization occurs on the grain level size where highly-deformed narrow bands of material appear already at the moderate strain levels. These bands are called channels or <b>clear</b> <b>bands,</b> because they are almost empty of irradiation defects, whereas the surrounding matrix is still full of them. <b>Clear</b> <b>bands</b> are very thin with a thickness of a few tens of nm. It is thought that these <b>clear</b> <b>bands</b> contribute significantly to yield-stress increase and loss of work-hardening and ductility under irradiation. Additionally, high stress concentrationsare generated at points where <b>clear</b> <b>bands</b> impinge on the grain boundaries, resulting in grain boundary damage and increasing the possibility of intergranular cracking. Continuum-based structural-mechanics models are not able to predict the initiation or the evolution of grain-level plasticslip localization. New approaches like strain-gradient crystal plasticity are being developed to tackle these issues. In the present work a numerical approach is presented where the application of strain-gradient crystal plasticity is extended to aggregates containing up to tens of grains. Plastic slip localization is demonstrated within the corresponding finite-element model. JRC. F. 4 -Innovative Technologies for Nuclear Reactor Safet...|$|R
30|$|The colonies {{were chosen}} for mating process between the haploid strains of S. cerevisiae (MAT-a and MAT-α) for the {{industrial}} ethanol-producing yeast. Conjunction process resulted a strain of S. cerevisiae possessing diploid genetic traits, and was named S. cerevisiae R-control.

50|$|A similar effect {{occurs in}} all the wing feathers, most noticeably in the primary and {{secondary}} wing coverts, {{and also in the}} six tail feathers, which carry a similar <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> on feathers 2 to 6 in the non-Opaline. The first (longest) tail feather of the Opaline also carries a rather blotchy clear area of somewhat variable extent, and the suffusion of body colour present to a small degree in the non-Opaline is intensified in the Opaline.|$|E
50|$|Ophioninae is a {{worldwide}} subfamily of Ichneumonidae with 32 genera, and very rich in tropical regions. They are koinobiont endoparasitoids of larval Lepidoptera, though {{at least one}} species parasitizes Scarabaeidae (Coleoptera). They are among the only Parasitica whose ovipositors {{can be used to}} sting vertebrates. The pupae are ovoid with a central <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> characteristic for this subfamily. Ophionines are typically fairly large, orange, slender insects with compressed, curved abdomens. They have very large ocelli and are active at night, and may be commonly encountered at lights.|$|E

50|$|Clinical {{trials have}} shown the Hall Technique to be effective, however {{it is not an}} easy, quick fix {{solution}} to the problem of carious primary molars. The technique is not suited to every tooth, child or clinician, however it can be an effective method of managing carious primary molars. Hall technique should not be used when there are clinical or radiographic signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis or dental abscess. Radiographically, there should be a <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> of dentine between the carious lesion and pulp for a Hall Technique to be suitable.|$|E
50|$|Adults are {{normally}} 4 to 5 mm long, darker brown with cream-coloured to yellow highlights. The scutellum shows a heart shaped marking, {{while in the}} wings there are two spots. Across the body is present {{a more or less}} visible <b>clear</b> <b>band.</b> This species is quite variable in colour. In springs the basic colour is darker, while the cuneus is bright orange-yellow. The new generation of adults is commonly paler and markings are less pronounced. Head width is about 1/2 of the width of the pronotum. Legs are pale yellowish, striped with black rings. Tibiae show short dark spines.|$|E
5000|$|By 1992, IronMind {{had moved}} all design and {{production}} of its grippers in-house. [...] The next generation of the Silver Crush Grippers, released in 1993, marked the next major step in gripper evolution; their stainless-steel handles replaced the previous chrome-plated mild steel handles, and a new assembly technique eliminated the drift pin central {{to the design of}} the older grippers. IronMind briefly offered a model with a right-hand wind spring, although that design was soon shelved in order to concentrate on the more popular left-hand wind spring. The new design also featured a <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> at the midpoint of each handle, an element of trade dress for IronMind’s grippers ever since.|$|E

50|$|The flight {{feathers}} of the budgerigar consist of 10 primaries and 10 secondaries. These are dark grey {{with a clear}} central band across every feather from the 2nd primary to the 8th secondary. These clear areas are not visible in the folded wing, but form a prominent continuous band running right along the wing when it is stretched out. It is hidden from above by the coverts but is visible from beneath. In the Opaline this <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> is present on every flight feather and is much broader. Only the distal half of the flight feather is dark, with the clear zone extending from the midpoint to the shaft. Because it is broader it is visible in the primaries of the folded wing of the Opaline, just beneath the secondaries and primary wing coverts, as a small clear patch.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDislocation Dynamics {{simulations}} of dislocations gliding across a random populations of Frank loops are presented. Specific local rules are developed to reproduce elementary interaction mechanisms obtained in Molecular Dynamics simulations. It is shown that absorption of Frank loops as helical turns on screw dislocations governs {{the process of}} <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> formation, because: (1) it transforms the loops into jogs on dislocations, (2) when the dislocations unpin, the jogs are transported along the dislocation lines, leading to a progressive clearing of the band and (3) the dislocations are re-emitted in a glide plane different from the initial one, allowing for a broadening of the band. It is also shown that a pile-up of dislocations is needed to form a <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> of finite thicknes...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{statistical}} distribution of {{components in the}} non-perturbative parts of energy eigenfunctions (EFs), in which main bodies of the EFs lie. Our numerical simulations in five models show that deviation of the distribution from the prediction of random matrix theory (RMT) is useful in characterizing the process from nearly-integrable to chaotic, in a way somewhat similar to the nearest-level-spacing distribution. But, the statistics of EFs reveals some more properties, as described below. (i) In the process of approaching quantum chaos, the distribution of components shows a delay feature compared with the nearest-level-spacing distribution {{in most of the}} models studied. (ii) In the quantum chaotic regime, the distribution of components always shows small but notable deviation from the prediction of RMT in models possessing classical unterparts, while, the deviation can be almost negligible in models not possessing classical counterparts. (iii) In models whose Hamiltonian matrices possess a <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> structure, tails of EFs show statistical behaviors obviously different from those in the main bodies, while, the difference is smaller for Hamiltonian matrices without a <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> structure.

40|$|Icosahedral {{band gap}} {{materials}} (BGMs) optimally combine the distinct band gaps of periodic BGMs {{with the high}} rotational symmetry of quasiperiodic structures. This is shown experimentally for longitudinal and transverse polarized elastic waves in a phononic crystal based on the three-dimensional Penrose tiling (3 D-PT) and applies equally to photonic crystals. The ability of icosahedral BGMs to form Bragg-type band gaps follows from the similarity between the 3 D-PT and the face-centered cubic structure (its periodic average structure). The 3 D quasiperiodic BGM lacks bands of strong transmission like random or disordered BGMs but shows <b>clear</b> <b>band</b> gaps like periodic BGMs do. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.
