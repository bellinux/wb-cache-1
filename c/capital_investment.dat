40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the association between}} CEO reputation and corporate <b>capital</b> <b>investments.</b> The efficient contracting hypothesis predicts a positive association between CEO reputation and wealth effects of corporate <b>capital</b> <b>investments.</b> In contrast, the rent extraction hypothesis predicts that the wealth effects of <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> are negatively associated with CEO reputation. We find that the stock market's responses to announcements of <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> are more favorable for firms with more reputable CEOs. Moreover, CEO reputation mitigates the negative stock price reaction associated with announcements of <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> by firms with high free cash flow and low growth opportunities. Additional analysis indicates that firms with more reputable CEOs exhibit significantly better post-investment operating performance improvements than those with less reputable CEOs, especially in firms with high free cash flow and low growth opportunities.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{trends in}} U. S. venture <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> {{over the period}} 1980 through {{the second quarter of}} calendar year 2010 (2010 Q 1 +Q 2). Particular attention is given to U.

During the early 1980 s, U. S. venture <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> in the energy/industrial sector accounted for more than 20 % of all venture <b>capital</b> <b>investments.</b> However subsequent periods of low energy prices, the deregulation of large aspects of the energy industry, and the emergence of fast growing new industries like computers (both hardware and software), biotechnology and the Internet quickly reduced the priority accorded to energy/industrial investments. To wit, venture <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> related to the energy/industrial sector accounted for only 1 % of the $ 119 billion dollars invested in 2000 by the U. S. venture capital community. The significant increase in the real price of oil that began in 2003 - 2004 correlates with renewed interest and increased investment by the venture capital community in energy/industrial <b>investment</b> opportunities. Venture <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> for 2009 for the energy/industrial sector accounted for $ 2. 1 billion or slightly more than 13 % of all venture capital invested that year. The total venture capital invested in energy/industrial during the first two quarters of 2010 is close to $ 1. 8 billion accounting for 17 % of all venture <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> during the first two quarters of 2010. In 2009, the aggregate amount invested in CleanTech was $ 1. 8 billion (30 % of the total US venture capital invested in that lean year) and for the first two quarters of 2010 US venture <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> in CleanTech have already exceeded $ 1. 9 billion (19 % of all US venture <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> made during the first half of 2010).

5|$|The {{economy of}} Tripura can be characterised by {{high rate of}} poverty, low capital formation, {{inadequate}} infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood.

By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars) and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor. A $100,000 <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> was made that year and it was incorporated.

The ZX80 had proved {{more popular than}} {{expected}} and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources {{to deal with the}} demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra £20 ROM chip into the circuit board.|$|E
