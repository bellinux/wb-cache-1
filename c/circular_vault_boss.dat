50|$|Inside, the wide, aisleless nave is {{lit by the}} {{clerestory}} {{windows with}} grisaille glass. At night, {{the lights on the}} Flamboyant tracery of the clerestory windows are a lovely sight. There is a neo-Gothic openwork screen from 1844 around the chancel which demarcates it from the ambulatory. The stained glass in the choir is from the 19th century. This cathedral was famous for its sumptuous 16th century liturgy, and for its organ of 1605 at the west end. This is commemorated in the choir <b>vault</b> <b>bosses</b> with figures of angel musicians. The original pulpit with its delicately carved stone baldaquin is still in place.

50|$|The {{church of}} Saint Maurice is the parish {{church of the}} town, going thru several {{architectural}} evolutions. The oldest portion, the bell tower, is Romanesque, dating {{from the beginning of}} the 12th century. The nave and the choir both date from the end of the 12th century or beginning of the 13th, with Angevin Gothic style vaults. This style can be found in the Angevin territories, but not restricted to them. The vault is fairly bulbous in form, marked by very ornate sculptured and painted <b>vault</b> <b>bosses,</b> at the junction of the ribs and the capitols at the rib springs. A chapel from the 15th and a side aisle from the early 16th century mark the transition from Flamboyant Gothic to Renaissance architecture. The church was repainted in the 19th century, inspired by the restoration of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, and received new stained glass windows commissioned from the Atelier Lobin in Tours.|$|R

50|$|The {{south and}} west fronts, facing the streets, were built in Italianate style from Portland stone, with four floors, {{measuring}} 112 ft wide and 61 ft high. At the southwest corner was an unusual high semi-circular portico with Doric columns and entablature, surmounted by a tower of Portland stone 109 ft high, with a conical roof topped by a gilt ball. Within the tower was a staircase providing access to the upper floors. The ground floor portico provided access to an entrance vestibule leading to a large central <b>circular</b> <b>vaulted</b> hall. The central rotunda was 60 ft in diameter, with a wooden floor inlaid with a large mariner's compass.

40|$|Abstract. The ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coils {{are made}} up of a winding pack {{enclosed}} in a case. In the central region the noses of the coils are wedge shaped and fit together to form a <b>circular</b> <b>vault.</b> On the outside an intercoil support structure joins the coil above and below the equator. The goal of the ITER project L 2 is to verify the design principles, design procedures, design criteria, operating margins, analysis methods and manufacturing process, including Quality Assurance (QA) capable of application to the ITER TF coils. The project is divided into two subprojects: TF Model Coil (TFMC) construction and testing and TF coil case fabrication demonstration. The conceptual design of the ITER TFMC has been carried out by the ITER EU HT, the engineering design and construction by European Industries. The testing of the TFMC is foreseen in the TOSKA facility at FZK Karlsruhe starting {{in the first quarter of}} 2001. The feasibility demonstration of the TF coil case is being carried out also by European industry by: Forging trapezoidal tubes with variable wall thickness, casting new modified 316 LN type material for the intercoil structure and the parts of the case subject to lower stresses, qualifying the welding and NDT methods to be applied to the heavy thickness (~ 250 mm) to be joined together to form the casing. 1.

50|$|The chancel has a rose window, reputedly {{modelled}} on {{the much}} larger one in Old St Paul's Cathedral (destroyed in the Great Fire).

50|$|A. F. Livesay of Portsmouth was {{appointed}} as architect. Other works of his included the recently completed Holy Spirit Church, Newtown, on the Isle of Wight. Livesay’s design {{is in the}} Early English architectural style, {{and is based on}} elements of Salisbury Cathedral, including the <b>vaulting</b> and <b>bosses</b> of the north and south aisles in the Cathedral. The church was built of poor-quality Westwood stone,http://projects.bre.co.uk/ConDiv/stonelist/westwood2.html with the interior having iron and plaster columns (the plaster painted to mimic marble such as the Purbeck marble of Salisbury cathedral’s columns), and plaster scribed with false ashlar blocks to mimic high-quality stonework in the vaulting and walls. There were four porches, one of which (the south porch, the main entrance to the church nowadays) is situated under an embattled tower. The windows were originally plain, clear glass.|$|R
50|$|Finally, the Perpendicular style (so-called {{because the}} {{mullions}} and transoms were vertical and horizontal) allowed huge windows, often filled with stained glass. The style, so described runs from about 1330, initially {{in parallel with}} the Decorated style, until 1530. Sometimes criticised as over formal, the spaces allowing for glass were huge. Another feature was that doorways were often enclosed by squared mouldings and the spaces between the moulding and the door arch - called spandrels were decorated with quadrifoils etc. Ornate stone ceilings, using so-called fan vaulting, made for huge unsupported spaces. King's College Chapel, Cambridge has magnificent specimens of these. Meanwhile, the Lady Chapel of Ely Cathedral has an unsupported stone ceiling approximately 30 feet by 80 feet, using a star formation of lierne <b>vaults</b> and <b>bosses.</b>|$|R

40|$|Anneli Randla: Medieval painted {{decoration}} in St Michael’sin Mihkli, EstoniaKeywords: medieval murals, church decoration, paint research, {{technical studies}} of artSummary:Recent {{studies in the}} medieval St Michael’s Church in Mihkli, in western Estonia, {{have shown that the}} stone church was  constructed in two stages: at first a simple building with wooden ceiling was erected, and at a later date (possibly around 1500) stone vaulting was added over the first chancel and the nave. In August 2013, preliminary investigations were undertaken to study the painted decoration of the inner walls and vaults of the church. The small sample areas uncovered were sufficient to reveal several historical colour schemes. The richest decorationis contemporary with the first plastering of the vaults since the plaster was still moist when the paint was applied. The decoration is vernacular in character and its aim is to enhance the architectural features of the building. Thus the ribs and corbels of the vaults are painted but the decoration is extended to flat surfaces as well. For example painted pendants in grey and red adorn the ends of the ribs of the eight-partite vault of the chancel. The largest composition was discovered in the  eastern bay of the nave around the <b>vault</b> <b>boss.</b> An irregular eight-petalled red flower is formed around the boss with a cross on it. These paintings might have been executed by local church builders rather than by professional craftsmen. CV :Anneli Randla earned her PhD in art history at the University ofCambridge in 1999.

It is a faithful reproduction of the altar of the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament in the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of the Redemptorist Fathers. In the chapel at the end of the left aisle it is preserved a valuable painting depicting the Immaculate Conception, attributed to the great seventeenth-century painter Mattia Preti, born in Taverna, which presumably left even his self-portrait in a corner of the canvas.
