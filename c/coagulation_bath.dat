Further, by altering the composition of the bath in a step-wise fashion during a single spinning run, variations in all other process parameters were minimized. We found that with increasing solvent composition in the <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath,</b> the fibers not only became round in cross section, but also became smaller in diameter, which persisted down the spin line. With this decrease in diameter, all else equal, came an accompanying increase in apparent fiber density via a reduction in microvoid content.

For comparison, PS membranes were fabricated in pure water and GO containing <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath,</b> respectively. The synthesized membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle goniometry, tensile strength measurement, etc. The hydrophilicity of the PS membranes increased with the increasing of GO concentration. Compared to the PS membranes synthesized in pure water <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath,</b> the skin layer of the PS/GO membranes synthesized in GO containing water <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath</b> was also thicker, which in turn influenced the separation performance. For example, the flux of the PS/GO membrane synthesized in GO solution (20 mg/L, PS/GO- 20) decreased by 75. 1 %. However, the PS/GO membranes had better tensile strength (from 2. 31 to 2. 87 MPa) and tensile modulus (from 237. 86 to 258. 47 MPa) compared with PS membrane, although the membrane integrity was destroyed to some extent due to the incorporation of GO nanosheets.

40|$|Sulfur dioxide (SO 2) is a {{very toxic}} air {{pollutant}} gas and it causes the greenhouse effect, photochemical smog, and acid rain, which threaten human health severely. Thus, the capture of SO 2 gas {{is very important for}} the environment. Graphene which is two-dimensional material has excellent mechanical, chemical, thermal properties, and many application areas such as energy storage devices, gas adsorption, sensing devices, and optical electronics. Further, graphene oxide (GO) is examined as a good adsorbent because of its important features such as functional groups (epoxy, carboxyl and hydroxyl) on the surface and layered structure. The SO 2 adsorption properties of the fibers are usually investigated on carbon fibers. In this study, potential adsorption capacity of GO fibers was researched. GO dispersion was first obtained with Hummers’ method from graphite, and then GO fibers were obtained via wet spinning process. These fibers were converted into a disc shape, dried, and then subjected to SO 2 gas adsorption test. The SO 2 gas adsorption capacity of GO fiber discs was investigated in the fields of utilization of different <b>coagulation</b> <b>baths</b> and reduction by hydrazine hydrate. As <b>coagulation</b> <b>baths,</b> single and triple baths were used. In single bath, only ethanol and CaCl 2 (calcium chloride) salt were added. In triple bath, each bath has a different concentration of water/ethanol and CaCl 2 salt, and the disc obtained from triple bath has been called as reference disk. The fibers which were produced with single bath were flexible and rough, and the analyses show that they had higher SO 2 adsorption capacity than triple bath fibers (reference disk). However, the reduction process did not increase the adsorption capacity, because the SEM images showed that the layers and uniform structure in the fiber form were damaged, and reduction decreased the functional groups which SO 2 will be attached.

Based on rheological and polarized optical microscopy investigations, a rational relation between GO sheet size and polydispersity, concentration, liquid crystallinity, and spinnability is proposed, leading to an understanding of lyotropic LC behavior and fiber spinnability. The knowledge gained from the straightforward formulation of LC GO “inks” in a range of processable concentrations enables the spinning of continuous conducting, strong, and robust fibers at concentrations as low as 0. 075 wt%, eliminating the need for relatively concentrated spinning dope dispersions. The dilute LC GO dispersion is proven to be suitable for fiber spinning using a number of coagulation strategies, including non-solvent precipitation, dispersion destabilization, ionic cross-linking, and polyelectrolyte complexation.

It eased the fabrication process and produced the PAN/AM fibers with better mechanical properties. The PAN/AM fibers produced at <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath</b> temperature of 13 Â°C exhibited the excellent mechanical properties. At the <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath</b> temperature of 13 Â°C, the inward diffusion of non-solvent was still slow and consequendy reduced the number of micro-pores and fit for the drawing process. The ratio of carbon fiber to precursor modulus (Ec/Ep) was calculated to be about 16. 5, which was relatively acceptable value as published elsewhere. It can be concluded that the PAN precursor fibers were successfully produce in the solvent-free coagulalion process which possessed competitive mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{asymmetric}} pure CA and CA / TiO 2 nanocomposite membranes {{were prepared}} via phase inversion by dispersing TiO 2 nanoparticles in the CA casting solutions induced by immersion precipitation in water <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath.</b> TiO 2 nanoparticles, which were synthesized by the sonochemical method, were added into the casting solution at different concentrations. Effects of TiO 2 nanoparticles concentration (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mass%) and <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath</b> temperature (CBT, 25, 50 and 75 °C) on morphology, thermal stability and pure water flux (PWF) of the prepared membranes were studied and dis-cussed. Increasing TiO 2 {{concentration in the}} casting solution film along with higher CBT resulted in increasing the membrane thickness, water content (WC), membrane porosity and pure water flux (PWF). Also, these changes facilitate macrovoids formation. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that thermal stability of the nanocomposite membranes was improved by the addi-tion of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, TGA results indicated that increasing CBT in each TiO 2 concentration leads to the decreasing of decomposition temperature (Td) of nanocomposite membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of solvent {{out of a}} cast cellulose acetate (CA) solution into the <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath</b> during membrane formation is treated as a diffusion process. From the increase of solvent concentration in the bath with time (solvent leaching experiments) an overall solvent diffusion coefficient has been calculated. In size these coefficients compare well to mutual pseudo-binary solvent-non-solvent diffusion coefficients determined {{by means of a}} classical boundary broadening method applied to ternary solutions with fixed CA concentration, but with a gradient in solvent-nonsolvent composition. Since binary polymer-solvent interdiffusion coefficients are at least one order of magnitude lower, it is concluded that the diffusion of solvent into the <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath</b> is essentially a pseudo-binary solvent-non-solvent diffusion process. Combination of experimental results with model calculations for the effect of a thin dense skin on the diffusion of solvent out of the sublayer shows that the casting-leaching diffusion coefficient can be used to describe the out-diffusion of solvent from the layer under the skin provided that the relative skin resistance is not too high, or that the skin thickness is small...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Polysulfone Flat {{ultrafiltration}} membranes {{were prepared}} with dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as solvent and polyvinypyrrolidone (PVP) as pore forming additive. Performance of PSF membrane such as pure water flux, albumin egg rejection were investigated. In addition, the same investigations {{were conducted with}} different <b>coagulation</b> <b>bath</b> temperature and evaporation time. The results show {{that there were a}} maximum of pure water flux and a minimum of the retention of Albumin when PVP content reach 14 %...|$|E
