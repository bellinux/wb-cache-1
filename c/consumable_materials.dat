40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe Consumable Asset Reutilization Program (CARP) is an {{organization}} established under Naval Supply Systems Command to provide a specific warehousing service for excess material generated by commands operating under the Navy Working Capital Fund. This warehousing service would receive excess <b>consumable</b> <b>material</b> that had possible future demand, and hold that material until demand on that item was realized. Annually, CARP processes approximately 70, 000 excess offload transactions from aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, and naval air stations. Of the three, aircraft carriers are the largest customer of this service. This MBA project employs exploratory research to empirically analyze material that is offloaded from aircraft carriers to CARP, and to identify drivers of the high volume of excess <b>consumable</b> <b>material</b> that is generated on-board aircraft carrier inventories. This project proposes policy-level changes to both the allowancing and offload processes for aircraft carriers, and, through statistical modeling and analysis, estimates the outcomes of these changes on inventories and costs.

In addition, we planned to do a performance analysis of the Registration Project of Type 1 diabetes for the reimbursement of <b>consumable</b> <b>materials.</b> MethodsTo obtain nationwide data on the incidence and prevalence of T 1 DM, we extracted claims data from July 2011 to August 2013 from the Registration Project of Type 1 diabetes on the reimbursement of <b>consumable</b> <b>materials</b> in the National Health Insurance (NHI) Database. For a more detailed analysis of the T 1 DM population in Korea, stratification by gender, age, and area was performed, and prevalence and incidence were calculated. ResultsOf the 8, 256 subjects enrolled over the 26 months, the male to female ratio was 1 to 1. 12, the median age was 37. 1 years, and an average of 136 new T 1 DM patients were registered to the T 1 DM registry each month, resulting in 1, 632 newly diagnosed T 1 DM patients each year. We found that the incidence rate of new T 1 DM cases was 3. 28 per 100, 000 people. The average proportion of T 1 DM patients compared with each region's population was 0. 0125 %. The total number of insurance subscribers under the universal compulsory NHI in Korea was 49, 662, 097, and the total number of diabetes patients, excluding duplication, was 3, 762, 332.
