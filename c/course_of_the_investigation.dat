The Fringe Team investigates the object that arrived in Brooklyn, a cylinder that is determined to vibrate at a particular frequency.

Namdhari’s {{personal}} Security Officer (PSO) Sachin Tyagi’s name also came up during <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigations.</b> Tyagi in touch with Namdhari since January 2012 and during <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> <b>the</b> shootout alluded to being a ‘well-hatched conspiracy.’ Tyagi was arrested on 3 December 2012.

The case still remains under trial. Namdhari and Sachin Tyagi were cleared <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IPC 302 and murder charges were dropped and are being tried for IPC 304 which is culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The shooting was not premeditated and no conspiracy was found.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigations</b> by <b>the</b> {{auditing}} firm Ernst & Young, a few {{financial transactions}} {{could not be}} satisfactorily explained.

25|$|The Department for Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) {{investigated}} the accident, with the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Boeing and Rolls-Royce also participating.

25|$|In the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation,</b> {{it emerged}} that Bank Leu was {{involved}} in half of the purchases.

50|$|Pelle {{disappeared}} from the radar screen until 1989 when several indictments were issued against him. The indictments charged Pelle for kidnapping, money laundering and mafia conspiracy together with 49 others such as the high ranking 'Ndrangheta bosses Sebastiano Romeo from San Luca, Giuseppe Morabito from Africo, Pasquale Barbaro and others. Several clans formed a single entity, known as the Anonima sequestri dell’Aspromonte, that had been responsible for a string <b>of</b> kidnappings in <b>the</b> 1980s.

25|$|On December 5, 2008, the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal {{held that}} her {{statements}} {{were taken in}} violation of her Miranda rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement because the police would have inevitably {{found it in the}} normal <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009.

25|$|Another {{example is}} the high profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were {{committed}} by members of Charles Manson's cult and {{came to be known}} as Helter Skelter. During the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investigation</b> into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. On January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.|$|E

Eduardo Balarezo of Washington, D.C. [...] Balarezo filed multiple motions on Jones' behalf, including the motion to suppress the GPS data. [...] This motion formed the basis for Jones' appeals. [...] The government tried Jones {{for the first time in}} late 2006, and after a trial lasting over a month, a federal jury deadlocked on the conspiracy charge and acquitted him of multiple other counts.

Also, although the sensitive spots were quite definitely localised, Head, who sat through the tests with his eyes closed, was unable to gain any exact appreciation of the locus of stimulation. Quite the contrary, the sensations radiated widely, and Head tended to refer them to places remote from the actual point of stimulation.|$|E
