Although the total whip would weigh {{only a fraction of}} a naval rope cat, the thin, dense <b>codline</b> tresses were far more likely to cut the skin.|$|E

60|$|Like Uncle Parker, whose rheumatic {{bones were}} dashed against Egg Rock full forty years ago, I am a spinner of long yarns. Seated on the gunnel of a dory {{or on the}} sunny side of a boat-house, where the warmth is {{grateful}} to my limbs, or by my own hearth when a friend or two are there, I overflow with talk, and yet am never tedious. With a broken voice I give utterance to much wisdom. Such, Heaven be praised! is the vigor of my faculties that many a forgotten usage, and traditions ancient in my youth, and early adventures of myself or others hitherto effaced by things more recent, acquire new distinctness in my memory. I remember the happy days when the haddock were more numerous on all the fishing-grounds than sculpins in the surf--when the deep-water cod swam close in-shore, and the dogfish, with his poisonous horn, had not learnt to take the hook. I can number every equinoctial storm in which the sea has overwhelmed the street, flooded the cellars of the village and hissed upon our kitchen hearth. I give {{the history of the}} great whale that was landed on Whale Beach, and whose jaws, being now my gateway, will last for ages after my coffin shall have passed beneath them. Thence it is an easy digression to the halibut--scarcely smaller than the whale--which ran out six <b>codlines</b> and hauled my dory to the mouth of Boston harbor before I could touch him with the gaff.|$|R
