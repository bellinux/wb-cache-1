40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the impact of two fining agents (bentonite and gelatine) on the {{coloured}} matters of young red wines Vranac, Pinot Noir and Gamay Noir. Both agents caused decrease in these substances. The effect is more intensive with the dose of bentonite of 1 g/L, but the variability depends on variety. Higher decrease was found in the colour intensity, coloured anthocyanins and polymers (up to 44 %), but lower in the colourless anthocyanins (up to 20 %). The intensity of red and blue colours decreases, while that of yellow colour increases. The use of bentonite in dosages higher than those recommended may cause the wine to obtain more pronounced »brick red« colour (the <b>colour</b> <b>tint</b> increases while the value of the spectrum form decreases). Fewer changes occurred in the coloured matters after treating the wine with gelatine. The colour intensity, colourless and coloured anthocyanins showed a decrease of up to 10 % and polymers of up to 16 %. The intensity of yellow colour decreases, while that of red increases as well as the ΔA/% value...|$|E
50|$|After the film's {{commercial}} failure, {{the negative}} disappeared, {{and until the}} 1980s it was largely known through incomplete and poor quality copies. In 1986 the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique made a first restoration of the film using material held in Brussels, Amsterdam and Lausanne, together with some material already restored by the Cinémathèque française. This version lacked intertitles and <b>colour</b> <b>tinting.</b> In 1993 the Belgian and French cinematheques were assisted by Gosfilmofond (Moscow) and Nederlands Filmmuseum (Amsterdam) in a new restoration which added <b>colour</b> <b>tinting.</b> In 2004 Lobster Films (Paris) completed the restoration using digital technology to reduce spots and marks in the images, and the original French intertitles were restored. A new score (for octet) was commissioned from Antonio Coppola.|$|R

30|$|Contrast {{resolution}} {{settings are}} the primary factors that influence the assessment of nodule consistency, reflectivity and the detection of echogenic foci due to calcium or colloid. Whilst broader bandwidths allow improved beam penetration in the neck, the majority of advances in this aspect of thyroid ultrasound relate to how the echoes are received and processed rather than the pulse transmission. Signal processing (also known as speckle reduction) techniques are designed to interrogate lines of echoes obtained on each frame and improve the signal-to-noise ratio by pattern recognition [5]. For example, an anechoic area containing background noise will be recognised as a cystic structure and the abrupt change in echoes around the margins of this target then recognised as the cyst/vessel wall (e.g., Precision ImagingTM, Toshiba). This process of removing unwanted noise leads to images that look sharper because of the improved signal-to-noise ratio and emphasise cystic vs. solid consistency. The dynamic range and grey-scale map are inherently linked but different aspects of high-resolution ultrasound. The dynamic range controls the range of grey (or the preferred <b>colour</b> <b>tint)</b> that is available to display echo intensity, whilst the grey-scale map allocates which parts of this spectrum are used to represent the echo signals received [6]. Tissue harmonic imaging (THI)—an established technique for improving image contrast at other body sites—has recently become more relevant to high-frequency ultrasound. As {{the basis of this}} technique is to receive a signal from the second harmonic frequency of the probe’s transmit pulse (i.e., twice the probe transmit frequency), its use in superficial structures has been limited [7]. However, the advent of wider bandwidths and more sophisticated receive technology means that THI is increasingly available to use with high-frequency probes (e.g., Hitachi High definition dynamic THI) resulting in further removal of clutter/noise and improved tissue contrast. Basic ultrasound settings (focal zones, time gain control, etc.) also affect image quality but are not covered in this article.|$|E
40|$|Three {{treatments}} {{were tested}} on blacklip pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera, during the bead insertion process {{as part of}} research to improve the efficiency of round pearl culture. The oysters (100 to 150 mm shell height) were maintained on a commercial farm at Manihiki atoll, Cook Islands. The three treatments were: (1) immersion of the oysters in 2 ml/l propylene phenoxetol for 15 min to relax them before operating; (2) disinfection of the operation site with an antiseptic (1 : 50 aqueous dilution of 10 % povidone iodine solution); and (3) closure of the surgical incision with a flexible cyanoacrylate adhesive. The three treatments were applied or not applied to oysters in a 3 -factor arrangement to give eight treatment combinations. The treatment combinations were applied to two groups of oysters: Group I, consisting of 96 oysters (12 sets× 8 treatment combinations), and Group II, consisting of 768 oysters (12 sets× 8 treatment combinations× 8 oysters per set). After 6 weeks, all oysters were inspected for mortality and bead rejection, and Group I oysters were sacrificed. Group I oysters were necropsied and checked {{for the presence of}} pearl sacs. After 18 months, the pearls from Group II oysters were harvested and graded for quality; scoring for lustre, surface perfection, main <b>colour,</b> <b>tint,</b> shape, diameter, length and weight. Inserted beads ranged from 6. 3 – 7. 8 mm diameter and their size was not correlated significantly with shell size. Relaxant use was associated with significantly higher mortality in both Groups of oysters and total failures (deaths+bead rejections) in Group II oysters compared with controls. Relaxant use was also associated with pearls of significantly lighter weight, i. e., with lower nacre secretion, further suggesting that there was an adverse effect from this treatment. Adhesive use was associated with more deaths (significant in Group II) and with more bead rejections (significant in Group I). Adhesive use, however, had a positive effect on pearl quality through improved shape. Seventy-six of the 78 Group I oysters that retained beads for 6 weeks had formed pearl sacs, but 55 of the beads (71 %) already had imperfections in the form of projecting calcified ‘tails' from the bead. Histological examination showed that the ‘tails' enclosed accumulations of inflammatory cells in the incision pathway. Adhesive use significantly reduced the prevalence of beads with ‘tails', apparently by better closing the incision pathway. The reduction in ‘tails' at 6 weeks was reflected in a significant reduction in the mean length/diameter ratio of pearls at harvest, i. e., a higher level of symmetry. This was the only significant, positive effect of the three treatments on pearl quality parameters. Antiseptic application to the operation site had no significant effect on mortality, bead rejection rate or ‘tail' formation. However, antiseptic was the only treatment that resulted in a lower percentage of total failures compared to controls. Inflammatory cells, arising from suspected bacterial infections, were associated with failures to produce a pearl sac and the ‘tails' imperfection. Better hygiene with beads, instruments, cloths, cutting boards and graft tissue should control infection levels. The additional times taken to apply the three treatments of this study were not excessive and encourage further innovative approaches to the bead insertion proces...|$|E

50|$|Science fiction films {{appeared}} {{very early}} in the silent film era. The initial attempts were short films of typically 1 to 2 minutes in duration, shot in black and white, but sometimes with <b>colour</b> <b>tinting.</b> These usually had a technological theme, and were often intended to be humorous. Le Voyage dans la Lune, created by Georges Méliès in 1902 is often considered to be the first science fiction film. It drew upon Jules Verne and H. G.

Roscoe Scandwell, grandfather, was pure white; Martha three-quarters white; the many sons and daughters of them seven-eighths white; the grandchildren graded up to fifteen-sixteenths white, or, in the cases when their seven-eighths fathers and mothers had married seven-eighths, themselves fourteen-sixteenths or seven-eighths white. On both sides the stock was good, Roscoe straight descended from the New England Puritans, Martha no less straight descended from the royal chief-stocks of Hawaii whose genealogies were chanted in males a thousand years before written speech was acquired.|$|R
