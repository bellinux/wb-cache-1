40|$|Cloud {{computing}} has {{the advantage}} of converting capital expenses into operational costs. This student thesis evaluates a phase driven methodology for migration of the database layer to the Cloud based on a research case study. In addition, a <b>Cloud</b> data <b>migration</b> tool is evaluated. We build an evaluation design for the methodology and the tool. Based on the methodology {{and with the help of}} the <b>Cloud</b> data <b>migration</b> tool, an application from the e-Science field is migrated to Amazon Web Services. During the migration project we collect data and document all shortcomings concerning the methodology and the tool. This evaluation data is afterwards analysed, to see how well the methodology and the tool support the migration. The results of the analysis lead to improvement suggestions on the methodology and the <b>Cloud</b> data <b>migration</b> tool...|$|R
30|$|The key goal of our {{approach}} is to accurately estimate <b>cloud</b> database <b>migration</b> cost and duration. This would enable different migration options and parameters to be evaluated, therefore supporting decision-making. We measured the {{achievement of this goal}} by comparing our predictions against (1) real <b>cloud</b> database <b>migrations</b> and (2) cost calculators from the cloud providers [48, 49]. The database migrations used a closed-source system from our industrial partner Science Warehouse [9] and the open-source ERP System Apache OFBiz [50].|$|R

50|$|A way to {{mitigate}} <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> difficulties is to architect {{applications for the}} cloud that reduce or eliminate the dependencies between the cloud application stack and {{the capabilities of the}} cloud service provider. Another way is to select only generic and higher-level applications to move to the cloud in the first place. Another method is to select open standards for cloud computing.|$|E
30|$|Internal {{validity}} threats can {{originate from}} how the experiments were performed, and from {{bias in the}} interpretation of the results. To mitigate against these threats, we repeated the experiments prone to such bias (i.e., the database migration simulations with MigSim and the DBLModeller performance results) over 20 independent runs. The code, experimental data, and results are publicly available in our GitHub repositories at [12] for DBLModeller and [13] for MigSim to enable replication. While the real-world <b>cloud</b> database <b>migrations</b> used to evaluate our estimated migration cost and duration were small-scale, we have referenced much larger <b>cloud</b> <b>migrations</b> when interpreting the experimental results. It {{should also be noted that}} migrating databases from ERP systems is an expensive and time consuming process. While we made full use of our systems by migrating them twice, experiments on other systems should performed to confirm our encouraging findings.|$|R

Next to relational database management systems this methodology also supports NoSQL data stores, BLOB stores and content delivery networks. Using the generic methodology a <b>Cloud</b> data <b>migration</b> tool was developed which supports the decision process of selecting a Cloud data store and helps refactoring the application architecture by suggesting Cloud data patterns and potential adaptions of the network, data access and application layer. Finally the migration tool is able to copy data from a source system like MySQL server to a target system like Amazon RDS (MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle), Azure SQL Database and Amazon SimpleDB...|$|R
30|$|Both {{databases}} (Science Warehouse and OFBiz) were migrated twice: {{from the}} existing cloud platform to a new cloud platform, then back again. This provided two data points per system for our evaluation. While we used public clouds as the source and target infrastructure, our approach can also be applied to in-house to <b>cloud</b> <b>migrations.</b> The Amazon Database Migration Service was used as middleware to perform both migrations. Additionally, the Science Warehouse migration required a VPN between the two clouds to secure the data during transfer.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> {{challenges}} {{that have been}} cited include security, vendor management and technical integration. Security experts have raised the issue that because public clouds are multi-tenant (see: Multitenancy), meaning that the cloud provider hosts data from many different user organizations, opening up security risks. Vulnerabilities or defects in one organization's applications could negatively affect other applications hosted by the same service provider.|$|E

A September 2012 Inspector General report found the savings and cost analysis not verifiable and recommended GSA update its cost analysis. GSA office of CIO was unable to provide documentation supporting its analysis regarding the initial projected savings for government staffing and contractor support.

30|$|Three crucial {{pieces of}} {{information}} when migrating a database to the <b>cloud</b> are duration, <b>migration</b> cost, and future running costs. A detailed understanding of each allows an organisation to choose between cloud providers and different migration methods (e.g., Internet versus HDD shipping). Existing cloud cost calculators and approaches do not consider a system’s current and future workload. They rely on a user accurately matching their workload to the advertised cloud resources. Their accuracy is therefore limited in real-world use. To address this gap, we developed a two-stage approach for evaluating <b>cloud</b> database <b>migration</b> options.|$|R
40|$|Moving workloads on to cloud, {{promises}} to be an attractive investment for enterprises planning for a sustainable IT landscape. However, leveraging the existing IT investment of an organization and moving {{them over to the}} cloud environment with minimum business disruption and costs, seems to be the biggest challenge in adopting cloud based modernization. Enterprise workloads move into cloud delivery models with varying levels of transformation effort, return on investment and productivity gains. Like any transformation effort, <b>migration</b> to <b>cloud</b> can also be viewed as a phased transition/journey. In this respect, studying the various migration patterns, it is found that a common theme emerges that have been depicted in this paper. The authors have illustrated an approach that takes a portfolio view of applications and assesses highest degree of cloud affinity considerations that includes complexity of the selected workloads, target environment, organization maturity etc. The paper also discusses the taxonomy of <b>cloud</b> <b>migrations</b> and the overall migration mode...|$|R
30|$|We employ {{simulation}} {{to estimate}} these migration values {{because of the}} large number of variables associated with <b>cloud</b> database <b>migrations,</b> and the complexity of their relationships. These variables include the source database workload, workload growth, database size, cloud instance performance, and cloud usage charges. In particular, the database workload and cloud instance performance are stochastic variables [33 – 35] which meant we ruled-out a model transformation/query to obtain results directly from the models.|$|R

30|$|Need {{for more}} results on <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> {{evaluation}} - By observing {{the results on}} <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> in the selected studies one can clearly identify {{the need for more}} and more results and real-time case studies from industries on <b>cloud</b> <b>migration.</b> More evaluation, survey and experience reports on legacy-to-cloud migration will be needed, which will result in more trust and confidence of researchers regarding the validity of <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> research.|$|E
30|$|Solutions {{to address}} Security Concerns – As per the {{distribution}} of studies based on the 5 -Phase model for <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> (Figure  4), {{the main focus of}} the research is on the requirement analysis and <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> planning (approx. 38 %), however very few of them address the security concerns hovering over the <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> (discussed in Section 5.4).|$|E
30|$|In this work, we {{assist with}} this {{decision-making}} process via a tool-supported approach for evaluating <b>cloud</b> database <b>migration</b> options. Our approach has two stages—database workload and structure modelling, and database migration simulation—and estimates migration duration, migration costs, and future cloud running costs.We assume {{the source and}} target databases have an identical: schema, type (e.g., relational or NoSQL), vendor (e.g., Oracle or MySQL), and software version. Changing any of these parameters is a complex activity, which organisations tend to perform separately (as discussed in “Approach overview” section).|$|R
30|$|Strauch et al. [60, 61] {{propose a}} novel {{methodology}} for migrating the database {{of an existing}} system to the cloud. It focuses on complex migrations where significant quantities of data exist, and the software components remain on physical in-house servers. The strengths of this methodology include its level of detail, the evaluation with large real-world systems (SimTech SWfMS and NovaERM), and the accompanying <b>Cloud</b> Data <b>Migration</b> Tool. As a result, many organisations could easily employ it to migrate their databases. Our approach complements this methodology by accurately predicting database migration and deployment costs.|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} and tools require both databases to be identical {{apart from the}} data. Changing the database version, schema (e.g., to modernise its design), or database type (e.g., relational to NoSQL) are significant independent challenges [19 – 21] and {{outside the scope of}} our work. We expect many organisations to perform separate projects for <b>cloud</b> database <b>migration</b> and data conversion. Our industrial partner for this work, Science Warehouse, took this approach. Conversion of the data and database structures will require cloud or in-house compute resources. Determining the cost of this is a complex activity, which we propose in “Conclusion and future work” section as future work.|$|R
40|$|Context. The growing {{prevalence}} and {{potential impact of}} cloud computing technology have sparked significant attention amongst IT industry and academia. It offers potential clients {{a wide range of}} services which are universally accessible, acquirable, releasable, and payable on the fly based on the amount of usage. Many IT-based organisations are moving their legacy software applications to cloud environments. An effective method for conducting such transition is crucial to a successful migration. The literature review reveals that the methodological aspect of the <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> has not been well addressed, despite calls expressed by several researchers to resolve this issue. The existing knowledge about <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> process is fragmented over the literature, narrow in tactical focus with heterogeneous viewpoints, and lacking support for creating customised methods, that fit given <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> scenarios. Objective. By adopting the design science paradigm, this research proposes a framework, which provides a generic process model of <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> with associated guidelines. The model can be reused and tailored for creating, configuring, and maintaining situational methods for various <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> scenarios. Method. The proposed framework is based a model-driven software development approach and offers two functionalities: (i) an overarching and platform-independent process model which captures domain constructs relevant to the <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> which a typical <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> may entail; and (ii) a tailoring procedure which aids creating, fine-tuning, standardising, and sharing situational methods for given <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> scenarios through reusing the process model. The framework is iteratively evaluated and refined by feedback received from domain experts and case studies. Contributions. The framework facilitates consistent communication and efficient knowledge sharing and exchange in the <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> domain. It also underpins a substrate for creating, standardising, maintaining, and publishing situational methods for various <b>cloud</b> <b>migration</b> scenarios...|$|E

40|$|The ICT {{industry}} and specifically critical sectors, such as healthcare, transportation, energy and government, require as mandatory the compliance of ICT systems and services with legislation and regulation, {{as well as}} with standards. In the era of cloud computing, this compliance management issue is exacerbated by the distributed nature of the system and by the limited control that customers have on the services. Today, the cloud industry is aware of this problem (as evidenced by the compliance program of many cloud service providers), and the research community is addressing the many facets of the legal-rule compliance checking and quality assurance problem.
