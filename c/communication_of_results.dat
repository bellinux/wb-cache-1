The 2nd Field Survey Company also assisted the mining companies by establishing the positions of objectives within the German lines, using intersection and a special series of aerial photographs. The company surveyed advanced artillery positions, so that guns moving forward to them once the battle had begun could begin firing as soon as they arrived at the positions.|$|E

This latter class of tools is the least developed, reflecting in part the limited range of suitable compatible datasets and the limited set of analytical methods available, although this picture is changing rapidly.

40|$|Abstract. Data mining {{is often}} used to develop {{predictive}} models from data, but rarely addresses how these models are to be employed. To use the constructed model, the user is usually required to run an often complex data mining suite in which the model has been constructed. A better mechanism for the <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>resulting</b> models and less complex, easy to use tools for their employment are needed. We propose a technological solution to the problem, where a predictive model is encoded in XML and then used through a Web- or Palm handheld-based decision support shell. This schema supports developer-to-user and user-to-user communication. To facilitate the communication between the developers we advocate the use of data mining scripts. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{critical}} value is a laboratory result representing a pathophysiological state that offers risk to a patient's life. The <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> these <b>results</b> is a laboratory responsibility and, {{according to the}} literature, 95 % of physicians consider it useful in decision-making and patient management. Two-thirds <b>of</b> critical <b>results</b> lead to some change in therapeutic approach. The <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> critical <b>results</b> is a requirement for laboratory accreditation programs. Thus laboratories should establish a list of tests, their {{critical value}}s, and the procedure describing the communication flow. The performance indicator for this activity should consider the time between results release and their effective communication, and the percentage <b>of</b> successful <b>communication.</b> There is no standardization of laboratory parameters that need to have critical values established, not even the ranges {{to be considered for}} notification purposes. The frequent update of test lists and critical value ranges based on literature reviews and on experience exchange among clinical laboratories ensure the continuous improvement process for this procedure and patient safety...|$|R

40|$|Opening remarks for the 2006 {{conference in}} Madrid on the {{research}} use of patented inventions. The conference, which was held at CSIC on 18 - 19 May 2006, was jointly organised by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office (OEPM) and the OECD, {{with support from the}} European Patent Office (EPO) through its European Patent Academy.

It is well established that <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> among scientists of different institutions all over the world is essential for science and science advancement. Not only to be able to perform incremental research but, above all, to achieve those breakthroughs that have, along the last couple of centuries, improved the quality of life. <b>Communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>results,</b> sharing of experiences, exchange of researchers, etc., are therefore considered essential for us. Short after the Bayh-Dohle Act (1980) was passed in United States, allowing universities to patent inventions in order to promote technology transfer, the CSIC set up its Office for Technology Transfer (OTT), thus becoming in 1986 one of the first research institutions in Europe to recognize the need to structure and support technology transfer...|$|E
40|$|Immediate {{reporting}} of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens {{has been introduced}} into many breast clinics; in others, women return to a later clinic to receive the result. This delay in <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> may lead to elevated anxiety. This study compared anxiety levels in two groups having FNAB. One group received results at the initial clinic visit (n = 51), the other having delayed communication (n = 51). Anxiety was measured using the six-item short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-SSF) and was administered before and after each consultation. Initial anxiety was high in both groups. Women with malignant results had higher post-communication anxiety compared with women with benign results. However, within the group with benign results (the vast majority), immediate communication {{was associated with a}} significantly greater fall in STAI-SSF scores from before to after the first consultation (U = 587. 0; P < 0. 02). There was no difference between the immediate and delayed communication among women with a malignant diagnosis (U = 26. 0; P = 0. 91).
