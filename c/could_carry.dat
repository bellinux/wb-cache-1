50|$|The early gravity {{nuclear bombs}} <b>could</b> only be <b>carried</b> by the B-29 Superfortress. The next {{generation}} of weapons were still so big and heavy that they <b>could</b> only be <b>carried</b> by bombers such as the B-52 Stratofortress and V bombers, but by the mid-1950s smaller weapons had been developed that <b>could</b> be <b>carried</b> and deployed by fighter-bombers.|$|R

50|$|The Crossbow had a cigar-shaped fuselage, {{straight}} wings, {{a straight}} twin-fin tail, and an engine inlet under the belly. It was {{powered by a}} Continental J69 turbojet engine, with 4.41 kN (450 kgf/1,000 lbf) thrust. Two Crossbows <b>could</b> be <b>carried</b> by a Boeing B-50 Superfortress bomber, while four Crossbows <b>could</b> be <b>carried</b> by a Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber.|$|R

5|$|The combi model, the 747-200M, <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> freight in {{the rear}} section of the main deck via a side cargo door. A {{removable}} partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front. The -200M <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck. The model was {{also known as the}} 747-200 Combi. As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM. Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also had two aircraft converted.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the Portland-class cruisers were {{designed}} with space to be outfitted as fleet flagships, with accommodations for an Admiral {{and his staff}} to operate. The class also featured two aircraft catapult amidships, and she <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> four aircraft which were stored in a hangar. Her total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 848, a wartime complement of 952, and a complement 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship.|$|E

5|$|Although in {{operational}} use the Vulcan typically carried various nuclear armaments, {{the type}} {{also had a}} secondary conventional role. While performing conventional combat missions, the Vulcan <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> up to 21 bombs inside its bomb bay. From the 1960s, the various Vulcan squadrons would routinely conduct conventional training missions; the aircrews {{were expected to be}} able to perform conventional bombing missions in addition to the critical nuclear strike mission the Vulcan normally performed.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
50|$|The RAH-66 {{was armed}} with a 20 mm three-barrel XM301 cannon under its nose and <b>could</b> {{internally}} <b>carry</b> six AGM-114 Hellfire or twelve AIM-92 Stinger missiles split evenly between the two retractable weapons pylons. The Comanche <b>could</b> also <b>carry</b> four Hellfire or eight Stinger missiles externally on each of its stub wings, but with {{a reduction in the}} effectiveness of stealth technologies.|$|R

5|$|Courageous <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> up to 48 aircraft; {{following}} {{completion of}} her trials and embarking stores and personnel, she sailed for Spithead on 14 May 1928. The following day, a Blackburn Dart of 463 Flight made the ship's first deck landing. The Dart {{was followed by}} the Fairey Flycatchers of 404 and 407 Flights, the Fairey IIIFs of 445 and 446 Flights and the Darts of 463 and 464 Flight. The ship sailed for Malta on 2 June to join the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry {{set aside}} $850 {{million for the}} Fifth {{generation}} computer project. Their objectives were to write programs and build machines that <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings. Much {{to the chagrin of}} scruffies, they chose Prolog as the primary computer language for the project.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> out {{conversations that}} were so {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with {{a human being and}} not a program. But in fact, ELIZA had no idea what she was talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E

5|$|She <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> five floatplanes and {{two to four}} regular, wheeled aircraft. The latter {{would have}} to return to land after launch, but the {{seaplanes}} would take off and land in the water alongside the carrier, lifted on and off the ship by the cranes. Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a Short Folder, two Wight Pushers, three Sopwith Type 807 seaplanes and two to four Sopwith Tabloid wheeled aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} of the helicopter, with two under each wing and two on the fuselage under the sponsons. The two inner wing hardpoints <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E
5|$|The British Commandos {{were formed}} during the Second World War in June 1940, {{following}} {{a request from}} the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, for a force that <b>could</b> <b>carry</b> out raids against German-occupied Europe. Initially drawn from within the British Army from soldiers who volunteered for the Special Service Brigade, the Commandos' ranks would eventually be filled by members of all branches of the British Armed Forces {{and a number of}} foreign volunteers from German-occupied countries.|$|E

50|$|The Harris {{class had}} almost twice the {{displacement}} of most its sister attack transport classes whilst retaining about the same speed of 17-18 knots. The ships <b>could</b> consequently <b>carry</b> {{a large number of}} troops - between about 1,500 and 2,000 (and it seems, in more comfortable conditions than those that prevailed for the other APA classes). They <b>could</b> also <b>carry</b> a moderate amount of cargo.|$|R
