40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} job satisfaction and burnout among two categories of <b>community-based</b> <b>nurses</b> (N = 402) in the Netherlands taking account of job and individual characteristics. Results show that these nurses are moderately satisfied with their jobs and the effects of burnout are average. Further, community nurses are less satisfied and have experienced burnout to a greater extent than community nurse auxiliaries. Both job characteristics and individual characteristics are related to job satisfaction and burnout. However, job satisfaction is affected to a greater extent by job characteristics whereas burnout is more often a result of individual characteristics.

40|$|Effective {{hospital}} and community rehabilitation services are increasingly recognised {{as a means}} of meeting the changing pattern of health and social care need. While the district or community nurse has the potential to play a central part in community rehabilitation provision, this role has received relatively scant attention in the literature. This paper describes research findings on community nurses’ perceptions of their role and potential contribution to rehabilitation. As part of a wider, 2 -year, qualitative investigation {{of the role of the}} nurse in rehabilitation, fieldwork was undertaken with both district and community staff nurses. This comprised focus group discussions and interviews with staff recruited as a consequence of the follow-up of patients’ experiencing rehabilitation. The findings indicate that community-based nurses contributed to patient rehabilitation by making assessments, referring on to other members of the multi-professional team, advocating for and liaising with other services, helping people to adapt, teaching and motivating patients and carers, supporting and involving families, and providing technical care. A number of challenges to <b>community-based</b> <b>nursing</b> roles were apparent, including feelings of exclusion, lack of recognition, a lack of time for rehabilitation and paucity of referrals for rehabilitation.

40|$|Abstract Objective: Disease {{management}} following hospital discharge {{is difficult}} in most low-resourced areas, posing {{a major obstacle}} to health equity. Although mobile phones are a ubiquitous and promising technology to facilitate healthcare access, few studies have tested the acceptability and feasibility of patients themselves using the devices for assisting linkages to healthcare services. We hypothesized that patients would use mobile phones to help manage postdischarge problems, if given a communication protocol. We developed a mobile phone-based program and investigated its acceptability and feasibility {{as a method of}} delivering posthospitalization care. Subjects and Methods: A consecutive cohort of adult patients in a public hospital in Quito, Ecuador was enrolled over a 1 -month period. A hospital-based nurse relayed patients' discharge instructions to a <b>community-based</b> <b>nurse.</b> Patients corresponded with this nurse via text messaging and phone calls according to a protocol to initiate and participate in follow-up. Results: Eighty-nine percent of eligible patients participated. Ninety-seven percent of participants completed at least one contact with the nurse; 81 % initiated contact themselves. Nurses completed 262 contacts with 32 patients, clarifying discharge instructions, providing preventive education, and facilitating clinic appointments. By this method, 87 % of patients were successfully linked to follow-up appointments. Conclusions: High levels of patient participation and successful delivery of follow-up services indicate the mobile phone program's acceptability and feasibility for facilitating posthospitalization follow-up. Patients actively used mobile phones to interact with nurses, enabling the provision of posthospitalization medical advice and facilitate community-based care via mobile phone...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To improve {{clinical}} diabetes care, patient knowledge, {{and treatment}} satisfac-tion {{and to reduce}} health-adverse culture-based beliefs in underserved and underinsured pop-ulations with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 153 high-risk patients with dia-betes recruited from six community clinic sites in San Diego County, California were enrolled in a nurse case management (NCM) and peer education/empowerment group. Baseline and 1 -year levels of HbA 1 c, lipid parameters, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, knowledge of diabetes, culture-based beliefs in ineffective remedies, and treatment satisfaction were prospectively mea-sured. The NCM and peer education/empowerment group was compared with 76 individuals in a matched control group (CG) derived from patients referred but not enrolled in Project Dulce. RESULTS — After 1 year in Project Dulce, the NCM and peer education/empowerment group had significant improvements in HbA 1 c (12. 0 – 8. 3 %, P 0. 0001), total cholesterol (5. 82 – 4. 86 mmol/l, P 0. 0001), LDL cholesterol (3. 39 – 2. 79 mmol/l, P 0. 0001), and diastolic blood pressure (80 – 76 mmHg, P 0. 009), which were significantly better than in the CG, in which no significant changes were noted. Accepted American Diabetes Association standards of dia-betes care, knowledge of diabetes (P 0. 024), treatment satisfaction (P 0. 001), and culture-based beliefs (P 0. 001) were also improved.

We studied the incidence and preventability of adverse drug events and potential adverse drug events in nursing homes. METHODS: We performed a cohort study of all long-term care residents of 18 <b>community-based</b> <b>nursing</b> homes in Massachusetts during a 12 -month observation period. Potential drug-related incidents were detected by stimulated self-report by nursing home staff and by periodic review of the records of nursing home residents by trained nurse and pharmacist investigators. Each incident was classified by 2 independent physician-reviewers, using a structured implicit review process, by whether or not it constituted an adverse drug event or potential adverse drug event (those that may have caused harm, but did not because of chance or because they were detected), by the severity of the event (significant, serious, life-threatening, or fatal), and by whether it was preventable. Examples of significant events included nonurticarial rashes, falls without associated fracture, hemorrhage not requiring transfusion or hospitalization, and oversedation; examples of serious events included urticaria, falls with fracture, hemorrhage requiring transfusion or hospitalization, and delirium.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to define, the practice domain of <b>community-based</b> child health <b>nursing</b> in light of widespread political, economic and social changes in Western Australia. The project was conducted by a group of nurse researchers with experience in child health nursing from the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Curtin University and the Child and Adolescent Community Health Division at the Department of Health, Western Australia. The overall aim of the project was to map the scope of nursing practice in the community child health setting in Western Australia and to identify the decision making framework that underpins this nursing specialty. Given the widespread social, economic and health service management changes, it was important for nurses involved with, or contemplating a career in, community-based child health to have the role accurately defined. In addition, consumer expectations of the service needed to be explored within the current climate. A descriptive qualitative study was used for this project. A purposive sample of 60 participants was drawn from the pool of child health nurses in the South Metropolitan Community Health Service (SMCHS), North Metropolitan Health Service (NMHS) and Western Australian Country Health Service (WACHS). Following ethical approval data was collected via participants keeping a two week work diary. The data was coded and thematic analysis was applied. Several themes emerged from the analysis which were validated by follow up focus group interviews with participants. This clearly demonstrated common, recurring issues. The results identified that the <b>community-based</b> child health <b>nurses</b> are currently undertaking a more complex and expanded child health service role for an increasingly diverse client population, over their traditional practices which are still maintained. Excessive workloads and lack of human and non human resources also presented challenges. There are increasing requirements for child health nurses to engage in community development and capacity building, often through a multidisciplinary partnership, which requires them to have sound brokerage and facilitation skills to enable community inclusion and inter-agency collaboration at the local level.

40|$|Background In 1998 the World Health Organisation Europe {{introduced}} the Family Health Nurse concept. The envisaged role of this <b>community-based</b> <b>nurse</b> {{was seen as}} multi-faceted and included helping individuals, families and communities to cope with illness and improve their health. During 2000 – 2002 Scotland led enactment of the concept through education and practice, and the first research study evaluating its operation and impact in remote and rural areas was published in 2003. Objective This study's purpose was to follow up health care professionals’ perspectives {{on the development of}} family health nursing in remote and rural areas of Scotland since 2002. Methods The main research method used was questionnaire survey of all the established family health nurses in these areas and all other health and social care professionals with whom they had regular work-related contact. Where novel contexts or practice patterns emerged, further investigation was undertaken through telephone interviews. Findings Twenty-three family health nurses (88 %) and 88 of their colleagues (52 %) returned questionnaires. Eight family health nurses were interviewed. The dominant theme within the findings was the gradual, positive development of a role which tended to maintain established community nursing service provision, yet also supplement this with a limited expansion of family health services and public health activities. The flexibility and wide scope of the FHN role in terms of providing generalist community health nursing services was clearly evident. However, capacity to engage with whole families was found to vary widely in practice. Conclusions Within remote and rural Scotland family health nursing is gradually consolidating and developing, but its particular aspiration to engage with whole families is often difficult to enact and is not a priority within mainstream UK primary care policy, planning or provision.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to test <b>community-based</b> <b>nursing</b> {{education}} about breast self-examination to see whether self-examination frequency could be increased. Background: Breast cancer rates in China are rising rapidly, especially in cities. The majority of Chinese women does not know about breast self-examination, and the Chinese health care system cannot provide mammograms for the millions of at-risk women throughout China. Method: This study was a randomized clinical trial of nurse-provided, community-based teaching of breast self-examination in the urban and rural areas of Tianjin and urban and suburban areas of Shanghai. Women (n = 1510) never diagnosed with breast cancer and 40 years and older were randomized by community and stratified by urban vs. other residences. Results: At baseline, 9 % of the intervention and 6 % of the control groups did breast self-examination at least every other month. After 12 months, 34 % of the intervention, but only 11 % of the control, group did breast self-examination that often (P < 0. 001). There was a significant impact in urban, suburban and rural areas, and intervention effects were stronger than any of the other influences tested. Conclusion: The clinical trial showed a statistically significant increase in breast self-examination after the nursing education intervention.

This study was a randomized {{clinical trial}} of nurse-provided, community-based teaching of breast self-examination in the urban and rural areas of Tianjin and urban and suburban areas of Shanghai. Women (n [*]=[*] 1510) never diagnosed with breast cancer and 40 [*]years and older were randomized by community and stratified by urban vs. other residences. At baseline, 9 % of the intervention and 6 % of the control groups did breast self-examination at least every other month. After 12 [*]months, 34 % of the intervention, but only 11 % of the control, group did breast self-examination that often (P [*]<[*] 0. 001). There was a significant impact in urban, suburban and rural areas, and intervention effects were stronger than any of the other influences tested. The clinical trial showed a statistically significant increase in breast self-examination after the nursing education intervention. As no other breast cancer screening method is available in most of China, this method is best suited for the masses of people currently at risk in China...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the intent of <b>community-based</b> <b>nursing</b> {{activities}} regarding the promotion of mutual help among the residents, using an effects analysis of the activities and a nature analysis of the activities of public health nurses. Two different community nursing activities designed to promote supportive groups for mothers with infants were conducted. The data was collected from a self-report questionnaire which was mailed to 60 mothers (28 participants and 32 nonparticipants) in the districts who had a first child of 1 - 2 years old, and semi-structured interviews conducted with four public health nurses. Effects of both activities on the promotion of mutual help were for the mother to get acquainted with the other mothers with children of a similar age, to increase support among them, to recognize the need for mutual help between all generations in the community, to expand interest in mutual support in their daily activities, and to make health care and public services accessible. The intent of the two nursing activities was to assess needs, especially the need for mutual help, to produce the requisites to gain the support of the community, to introduce mothers with other mothers and community people, and to provide basic nursing care services directly. The activities based on the response to the health needs of individuals promote matured help. It would be expected that the mothers get other mutual help much more in the community, by having experience of mutual help in daily infant care. 保健婦(士) が実施した育児にかかわる住民どうしの支え合い支援を素材に,地域生活共同体内の支え合いを促す方法を追究した。子育てサークルを母親学級に引きつづき育成した地区と育児以外の諸問題を含めて地域づくりをしている地区において,サークル参加群 28 名(対照群 32 名) への質問紙により地域の人々の交流や支え合いの実態を調べ,さらに担当保健婦 4 名に対する非構成的な面接調査により援助内容を調べた。いずれの地区でもサークル参加者は,育児中の母親の交流者数が多く,サークル参加者同士や近隣の育児中の母親との心理的・情報的・手段的サポートを発展させており,日常的で親しい関係や世代を越えた周囲の人々との関係を必要と認識していた。子育てサークル育成支援の方法は,支え合い支援の必要性の判断,支え合いを促す条件づくり,人と人を結びつける工夫と配慮,健康問題に対する直接的な援助,公的サービス等の資源の活用であった。この活動の基盤には,個人の育児の支援を原点として展開する看護固有の機能があり,戦略的に地域生活の成り立ちに対応した住民の支え合いへの発展をめざすものである...|$|E
40|$|R&eacute;mi Marty 1, St&eacute;phane Roze 1, Hannah Kurth 21 HEVA, Lyon, 2 IPSEN, Boulogne-Billancourt, FranceBackground: Long-acting {{somatostatin}} receptor ligands (SRL) with product-specific formulation {{and means}} of administration are injected periodically in patients with acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors. A simple decision-tree model aimed at comparing cost savings with ready-to-use Somatuline Autogel&reg; (lanreotide) and Sandostatin LAR&reg; (octreotide) for the UK, France, and Germany. The drivers of cost savings studied were the reduction of time to administer {{as well as a}} reduced baseline risk of clogging during product administration reported for Somatuline Autogel&reg;. Methods: The decision-tree model assumed two settings for SRL administration, ie, by either hospital-based or <b>community-based</b> <b>nurses.</b> In the case of clogging, the first dose was assumed to be lost and a second injection performed. Successful injection depended on the probability of clogging. Direct medical costs were included. A set of scenarios were run, varying the cost drivers, such as the baseline risk of clogging, SRL administration time, and percentage of patients injected during a hospital stay. Results: Costs per successful injection were less for Somatuline Autogel&reg;/Depot, ranging from Euros (EUR) 13 - 45, EUR 52 - 108, and EUR 127 - 151, respectively, for France, Germany, and the UK. The prices for both long-acting SRL were the same in France, and cost savings came to 100 % from differences other than drug prices. For Germany and the UK, the proportion of savings due to less clogging and shorter administration time was estimated to be around 32 % and 20 %, respectively. Based on low and high country-specific patient cohort size estimations of individuals eligible for SRL treatment among the patient population with acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors, annual savings were estimated to be up to EUR 2, 000, 000 for France, EUR 6, 000, 000 for Germany, and EUR 7, 000, 000 for the UK. Conclusion: This model suggests that increasing usage of the Somatuline device for injection of SRL might lead to substantial savings for health care providers across Europe.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 One forty-item {{questionnaire}} (Cancer Nursing Outreach Program Evaluation Tool) and one twenty-item questionnaire (Cancer Attitude Survey) {{were submitted}} to a randomly selected population of 200 employed associate, diploma and baccalaureate degree nurses distributed among numerous practice settings in the State of Oregon. Data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (fixed design), Exact Tukey q and Pearson Product Moment Correlations. Selected Findings The three-way analysis of variance revealed that statistically significant differences existed among nurses' attitude mean scores based on location of nursing practice, clinical exposure to cancer patients and educational achievement. Nurses practicing in the community obtained more positive attitude mean scores than did nurses practicing in the hospital. Nurses caring for six or more cancer patients each month for one year achieved more positive mean scores than did nurses without this exposure. Nurses completing two dydactic cancer theory courses (102 hours) obtained more positive mean scores than nurses without this education. Hospital-based nurses with educational achievement had significantly higher mean scores than did the hospital-based nurses without educational exposure. However, <b>community-based</b> <b>nurses</b> with or without educational achievement obtained more positive mean scores than did the hospital-based nurses with educational achievement. Selected Recommendations 1. Nurses contemplating employment {{in the field of}} oncological nursing could be assisted with examination of their attitudes by using an attitudinal measurement instrument. 2. The effects of location of nursing practice, clinical exposure and educational achievement on the attitudes of nurses toward cancer and the cancer patient could serve as a basis for determining ongoing attitudinal trends. 3. An evaluation of the unique patterns of attitudes currently existing within a cancer staff and a comparison of these patterns with other cancer and non-cancer health care professionals should be made. 4. Cancer educational programs identified as important for hospital and community based nurses could be established and made accessible to nurses by the organizations and institutions employing them...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Frontier Nursing Service {{recognized}} that {{as health care}} options became more complex, a broader based education was necessary for nurses {{to be able to}} provide comprehensive primary care to all family members. At this time the FSMFN developed the first certificate program to prepare family nurse practitioners. In 1970, the name of the School was changed to the Frontier School of Midwifery and Family Nursing (FSMFN) to reflect the addition of the FNP program. The last class to graduate from the combined family nurse-midwifery program was in August 1990. The <b>Community-based</b> Family <b>Nurse</b> Practitioner (CFNP) education program was reestablished in 1999 using the CNEP distance education model. With the acceptance of CFNP class 1 in 1999, the Frontier School of Midwifery and Family Nursing comes full circle in its mission to educate nurses to provide primary care that is comprehensive, safe, and culturally sensitive.|$|R
