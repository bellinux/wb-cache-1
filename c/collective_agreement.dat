40|$|The {{following}} {{study is}} a textual analysis of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> from Canadian Universities that include provisions for librarians. There has for many years been {{a focus on the}} “crisis in librarianship. ” The hope with this research is to celebrate the victories and highlight how <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> are foundations upon which librarians can build.

This project documents the advances librarians have made and makes recommendations for areas where further activism may be needed. The research focusses on how Academic Librarian positions are described and codified in University <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> in Canada. What provisions are there in <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> to protect Academic Librarians 2 ̆ 7 from de‐professionalization, protect their academic freedom, control their workload, ensure job security and/or protect against contracting out? <b>Collective</b> <b>agreements</b> will be compared for their similarities and the gaps that may exist...|$|R
30|$|These data, however, {{cover only}} the weekly hours worked by {{employees}} in establishments with <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> Results from the IAB Establishment Panel {{show that in}} establishments with <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> the weekly working hours are fewer than in those without <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> <b>Collective</b> bargaining coverage decreased {{over the past years}} (cf. Ellguth and Kohaut 2014). Thus, the customary working hours in establishments which are not bound by <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> gain importance. This must be considered in the AZR since otherwise the component of collectively agreed or customary working hours is estimated too low. Through analyses of the IAB Establishment Panel, a correction factor is estimated for each industry, which compensates for this effect.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to fill several {{knowledge}} gaps regarding the contents of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements,</b> using a new online database. The authors analyse 249 <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> from 11 countries - Benin, Brazil, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda. The authors research to what extent wage and other remuneration-related clauses, working hours, paid leave arrangements and work-family arrangements are included in <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> and whether bargaining topics cluster within agreements. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the web-based WageIndicator <b>Collective</b> Bargaining <b>Agreement</b> Database with uniformly coded agreements, that are both collected and made accessible online. The authors present a quantitative multi-country comparison of the inclusion and contents of the clauses in the agreements. Findings: The authors find that 98 per cent of the <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> include clauses on wages, but that only few agreements specify wage levels. Up to 71 per cent have clauses on social security, 89 per cent on working hours and 84 per cent of work-family arrangements. The authors also find that <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> including one of these four clauses, are also more likely to include the other three and conclude that no trade off exists between their inclusion on the bargaining agenda. Research limitations/implications: Being one of the first multi-country analyses of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements,</b> the analysis is primarily explorative, aiming to establish a factual baseline with regard to the contents of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> Originality/value: This study is unique because of its focus on the content of <b>collective</b> bargaining <b>agreements.</b> The authors are the first to be able to show empirically which clauses are included in existing <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> in developing countries...|$|R
50|$|Minimum {{wages are}} {{regulated}} and stipulated {{in some countries}} that lack explicit laws. In Sweden minimum wages are negotiated between the labour market parties (unions and employer organizations) through <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> that also cover non-union workers at workplaces with <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> At workplaces without <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> there exist no minimum wages. Non-organized employers can sign substitute agreements directly with trade unions but far from all do. The Swedish case illustrates that in countries without statutory regulation will part of the labour market do not have regulated minimum wages, as self-regulation only applies to workplaces and employees covered by <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> (in Sweden about 90 per cent of employees).|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses, in {{a comparative}} perspective <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> entered into in Belgium and in South Africa {{in the private}} sector.

Each part adopts the same format: it comprises a historical survey, a description of the parties to <b>collective</b> <b>agreements,</b> the forums in which collective bargaining takes place and an analysis of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements,</b> focusing on the nature of their binding force. Because Belgian law prohibits agency shop and closed shop agreements, {{on the basis of the}} freedom of association, no reference has been made to these agreements, even though they are permitted in South Africa and are regarded as <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> This dissertation does not deal with <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> entered into to regulate terms and conditions of employment in the public sector as state employees in Belgium are excluded from the scope of labour law and have their employment relationship governed by administrative lawLawLL.

2500|$|There is no {{minimum wage}} that is {{required}} by legislation. Instead, minimum wage standards in different sectors are normally set by collective bargaining.

The high coverage of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending [...] <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> to whole industries or sectors.

25|$|In {{addition}} to these contemporary great powers mentioned above, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Mohan Malik consider India {{to be a great}} power too. Although unlike the contemporary great powers who have long been considered so, India's recognition among authorities as a great power is comparatively recent.

25|$|This {{new process}} was criticised by {{those opposed to}} WorkChoices as they {{believed}} that it would give unions less opportunity to scrutinise and intervene where they believed an agreement had been unfairly drafted. However, the government stated in response that the intention {{of this part of}} the Act was to improve the turn-around time for agreement certification. In addition, the newly amended Act provided for substantial penalties upon employers, employees and unions where a <b>collective</b> <b>agreement</b> did not comply with the new regulations or included prohibited content.|$|E
25|$|The {{first years}} of the 20th was time of {{increased}} labour movement activity; also the yard and engineering shop workers were dissatisfied to their working conditions.

The first notable strike took place in 1902, when the yard smiths were striking for one month. The action did not lead to favourable results for the workers; instead of reaching a <b>collective</b> <b>agreement,</b> each worker made a personal contract with the employer.|$|E
30|$|In {{discussing}} coverage, {{an important}} issue is extension agreements. In {{a good number of}} continental European nations, high levels of union coverage of 75  % or more are achieved through a combination of sectoral (or higher) level bargaining, strong employer organization, and a widespread use of procedures for extending the terms of <b>collective</b> <b>agreements.</b> Of these, the most important is administrative extension, whereby {{at the request of the}} parties the relevant government entity confirms the extension based on the terms of ruling agreements (or sometimes “enlarges” <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> to sectors than have no <b>collective</b> <b>agreements).</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of librarians at Canadian post-secondary institutions have recently attained faculty status. However, the <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> {{of the faculty}} associations do not always explicitly state that librarian members participate in all three traditional faculty activities: teaching, scholarship, and service. This study focuses on {{the membership of the}} Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT), using qualifying member <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> and library websites. A qualitative approach is used to build upon the research first reported by Leckie and Brett (1995). Through description, analysis, and interpretation of data, I report that there is a disparity between what the <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> state regarding the teaching responsibilities of librarians and what the library websites advertise on behalf of teaching librarians. Three themes of library teaching emerge and two trends for <b>collective</b> <b>agreements</b> regarding postsecondary librarians teaching are considered...|$|R
25|$|Convention decisions, however, {{still had}} to be {{approved}} by government, as the union operated under the Societies Act. This changed on November 17, 1977, when AUPE met to change its status into an unincorporated trade union. All aspects of the CSA were transferred into the new union. The Public Service Employee Relations Act (PSERA) received Royal Assent on May 18, 1977, giving AUPE bargaining rights for each group of employees for which it had a <b>collective</b> <b>agreement.</b> These arrangements were ratified at the union’s second convention at the Palliser Hotel in Calgary.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the Statutes of Labourers was {{repealed}} as increasingly capitalistic England embraced laissez-faire policies which disfavored regulations of wages (whether upper or lower limits).

As trade unions were decriminalized during the century, {{attempts to control}} wages through <b>collective</b> <b>agreement</b> were made. However, this meant that a uniform minimum wage was not possible.
