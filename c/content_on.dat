Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to already available excess <b>content</b> <b>on</b> her, the author felt {{she would not be}} able to find anything new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City did not have any commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video <b>content</b> <b>on</b> services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.|$|E

5|$|A year earlier, Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group {{purchased}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for $311m. Fox also held {{exclusive rights to}} Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view, Murdoch’s acquisition looked more appealing. He was now able to control both programming <b>content</b> <b>on</b> his network and distribution rights to the Dodgers. For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox’s formula and went ahead with a takeover of a Premier League club. Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members. The club was the most valuable in English football, making £30.1million from gate receipts and programmes in 1997 alone. At the same time, more than 200 supporters’ groups were established worldwide and the club's fanbase exceeded 100million, despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play. As a means of capitalising on this growing market, MUTV, a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998. In co-operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world’s first channel dedicated to a football club, funded entirely through subscriptions. On the pitch United's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson, who assembled a team capable of dominating in the long haul.|$|E
5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This was explained as being due to the marked decrease of <b>content</b> <b>on</b> the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E

5|$|Fates was {{announced}} for all regions via a Nintendo Direct broadcast in January 2015. It {{was announced}} in Japan as Fire Emblem if. Its English title was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015. Fates was released in multiple versions. Birthright and Conquest both received a physical release on June 25, 2015 in Japan, which was announced for a 2016 release in the west. Players who purchase a physical copy of either version can download the other version as DLC for a smaller price. Revelation was released exclusively as downloadable <b>content</b> <b>on</b> July 9, {{two weeks after the}} physical release of Fates. In addition to the standard releases was a special edition giving access to Conquest, Birthright and Revelation. The western release also follows the release pattern used in Japan. In North America, the physical versions were released first in February, with the third storyline coming later as DLC in March. In Europe, the physical editions were released on May 20, with Revelation following as DLC on June 9. A special edition, containing all three storylines and an art book, was made available in both regions alongside the initial physical releases. In Australia, the physical versions launched on May 21, while Revelation launched on June 10.|$|E
5|$|If {{a device}} {{key is to}} be revoked, the media key blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after the time of revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing key. Users trying to view new <b>content</b> <b>on</b> a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised device or processing key could be used to decrypt a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume unique key, BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly, bypassing the key exchange and verification process.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, it was {{announced}} that VyRT would exclusively broadcast worldwide the performance scheduled on September 15 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Sales for digital tickets began on September 3. VyRT provided access to several different experience packages featuring backstage interactivity with both bands and exclusive <b>content.</b> <b>On</b> September 15, before Thirty Seconds to Mars took to the stage, the VyRT platform was hacked and was a victim of a piracy. Jared Leto, founder of the streaming service, was forced to delay the performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars by an hour to resolve the issue. The audience eventually lost approximately three minutes of actual stage time, but the set list was shortened. The event included real-time social community engagement from audiences worldwide. A second broadcast of the show was later scheduled for September 17, 2014. The performance by Thirty Seconds to Mars became commercially available for download in October 2014 through VyRT. Footage recorded during the Carnivores Tour was uploaded to Linkin Park's official YouTube account.|$|E
