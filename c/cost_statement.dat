The {{part of the work}} is aimed at the measurement parameters of metal cables which are used in data center with noise. The first part is focused on analyzing the structure of the data center and cabling used in it. The structure of the data center is based on the TIA- 942 and consists of an entrance room, main distribution area MDA, horizontal distribution area HDA, zone distribution area ZDA and the equipment distribution area EDA. Divided into backbone cabling and horizontal cabling and use standard and pre-terminated cabling. The measurement results of structured metal cabling with noise are discussed in the next part. There were used these types of cables UTP, FTP and S/FTP. The measurement was performed in the electricity substation and in the laboratory of electromagnetic compatibility. The third part of this work deals with the actual design of structured cabling for the data center. In the first design we use the standard installation, the second preterminated cabling. For both types of installation <b>cost</b> <b>statement</b> is processed (CAPEX). Thesis is also completed with DC design drawings and rack drawings...|$|E
40|$|This tool is {{designed}} to help presses of all sizes determine the full costs of publishing monographs. It may be useful if you are preparing to apply for a subvention to publish a monograph and need an itemized <b>cost</b> <b>statement.</b> Or, it might just be information you need to have in order to better assess and run your business. The process described below will be easiest if centrally coordinated, whether by the press director, business manager, or the Chief Financial Officer. It will almost certainly require some time for departmental heads. Whether or not you choose to involve more staff in the process is up to you. Those who have done so have found that the process can have benefits well beyond the numbers. The Monograph Costing Tool is essentially one large Excel workbook with a summary sheet that draws the data into a comprehensive view. The workbook includes many tabs, whose data is linked throughout the workbook; when you enter data on one page, it often feeds to other cells on that page and other pages. The Tool’s authors have tried to make the math behind the calculations as simple and transparent as possible. One need just look on the formula line in Excel to see how data is aggregated on a given page, or how data is pulled from the tabs into the dashboard. Excel sheet is attached (below...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus on}} process {{improvements}} in high performance lightweight structures is mainly located on thermoset material. Resin transfer moulding processes {{have been developed}} to decrease cost for high performance structures in competition to prepreg material. However, thermoplastic materials, such as CF/PEEK, CF/PEKK or CF/PPS, offer interesting opportunities despite the higher material cost compared to thermosets. This paper shows two examples using continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic material and the joining processes among themselves as well as to titanium in a hybrid structure design. Cost reduction is demonstrated using vacuum consolidation, special moulds and several welding techniques. The first example is a rudder from the vertical tail plane of a military aircraft. Several manufacturing steps including forming or shaping with flat plates, positioning stringers during vacuum consolidation, welding of ribs and welding of the central spar are shown. A <b>cost</b> <b>statement</b> is given analysing the overall manufacturing process. The second example shows the design study of a hybrid fan blade of an aero engine, made from titanium and CFRP part joined along an extended surface. The fan blade is a newly developed high performance blade to save weight and to increase the pressure ratio per compressor stage, so that one complete compressor stage is obsolete. A newly developed finite element model for combining titanium and CFRP is introduced and the special aspects of draping and consolidation in low cost moulds are shown. Future prospects are the integration of additional functions into the structure like lightning protection, bird impact improvement and combination of short fibre and continuous fibre material. Heated press processes during consolidating or welding are reducing cycle times. Some examples such as the man hole access cover, door frame or suspension arm in automotive application are shown with feasible process cycles. ...|$|E

Several sets of data ranging from the FAS 33 minimum disclosure requirements under each model to full sets of comprehensive financial statements are presented and analyzed. In addition, the results of an interview with executives of the case study hospital are presented regarding their views of the perceived impact of FAS 33 data on their financial decisions. ^ This dissertation research study demonstrates that the FAS 33 minimum disclosure requirements and the optional comprehensive financial statement procedures can be feasibly applied to the conventional historical <b>cost</b> financial <b>statements</b> of not-for-profit hospitals. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 70) The {{objective of}} this research has been to examine the nature and usefulness of direct costing. After a chapter that presented the historical background {{and the development of}} the direct cost concept and which was included in the research to lend perspective and understanding, the study considered cost classifications and analyzed the usefulness of direct costing for management decision purposes and for external financial reporting. The study also presented a profit sensitivity model so that attention could be focused on the variance in results obtained under direct costing as compared to the results obtained using absorption costing. This model was included in the study for completeness {{on the assumption that the}} evaluation of direct costing should not be limited to a consideration of its differences in theory and application, but also its impact on profits as compared to other costing methods. The central conclusions of this study are listed below. 1. The nature of direct costing is found in the association of fixed or time costs of production with time periods rather than with units of product. 2. Direct <b>cost</b> <b>statements</b> help make management aware of patterns of cost behavior and relevant cost classifications and thus aid in solving decision problems. 3. Direct <b>costing</b> presents income <b>statements</b> where the fluctuation in income is related to the fluctuations in sales, rather than to the fluctuation in both sales and production, and can aid in evaluating efficiency. 4. Direct costing has not had general acceptance for published financial reports even though it may be used for planning and controlling purposes. Because the criteria applied in the case of direct costing differ from the criteria applied for absorption costing, the controversy over the use of direct or absorption costing for external reports will persist. 5. The impact of direct costing for profit determination as demonstrated by the sensitivity model developed for the study is significant even for reasonably low proportions of fixed overhead cost and relatively balanced production and sales volumes...|$|R
