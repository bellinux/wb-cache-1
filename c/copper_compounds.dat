5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. <b>Copper</b> <b>compounds</b> are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.|$|E
5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because <b>copper</b> <b>compounds</b> often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Solutions of <b>copper</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are used}} as a wood preservative, {{particularly}} in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. Textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E

25|$|The {{advances}} {{made in the}} Middle East in botany {{and chemistry}} led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote {{one of the most}} valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of <b>copper</b> <b>compounds,</b> especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.|$|E

2500|$|Cyanomethyl groups {{represent}} {{an easy way}} to protect an iminium ion during allylic vinylation of the ketone. [...] Cyanamide groups and analogs have been often used in the generation iminium ions. [...] They are typically installed by nucleophilic addition onto an iminium ion, generally produced by amine alkylation with formaldehyde. [...] The iminium ion is thus masked. [...] It follows that usage of a cyanomethyl group provides an efficient way to control the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction. [...] The cyanomethyl group protects the nitrogen at the 2-position during formation of the other allylic analog by logic similar to cyanide-type umpolung. [...] It then later provides a good leaving group for formation of the iminium ion, in accordance with its usage in iminium ion generation. [...] Iminium ion generation from cyanomethyl groups is normally promoted by addition of silver nitrate, although other silver and <b>copper</b> <b>compounds</b> have been used. [...] This added step allows for more precise control of iminium ion generation. [...] Importantly, these preparatory reactions must be carried out at -78°C to prevent cyanomethyl/vinyllithium interaction.

60|$|Another {{and very}} {{different}} form of thunderbolt is the belemnite, a common English fossil often preserved in {{houses in the}} west country with the same superstitious reverence as the neolithic hatchets. The very form of the belemnite at once suggests {{the notion of a}} dart or lance-head, which has gained for it its scientific name. At the present day, when all our girls go to Girton and enter for the classical tripos, I need hardly translate the word belemnite 'for the benefit of the ladies,' as people used to do in the dark and unemancipated eighteenth century; but as our boys have left off learning Greek just as their sisters are beginning to act the 'Antigone' at private theatricals, I may perhaps be pardoned if I explain, 'for the benefit of the gentlemen,' that the word is practically equivalent to javelin-fossil. The belemnites are the internal shells of a sort of cuttle-fish which swam about in enormous numbers in the seas whose sediment forms our modern lias, oolite, and gault. A great many different species are known and have acquired charming names in very doubtful Attic at the hands of profoundly learned geological investigators, but almost all are equally good representatives of the mythical thunderbolt. The finest specimens are long, thick, cylindrical, and gradually tapering, with a hole at one end as if on purpose to receive the shaft. Sometimes they have petrified into iron pyrites or <b>copper</b> <b>compounds,</b> shining like gold, and then they make very noble thunderbolts indeed, heavy as lead, and capable of doing profound mischief if properly directed. At other times they have crystallised in transparent spar, and then they form very beautiful objects, as smooth and polished as the best lapidary could possibly make them. Belemnites are generally found in immense numbers together, especially in the marlstone quarries of the Midlands, and in the lias cliffs of Dorsetshire. Yet the quarrymen who find them never seem to have their faith shaken in the least by the enormous quantities of thunderbolts that would appear to have struck a single spot with such extraordinary frequency This little fact also tells rather hardly against the theory that the lightning never falls twice upon the same place.|$|E
