50|$|By 1928, the Lytton Quarantine Station {{facilities}} {{had been}} extended and enhanced. Vessels were {{met at the}} river mouth by the Health Authorities who boarded each ship (two launches were kept at Lytton) and inspected all goods and personnel on board. Suspect people and goods were landed at Lytton for fumigation and isolation. Jetty facilities permitted passengers to disembark on foot and a crane was provided for conveying sick passengers, luggage and stores to shore. A tram line ran from the jetty to the reception house. A permanent staff of a foreman assistant, two engine-drivers, a coxswain and four assistants was employed to maintain the facilities and attend to non-human quarantine, which included disinfection of luggage and materials using a steam disinfector (autoclave) with attachments for cyanide or formaldehyde gas. A bathing block permitted 10 cabin passengers and 20 crew, third class or deck passengers to bathe simultaneously. Separate accommodation in tents or troop huts had been established for Asiatics, with separate kitchen, dining-room, shelter shed, lavatory and bath blocks. Lighting was supplied from kerosene lamps. A water carriage sewerage system discharged directly into the river, with a <b>chlorination</b> <b>chamber</b> available for disinfection of sewerage as necessary. The medical officer's and foreman assistant's quarters were connected to the city telephone service and internal telephones served most of the principal buildings. A cemetery was located within the grounds. The Lytton facility functioned as a human quarantine station until the early 1980s, by which time the decision {{had been made to}} phase out human quarantine services. Arrangements were made for Kenmore Repatriation Hospital to provide observation facilities in the event that they were required, and in 1982 the Lytton facility reverted to its earlier role as an animal quarantine station, re-designated the Lytton Quarantine Complex and Animal Detention Centre. Facilities comprised a launch jetty, workshop, inflammable store, guinea pig area, imports treatment laboratory, utility buildings area, offices, stores, and animal quarantine detention facilities. In addition to its role as an animal quarantine centre, Lytton served as a communications centre, a base for south side shipping clearance and inspection, a facility for dealing with quarantine treatment and detention of materials, a training area and a depot for stores. Many of the buildings associated with the human quarantine station at Lytton were removed after the 1982 closure, some relocated to sites in the Lytton and Wynnum districts.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{preparation}} {{for the first time}} of selective and epitaxial β-FeSi 2 on oxidized and patterned $ 4 ''$-silicon wafers. These layers are obtained by Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition using a Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) system and in a temperature/time range of 750 - 850 °C / 2 minutes. The iron source is a <b>chlorination</b> <b>chamber</b> where high purity iron is heated under HCl/Ar or Cl 2 /Ar gas in order to form volatile chlorinated iron species which are then transported into the reaction chamber. The layers obtained are single crystal islands most of them oriented with the substrate. They are P-type as deduced from electrical results performed on layers grown on N- and P-type substrates (diode and ohmic contact respectively). Structural results and selectivity of this RTP-CVD β-FeSi 2 will be presented and discussed...|$|E
