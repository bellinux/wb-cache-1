A lance was a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. The throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the <b>compound</b> <b>head</b> that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. The length of the <b>compound</b> <b>head</b> was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a man’s chest to his back.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the interpretation of}} nominalisations, a particular class of <b>compound</b> nouns whose <b>head</b> noun is derived from a verb and whose modifier is interpreted as an argument of this verb. Any attempt to automatically interpret nominalisations needs to take into account: (a) the selectional constraints imposed by the nominalised <b>compound</b> <b>head,</b> (b) {{the fact that the}} relation of the modifier and the head noun can be ambiguous, and (c) the fact that these constraints can be easily overridden by contextual or pragmatic factors. The interpretation of nominalisations poses a further challenge for probabilistic approaches since the argument relations between a head and its modifier are not readily available in the corpus. Even an approximation which maps the <b>compound</b> <b>head</b> to its underlying verb provides insufficient evidence. We present an approach which treats the interpretation task as a disambiguation problem and show how we can "recreate" the missing distributional evidence by exploiting partial parsing, smoothing techniques, and contextual information. We combine these distinct information sources using Ripper, a system that learns sets of rules from data, and achieve an accuracy of 86. 1 % (over a baseline of 61. 5 %) on the British National Corpu...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{combines}} a corpus-based study of noun+verb collocations with {{an attempt to}} distinguish compositional, regularly formed compounds from lexicalised ones. We claim that morphologically regular, compositional compounds share most of their collocational preferences with their <b>compound</b> <b>heads,</b> whereas lexicalised <b>compounds</b> have their own collocational preferences, distinct or only marginally overlapping with those of their heads. We test this claim on corpus data for noun+verb collocations of 85 German simple nouns and their compounds (1, 058 types). The extraction relies on stochastic parsing, since this procedure provides syntactically homogeneous data and frequency counts, which are input to the log-likelihood association measure, to compute significance scores for the combinations. The experiments seem to confirm our hypothesis: a collocational analysis of this kind can serve to identify lexicalised compounds. Being able to identify lexicalised compounds is relevant for lexicography in different respects: {{in the definition of}} the nomenclature of a dictionary, because lexicalised compounds should be included with priority, and in work on the micro structure, because collocations of a compound which are shared with the <b>compound</b> <b>head</b> may be treated extensively under the head, with only a reference or a pointer under the compound. ...|$|R

40|$|Compounding, the {{concatenation}} {{of words}} (e. g. dishwasher), {{is an important}} mechanism across many languages. This study investigated whether access of initial compound constituents occurs immediately or, alternatively, whether it is delayed until the last constituent (i. e. the head). Electroencephalogram was measured as participants listened to German two-constituent compounds. Both the initial {{as well as the}} following head constituent could consist of either a word or nonword, resulting in four experimental conditions. Results showed a larger N 400 for initial nonword constituents, suggesting that lexical access was attempted before the head. Thus, this study provides direct evidence that lexical access of transparent compound constituents in German occurs immediately, and is not delayed until the <b>compound</b> <b>head</b> is encountered...|$|R

The Nizaa data prompt a revision of two of the findings of the Morbo/Comp project. Firstly, the claim that there is a canonical position for the <b>head</b> in each <b>compound</b> type in a given language requires a definition of ‘compound type’ that includes the semantic relation as well as the input and output categories.

These results are compatible with a dual-route model that posits not only whole-word access for compounds but also an activation of decomposed representations of compound constituents. A final result relates to head position, which in Italian compounds could be on either the left- or the right-hand side of the word. While behavioural analysis did not reveal a difference between left- and right-headed compounds, a differ- ence was found with the P 300 component.

It provides a systematic analysis of the two types of compounding in French: native compounding, the main type, and neoclassical compounding, which is quite marginal. It presents the various rules: native compounds are prototypically constructed of two lex-emes and form a third one; they are predominantly endocentric; the governing constituent and the <b>compound</b> <b>head,</b> if any, is on the left and controls the semantic relations between the two constituents, whether coordinated, attribu-tive or subordinating. Neoclassical compounds are prototypically constructed of bound neoclassical elements and form adjectives; they are often exocentric; the governing constituent is on the right. Inflection in native compounds is complex. Several areas of the analysis remain unresolved, particularly regarding the boundaries between morphological/syntactic compounds...|$|R

The CARIN measures successfully predict response latencies in a familiarity categorization task, in a semantic transparency task, and in visual lexical decision. Of the measures based on latent semantic analysis, only a measure orthogonal to the conceptual relations, which instead gauges the extent to which the concepts for the <b>compound’s</b> <b>head</b> and the <b>compound</b> itself are discriminated, also reached significance. Results further indicate that in tasks requiring careful assessment of the meaning of the compound, general knowledge of conceptual relations plays a central role, whereas in the lexical decision task, attention shifts to co-activated meanings and the specifics of the conceptual relations realized in the compound’s modifier family...|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} verbs {{of modern}} Greek are formed as other compounds in the language, creating a compound stem by prefixing {{the stem of}} a second verb to another verb with the compounding interfix -o-. Although only the second verb is inflected, the typical Greek compound verb is a coordinative compound formed by two semantically opposed, equal verbs, and in semantic terms neither can be nominated the <b>compound</b> <b>head</b> with the other as a dependent. The action expressed by the verb is semantically equal to using both verbs individually, linked by a conjunction.Examples: μπαίν-ω 'beno 'I go in' + βγαίν-ω 'vjeno 'I come out' = μπαινοβγαίνω beno'vjeno 'I go in and out'; ανάβ-ω a'navo 'I light up' σβήν-ω 'zvino 'I put out (a light)' = αναβοσβήνω anavo'zvino 'I flash on and off'.

40|$|Reading {{compound}} words was {{studied in}} neglect dyslexia {{in order to}} assess the influence of ‘head- edness’. The ‘head’ of a compound is the component that determines the grammatical category, the syntactic (e. g., the gender) and the semantic properties of the compound as a whole. For example, in the word ‘blackberry’ berry is the <b>compound’s</b> <b>head.</b> The question was addressed {{of whether or not the}} privileged status of the head constituent influences processing and determines behavioural patterns in the breakdown of spatial attention in neglect. Italian right-headed (e. g. capobanda, band leader) and left-headed compounds (e. g. astronave, spaceship) were administered to 18 participants affected by neglect dyslexia. Left-headed compounds were read better than right-headed compounds. This result was not due to factors such as frequency, familiarity, age of acquisition or imageability, since these effects were controlled. It is suggested that attention is captured by the head component after implicit reading of the whole word. The head would require a relatively lighter processing load than the modifier and benefit from top-down facilitation. ...|$|R

The crucial issue is that the nouns under study, which constitute a subset of the so-called neoclassical compounds, are frequently and productively found only in biomedical domain corpora. So, they have never been taken into consideration by morphological theories for general language, because of their only recent availability within (often) online resources. Consequently, computing their structure and meaning often requires the definition of specific rules. The paper focuses on the example of compound nouns which can be linearly represented by PREF YX I, where PREF represents a quantifying prefix, X is the <b>compound</b> <b>head,</b> Y its extension, and –I, a suffix indicating pathology and standing for eg –ie (in French and German) or ia (in English, Spanish and Italian).
