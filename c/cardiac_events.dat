Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with <b>cardiac</b> <b>events,</b> mostly in older divers.

40|$|Effects of {{cardiovascular}} dysfunction on renal function have been poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated {{the relation between}} a first ischemic <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> and long-term renal function changes {{in the general population}} from the PREVEND study. We studied 6, 360 subjects with a total follow-up duration of 27. 017 subject-years. The estimated mean proportional increase in serum creatinine after a first ischemic <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> was 3. 1 % compared with 0. 4 % per year of follow-up in subjects without such an event (p = 0. 005). This represented a significantly larger decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate after the event in subjects with an event versus the decrease in subjects without a first ischemic <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> (2. 2 vs 0. 5 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) /year of follow-up, p = 0. 006). In multivariate analysis with adjustment for renal risk factors, this event showed an independent association with serum creatinine change. In conclusion, a first ischemic <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> appears to enhance the natural decrease in renal function. Because even mild renal dysfunction should be considered a major cardiovascular risk factor after myocardial infarction, increased renal function loss after an ischemic <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> could add to the risk for subsequent cardiovascular morbidity, thus closing a vicious circle.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} prognostic value {{of an increase in}} fluorine (F) - 18 deoxyglucose uptake compared wilh clinical, angiographic and stress thallium findings in patients with myocardial infarction. Background. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using F- 18 deoxyglucose has been applied to assess tissue viability in patients with coronary artery disease. We hypothesized that patients with a myocardial segment with augmented F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake are at high risk for a future <b>cardiac</b> <b>event.</b> Methods. One hundred fifty-eight consecutive patients with myocardial infarction referred for F- 18 deoxyglucose PET and stress thallium scans were studied. Follow-up was obtained in 84 patients at a mean interval of 23 months to investigate prognostic implications of radionuclide studies. Results. Seventeen patients had a <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> during the follow-up interval. Univariate analysis showed that an increase in F- 18 deosyglucose uptake was the best predictor of a future <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> (p = 0. 0006), followed by the number of stenosed vessels (p = 0. 008). In the multivariate analysis, when an increase in F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake was entered into the model, only angiographic variables had an independent value, whereas no other radionuclide variables showed value. Among patients who did not show redistribution, a future <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> was observed more often in patients with than in those without an increase in F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Thus, an increase in F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake seemed to be the best predictor of a future <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> among all clinical, angiographic and redionuclide variables in this study of stable patients with myocardial infarction. Even when a stress thallium- 201 scan does not show redistribution, those patients who have an increase in F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake in a PET study may be at risk for a future <b>cardiac</b> <b>event,</b> and these patients may need aggressive treatment to prevent a future <b>cardiac</b> <b>event...</b>|$|R

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is a global}} health problem. Evidence indicates that type 2 diabetes can lead to serious complications, such as a <b>cardiac</b> <b>event,</b> which usually require critical nursing care. Patients with type 2 diabetes and {{with a history of}} cardiac disease are at greater risk of a further <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> requiring readmission to hospital. Evidence indicates that improved diabetes management assists patients with type 2 diabetes to manage their condition efficiently, reduces risks of a further <b>cardiac</b> <b>event,</b> and therefore reduces hospitalisations. However, there is limited information found regarding a diabetes management program specifically for patients who have already had cardiac complications. Difficulties in developing patients' skills in managing and modifying their daily lives also present a challenge to coronary care staff. Therefore, there is a real need to develop a special diabetes management program for patients with diabetes who have experienced a critical <b>cardiac</b> <b>event,</b> which will be commenced in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU). The aim of this research is to gain a greater understanding of the characteristics, secondly to obtain in-depth understanding of needs and experiences of patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalised for a critical <b>cardiac</b> <b>event.</b> A further aim is to develop and pilot test a diabetes management program, specific to the patients with diabetes {{in the context of the}} CCU.

40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} gain {{in-depth}} {{understanding of the}} actual hospital and home experience of patients with diabetes and a critical <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> to assist in developing a pertinent diabetes self-management programme. Background. Type 2 diabetes can lead to cardiac complications requiring critical nursing care. Patients with diabetes {{and a history of}} cardiac disease are at greater risk of a further <b>cardiac</b> <b>event.</b> Greater self-efficacy or confidence in regulating diabetes and reducing the risk of a further <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> can be achieved through self-management programmes. However, the start of such a programme within the critical care environment presents challenges to critical care staff. It is important to understand patients' experiences and needs to improve quality of care. Design. An interpretive approach comprising open-ended interviews was used to collect data from patients with type 2 diabetes experiencing a <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> who had a coronary care unit admission in 2002 - 2003. Findings. The findings revealed that patients with diabetes who had a critical <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> experienced considerable feelings of hopelessness and fatigue. Patients also had concerns in the areas of self-confidence and confidence in health professionals. Patients indicated that greater self-confidence and confidence in health professionals would help their ability to manage their daily lives. Conclusion. This paper provides in-depth understanding of the perspectives of patients with type 2 diabetes who have also been hospitalized for a critical <b>cardiac</b> <b>event.</b> This study concluded that {{further research is needed to}} fully explore whether enhancing self-confidence for these patients will lead to improved diabetes management, reduced negative feelings and more positive health outcomes.

40|$|Background and Purpose Atrial {{fibrillation}} or flutter (AF) {{constitutes a}} {{major risk factor}} for developing an ischemic stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). Oral anticoagulation therapy in stroke patients with AF {{has proven to be}} an effective therapy for secondary prevention of stroke recurrence. Development of strategies improving the detection sensitivity of paroxysmal AF in stroke patients is of major importance. Several trials studied the use of Holter-electrocardiogram (Holter-ECG) monitoring for the detection of AF in stroke patients. AF was detected in 2, 1 % to 9, 4 % of the stroke patients in 24 -hour monitoring up to 21, 3 % in prolonged registration. Nevertheless current guidelines only recommend 24 -hour Holter-ECG monitoring in patients without another explainable etiology for the stroke than AF or when cardiac arrhythmias are suspected. In this study we evaluated the diagnostic yield of 24 -hour automated <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recording for the detection of AF in the acute inpatient setting of ischemic stroke or TIA. We did not distinguish between the causes or types of stroke. Methods In this prospective single centre cohort study, between 11 July 2011 and 28 October 2011, 153 consecutive patients were admitted to the hospital with the suspicion of a stroke or TIA. Patients with previously documented AF or AF on the admission electrocardiogram (ECG) were not included. In 127 patients 24 -hour automated <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recorder was performed as soon as possible after admission. All stroke types according to the TOAST classification were included. Results Of the 127 patients with 24 -hour <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recording 94 patients were diagnosed with an ischemic stroke or TIA and had complete 24 -hour recording. In 5 of these 94 patients AF was detected during 24 -hour <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recording (5, 3 %). These 5 patients were all women {{with a mean age of}} 74, 6 years and 4 had a cortical stroke or cortical TIA. There was a significant difference in age (p= 0, 02), gender (p= 0, 02), cortical involvement (p= 0, 04) and palpitations (p= 0, 02) compared with the group without paroxysmal AF during <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recording. Conclusions 24 -hour automated <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recording revealed AF in 5, 3 % of the patients with a stroke or TIA. Female gender, an age of 70 years and older, cortical involvement and palpitations were associated with paroxysmal AF. These patients with AF during <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recording were all diagnosed with a stroke or TIA of unknown etiology despite complete workup prior to the diagnosis of AF using <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recording. Prolonged automated <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> recording would increase the number of newly diagnosed AF patients, especially in the group with stroke or TIA of unknown etiology despite complete workup. ...|$|R

SUBJECTS: 5106 patients aged 25 - 64 years with an acute <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> leading to coronary death or definite myocardial infarction within 28 days of onset, occurring between 1986 and 1992. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case fatality before admission, 28 day case fatality for patients in hospital, and total case fatality after an acute <b>cardiac</b> <b>event.</b> RESULTS: Despite a more unfavourable risk profile women tended to have lower case fatality before admission than men (crude odds ratio 0. 88; 95 % confidence interval 0. 77 to 1. 02). Adjustment for age, living arrangements, smoking, medical history, and treatment increased the effect of sex (0. 72; 0. 60 to 0. 86). After admission to hospital, women had a higher case fatality than men (1. 76; 1. 43 to 2. 17), but after adjustment for confounders this was reduced to 1. 18 (0. 89 to 1. 58). Total case fatality 28 days after an acute <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> showed no significant difference between men and women (0. 85; 0. 70 to 1. 02) CONCLUSIONS: The higher case fatality after an acute <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> in women admitted to hospital is largely explained by differences in living status, history, and medical treatment and is balanced by a lower case fatality before admission...|$|R

The relationship between their serum/plasma CK and TnT levels at the time of admission and clinical outcome was investigated over a mean follow up of 24. 12 +/- 3. 75 months. RESULTS: Admission CK was found to be associated with subsequent <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> and mortality (P 3 ̆c 0. 01 and P 3 ̆c 0. 04 respectively). Admission CK was also mildly associated with time interval between onset of symptoms to SK treatment (correlation coefficient 2 ̆ 7 r 2 ̆ 7 = 0. 23). Odds of encountering a <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> in AMI patients with above-normal CK levels (adjusted for gender) were 3. 46 times higher than the odds in patients with normal CK levels. Similarly, odds of mortality in patients with positive TnT were 4. 6 times the odds in patients with negative TnT. The two biochemical markers, CK and TnT, together did not provide any further information about prognosis of the disease.

MethodsFollow-up data were obtained from 353 young patients with a first <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> (men ≤ 45 years and women ≤ 55 years). Baseline characteristics on traditional risk factors were collected {{at the time of}} the first event, and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), von Willebrand Factor (VWF), and fibrinogen were measured one to three months after the first event to exclude an acute phase response. We performed age and sex adjusted Cox regression analyses to assess the relationship between these factors and recurrent events with three different endpoints: all cause mortality, recurrent <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> (myocardial infarction or revascularisation procedure), and any recurrent <b>event</b> (<b>cardiac</b> <b>event,</b> cerebrovascular event or all cause mortality). ResultsDuring a total follow-up time of 1483 person years (mean 4. 2 years), 11 patients died (3 %), 42 patients had a recurrent <b>cardiac</b> <b>event</b> (12 %), and 53 patients had any recurrent event (15 %). CRP was associated with an increased risk of any recurrent event (HR 1. 28 [95 % CI =  1. 02 – 1. 59] per unit increase in lnCRP).
