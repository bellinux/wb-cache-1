5|$|A near-contemporary {{account of}} Æthelwig's life, or Vita, is {{included}} in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, the monastic chronicle for Evesham Abbey. This was a 13th-century work by Thomas of Marlborough, which was written to bolster the Evesham's case for exemption from the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Worcester, in whose diocese Evensham was. In order to do this, Thomas incorporated earlier works dealing with Evesham's history, including the work on Æthelwig. However, because of Thomas' purpose in composing the Chronicon, he probably altered some of the texts he included, and it appears that the life of Æthelwig was first incorporated into a complete history of the abbey and then that <b>composit</b> work was adapted by Thomas into his Chronicon. The main evidence for this is internal stylistic evidence, where the Æthelwig material is stylistic uniform with other material dating to prior to 1077, with information after 1077 forming a separate writing style.|$|E

When the woman screams, the screen freezes and Homer is composited to the screen, instructing the audience about SpringShield's telephone number. In order to <b>composit</b> Homer into the screen, director Michels made use of a greenscreen. The advertisement resumes and the monster is subdued by Homer, Lenny and Carl. Confused, the monster turns to Homer and asks, [...] "friend?" [...] to which Homer replies [...] "the only friend you need is SpringShield," [...] and holds a business card {{in front of the}} camera. The monster then puts the card in his wallet and says [...] "monster put in wallet." [...] The monster's last line was written during one of the episode's rewrites, but none of the writers on The Simpsons writing staff has taken credit for it. The line has since become very popular with the series' writing staff; Jean said that it was [...] "very funny and unusual for a television show," [...] and Gould considers it to be his favorite joke in any episode he has ever written. At the end of the episode, Maggie saves Homer by shooting Fat Tony's gang members with a rifle. The scene was conceived by series co-creator and executive producer James L. Brooks while writing notes during the episode's first table-read.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>compositing</b> {{window manager}} {{may appear to}} the user similar to a {{stacking}} window manager.

40|$|In this thesis, DCT domain video <b>compositing</b> with {{embedded}} zerotree coding for multi-point {{video conferencing}} is considered. In a typical video <b>compositing</b> system, video sequences coming from different sources are <b>composited</b> into one video stream and sent using a single channel to the receiver points. There are mainly three stages of video compositing: decoding of incoming video streams, decimation of video frames, andencoding of the <b>composited</b> video. Conventional spatial domain video <b>compositing</b> requires transformations between the DCT and the spatial domains increasing {{the complexity of}} computations. The advantage of the DCT domain video <b>compositing</b> is that the decoding, decimation and encoding remain fully in the DCT domain resulting in faster processing time and better quality of the <b>composited</b> videos. The <b>composited</b> videos are encoded via a DCT based embedded zerotree coder which was originally developed for wavelet coding. An adaptive arithmetic coder is used to encode the symbols obtained from the DCT based zerotree codingresulting in embedded bit stream. By using the embedded zerotree coder {{the quality of the}} <b>composited</b> videos is improved when compared to a conventional encoder. An advanced versionof zerotree coder is also used to increase the performance of the <b>compositing</b> system. Another improvement is due to the use of local cosine transform to decrease the blocking effect at low bit rates. We also apply the proposed DCT decimation/interpolation for single stream video coding achieving better quality than regular encoding process at low bit rates. The bit rate control problem is easily solved by taking the advantage the embedded property of zerotree coding since the coding control parameter is the bit rate itself. We also achieve the optimum bit rate allocation among the <b>composited</b> frames in a GOP without using subframe layer bit rate allocation, since zerotree coding uses successive approximation quantization allowing DCT coefficients to be encoded in descending significance order...|$|R
