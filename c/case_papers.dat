40|$|Background: Problem-based {{learning}} (PBL) {{is one of}} {{the pedagogical}} approaches utilized in the Medical College at Aga Khan University (AKU). In Years 1 and 2, clinical PBL scenarios developed by a multidisciplinary module committee are presented to students in the form of written (<b>paper)</b> <b>cases</b> from which students are expected to derive basic science learning objectives. In response to informal feedback by students and formal case evaluations, that revealed a decline in student interest in the PBL process, the Introductory module committee decided to test alternative methods of PBL case delivery, specifically, the use of video cases. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effectiveness of video <b>cases</b> versus <b>paper</b> <b>cases</b> as a delivery methodology for PBL. Methods: Year 1 medical students (Class of 2016) at AKU and the facilitators of the Introductory module were requested to complete a brief structured questionnaire after each PBL <b>case</b> (two <b>paper</b> and two video). Case evaluations of the two video cases for Class of 2016 were also compared to the case evaluations of the same <b>cases</b> delivered as <b>paper</b> <b>cases</b> for the Class of 2015. Results: Eleven facilitators, one each for eleven PBL groups, and 99 / 100 students consented to participate in this study. 392 (98 % response rate) students’ and 42 facilitators’ (95 % response rate) questionnaires on four cases were evaluated. Students found <b>paper</b> <b>cases</b> more effective compared to video cases (P= 0. 001), while no significant difference was observed in facilitators’ preference (P = 0. 19). Conclusions: Students preferred <b>paper</b> over video <b>cases,</b> which may be linked to quality and content of video cases. Video cases can still be used to increase student interest, but preferably in the second half of Year 1 or in Year 2, and should ideally be created for observation-intensive scenarios.

5000|$|Paper {{wealth is}} {{fundamentally}} an accounting matter - one's net worth is the accounting value of one's assets minus the accounting value of one's liabilities. There are various accounting methods for different assets and liabilities, and they yield different notions of net worth; some methods {{are more or}} less volatile than others. For example, one may value ("hold", [...] "mark") assets at book value, meaning the price for which they were purchased; in this <b>case</b> <b>paper</b> wealth does not change when the potential sale price of an asset changes, but does change if the asset is sold, as the asset is replaced by the sale proceeds. Conversely, one may mark assets at market value (mark to market accounting), in which <b>case</b> <b>paper</b> wealth changes as the market varies.|$|R

5000|$|The {{programme}} was devised {{and produced}} by Peter Hill, an investigative journalist, in 1979, motivated by Ludovic Kennedy's earlier television {{work in the}} same field and the work of Tom Sargant at reform group JUSTICE. In 1992 Hill recalled: [...] "At that time there were equally important programmes being made by John Willis at Yorkshire Television and Ray Fitzwater at Granada. We were all investigating mistakes made before a case comes to trial. That was the problem in the early eighties - the legacy of police misconduct from the seventies." [...] During this period, criminal justice procedure in the United Kingdom was uncodified. Until the introduction of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), and the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, the police [...] "decided what evidence to disclose." [...] Following the introduction of PACE, David Jessel, who replaced Hill, acknowledged that the Act had [...] "probably reduced police misconduct" [...] but said that [...] "the evidence of a plethora of post-PACE <b>case</b> <b>papers</b> is that the same old wickednesses continue, although in different guises. It is remarkable how many suspects these days [...] "confess" [...] in police cars on their way to PACE-protected police stations; and duty solicitors have tales to tell about the co-operation afforded them at some stations." ...|$|E

Seven years after the incident, in February 2009, Erda, the Deputy Superintendent of Police with the Gujarat Police at the time was arrested on charges of dereliction of duty and for tampering with evidence, as some survivors alleged that he not only allowed the killings to happen but also helped rioters to burn the dead bodies.
