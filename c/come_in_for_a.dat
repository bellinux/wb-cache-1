5|$|Many of {{the cast}} members {{at the time were}} {{relatively}} unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reading after he spotted her picture in the Austin American-Statesman. For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car came}} back in on lap 32, with Rosberg leading the field at the flying restart, quickly pulling out a two-second {{advantage}} over Hamilton. Sergio Pérez was {{the winner of the}} restart, moving up three places into 11th and moving up another position several laps later. On lap 39, Button moved ahead of Felipe Nasr into seventh position. After keeping the gap at around two seconds for a number of laps, a mistake by Rosberg saw Hamilton close back up to him, allowing him to use the drag reduction system to attempt an overtake manoeuvre. Several drivers decided to change tyres for a second time around lap 50, including Valtteri Bottas on lap 52, while Nico Hülkenberg took his third stop a lap before, serving a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pitlane in the process. On lap 55, Hamilton {{was the first of the}} leading duo to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pitstop, followed by Rosberg a lap later. A quicker stop for Rosberg and a mistake by Hamilton on his lap after pitting saw Rosberg emerge from his stop ahead. Verstappen was in the lead, soon followed closely by the two Mercedes drivers. On lap 58, Räikkönen overtook Ricciardo for fourth place, while Verstappen was staying in the lead with soft compound tyres he fitted on lap 15. He lost the lead to Rosberg however on lap 61, with Hamilton getting past him as well soon after. As the Mercedes duo battled for the race win, several drivers retired in the closing stages of the race, including Hülkenberg and Massa. Räikkönen was closing in to Verstappen in third, while Pascal Wehrlein edged closer to Bottas in tenth place as well. On the last lap, Hamilton attempted to overtake Rosberg into turn two. Hamilton went to the outside but Rosberg turned into the corner late on the inside and both cars touched, damaging Rosberg's front wing and pushing Hamilton off the track. They almost touched again as Hamilton rejoined the track. Hamilton eventually got ahead into turn three as Rosberg nursed his damaged car to the finish line. He was relegated to fourth position as both Verstappen and Räikkönen moved past him over the course of the lap. Further behind, Pérez retired, elevating Wehrlein into the last point-scoring position in tenth.|$|E
25|$|Noda {{pulled in}} to retire, and Mansell {{eventually}} had to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new nosecone, ruining his race and denting his reputation. Noda's luck would then get no better {{at his home}} race in Japan, where he qualified 23rd, once again only one spot off Comas, although {{this time he was}} only 0.013s behind the Frenchman. His experience at Suzuka was obviously paying rich dividends, but when torrential rain drenched the circuit on race day, it would suddenly be a whole new ball game.|$|E

25|$|Until 1909 {{the fare}} for {{children}} under 12 was for two children to travel with one adult ticket or for one child to ride two adult stages. This system had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of criticism, the outcome {{of which was the}} introduction of children’s tickets in January. Children under 15 years of age were supplied with books of 30 tickets, each book costing 1/3d. Each ticket was available for one adult 1d. stage and had to be handed to the conductor in exchange for a section ticket.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth and}} final Test match was played between 3–7 November 2004 at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Having already lost the series, India made changes in the team. Patel, Akash Chopra, Ajit Agarkar and Yuvraj Singh were all dropped from the lineup. The first day of play was almost {{completely}} washed out by rain, with only 11 overs being bowled. India won the toss and elected to bat. The innings started on a bad note, losing 2 wickets {{on the first day}} itself. On the second day India was bowled out for their second-lowest score ever of 104 runs, with Rahul Dravid scoring the highest score in the innings of 31 runs. Jason Gillespie (4–29) was the main wicket taker for Australia. Australia's first innings also didn't last long, as they were bowled out on the same day for a score of 203 runs, with Martyn (55) top scoring. Murali Kartik (4–44) and Kumble (5–90) were the main wicket takers. 18 wickets fell in all {{on the second day of}} play. India made 205 runs in their second innings, with significant scores from V.V.S. Laxman (69) and Tendulkar (55). Michael Clarke (6–9) removed the tail order within 23 runs. Chasing 107 runs for victory, Australia lost wickets consistently throughout their second innings and were bowled out for 93 runs, giving India a victory by 13 runs. Harbhajan Singh (5–29) and Murali Kartik (3–32) took most of the wickets. Murali Kartik was named Man of the Match. This Test is one of the shortest Test matches ever played, lasting for only 2 complete days. The pitch prepared for the match had later <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lot of criticism by Ricky Ponting.|$|E

2500|$|Southey, whose {{political}} about-face {{was more}} blatant {{than that of}} the others, still <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> measure of biting criticism: [...] "not truth, but self-opinion is the ruling principle of Mr. Southey's mind".

500|$|Sonic Rs soundtrack was {{particularly}} divisive. Nutter described the [...] "storm of controversy [...] surrounds the accompanying music", which [...] "has <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{bit of a}} slagging on the Internet recently for the addition of vocals." [...] Although he was [...] "not a particular fan of dance music", Nutter stated that the tracks were [...] "better than most chart stuff", while the included instrumental versions were sufficient [...] "to appease everyone". Sackenheim offered high praise for [...] "One of the most inspired soundtracks I've ever heard", while MacDonald commented: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} more games should have songs with vocals. It gives the game so much more personality". Conversely, Dan Elektro deplored the [...] "unbelievably annoying music". Computer and Video Games complimented the music, saying it [...] "fits the Sonic style perfectly", and is reminiscent of Sonic CDs soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Black {{joined the}} cast {{full-time}} in season 10. Had Stargate SG-1 not {{been picked up}} for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series. To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and {{tried to find a}} suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship. Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful complement to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in [...] "Beachhead", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy. The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer Damian Kindler later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler Lando Calrissian from Star Wars, a [...] "former swindler who's gone legit". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala [...] "as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. But definitely the sort of character who could <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> couple of seasons, spice things up and then move on and come back and forth." [...] Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them [...] "end up in a motel room bed together" [...] in the episode [...] "Memento Mori", involving underwear, [...] "handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies". A scene in the milestone episode [...] "200" [...] also parodied the show's connection to Farscape. In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period. Her relocation to Vancouver and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low. She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character [...] "and not go for the cheap laugh".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} half of the century (and prior) {{prenatal}} care was practically unheard of in the region. [...] Midwives were not called on until the due date was approaching or labor pains started.

2500|$|George William Curtis, {{the editor}} of Harper’s New Monthly Magazine, remembered Ludlow as “a slight, bright-eyed, alert young man, who seemed {{scarcely}} more than a boy,” when he <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> visit. [...] Curtis introduced Ludlow to the princes of the Harper publishing family as an upcoming literary talent who, before his twenty-fifth birthday, would have his first book go through several printings and would place more than ten stories in Harper’s publications, {{some of which were}} printed serially and spanned several issues.|$|R

2500|$|According to Jardine, {{each member}} was taught their {{individual}} vocal lines by Brian at a piano. He explains, [...] "Every night we'd <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> playback.

2500|$|Gilbert had {{targeted}} the aristocracy and political officials for satiric treatment in earlier works. In this opera, the House of Lords is lampooned as {{a bastion of}} the ineffective, privileged and dim-witted, whose only qualification to govern is noble birth. The political party system, the law and other institutions also <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dose of satire. Throughout Iolanthe, however, both author and composer managed to couch the criticism among such bouncy, amiable absurdities and [...] "splendid pageantry" [...] that it is all received as good humour, with Prime Minister Gladstone complimenting the opera's good taste. In fact, Gilbert later refused to allow quotes from the piece {{to be used as}} part of the campaign to diminish the powers of the House of Lords.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Take Out," [...] Don {{must see}} a {{therapist}} who is {{led to believe}} that he is [...] "trigger happy." [...] His father noted that this may be true, as he often shoots first. Further, Alan recalled how Don would take on others' burdens as a child and told him to get counseling, which he later willingly sought, especially considering that he viewed his life's work as a series of dirty deeds. In [...] "One Hour", Don expressed that he doesn't have to trust his team, they have to trust him. [...] The exception to this may be Charlie, whom the therapist identified {{as a member of the}} team to Don's initial confusion. [...] It appears that Don considers Charlie more of an extension of himself than a member of his team, which may be true: [...] Charlie would likely not be involved in the volume of cases that he is if not for Don's continued requests for his assistance, despite the team's respect for Charlie's contributions. He also confessed to his psychiatrist that he [...] "respects the Hell out of" [...] Charlie for all that his brother does for the FBI, and that Charlie has never let them down despite often having the team's and Don's lives in his hands. When the psychiatrist pushes Don about his relationship with Charlie, indicating first that Don resents Charlie's presence at the FBI and then that Don enjoys having his little brother as his 'employee', Don vehemently snaps back and defends Charlie. This shows how far the relationship between the brothers has come, especially since being damaged by the unusual pressures of their childhood and the three months near the end of their mother's life that Charlie spent working on P vs. NP. The therapist reveals that Don has deep-seated fears of losing what he has worked for, together with self-esteem issues from growing up in Charlie's shadow and likely some abandonment issues as well. In [...] "Money for Nothing", he acquiesces to the counselor's request to ask Charlie to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> visit. A looming issue was the day Charlie walked all the way home from a camping trip at the age of 8 (taken for Don's 13th birthday) just to get away from Don who did not want him sticking around. During the meeting, he learns that his brother was not as inept as he and his father thought and stated he likes working with Charlie. Both Don's therapist and Edgerton himself bring up the incident in which a suspect was tortured that nearly took Don over the edge ("One Hour" [...] and [...] "Pandora's Box"), but given the fact that it was done to obtain the whereabouts of a missing FBI agent, Don and Ian's superiors appear to be overlooking the matter for now.|$|E
