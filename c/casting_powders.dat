Design/methodology/approach: The methodology of the research conducted was based on the chemical analysis of basic mould powders and powders with 5 % addition of food origin binder.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of alumina increase on the functioning of casting powder during continuous casting. Two aspects of the powder's performance were experimentally measured, namely the influence of alumina on the viscosity and the crystallisation behaviour. These two aspects were then related to the in-mould functioning of the casting powder with the aid of literature references. Casting slag must provide lubrication between the mould surface and the thin steel shell. Alumina increase will cause viscosity increase in casting slags and will hinder lubrication when the inflow of casting slag into the mould/strand gap deteriorates. Heat transfer across the gap is determined by the amount of solid casting slag and the form (glass or crystalline) thereof. Heat transfer across a crystalline material may be up to seven times lower than that across a glass phase. The increased alumina will serve to increase the ratio of glassy phase to crystalline phase in the gap, so increasing the heat transfer. To determine the true extent of alumina increase with modern clean steel practice, samples were taken from the moulds of both the VI and V 2 continuous casters at ISCOR Vanderbijlpark. The influence of this alumina increase on the viscosity and the crystallisation behaviour of the casting slag were experimentally measured. Viscosity measurements were done with a rotating bob viscometer (in a vertical tube furnace) on two commercial <b>casting</b> <b>powders</b> (with increasing AI 2 O 3 content). Viscosity prediction models were evaluated with the data from the measured viscosity values. Crystallisation measurements were done by quench experiments with the aid of the hot thermocouple technique. Crystallisation behaviour after a specified heat cycle was presented as the percentage opaque material (crystalline) to vitreous material (glassy) measured with an optical microscope. For the seven sequence casts during which samples were collected from the mould, it was found that the alumina content of the casting slag reached a steady-state value within the first ladle (first 40 minutes) with an increase of 3 to 4 mass %. The influence of a 4 mass % alumina increase on the measured viscosity is small enough that proper lubrication function of the slag will not be negatively affected. Viscosity prediction models vary in their accuracy and are limited with respect to the composition range of the casting powder and the temperature range for which they are valid. The increased alumina content was found to have a strong influence on the percentage crystalline material present. After the sample was heated to 1300 °C, kept there for 10 s, and then quenched, the crystalline material will decrease from 60 % to 30 % for 5 mass % alumina added. This decreased crystalline material present may notably increase heat transfer. Full crystallisation does not occur at a single temperature, and crystallisation occurs over a temperature interval (of up to 200 °C). This means that crystallisation temperature values quoted by casting powder manufacturers depend on the heat cycle and the technique used during crystallisation measurements. Several crystalline phases are usually present in solidified casting slag and these crystalline phases are strongly influenced by the alumina content: the stable crystalline phases may change as alumina content increases. For the current alumina increase in <b>casting</b> <b>powders</b> the effect on viscosity is small, while crystallisation behaviour may be influenced to a greater extent.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} at Outokumpu Tornio Works {{in order to}} examine the properties of films between the mould and steel shell during the continuous casting of stainless steel. Film sampling was carried out in the tail-out phase {{at the end of the}} cast. The films were subjected to chemical analyses and respective compounds and phases were distinguished. Local heat fluxes were measured with thermocouples and the resulting data was subjected to analyses. No previous study utilising equivalent sampling and analysis has been reported. Several massive samples were collected, a number of which were several millimetres in thickness and covered virtually the entire width of the mould, descending 40 cm below the meniscus. Analysis showed that the flux films could explain some of the very low, local heat fluxes that were observed. The most typical feature in the sampled films was the layer dominated by a cuspidine phase. The crystalline structure of these films had either formed during solidification, or via the devitrification process. Following a high cooling rate and short residence time prior to sampling, glassy structures were found. Most of these findings accord well with the literature. Such crystalline structures are to be expected in these conditions, via either direct formation or devitrification. Evidence from the literature confirms that the layers in the films were formed during the longer period of the casting process and not during tail-out. The most unexpected feature was the formation of a separate NaF layer, and the formation of elemental sodium (Na), and probably sometimes potassium (K), against the mould wall. The study found that the films can have residence times of as much as several hours on the mould wall, and complex structures containing several sub layers, voids and pores can develop. With the aid of temperature recordings, evidence of fracturing was found in the sampled films. Variation was seen in the appearance of surfaces on the mould side. There were variations between samples from different heats, and local variations in centimetre scale.

The {{effects of}} high energy milling on tin bronze with the {{composition}} Cu- 24. 6 wtSn {{have been examined}} using hardness testing, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. High energy milling has caused mechanical alloying of an elemental copper and tin powder blend, and mechanical milling of a <b>cast</b> <b>powder</b> and a melt quenched powder. Nanocrystalline grains with a size between 5 nm and 50 nm have been directly observed in the final milled powder. The powder consist of the a phase and 8 phase and is partially amorphous. An extension of the solid solution solubility has also been detected due to milling. The formation of the metastable tin-rich 11 phase has been observed in the intermediate stage of mechanical alloying of the elemental powder blend due to the higher diffusivity of tin in copper over copper in tin. The formation of the 11 phase during mechanical alloying of tin bronze with the composition Cu- 24. 6 wtSn has not been reported before. The morphological development of the three initial powders has proceeded by different mechanisms during milling due to the different hardness and toughness of the starting powders. Milling of the elemental powder blend and the <b>cast</b> <b>powder</b> proceeds via classic mechanisms for milling of ductile powders and brittle powders respectively, while milling of the tougher melt quenched powder proceeds via {{a combination of the}} two mechanisms. An attempt to process the milled powder into a bulk state using various thermomechanical techniques while still retaining a nanocrystalline grain size has not succeeded. The high diffusivity of the material at elevated temperatures has led to grain growth into the micrometer range even at relatively low thermo-mechanical processing temperatures.
