40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of wood <b>plastic</b> <b>composite</b> extrusion. Covered in this work is a brief introduction to wood <b>plastic</b> <b>composites,</b> the equipment and processing unit operations required to manufacture wood <b>plastic</b> <b>composites,</b> and the basic material properties of wood <b>plastic</b> <b>composites.</b> This paper is intended as a introductory pedagogical tool for discussing the basics of wood <b>plastic</b> <b>composite</b> extrusion...|$|R
5000|$|A polymer is {{generally}} manufactured by step-growth polymerization or addition polymerization. When combined with various agents to enhance {{or in any}} way alter the material properties of polymers the result {{is referred to as}} a <b>plastic.</b> <b>Composite</b> <b>plastics</b> refer to those types of plastics that result from bonding two or more homogeneous materials with different material properties to derive a final product with certain desired material and mechanical properties. Fibre-reinforced plastics are a category of <b>composite</b> <b>plastics</b> that specifically use fibre materials to mechanically enhance the strength and elasticity of plastics.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{increased}} risk of vandalism to curbside mailboxes, numerous vandal-resistant boxes made of <b>composite</b> <b>plastic</b> or heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate have also entered the market. Some composite mailboxes made of resilient polymer plastics and mounted on ground spikes can resist severe impacts from baseball bats or even being {{run over by a}} vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other type}} of {{external}} frame which recently was proposed, is made from <b>composite</b> <b>plastic</b> which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also {{it is a kind}} of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature. In this type of backpack, load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps. This non-flexible structure diminishes the momentum at lumbar region of the back. Strap curvature is shaped close to spine curvature and there are two flexible drawstrings to prevent backpack movement in transverse plane. The straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a white glass wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces, which could be produced through walking. This backpack type is an experimental sample that need further options to be prepared for [...] usage. One of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying.|$|E

50|$|The metal inserts {{provide support}} for bearings, shafts, gears and other metal {{components}} of the gearbox. The composite gear housing does not remove heat as efficiently as an aluminum or magnesium housing. Composite gear housings require more expensive and reliable cooling systems. However, <b>composite</b> <b>plastic</b> material is widely used on low-power applications such as gear motors for electromechanical actuators. Lightly loaded rotary gear actuators can be completely made of <b>composite</b> <b>plastic</b> material. Such electromechanical rotary actuators are installed, for example, on power windows of automobiles. Higher loaded actuators can contain metallic gears inside plastic composite housing for reduction of cost and corrosion resistance.|$|E
