40|$|In {{waterjet}}/abrasive waterjet (WJ/AWJ) <b>cutting</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the components}} of both the ultra high-pressure (UHP) intensifier and the cutting head are subject to faults and performance degradation. Abrasive particles are responsible for focusing tube wear and orifice breakage, whereas challenging pressure conditions {{are responsible for the}} wear and cracks of UHP pump components. The impact of these factors on quality and productivity leads to the need for reliable condition-monitoring systems in WJ/AWJ shop floors. This paper investigates a new approach for the online health condition assessment of both UHP pump and cutting head components by using a single type of information source, i. e., the plunger displacement signal. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to study the effects of actual faulty components on the acquired signals during AWJ cutting.

50|$|A chopper pump is a {{centrifugal}} pump which {{is equipped with}} a <b>cutting</b> <b>system</b> to facilitate chopping/maceration of solids that are present in the pumped liquid. The main advantage of this type of pump is that it prevents clogging of the pump itself and of the adjacent piping, as all the solids and stringy materials are macerated by the chopping system. Chopper pumps exist in various configurations, including submersible and dry-installed design and they are typically equipped with an electric motor to run the impeller and to provide torque for the chopping system. Due to its high solids handling capabilities, the chopper pump is often used for pumping sewage, sludge, manure slurries, and other liquids that contain large or tough solids.|$|E
50|$|Eurogamer writer Rich Stanton {{was pleased}} with the {{creation}} of this Metal Gear spin-off expanding the franchise. It was noted that the game was close to receiving a perfect 10 were it not for issues with the camera. Other sites noted similar issues during their reviews due to the fact it could not keep up with the fast action sequences. The game's action was praised by several publications, stating it would be appealing for casual players and Metal Gear fans. Some focused on the <b>cutting</b> <b>system</b> which allowed players to slice not only enemies but also the environment, while IGN's Mitch Dyer commented on how the amount of subweapons improved the game's variety despite a lack of flow when changing them. Boss fights have also been referred as one of the game's strongest points due to its use of cutscenes and music.|$|E
50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the <b>cutting</b> <b>system.</b> An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry. A set of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the pump suction in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the hydraulic parts of the pump. A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|E
40|$|Waterjet {{technology}} finding broad application {{potential in}} different areas, due to having low cutting force required {{and the possibility}} of flexible and multi-directional cutting, is used as an alternative method over the conventional <b>cutting</b> <b>systems.</b> Waterjet technology, used firstly in excavation processes of soft rocks in mining, has increased its usability with the hydraulic excavation of coal. Nowadays, it is commonly used for block cutting in quarries and processing of natural stones for the purposes of decorative production. The method has the potential use in drilling and tunneling processes too. Recently, investigations have been carried out to enhance the usability of the technology in milling processes. In this study, an assessment of some applications of waterjet technology in mining is presented. Additionally, the technology is compared with other <b>cutting</b> <b>systems</b> used in mining in terms of various aspects as well. As a result of the study, it is determined that the cutting process with waterjet technology could be efficiently used in mining sector because of the advantages such as little material losses, not requiring any additional processes after cutting, eliminating the dust, increasing the fragmentation efficiency of rock or coal, decreasing the costs resulted from wear...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{peripheral}} bone damage induced by different <b>cutting</b> <b>systems.</b> Four devices were tested: Er:YAG laser (2. 94 mm), Piezosurgery, high-speed drill and low-speed drill. Forty-five bone sections, divided into 9 groups according to different parameters, were taken from pig mandibles within 1 h post mortem. Specimens were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, decalcified and cut in thin sections. Four different parameters were analyzed: cut precision, depth of incision, peripheral carbonization and presence of bone fragments. For statistical analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to assess equality of sample medians among groups. All sections obtained with the Er:YAG laser showed poor peripheral carbonization. The edges of the incisions were always well-shaped and regular, no melting was observed. Piezosurgery specimens revealed superficial incisions without thermal damage but with irregular edges. The sections obtained by traditional drilling showed poor peripheral carbonization, especially if obtained at lower speed. There was statistically significant differences (p< 0. 01) among the <b>cutting</b> <b>systems</b> for all analyzed parameters. Er:YAG laser, gave poor peripheral carbonization, and may be considered an effective method in oral bone biopsies and permits to obtain clear and readable tissue specimens...|$|R

5000|$|The game's <b>cutting</b> <b>system</b> allows {{players to}} engage in melee combat, {{as well as to}} {{precisely}} slash enemies and objects at will along a geometrical plane using the [...] "free slicing" [...] Blade Mode. Virtually any object in the game can be cut, including vehicles and enemies, though elements of the environment were intentionally limited to structures such as pillars and walls to better facilitate the game. Entering Blade Mode produces a special targeting reticule {{in the form of a}} transparent blue plane which can be rotated and moved, tracing orange lines across the surfaces of objects to indicate exactly where they will be cut; it can also be used to enter a bullet time state, giving players the opportunity to precisely slash targets during moments of action, such as slicing through a falling target from multiple angles before it hits the ground. These features can be employed strategically, for example disabling opponents, finding weak points and gaps in armor, severing support columns to collapse ceilings or walls onto enemies, deflecting enemy fire, or cutting through objects to remove enemy cover. However, entering into Blade Mode reduces Raiden's energy to the point that if dropped to a certain level, it cannot be used. Throughout the story the player obtains the Ripper Mode, a state which enhances Raiden's power for a limited time facilitating the use of Blade Mode.|$|E

The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] mixtures and pure stands of perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, white clover and red clover were grown in three-cut and five-cut systems at ?s, southern Norway, at a low fertilization rate (100 kg N ha? 1 year? 1). Over a three-year experiment, we found strong positive effects of species diversity on annual dry-matter yield and yield stability under both cutting frequencies. The overyielding in mixtures relative to pure stands was highest in the five-cut system {{and in the second}} year. Among the possible pairwise species interaction effects contributing to the diversity effect, the grass?grass interaction was the strongest, being significant in both <b>cutting</b> <b>systems</b> and in all years.
