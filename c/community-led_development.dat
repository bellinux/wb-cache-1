40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the new {{role played by}} local self-government units in Poland. Main factors that determine the public authorities’ capacity to become architects of coalitions for local development are identified. Coalitions are defined as partnerships linking and mobilizing stakeholders anchored in three sectors: public, economic and non-governmental. The coalition-making role of the public organs is investigated {{on the basis of}} Local Action Groups (LAGs), which are pro-developmental cross-sector organizations established in rural areas of the Podkarpackie (Sub-Carpathian) Voivodesh ip, Poland. Findings are presented that draw on quantitative and qualitative results of the research project that investigated mechanisms involved in the operation of the cross-s ector coalitions. The dominant role of the public authorities in those coalitions is demonstrated. The <b>Community-led</b> Local <b>Development</b> model {{is referred to as the}} future framework for LAGs...|$|R

40|$|Tribal (rural) {{communities}} possess assets/resources {{that can}} be utilised in {{improving the quality of}} life of their residents. The processes involved in the usage of these assets toward <b>community-led</b> <b>development</b> can determine the success or failure of the development efforts by the community. The research conducted was aimed at investigating the processes involved in utilising these assets, with reference being placed on two <b>community-led</b> <b>development</b> approaches namely Asset Based Community Development and Sustainable Livelihood Framework. The research will examine the processes that the Royal Bafokeng Nation has used in the successful development of its community. A comparison of the <b>community-led</b> <b>development</b> processes will be compared to the Integrated Sustainable Development Strategy formulated by the South African government to develop rural communities. The results indicate that development is not just about asset identification, it‟s more complex than that. If development was just about resource identification then a lot of tribal communities would be developed. Development is about the interactions between leaders, community and external sources and in the case of RBN, administration as well. It is about interaction between leaders and community in the form of participation in development efforts; interaction between leaders (and administration) with external sources such as municipalities to enhance development; and interaction between community and external sources through social capital. The results also indicate that whilst it is the duty of government to provide basic services, communities can partake in other development initiatives. That development in it‟s entirely should not be left to government if communities have the means of initiating development. That government has to improve certain aspects in their development strategies, but that it has made strides in formulating strategies to develop rural communities. The challenges for government come in the implementation of these strategies. That partnership between community and government can lead to better and sustainable development initiative...|$|E

This article examines what {{is arguably the most}} well-established example of local {{economic development}} in South Africa, namely a local government and <b>community-led</b> <b>development</b> initiative in the small rural town of Stutterheim. As the project has evolved over a decade, it has changed its development focus to reflect the changing context and various internal constraints. The study reveals that even though the project has had difficulties, its sheer survival and ability to adapt in a rapidly changing society have been important. More general lessons include the significance of key social entrepreneurs and the development of social and human capital in concert with physical and business infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Social {{innovation}} is attracting increasing attention {{in research and}} policy, heightened by continuing austerity across Europe. Therefore, this paper examines earlier research into <b>community-led</b> local <b>development</b> (CLLD) initiatives in rural areas of Europe to develop {{our understanding of the}} meaning and scope of rural social innovation. We draw on a Schumpeterian view where innovations emerge from new combinations of resources that bring about positive changes and create value in society. A Schumpeterian social innovation framework is derived as the basis for re-analysing data from previous evaluations of LEADER policy in five different national contexts. This elicits a clearer understanding of social innovation in a rural development context, identifying different processes and outcomes that create social value. As the CLLD agenda and the demand for innovation in Europe gather pace, our aspirations are to inform future research and other initiatives on how to integrate social innovation into the design and evaluation of new rural development policies and programmes...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the {{concepts}} of the learning society and <b>community-led</b> local <b>development,</b> specifically focused on community education in rural areas of the Czech Republic. The research questions are connected with the identification of objective and subjective conditions for the development of community education and with the development of activities of Rural Community Schools, both from the supply and demand perspectives. The aim is fulfilled through a secondary analysis of Rural Community Schools’ websites and mainly through primary research carried out by interviewing techniques {{with a high level of}} standardisation, conducted with the main actors (Community Coordinators) of Rural Community Schools. The results of the study show the higher importance of subjective conditions for the successful development of community education in the Czech Republic. The paper also identifies the demand for educational activities provided by Rural Community Schools as a positive factor in their development. On the other hand, weaknesses could mainly be seen in cooperation with local partners. This is also the main possibility or necessity for their successful future development...|$|R
40|$|In the UK a {{consensus}} has emerged that renewable energy generation should be increased. Following public opposition to large-scale installations, interest {{has grown in}} the potential for community-based renewable energy developments, {{with high levels of}} local participation. Bottom up development processes are expected to deliver locally appropriate projects more likely to win public support, bring socio-economic and environmental benefits to rural areas and increase public engagement with sustainable energy issues. This thesis investigates the development and impacts of community renewable energy projects in rural Cumbria to assess the validity of these expectations. A series of in-depth case studies was undertaken to compare development of projects at different stages, with a focus on woodfuel heating. The research used an action research approach and grounded theory methodology for data analysis, as these techniques are appropriate for the study of complex, real-world problems. Abstract Title: Author: Submitted: The development and impacts of community renewable energy projects in rural Cumbria, UK Jennifer Claire Rogers, BSc October 2010 Considerable support for the concept of community-based renewable energy generation was found, alongside widespread enthusiasm for low-level participation in project <b>development.</b> <b>Community-led</b> project <b>development</b> was less attractive but can be successful in well-defined socially-cohesive communities where individuals have the skills, motivation and support to drive a bottom-up development process. Processes of project development as well as project outcomes were found to have positive impacts, although increased engagement with sustainable energy issues through community renewables did not necessarily lead to energy behaviour change. Overall the research indicated there is potential for community renewables which has by no means been realised yet, but that greater institutional support will be required for successful conversion of local ideas and enthusiasm into practical projects. Given that opportunities for community renewables are highly context-dependent the most effective support structures are likely to be locally-specific and responsive, and include more proactive approaches to identify and exploit opportunities with communities where independent local leadership does not emerge.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview and critical analysis of theories on economic development in rural regions in advanced countries. For this purpose, we have consulted literature in regional economics and the multidisciplinary field of rural studies. In order to analyse to which extent these theories are supported by empirical evidence, we have applied the method of pattern-matching to 18 case studies in leading and lagging rural regions in the EU. The matching {{results show that the}} mixed exogenous/endogenous development approach, the <b>community-led</b> <b>development</b> theory and the first hypothesis of Bryden's theory on the exploitation of social and cultural capital are widely supported by empirical evidence from the case studies. Broadly speaking, these theories relate economic development¿¿given the availability of labour and capital¿¿to a high capacity of local actors and strong internal and external network...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{regional}} {{policies of the}} Commonwealth Government 2 ̆ 7 s 1994 Working Nation White Paper and assesses its subsequent impact on this policy area. It outlines the recessionary macroeconomic context which allowed the emergence of Working Nation, and considers the innovation and feasibility of those policies. The paper then examines the main currents of regional policy at national and state levels since Working Nation, identifying principal dimensions including: an emphasis on network-based, <b>community-led</b> <b>development,</b> industry clusters as the main initiator of growth, {{and the influence of}} environmental concerns in generating selective regional responses from governments. However an increasing emphasis on major cities as a source of global competitive advantage has seen the states focus discretionary development resources on the capital cities, whilst accompanying re-regulation of industrial relations has widened the metropolitan/non-metropolitan wages gap. The paper concludes that reinvigorating regional policy needs a balanced and more supportive approach from all governments in place of the present minimalist and individualist approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the general concept of {{knowledge}} society and deals with regional development theories which emphasize local environment as an important part of rural development. The following two questions were studied: (1) What is the early experience of municipalities when establishing a Community School? (2) In which other municipalities would it be possible and appropriate to build such a school? For this purpose, both secondary and primary research methods were combined with data collection techniques – document study, observation, and questioning. Because the examined problem is set in the context of <b>community-led</b> local <b>development</b> (CLLD), violation of the ‘bottom-up’ approach principle is also highlighted. The paper presents the first experiences in the establishment of seven Community Schools within the Pilsen region and based on them also recommendations for the feasibility and suitability of establishing this type of school in other rural municipalities. The results show that the educational sector is not assisting in the modernization of rural schools with regard to community education and that the possibility of the contemporary and meaningful existence of schools in small rural municipalities remains ignored...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of <b>community-led</b> local <b>development,</b> this {{research}} aims to understand the blend of top down and bottom up influences that combine in campaigns for improved rural broadband provision. The representativeness of the membership of rural community broadband initiatives and the motivations and dominant arguments behind their campaigns are analysed {{from the perspective of}} neo-endogenous development, which concerns endogenous actors linking to exogenous networks and resources to raise “the potential of local areas to shape their own futures” (Ray, 2001, p 4). A sample of community-led broadband initiatives in the UK and Netherlands are studied as a precursor to two in-depth case studies in the province of Groningen and the county of Lincolnshire. The identification of key success factors enables an assessment of the scope for different rural regions to overcome the digital divide. The role of actors from within the community, the level of financial and other material resources available to them, their organisational and communication skills, network relations and the area specific/place-based nature of the arguments will all be analysed to test the theory of neo-endogenous rural development. Findings can be used to advise other community broadband initiatives and to advise policymakers how best to assess the degree (if any) and type of support that can boost community-led initiatives...|$|R
