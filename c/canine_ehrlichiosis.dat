40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the prevalence and identify possible clinicopathologic {{indicators of the}} diseases associated with canine epistaxis. METHODS: The medical records of 61 dogs with epistaxis were reviewed. RESULTS: Systemic diseases, diagnosed in fifty-six dogs, included canine leishmaniasis in twenty-three dogs, <b>canine</b> monocytic <b>ehrlichiosis</b> in twenty-two, concurrent canine leishmaniasis and <b>canine</b> monocytic <b>ehrlichiosis</b> in six, rodenticide toxicity in two and primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, suspected oestrogen toxicity and systemic arterial hypertension in one dog each. Intranasal diseases were documented in the remaining five dogs, including transmissible venereal tumour in three dogs, and nasal adenocarcinoma and nasal aspergillosis in one dog each. Mucosal pallor and a generalised bleeding tendency were significantly more common among dogs with <b>canine</b> monocytic <b>ehrlichiosis</b> compared with those with canine leishmaniasis, whereas the opposite was true for peripheral lymphadenomegaly. Also, dogs with <b>canine</b> monocytic <b>ehrlichiosis</b> presented with pancytopenia more frequently compared with those with canine leishmaniasis; in the latter dogs, the median values of haematocrit, leucocyte and platelet counts and serum total protein concentrations were higher. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Canine leishmaniasis and <b>canine</b> monocytic <b>ehrlichiosis</b> are the leading causes of canine epistaxis in Greece.

Blood samples were collected from dogs suspected of having a positive diagnosis for <b>canine</b> <b>ehrlichiosis.</b> Amplification of the p 28 gene by PCR produced an 843 -bp fragment and this assay could detect DNA from one gene copy among 1 billion cells.

Among the p 28 -based PCR negative samples, 55. 3 % were co-negatives, but 27. 6 % were positive in 16 S rRNA and dsb based PCR assays.

DNA from one canine blood sample was subjected to PCR with primers designed to amplify Ehrlichia (Cowdria) ruminantium ruminantium 16 S and map 1 genes.

By Western blotting antibodies to several immunodominant E. canis proteins were detected in serum from immunized dogs and antibody titres increased after each immunization. The complement of immunogenic proteins recognized by the antisera were similar to those recognized in serum from infected dogs. Upon challenge with live E. canis, rapid anamnestic humoral responses were detected in the serum of immunized dogs and primary antibody responses were detected in the serum from control dogs. Following immunization, a lymphocyte proliferative response (cellular immunity) was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNs) of immunized dogs upon stimulation with E. canis antigens.
