40|$|Abstract — The triple <b>concentric</b> <b>pipes</b> heat {{exchanger}} is an improved version of double pipe {{heat exchanger}}. Most {{of the previous}} study on the heat exchanger is confined to two fluids and few of many possible flow arrangements. The present study involves the sizing of triple <b>concentric</b> <b>pipes</b> heat exchanger where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction. This paper proposes a basic procedure for calculating overall heat transfer coefficients and length of triple <b>concentric</b> <b>pipes</b> heat exchanger. Length of triple pipe heat exchanger is computed for a required temperature drop of hot water with available dimensions of three pipes by LMTD method. Overall heat transfer coefficient and length of the equivalent double pipe heat exchanger are {{compared with that of}} the triple pipe heat exchanger. The theoretical analysis shows that introducing an intermediate pipe to the double pipe heat exchanger reduces effective length of heat exchanger, which results in savings in material and space.

30|$|To {{improve the}} manipulability of arc-shaped forceps, this paper {{discusses}} {{the method of}} {{the design of the}} shaft axis. Usually, <b>concentric</b> <b>pipe</b> structures are used to transmit the rotational motion of the proximal end to the distal end of the gripper. In this method, the shape of the bent inner pipe is {{different from that of the}} outer pipe. This causes strong contact between the outer and inner pipes if the inner pipe has strong flexural rigidity. This causes a large friction torque and a large angle difference (twist angle) between the distal end and the proximal end of the inner pipe. A low friction and elastic plastic-tube for the inner pipe would be valid to reduce the required torque. However, the Young’s modulus of plastic is significantly lower than that of metal and the torsional rigidity is also low, which results in a large twist angle. This paper proposes a procedure to fit the bent inner pipe to the outer pipe such that only the ends of the pipes are in contact with each other. The inner pipe with slits adjusts its flexural rigidity. The proposed method can be applied to various curves.|$|E

30|$|Arc-shaped forceps are {{important}} in pharyngeal cancer surgery, endoscopic sinus surgery, and single port surgery. Rotating the gripper of an arc-shaped forceps with respect to its shaft axis can improve the manipulability of the forceps. <b>Concentric</b> <b>pipe</b> structures consisting of inner and outer pipes are often used for this purpose. The inner pipe transmits rotations from its proximal end to distal end. However, {{the shape of the}} bent inner pipe is generally {{different from that of the}} outer pipe, and this causes large friction between the outer and inner pipes. To reduce friction, a plastic tube is often used for the inner pipe. However, since its torsional rigidity is low, this results in a large twist angle. This paper proposes a procedure to fit a metal bent inner pipe to an outer pipe by adjusting the flexural rigidity of the inner pipe with slits to reduce the friction. The procedure minimizes the twist angle between the proximal and distal end of the arc-shaped forceps by reducing the torque required to rotate its metal inner pipe. We develop a 5 mm forceps with a 3.5  mm inner pipe. The twist angle is 2.8 ° when a load torque of 20 Nmm is applied, which is a typical load torque for suturing, whereas the twist angle of a PEEK (polyetheretherketone) inner pipe is 24.3 ° in simulation. Ex vivo experiments show that the required forceps torque is small in simulated clinical scenarios.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} setup {{of double}} pipe heat exchanger fouling test rig {{was built to}} investigate the mineral scale deposition on different heat exchanger pipe surfaces. Progressive fouling deposition on different material surfaces under the similar solution conditions were observed and analyzed. Measurable data on the progressive build-up of scale deposits, deposition rate, {{as well as the}} composition and crystal morphology of the deposits were studied after each experimental run by analyzing the deposited scale on the test pipes. In this research the artificial calcium carbonate deposit on different material surfaces is considered as {{it is one of the}} major constituents of the most scales found in heat exchanging equipment. Fouling on different smooth test pipes were investigated in the centrally located larger <b>concentric</b> <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger. Uniform flow condition near the pipe surface was maintained by constant flow rate throughout the system. The calcium carbonate deposition rates on five different metal surfaces (Stainless steel 316, brass, copper, aluminium and carbon steel) were investigated. The results illustrated an upward trend for fouling rate with time on the tested specimens. The deposition on the surfaces showed a linear growth with the enhancement of thermal conductivity of the metals. However, deposition on carbon steel metal surfaces did not follow the typical linear trend of thermal conductivity over deposition as its surface was altered by corrosion effects. In addition, temperature, velocity, and concentration effects on fouling deposition were investigated on the SS 316 metal surface. It is noted that the fouling deposition increases with the increase of temperature and concentration due to enhanced deposition potential whereas reduces due to the increase of velocity which enhances shear stress. © 2017 Elsevier B.

Provisions for swirl, preheat and injection of LCV gases were incorporated with appropriate burner management systems for safe operation. Instrumentation for temperature, velocity and concentration measurements {{was developed and}} fully automated by interfacing to a microprocessor for rapid data acquisition. Flame stability limits were determined {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions by varying swirl, secondary air temperature and excess air levels while maintaining the burner momentum constant. Addition of swirl up to a limit of O~ 69 generally improved stability. Preheating secondary air alone was beneficial only if the temperature was raised to at least 250 oC. A combination of intermediate swirl and moderate preheat of the secondary air resulted in satisfactory flame stability over a wide range of calorific values of the fuel. Thus, existing <b>concentric</b> <b>pipe</b> burner systems may be easily modified at low cost to burn LCV gases of variable compositions. With LCV gas flames the excess air factor (EAF) had a major influence on values of temperature, species concentration and velocity. Unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) and CO not surprisingly increased in concentration close to the blow-off limits under the majority of operating conditions. This indicated incomplete combustion probably resulting from the lowered flame temperatures and partial flame lift-off. On the other hand, burnout efficiencies at the exhaust were reasonably high for most operating conditions involving LCV gases. The combustion data were analysed to extract the characteristic mixing and chemical reaction times the ratio of which gave the parameter epsilon, originally proposed for unconfined flames. Close to the blow-off limit epsilon took the value 4. 9 compared with 6. 2 for fully stable flames. This finding showed that the criterion was also valid for confined flames, supporting the extinction mechanism proposed by Peters and Williams, and providing an important basis for predicting stability limits and burner design parameters...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the virgin}} olive oil {{extraction}} process is mainly to obtain the best quality oil from fruits, by only applying mechanical actions while guaranteeing the highest overall efficiency. Currently, the mechanical methods used to extract virgin oils from olives are basically of two types: the discontinuous system (obsolete) and the continuous one. Anyway the system defined as ‘‘continuous” is composed of several steps which are not all completely continuous, due {{to the presence of}} the malaxer, a device that works in batch. The {{aim of the}} paper was to design, realize and test the first full scale sono-exchanger for the virgin olive oil industry, to be placed immediately after the crusher and before the malaxer. The innovative device is mainly composed of a triple <b>concentric</b> <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger combined with three ultrasound probes. This mechanical solution allows both the cell walls (which release the oil droplets) along with the minor compounds to be destroyed more effectively and the heat exchange between the olive paste and the process water to be accelerated. This strategy represents the first step towards the transformation of the malaxing step from a batch operation into a real continuous process, thus improving the working capacity of the industrial plants. Considering the heterogeneity of the olive paste, which is composed of different tissues, the design of the sono-exchanger required a thorough fluid dynamic analysis. The thermal effects of the sono-exchanger were monitored by measuring the temperature of the product at the inlet and the outlet of the device; in addition, the measurement of the pigments concentration in the product allowed monitoring the mechanical effects of the sono-exchanger.

40|$|Thermal {{spallation}} of rock may {{be defined}} as a type of progressive rock failure caused by the creation of thermal stresses induced by a sudden application of heat from a high temperature source. This technology is applicable to only certain types of hard rock, such as dolomite, taconite, and granite. In 1981 and 1982, the deepest holes ever drilled by this process were drilled in granite to depths of 1086 feet and 425 feet respectively. Penetration rates {{at the bottom of the}} deeper hole reached a maximum of 100 ft/hr. Because of these high rates, considerable interest was generated concerning the use of this technology for the drilling of deep holes. Based on this interest, this study was undertaken to evaluate the technical and economic aspects of the technology in general. This methodology has been used for blasthole drilling, the cutting of chambers at the bottom of drilled holes, and the cutting of narrow grooves in rock. However, because of the very high temperatures generated by the flame jet and the application of the technology to only certain types of rock, other areas of use have been very limited. In this report, evaluation of the technology was performed by conceptually designing and costing a theoretical flame jet drilling rig. The design process reviews a number of different concepts of the various components needed, and then chooses those pieces of equipment that best suit the needs of the system and have the best chance of being properly developed. The final concept consists of a flexible umbilical hose containing several internal hoses for carrying the various required fluids. An evaluation of this system was then made to determine its operational characteristics. The drilling capabilities and the economics of this rig were then compared to a conventional rotary drilling rig by theoretically drilling two holes of approximately 15, 000 feet in depth. This comparison was done by use of a spread sheet type computer program. The results of this study indicate that flame jet drilling performs significantly better in both time and cost. These results are due primarily to the high penetration rates, the reduced number of trips, and the decreased trip time due to the use of the umbilical. However, this significant time and cost advantage must be tempered by the fact that they are based on the assumption that the main components of the flame jet rig can be realistically and reliably built. Unfortunately, the use of an umbilical system presents very realistic and difficult design problems as hole depth extends beyond 7000 feet. Thus, unless a significant market for the use of this equipment can be found, further development of an umbilical type system is very questionable. An alternate system suggests by LASL may circumvent many of the problems stated. This concept consists of using concentric pipes and a down hole fluid separation system. <b>Concentric</b> <b>pipe</b> built by the Walker-Neer Manufacturing Company, Wichita Falls, Texas, has been used successfully in the drilling industry for years.

The spray model involves multi-phase flow phenomena and requires the numerical solution of conservation equations for the gas and the liquid phase simultaneously. With respect to the liquids phase, the discrete-droplet method (DDM) is used. The droplet-gas momentum exchange, droplet coalesces and breaks-up, and the droplet-wall interaction with wall-film generation and entrainment of the water droplet back into the gas stream are taken into account in this investigation. To be consistent with the experiments the experimental air water mixture on the liquid carry over (LCO) curve is used for the numerical investigation. The standard k-e{open} turbulence model is used for turbulence closure. The predicted results from the modified Eulerian-Lagrangian multi-phase model explain the complex flow behavior inside the separator and are in good agreement when compared with experiments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConvective heat {{transfer}} prediction of evaporative processes {{is more complicated}} than the {{heat transfer}} prediction of single-phase convective processes. This {{is due to the fact}} that physical phenomena involved in evaporative processes are very complex and vary with the vapor quality that increases gradually as more fluid is evaporated. Power-law correlations used for prediction of evaporative convection have proved little accuracy when used in practical cases. In this investigation, neural-network-based models have been used as a tool for prediction of the thermal performance of evaporative units. For this purpose, experimental data were obtained in a facility that includes a counter-flow <b>concentric</b> <b>pipes</b> heat exchanger with R 134 a refrigerant flowing inside the circular section and temperature controlled warm water moving through the annular section. This work also included the construction of an inverse Rankine refrigeration cycle that was equipped with measurement devices, sensors and a data acquisition system to collect the experimental measurements under different operating conditions. Part of the data were used to train several neural-network configurations. The best neural-network model was then used for prediction purposes and the results obtained were compared with experimental data not used for training purposes. The results obtained in this investigation reveal the convenience of using artificial neural networks as accurate predictive tools for determining convective heat transfer rates of evaporative processes...|$|R
