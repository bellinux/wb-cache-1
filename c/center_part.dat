25|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of uranium dioxide is low; it {{is affected by}} porosity and burn-up. The burn-up results in fission products being dissolved in the lattice (such as lanthanides), the precipitation of fission products such as palladium, the formation of fission gas bubbles due to fission products such as xenon and krypton and radiation damage of the lattice. The low {{thermal conductivity}} can lead to overheating of the <b>center</b> <b>part</b> of the pellets during use. The porosity results in a decrease in both the thermal conductivity of the fuel and the swelling which occurs during use.|$|E
