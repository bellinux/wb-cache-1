40|$|Dysplastic nodule (DN) is an {{important}} stage for precancerous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions progressing to HCC and has a very high risk of <b>canceration.</b> According to the difference in atypia, DN is classified into low-grade DN (LGDN) and high-grade DN (HGDN). This article summarizes the pathological features, radiological features, and biomarkers of LGDN and HGDN, briefly describes {{the risk of the}} <b>canceration</b> of DN into HCC, and points out {{that it is necessary to}} enhance the knowledge of DN, the precancerous HCC lesions, in clinical physicians.

40|$|Abstract. The {{involvement}} of tumor-associated macrophages in tumor progression is an indisputable fact. However, whether the growth-promotion effects of macrophages towards tumors in the aggressive stage affect their own <b>canceration</b> remains unknown. In the present study, human glioma stem/progenitor cells transfected with red fluorescent protein gene (SU 3 ‑RFP) were seeded inside the abdominal cavity of transgenic nude mice, of which all nucleated cells could express green fluores-cent protein (GFP), forming a tumor {{model with a}} double‑color RFP/GFP fluorescent tracer. Ascites and tumor nodules from tumor‑bearing mice were cultured, then the GFP+ cells were separated for clonal culture and further related phenotypic characterization and tumorigenicity tests. It was observed that the GFP+ cells isolated from ascites and solid tumors exhibited unlimited proliferative potential; the monoclonal cells were mouse-original, had a cancer cell phenotype and expressed the macrophage marker protein CD 68. Thus, in the abdominal tumor model with double‑color fluorescent tracer, macrophages recruited by tumor cells not only promoted tumor cell growth, but also exhibited their own <b>canceration.</b> This discovery is significant for the further study of tumor tissue remodeling and the tumor microenvironment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traditionally, cancer {{research}} has focused on protein-coding genes, which are considered the principal effec-tors and regulators of tumorigenesis. Non-coding RNAs, in particular microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have been widely reported to be important in the regulation of tumorigenesis and cancer development. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, investigation of the expression profiles of lncRNAs and a comparison of the involvement of lncRNAs, miRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in esopha-geal tumorigenesis and development have not previously been performed. In the current study, intrinsic associations among the expression profiles of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs from normal esophageal tissues and those from cancer tissues were investigated. Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to detect the expression profiles of the three types of RNA in the cancera-tion processes of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues. It was demonstrated that the different RNAs exhibit associated patterns of expression among normal esoph-ageal epithelium, low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN), and carcinoma tissues, particularly in the critical period of <b>canceration</b> (HGIN to ESCC). Furthermore, the results indicated a high level of similarity in the potential function of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in the processes of ESCC development. In the current study, a first generation atlas of lncRNA profiling and its asso-ciation with miRNAs and mRNAs in the <b>canceration</b> processes of ESCC were presented...|$|E
40|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} the seventh most common cancer {{worldwide}} among females and accounts for about 40 % of cancers of the uterus in Japan. An increase in incidence {{and a reduction in}} onset age of this disease are also likely, which makes it important to define the pathogenesis and develop effective treatment. However, the mechanism of <b>canceration</b> in the endometrium is unclear and development of endometrial cancer cannot be explained only by mutations of cancer-related genes. In contrast, epigenetic analyses have shown the importance of aberrant DNA hypermethylation in the <b>canceration</b> mechanism. In development of type 1 endometrial cancer, breakdown of the DNA mismatch repair system plays a large role, with changes in the human mutL homologue 1 (hMLH 1) gene being of most importance. Studies to detect aberrant DNA hypermethylation of cancer cells present in microscopic amounts in vivo and to apply these data to diagnosis of cancer have been started. Epigenetic changes have also been examined as a marker of sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Aberrant hypermethylation of checkpoint with forkhead-associated and ring finger (CHFR), a mitotic phase checkpoint gene, is correlated with sensitivity to treatment with microtubule inhibitors and may be a marker for the response of endometrial cancer to anticancer drugs. Epigenetic aberrant DNA methylation of other genes may also be useful as clinical biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMolecular {{dynamics}} (MD) calculations for {{the plasma}} membranes of normal murine thymocytes and thymus-derived leukemic GRSL cells in water {{have been performed}} under physiological isothermal–isobaric conditions (310. 15 K and 1 atm) to investigate changes in membrane properties induced by <b>canceration.</b> The model membranes used in our calculations for normal and leukemic thymocytes comprised 23 and 25 kinds of lipids, respectively, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol. The mole fractions of the lipids adopted here were based on previously published experimental values. Our calculations clearly showed that the membrane area was increased in leukemic cells, and that the isothermal area compressibility of the leukemic plasma membranes was double that of normal cells. The calculated membranes of leukemic cells were thus considerably bulkier and softer in the lateral direction {{compared with those of}} normal cells. The tilt angle of the cholesterol and the conformation of the phospholipid fatty acid tails both showed a lower level of order in leukemic cell membranes compared with normal cell membranes. The lateral radial distribution function of the lipids also showed a more disordered structure in leukemic cell membranes than in normal cell membranes. These observations all show that, for the present thymocytes, the lateral structure of the membrane is considerably disordered by <b>canceration.</b> Furthermore, the calculated lateral self-diffusion coefficient of the lipid molecules in leukemic cell membranes was almost double that in normal cell membranes. The calculated rotational and wobbling autocorrelation functions also indicated that the molecular motion of the lipids was enhanced in leukemic cell membranes. Thus, here we have demonstrated that the membranes of thymocyte leukemic cells are more disordered and more fluid than normal cell membranes...|$|E

40|$|Raman {{spectra of}} human {{colorectal}} tissue samples {{were employed to}} diagnose colorectal cancer. High-quality Raman spectra were acquired from normal and cancerous colorectal tissues from 81 patients. Subtle Raman variations, such as for peaks at 1134 [*]cm− 1 (protein, C-C/C-N stretching) and 1297 [*]cm− 1 (lipid, C-H 2 twisting), were observed between normal and cancerous colorectal tissues. The average peak intensity at 1134 and 1297 [*]cm− 1 was increased from approximately 235 and 72 in the normal group, respectively, to 315 and 273 in the cancer group. The variations of Raman spectra reflected the changes of cell molecules during <b>canceration.</b> The multivariate statistical methods of principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) and partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), together with leave-one-patient-out cross-validation, were employed to build the discrimination model.

Materials and Methods: The ICR mice buccal mucosa cancer model was established by injecting the mice with U 14 cells and mice was treated with insect tea. Tumor volumes and lymph node metastasis rates were determined. And the buccal mucosa tissues and cancer cervical lymph node were also checked by histology test, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blot assays. Results: The tumor volumes for the group treated with insect tea mice was smaller than those from the control mice. The sections of buccal mucosa cancer tissue showed that the <b>canceration</b> of insect tea mice was weaker than control mice. Insect tea significantly induced apoptosis in buccal mucosa tissues by upregulating Bax, caspases, and downregulating Bcl- 2. Nuclear factor-κB, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and COX- 2 gene, was significantly downregulated by insect tea, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory properties. Insect tea also exerted a great anti-metastasis effect on tissues as demonstrated by decreased expression of Matrix metalloproteinases genes and increased expression of tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases. Conclusion: The highest concentration of 1600 mg/kg oral gavage and 400 mg/mL smear insect tea showed the best anticancer effects.

The objective of this project is to investigate and evaluate level set segmentation methods for segmentation of both cell nuclei and membrane segmentation of microfilament images captured by fluorescent confocal microscopy. Based on some background investigations, the active contour methodology has been selected as the fundamental method for image segmentation. This thesis presents the methods used and reports on the results achieved for cell and nuclei segmentation using the hybrid level-set method and cell membrane segmentation using the subjective surfaces model. In addition, some initial results of nuclei segmentation in 3 -D case based on the hybrid method will be presented as well.

Morphological changes were observed in livers by histological analysis. Dynamic changes in liver and serum expression of IGF- 1 R were analyzed and quantitated by immunohistochemistry, immunoassays, and RT-PCR with DNA sequencing. The relation between IGF- 1 R expression and malignant transformation of hepatocytes was investigated at both the gene transcription and protein expression levels using rank correlation analysis. ResultsThe 2 -FAA-induced rat hepatocytes showed remarkable morphologic alterations, including granule-like degeneration and other features of precancerous to hepatoma formation, which paralleled with increases in IGF- 1 R expression. Comparison of the control rats, precancerous rats, degenerated rats, and hepatoma rats indicated differential profiles of liver IGF-IR (0, 88. 9 %, 50. 0 %, and 100 %), IGF-IR mRNA (0, 100 %, 61. 1 %, and 100 %), specific IGF-IR concentration (0. 63 ± 0. 17, 0. 66 ± 0. 14, 0. 65 ± 0. 2, and 0. 96 ± 0. 09, ng/mg wet liver), and serum IGF-IR level (1. 33 ± 0. 47, 1. 92 ± 0. 29, 1. 51 ± 0. 46, and 2. 43 ± 0. 57 ng/ml).

The in vitro anticancer effects of the salt were evaluated using a 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazolyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in TCA 8113 human tongue carcinoma cells. At 1 % concentration, the growth inhibitory rate of purple bamboo salt was 61 % {{higher than that of}} sea salt (27 %). Apoptosis analysis of the cancer cells was carried out using 4, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) staining to investigate the mechanism of the anticancer effects in tongue carcinoma cells. Purple bamboo salt induced a stronger apoptotic effect than sea salt. An Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse buccal mucosa cancer model was established by injecting mice with U 14 squamous cell carcinoma cells. Following injection, the wound at the injection site was smeared with salt samples. It was observed that the tumor volumes for the group treated with purple bamboo salt were smaller than those from the sea salt treatment and control groups. The sections of buccal mucosa cancer tissue showed that <b>canceration</b> in the purple bamboo salt group was weaker compared with that in the sea salt group. Similar results were observed in the lesion section of the cervical lymph. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting, the purple bamboo salt group demon-strated an increase in Bcl- 2 -associated X protein (Bax) and a decrease in B cell lymphoma- 2 (Bcl- 2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression, compared with the sea salt and control groups.

40|$|Abstract. The AT-rich {{interacting}} domain-containing protein 1 A gene (ARID 1 A) encodes ARID 1 A, {{a member}} of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Mutation of ARID 1 A induces changes in expression of multiple genes (CDKN 1 A, SMAD 3, MLH 1 and PIK 3 IP 1) via chromatin remodeling dysfunction, contributes to carcinogenesis, and has been shown to cause transformation of cells in associa-tion with the PI 3 K/AKT pathway. Information on ARID 1 A has emerged from comprehensive genome-wide analyses with next-generation sequencers. ARID 1 A mutations have been found in various types of cancer and occur at high frequency in endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer, including clear cell adenocarcinoma and endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and also occur at endometrial cancer especially in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. It has also been suggested that ARID 1 A mutation occurs at the early stage of <b>canceration</b> from endometriosis to endometriosis-associated carcinoma in ovarian cancer and also from atypical endo-metrial hyperplasia to endometrioid adenocarcinoma in endometrial cancer. Therefore, development of a screening method that can detect mutations of ARID 1 A and activation of the PI 3 K/AKT pathway might enable early diagnosis of endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers and endometrial cancers. Important results may also emerge from a current clinical trial examining a multidrug regimen of temsiro-limus, a small molecule inhibitor of the PI 3 K/AKT pathway, for treatment of advanced ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma with ARID 1 A mutation and PI 3 K/AKT pathway activation. Also administration of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, can inhibit cancer proliferation with PIK 3 CA mutation and resis-tance to mTOR inhibitors and GSK 126, a molecular-targeted drug can inhibit proliferation of ARID 1 A-mutated ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma cells by targeting and inhibiting EZH 2. Further studies are needed to determine the mecha-nism of chromatin remodeling dysregulation initiated by ARID 1 A mutation, to develop methods for early diagnosis, to investigate new cancer therapy targeting ARID 1 A, and to examine the involvement of ARID 1 A mutations in develop-ment, survival and progression of cancer cells...|$|E

A golden hamster model with cheek pouch dynamic <b>canceration</b> was established to receive oral treatment of ganoderma triterpenes water solution. Animals were continuously monitored, oral tissue samples were collected for histopathologic examination, {{and changes in the}} expression of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and Caspase- 3 were detected by immunohistochemical methods. Optimization of the experimental conditions allowed the identification of the optimal extraction conditions: 90 % ethanol as the extraction solvent, a solvent amount by the liquid-material ratio of 35 mL/g, extraction time of 2 h and extraction temperature of 80 °C. Under these conditions, the average extraction rate of ganoderma triterpenes was 1. 09 %. Tests in golden hamsters showed that compared with the model group during the same period, animals in the treatment group had better conditions, constantly larger number of normal cases shown by histopathologic results (P < 0. 01), and consistently smaller numbers of cases with paraplasm (P < 0. 05). Immunohistochemical results showed that compared with the model group, the treatment group had significantly lower (P < 0. 05) rates of positive VEGF expression in the normal state, simple epithelial hyperplasia, epithelial dysplasia or squamous cell carcinoma disease stages.

Neke promjene, kao što su primjerice maligna leukoplakija, {{melanosis}} circumscripta praecancerosa, erythroplasia Queyrat i morbus Bowen mogu se smatrati premalignim lezijama, jer se kao takve mogu histopatološki dokazati.

Nasuprot njima neke prekanceroze su samo eventualno potencijalno metaplastičke tvorbe kojih aktualni histopatološki supstrat još ne pokazuje bitnih odstupanja u smislu kancerizacije pa je njihov skupni naziv »predispozicije oralne sluznice za razvoj karcinoma« samo klinički termin, koji ne obvezuje na malignu alternaciju. Takva su oboljenja primjerice lichen ruber, pemphigus vulgaris, Plummer-Vinsonov sindrom i još neke druge. Posebnu skupinu prekanceroza čine patološke promjene oralne sluznice, koje su direktne posljedice mehaničkih ili kemijskih iritacija.

Precancerous {{conditions of}} the oral mucosa are a fairly well defined concept {{in view of the}} pathohistological substrate of the lesions, but there is a certain vagueness with regard to the clinical diagnostics of a number of changes which are only potentially cancerogenic. Some changes, such as e. g. malignant leucoplakia melanosis circumscripta praecancerosa, erythroplasia Queyrat and Morbus Bowen may be considered as premalignant lesions since histopathology may it confirm. The dynamicsof hereditary factors in their appearance has not yet been entirely cleared. Reversely, some precancerous conditions are only potentially metaplastic whose actual histo-pathological substrate does not as yet show any essential deviations in the sense of <b>canceration.</b> Therefore the collective term »Predisposition of the oral mucosa to the development of carcinoma« is a clinical term only and does not necessarily indicate malignant alternation. Such afflictions are for example Lichen ruber Pemphigus Vulgaris, Plummer-Vinson 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome and some others. A separate group of precancerous conditions consists of pathological changes of the oral mucosa which are the result of mechanical or chemical irritations. Their chronic persistence develops them into malignant lesions under so far unknown conditions. Such changes are the ulceration of the edge of the prosthesis chronic cheilitis, galvanism of the oral mucosa and the like. The effect of chemical nutritional cancerogenic substances on the mucosa of the oral cavity has so far not been studied in detail. The role of the stomatologist in detecting, diagnosing and prescribing treatment for these precancerous conditions is quite significant.
