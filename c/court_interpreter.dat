At a young age, he was chosen to attend the Chiefs' Children's School (later renamed Royal School). He was taught by the American missionary Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke, alongside his siblings and thirteen of their royal cousins, who were declared eligible to succeed to the Hawaiian throne.

40|$|Many {{countries}} have developed statutory provisions governing norms and {{standards of practice}} (NSPs) for <b>court</b> <b>interpreters.</b> However, in South Africa, {{in the case of}} State versus Naidoo (1962 : 631), Judge Williamson states that “in relation to the courts of this country, {{there appears to be no}} statutory provision, Rule of Court or regulation governing the position of interpreters”. If Judge Williamson’s statement is true, <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> could be perceived as working without proper guidance from a statute containing NSPs for <b>court</b> <b>interpreters.</b> This situation might result in <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> working according to their own personal preferences, each creating and abiding by his or her own NSPs. In turn, this could lead to poor interpreting practices, as there would be no application of common NSPs which <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> are to follow and for which they need to be held accountable. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the statement by Judge Williamson is true, and if so, how the lack of NSPs for <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> could affect their work. This aim was achieved by examining the Personne...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa {{there is}} no {{legislation}} defining the role of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters.</b> This has resulted in legal officials (magistrates and judges) forming their own opinions {{as to what the}} role of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> is. As such <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> find themselves performing tasks that are outside their scope of duties, for example acting as magistrates, in turn compromising their own tasks in the process. The aim of this study therefore is to determine {{the degree to which the}} lack of a definition of the role of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> affects the quality of court interpreting. In the study, the researcher was guided by the Descriptive Translation Studies (DTS) approach. The research procedures that were followed in the study combined the top-down and bottom-up approaches. In the top-down approach, two legislations, namely, “The Magistrates’ Court Act 44 of 1944 (as amended) ” and “The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 93 of 1996 (as amended) ”, were examined in order to determine whether the role of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> is defined and, if so, to what extent. In the bottom-up approach, examples of court proceedings were studied in order to determine specific roles that are played by <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> during trials. Extracts from transcripts of mechanically-recorded court proceedings were also analysed to establish whether magistrates made any references to the role of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> in these trials. It is hoped that this study will shed more light on the role of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> which could lead to better quality interpreting. Linguistics and Modern LanguagesM. A.

It aims to explore the work conditions of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> in the Czech Republic. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part describes general features of court interpreting, the legal framework of court interpreting in the Czech Republic, the settings of court interpreting and the role of different participants of criminal proceedings. The second part examines the status of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> in the Czech Republic through a questionnaire-based survey and interviews with <b>court</b> <b>interpreters,</b> representatives of <b>courts</b> and police officers. The survey showed that state authorities are not fully aware of the difficulty of court interpreting and do not create entirely suitable conditions for its practice. Considering also the low compensation of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters,</b> their status in the Czech Republic is rather problematic.

40|$|<b>Court</b> <b>interpreters</b> have seldom been {{featured}} in studies on the criminal courts. Until recently, cases requiring <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> were rare and marginal. The peculiarity and historical rarity of these cases may explain the lack of academic consideration {{of the work of}} <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> in the criminal justice literature. Rapid demographic changes brought about by mass migration, however, are changing the make-up of criminal justice proceedings, rendering <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> key participants and inexorable aides for the everyday running of the criminal justice system. This article examines the increased reliance on interpreters and the nature of their involvement in criminal justice proceedings. It will explore the relationship between interpreters and defendants, on the one hand, and between interpreters, counsels, and judges, on the other. Drawing on empirical data stemming from a research project on foreign national defendants conducted in Birmingham’s criminal courts, we explore issues of trust and reliability underpinning the intervention of <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> and the implications of these interventions for the defendant’s case. The use of interpreters aims first and foremost to ensure the defendant’s right to defense. Yet, as we show, their intervention is often propelled or hindered by instrumental, procedural, or logistical reasons, intimately linked to the rapid transformation of the demography of defendants and the privatization of services related to the criminal justice system. ...|$|R
40|$|This is a corpus-based {{study that}} investigates {{instances}} in which <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> in Hong Kong deviate from using direct speech and the first person, notwithstanding the requirement to use both of these when rendering statements made by witnesses or defendants. Quantitative data indicate that <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> do adhere to this requirement when interpreting Cantonese into English, but deviate from it when interpreting English into Cantonese. These {{data suggest that the}} use of reported speech and/or of the third person has identification functions that help Cantonese-speaking witnesses and defendants follow court proceedings and serve the pragmatic function of adding illocutionary force to interpreted utterances. Data from interviews with interpreters and legal professionals suggest that some latitude is exercised and tolerated when interpreters deviate from using direct speech and/or the first person when the target language is Cantonese. The findings indicate that <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> in the corpus observe strict professional guidelines by using direct speech most of the time, but occasional deviation from the direct approach suggests that <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> are able to make discretionary decisions to facilitate communication.

40|$|Complying {{with the}} rules of {{professional}} ethics during court interpreting {{is one of the}} most significant aspects of the <b>court</b> <b>interpreter’s</b> profession. Although associations of translators and interpreters draw up sets of rules in the form of professional codes, most of the practicing interpreters are not well acquainted with them, especially as the curricula of translation studies do not include ethics. The aim of this article is to present how the prescriptive norms of professional conduct can be applied in practice during court interpreting. The interpreters’ performance is discussed in view of their adherence to the principle of impartiality, on the example of the interpreted criminal proceedings in the Austrian court. The analysis reveals that <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> tend to violate this principle, by modifying the interpreted statements, lack of loyalty to the speaker, showing emotions or by assuming the role of a judge’s helper. The research further shows that the prescriptive rules are not always congruent with reality, as the ethical performance of the interpreter is often determined by the expectations of the other participants of the procedure. Due to the above, it seems vital to draw the attention of both the <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> and the representatives of the legal profession to the ethical aspect of court interpreting.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on ethical issues arising {{from the use of}} {{videoconference}} interpreting in courts in England and Wales. It draws on a theoretical framework informed by Camayd-Freixas (2013) and four paradigms of ethics, namely: pre-existing rules, consequentialism, moral sentiments, and virtue ethics. The ethical problems and inner conflicts experienced by Camayd-Freixas allow parallels to be drawn with the situation in England and Wales where the <b>court</b> <b>interpreter’s</b> Code of Professional Conduct does not provide any specific guidelines on Videoconference Interpreting (VCI). Questions arise as to the nature of perceived and actual ethical issues that occur in VCI, compared to face-to-face interpreted court hearings, which may also be affected by VCI in mode A (when the interpreter is present in the court room) or VCI in mode B (when the interpreter is with the witness or defendant at a remote location). The discussion is supported by findings from three semi-structured interviews conducted with <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> in England and Wales. This article argues that specific ethical issues arise in VCI (in mode A and/or B), and as <b>court</b> <b>interpreters</b> tend to prioritise a deontological approach when they rationalise ethical issues, they are ill-equipped to respond to such issues as they occur...|$|R
