50|$|Better Place {{was started}} by Shai Agassi on October 29, 2007, {{focusing}} on building massive scale Electric Recharge Grids as infrastructure to support the deployment of electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrids). The company had said it was in talks with more than 25 countries around the world. Better Place called themselves the first Electric Recharge Grid Operator (ERGO) and was developing <b>commercial</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> networks in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Israel, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. Better Place planned to include battery switching, or swapping, stations in their network which would allow drivers to quickly exchange an electric vehicle's discharged battery pack for a fully charged pack. In Better Place's business model, the battery pack {{is owned by the}} network operator who then bills the electric vehicle owner for use of the battery based on distance traveled.|$|E

A new model that integrates routing constraints, speed profiles, energy consumption, and vehicle ownership costs is developed. The model {{is applied to the}} study the competitiveness of three commercial vehicles: a widely available conventional diesel truck and two brands of electric trucks. Scenarios and breakeven points are calculated and analyzed for a large number parameter combination. The results show that route feasibility, minimum fleet size, distance traveled, battery life, purchase costs, and planning horizon are among the most significant factors affecting <b>commercial</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2013 by Renault. Published {{and used}} by INCOSE with permission. Abstract. In this paper, we present the {{contribution}} of game theory to the search of architectural equilibrium {{in the context of}} complex systems engineering. Our design approach is based on the use of an architectural design framework and of optimization models, illustrated by a practical example in which the system of interest is a <b>commercial</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> in its ecosystem. We rely on systems engineering in order to clearly understand the system we want to study and its environment, during the entire life cycle of the system. For interdependent decisions between stakeholders in the lifecycle of the system, the concept of equilibrium is important. Architectural equilibrium of the system guarantees its integration in its environment, the stability of the environment and the satisfaction of all stakeholders. This is modeled as a game in the sense of game theory leading to a Nash equilibrium, which allows anticipating for changes in an uncertain environment (departure of a stakeholder, arrival of a new actor, changes in requirements or constraints and so on) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} analysed {{findings from}} global transport stakeholder organisations and modelled the energy consumption of electric vehicles under Samoan conditions. Abstract The identification of alternative transport modes is urgently required as fuel price inflation is adversely affecting Samoa’s energy security and increasingly its {{economic and social}} well-being. The Samoan government has recognised the society-wide implications of fuel dependency and is moving towards improving fuel use efficiency of the national transport fleet and the identification of viable alternative transport fuels. This research analysed findings from global transport stakeholder organisations and modelled the energy consumption of electric vehicles under Samoan conditions. The results pointed to lower operating cost of electric vehicles which led to stakeholder support for the eCar pilot project aimed at establishing the feasibility of electro-mobility. The study adopted a postdevelopment approach as it provided information about electric vehicle technology and invited Samoan transport stakeholders to contribute to mutual learning about alternative transport modes via a series of participative workshops. Postdevelopment thinking also pointed to assumptions made under prevailing conceptions of the modernist development project which may see the promotion of electro-mobility {{in the form of}} a commercial technology which is unaffordable to the majority of Samoans. The study concludes that in order to make electro-mobility accessible to a wider section of society, the concept of electro-mobility needs to be deconstructed into its components and rebuild to suit Samoa’s conception of modernity. This could literally mean electric vehicle retrofit conversions of second hand cars to take advantage of the well documented energy efficiency of the electric motor and discounting the status enhancing ownership of a <b>commercial</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectric {{commercial}} delivery trucks {{have the}} potential to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution and lower per-mile operating and maintenance costs. However, the initial purchase cost of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> is significantly higher than that of a conventional diesel truck. In addition, <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> have a limited range that may lead to the well known problem commonly known as “range anxiety” {{due to the lack of}} nearby recharging stations. From a purely economic perspective, there is a cost tradeoff between low operating and maintenance costs of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their high initial capital costs. In this paper, a deterministic integer programming model is utilized to analyze the competitiveness of <b>commercial</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Utilizing realistic assumptions and a wide range of scenarios regarding fleet utilization and fuel efficiency, this research finds breakeven points where <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> become competitive.

30|$|The EV, {{as defined}} by the Encyclopedia Britannica, is a motor vehicle powered by a battery that {{originated}} in the late 1880 s and that has been used for private as well as public transportation. An <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> can be a bicycle, a motorcycle, or any type of four-wheeled automobile, being private or <b>commercial.</b> Battery-powered <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> are different than hybrid or fuel cell vehicles for this application in that they do not generate electricity. They are instead a distributed storage medium that time-shifts the generation and consumption of electrical energy, providing, for example, peak power, reliability, distributed storage, and reactive power (AC Propulsion, Inc. 2009 a).|$|R
5000|$|Around 1908 on the Nonnendamm in Berlin Protos built {{electric}} trucks for municipal use. The Protos {{vehicle was}} driven by motors located on the rear wheels. In addition to the normal steering wheel were two additional steering wheels located on left and right which could be operated by the driver while walking beside the vehicle. This utility E-LKW was also supplied by Protos as a normal truck of four-ton payload and as an omnibus. The chassis were built by Siemens-Schuckertwerke and the motors by Siemens & Halske. In 1911 <b>commercial</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> were introduced. In addition to automobiles and vans, truck and coach models were produced from 1913 with 2.5t capacity and up to 30hp. During the First World War many trucks came with 40hp and a 3t payload. In addition a model was built with 50hp and 4.5t payload. After the War trucks were no longer produced and those that had been stockpiled were still available until the 1920s. Production was limited to passenger cars and vans.|$|R

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry requires <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> battery systems to maintain specified performance for an 8 year life cycle. However, {{it has been}} shown for Li-ion batteries that the capacity loss after a 1 year operation is approximately 3 %, and the power loss is approximately 8 %. This is primarily due to battery internal resistance increasing over time caused by growth in SEI film thickness and a reduction in electrode adhesion. In this study, data were collected from a <b>commercial</b> hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> battery system running at operating-mode conditions over a period of 1 year. In total, approximately 340, 000 data samples were recorded. Of these data, about 92 % discharge current was less than 50 A and the peak at 150 A; about 97 % charge current was less than 75 A and the peak at 120 A. Based on an analysis of the collected data, a model simulating operating-mode performance was developed. The model addressed the three parameters- temperature, vibration and current. In order to better meet the requirement of <b>commercial</b> hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles,</b> a high performance 6 Ah high power battery was designed. The maximum charge and discharge current reached 180 A and 210 A, respectively. Using the developed simulation model, it can be shown that the 1 -year discharge power loss of the battery is less than 3 %, with negligible capacity degradation. It is therefore concluded that the 6 Ah high power battery can meet the 8 year life cycle requirement of the {{automotive industry}}...|$|R
