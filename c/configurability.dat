5|$|The browser was forked from Galeon, after developers' {{disagreements}} about Galeon's growing complexity. Since then Web {{has been}} developed {{as part of the}} GNOME project and uses most of GNOME's technology and settings when applicable. It is part of the GNOME Core Applications. As required by the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), Web maintains a clean and simple graphical user interface with only a required minimum number of features exposed to users by default. The browser's functionality and <b>configurability</b> can be extended with official and third-party extensions.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of [...] The TeXmacs text editor is a WYSIWYW {{scientific}} text editor, inspired by both TeX and Emacs. It uses Knuth's fonts and can generate TeX output. LyX is a WYSIWYM document processor which runs on a variety of platforms including GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows (newer versions require Windows 2000 or later) and Apple Mac OS X (using a non-native Qt front-end). TeXShop (for Mac OS X), TeXworks (for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows) and WinShell (for Windows) are similar tools and provide an integrated development environment (IDE) for working with LaTeX or TeX. For KDE/Qt, Kile provides such an IDE. Texmaker is the Pure Qt equivalent of Kile, with a user interface that is nearly the same as Kile's. TeXstudio is an open-source fork (2009) of Texmaker that offers a different approach to <b>configurability</b> and features. [...] Free downloadable binaries are provided for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, OS/2, and FreeBSD. GNU Emacs has various built-in and third-party packages with support for TeX, the major one being AUCTeX. For Vim, possible plugins include Vim-LaTeX Suite, Automatic TeX and TeX-9. For Google Docs, Auto-Latex Equations is a Google Docs add-on that provides mathematical TeX typesetting (MathJax supported).|$|E
2500|$|Build 4015 (build date of March 28, 2003) {{was leaked}} to the Internet on April 28, 2003. A number of {{features}} Microsoft {{had been working on}} were rolled into this build, such as a range of parental controls, also moved and enlarged the Windows logo to {{the left side of the}} Start button a lot of additional <b>configurability</b> for the sidebar (including being able to put it below the start bar at the bottom of the screen), and the notion of [...] "Libraries" [...] (later known as virtual folders) of files. These libraries collected content from around the hard drive. The user could then filter this content and save it in a folder. Microsoft had originally intended to replace all special shell folders (My Documents, My Music, etc.) with virtual folders. However, this change was deemed too drastic and was dropped after Beta 1's release in mid-2005. Libraries were later included in Windows 7. This build was also notable for the debut of the boot screen progress bar that is seen in the final release (though 4015's version was blue, not green). A new Download Manager shell location suggested that Internet Explorer would get a Mozilla-style download manager, though no such functionality was apparent. Significant memory leak problems with Windows Explorer and the Sidebar made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of Outlook Express changed completely, and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.|$|E

5000|$|The {{boundary}} between proper <b>configurability</b> and problematic soft-coding changes with {{the style and}} nature of a program. Closed-source programs must be very configurable, as the end user does {{not have access to}} the source to make any changes. In-house software and software with limited distribution can be less configurable, as distributing altered copies is simpler. Custom-built web applications are often best with limited <b>configurability,</b> as altering the scripts is seldom any harder than altering a configuration file.|$|E
