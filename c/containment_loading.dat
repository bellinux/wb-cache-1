40|$|DURING THE LAST YEARS IT HAS BEEN WIDELY RECOGNIZED THAT THE INITIATING EVENTS LEADING TO A CDA HAVE AN EXTREMELY LOW PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE. THEREFORE THE CDA HAS BEEN NO LONGER CONSIDERED AS A DESIGN BASIS ACCIDENT. NEVERTHELESS, CURRENT SAFETY PHYLOSOPHIES REQUIRE THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH ACCIDENTS ON THE PRIMARY CONTAINMENT MUST BE DETERMINED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE "RESIDUAL" RISKS TO THE PUBLIC. DUE TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY TO REPRODUCE EXPERIMENTALLY A CDA, IT IS NECESSARY TO RELY ONLY ON COMPUTER CODE PREDICTIONS BASED ON POSTULATED ENERGY RELEASES. IN ORDER TO GAIN INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN CONTAINMENT CODE CAPABI- LITIES, SEVERAL CO-ORDINATED EFFORTS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN THE PAST. THE COVA PROGRAMME WAS CONCERNED WITH THE SYSTEMATIC COMPARISON OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL-SCALE EXPLOSIVE TESTS WITH COMPUTER CODE CALCULATIONS. THE APRICOT PROGRAMME WAS DEVOTED TO THE BENCHMARKING AND COMPARISON OF COMPUTER CODE PREDICTIONS ON A SERIES OF BASIC FLUID DYNAMIC AND STRUCTURAL DYNAMIC PROBLEMS AS WELL AS ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SMALL-SCALE EXPLOSIVE TESTS. RECENTLY, THE <b>CONTAINMENT</b> <b>LOADING</b> AND RESPONSE (CONT) GROUP (OF THE SAFETY WORKING GROUP, FAST REACTOR CO-ORDINATING COMMITTEE OF THE CEC) MADE THE PROPOSAL OF SUBMITTING TO DIFFERENT COMPUTER CODE CALCULAIONS A CONTAINMENT BENCHNMARK PROBLEM REPRESENTING A CDA OCCURRING IN A FULL-SIZE POOL-TYPE LMFBR.

Five CE plants have melt dispersal flow paths which circumvent the main mitigation of containment compartmentalization in most Westinghouse PWRs. Calvert Cliff-like plant geometries and the impact of codispersed water were addressed as part of the DCH issue resolution. Integral effects tests were performed with a scale model of the Calvert Cliffs NPP inside the Surtsey test vessel. The experiments investigated the effects of codispersal of water, steam, and molten core stimulant materials on DCH loads under prototypic accident conditions and plant configurations. The results indicated that large amounts of coejected water reduced the DCH load by a small amount.

40|$|The MELCOR {{computer}} code {{has been developed}} by Sandia National Laboratories under USNRC sponsorship to provide capability for independently auditing analyses submitted by reactor manufactures and utilities. MELCOR is a fully integrated code (encompassing the reactor coolant system and the containment building) that models the progression of postulated accidents in light water reactor power plants. To assess the adequacy of containment thermal-hydraulic modeling incorporated in the MELCOR code for application to PWR large dry containments, several selected demonstration designs were analyzed. This report documents MELCOR code demonstration calculations performed for postulated design basis accident (DBA) analysis (LOCA and MSLB) inside containment, which are compared to other code results. The key processes when analyzing the <b>containment</b> <b>loads</b> inside PWR large dry containments are (1) expansion and transport of high mass/energy releases, (2) heat and mass transfer to structural passive heat sinks, and (3) containment pressure reduction due to engineered safety features. A code-to-code benchmarking for DBA events showed that MELCOR predictions of maximum <b>containment</b> <b>loads</b> were equivalent to similar predictions using a qualified containment code known as CONTAIN.

DCH is considered resolved if the conditional containment failure probability (CCFP) is less than 0. 1. Loads versus strength evaluations of the CCFP were performed for each plant using plant-specific information. The DCH issue is considered resolved for a plant if a screening phase results in a CCFP less than 0. 01, which is more stringent than the overall success criterion. If the screening phase CCFP for a plant is greater than 0. 01, then refined <b>containment</b> <b>loads</b> evaluations must be performed and/or the probability of high pressure at vessel breach must be analyzed. These analyses could be used separately or could be integrated together to recalculate the CCFP for an individual plant to reduce the CCFP to meet the overall success criterion of less than 0. 1. The CCFPs {{for all of the}} Westinghouse plants with dry containments were less than 0. 01 at the screening phase, and thus, the DCH issue is resolved for these plants based on <b>containment</b> <b>loads</b> alone.

40|$|CONTAIN is a reactor {{accident}} simulation code developed by Sandia National Laboratories under US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) sponsorship to provide integrated analysis of containment phenomena, including {{those related to}} nuclear reactor <b>containment</b> <b>loads</b> and radiological source terms. The recently released CONTAIN 2. 0 code version represents a significant advance in CONTAIN modeling capabilities over the last major code release (CONTAIN 1. 12 V). The new modeling capabilities are discussed here. The principal motivation {{for many of the}} recent model improvements has been to allow CONTAIN to model the special features in advanced light water reactor (ALWR) designs. The work done in this area is also summarized. In addition to the ALWR work, the USNRC is currently engaged in an effort to qualify CONTAIN for more general use in licensing, with the intent of supplementing or possibly replacing traditional licensing codes. To qualify the CONTAIN code for licensing applications, studies utilizing CONTAIN 2. 0 are in progress. A number of results from this effort are presented in this paper to illustrate the code capabilities. In particular, CONTAIN calculations of the NUPEC M- 8 - 1 and ISP- 23 experiments and CVTR test {number_sign} 3 are presented to illustrate (1) the ability of CONTAIN to model non-uniform gas density and/or temperature distributions, and (2) the relationship between such gas distributions and <b>containment</b> <b>loads.</b> CONTAIN and CONTEMPT predictions for a large break loss of coolant accident scenario in the San Onofre plant are also compared...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop methods to analyze the offsite consequences of specific sodium fast reactor (SFR) licensing basis events as used to characterize the safety of a nuclear plant design in a license application. An algorithm has been developed which assesses pool heatup, <b>containment</b> <b>load,</b> radionuclide transport, and release from containment during accident scenarios. To analyze temperature transients, the SFR pool has been divided into two, well-mixed regions separated by a metal divider referred to as a redan.

40|$|Infusion {{strategies}} for large, complex CFRP foam core sandwich panels with {{closed cell foam}} cores were investigated for open mould liquid composite moulding (LCM) technologies. For closed cell foam core no through the thickness resin flow is possible. If no through the thickness channels in the foam core are being introduced (e. g. open holes, core joints, pins, etc.) the infusion of the sandwich requires resin distribution media on both skins. In a first approach standard distribution medium was used. In a second step a tool integrated resin distribution system was developed for the infusion of the tool-sided skin. To demonstrate that aerospace quality is achievable manufacturing trials with monolithic specimen and complex sandwich panels including damage <b>containment,</b> <b>load</b> introduction and tool integrated resin distribution technology were carried out in a laboratory environment. The investigations show that aerospace quality can be achieved for large CFRP sandwich panels in LCM technology. However the achievable quality depends heavily on the panel/component materials, design details, geometry and the chosen technology approach and strategy for the infusion. Besides the quality factors todays composite aeronautical components have {{to meet the demand}} of the market for low cost structures and high production rates. Therefore an industrial concept approach for LCM of CFRP foam core sandwich panels was developed. Conceptual approaches for the key factors of the automation - the automated handling and preforming of the sandwich component are shown in this paper as well as the results of practical automation trials.

40|$|There {{are three}} main factors {{affecting}} {{the stability of}} a palletized load that is unitized by a stretch wrapping mechanism. These factors include the type of unitized load, wrapping configuration and shipping method. The wrapping configuration is determined {{on the basis of}} the type of unitized load and shipping method. For this study, the aforementioned components were referred to as the package, the product, and the distribution environment. These components come together to make up a stretch wrapping system. The package corresponds to the stretch wrap film that is packaging the unitized load and pallet. The product corresponds to the goods placed on the pallet to be packaged by the stretch wrapper. The distribution environment corresponds to the hazards that the packaged product will encounter in transit. This study was designed to observe and understand the interactions between each of the components of the stretch wrap system. Prior to stretch wrapping a pallet of product, the film is elongated or pre-stretched. The elastic nature of the stretch wrap forces the film to conform around the palletized load. It is hypothesized that the film force that the stretch wrap applies to the palletized load contributes to improved <b>load</b> <b>containment.</b> Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between percentage pre-stretch to change in film force and <b>load</b> <b>containment.</b> For the study, a range of pre-stretched unitized loads were subjected to ISTA 3 E distribution testing. Simultaneously the film force was monitored during the period of distribution testing. Subsequent to distribution testing, the load dispersion was quantified.

40|$|ABSTRACT Carton Clamp Test Methodologies and the Effects on <b>Load</b> <b>Containment</b> and Retention Tyler Don Blumer A carton clamp is an {{alternative}} device for moving packages and material. Instead of using iron tines {{like that of a}} conventional forklift, a carton clamp uses two large aluminum platens to slightly compress and secure the load for handling. This is advantageous as it allows operators to move layers of a unitized load individually, and eliminates the need for a pallet when handling full unitized loads. When using a carton clamp attachment, it is often difficult for operators to accurately gauge the amount of force being applied to the load. The required clamping force changes depending on the size, shape, and weight of the load. This creates the potential for under-clamping (slippage) and over-clamping (compressive damage). Seeing a market need for a reliable means of testing, two organizations set out to develop a testing protocol. A rift formed between schools of thought regarding the correct testing procedure. ISTA provides a sterile, calculated, and stationary simulation of carton clamp handling in its ISTA 6 -SAMS test protocol. ASTM offers a more holistic, dynamic, observational approach in its mobile ASTM 6055 standard protocol. One school of thought is suggested to imply that a package should be developed to be handled by the carton clamp (ASTM). The other school of thought is that the carton clamp attachment should be properly adjusted to the package specimen (ISTA). Previous studies have been performed citing the ISTA standard and using a specialized carton clamping device vibration device that is calibrated for laboratory research. Arguably, this method, though repeatable in nature, does not accurately simulate carton clamp handling found in industry. Likewise, the equipment investment is cost prohibitive for those in industry wishing to duplicate such a study. ASTM uses a carton clamp truck as used in industry, but does not specify any specific parameters making repeatability between laboratories and practitioners ambiguous. This study examined whether or not a common ground can be reached; implementing a carton clamp lift truck as found in industry allowing for mobile (hazard course) testing. A modified version of ISTA 3 B will be paired off against ASTM 6055 for evaluating both column and cross stack pallet patterns with a variety of treatments. This study attempted to determine if carton clamps as found in industry are capable and repeatable enough to provide consistent data. Similarly, this study examined the test methodologies effect on <b>load</b> <b>containment</b> via stretch film force, load retention via unitized load slippage, and the effects of ride height and driver interaction. The study sought to understand if these effects are uniform across the unitized load, or if particular layers of the load more affected than others...|$|R

Eleven macaques in the pre-AIDS stage of the disease were treated with a multidrug combination (highly intensified ART) consisting of two nucleosidic/nucleotidic reverse transcriptase inhibitors (emtricitabine and tenofovir), an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir), a protease inhibitor (ritonavir-boosted darunavir) and the CCR 5 blocker maraviroc. All animals stably displayed viral loads below the limit of detection of the assay (i. e. < 40 RNA copies/mL) after starting highly intensified ART. By increasing the sensitivity of the assay to 3 RNA copies/mL, viral load was still below the limit of detection in all subjects tested. Importantly, viral DNA resulted below the assay detection limit (< 2 copies of DNA/ 5 * 10 ⁵ cells) in PBMCs and rectal biopsies of all animals at the end of the follow-up, and in lymph node biopsies from the majority of the study subjects. Moreover, highly intensified ART decreased central/transitional memory, effector memory and activated (HLA-DR⁺) effector memory CD 4 ⁺ T-cells in vivo, in line with the role of these subsets as the main cell subpopulations harbouring the virus. Finally, treatment with highly intensified ART at viral load rebound following suspension of a previous anti-reservoir therapy eventually improved the spontaneous <b>containment</b> of viral <b>load</b> following suspension of the second therapeutic cycle, thus leading to a persistent suppression of viremia in the absence of ART. In conclusion, we show, for the first time, complete suppression of viral load by highly intensified ART and a likely associated restriction of the viral reservoir in the macaque AIDS model, making it a useful platform for testing potential cures for AIDS...|$|R
