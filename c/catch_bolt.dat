5000|$|B.A.D. (Battery Assist Device) Lever: a metal lever {{device that}} {{attaches}} to the standard AR-15 <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> and circles under the rifle's lower receiver and into the trigger guard, allowing the right handed operation of the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> with the trigger finger.|$|R
25|$|The Tavor {{features}} a last round <b>bolt</b> <b>catch,</b> whereby the <b>bolt</b> holds open {{after the last}} round discharges. This is a request of modern armies, as it helps to allow soldiers to know when their magazine empties and to reduce reloading times during combat.|$|R
5000|$|PMAG AR/M4 Gen M3: Improved PMAG {{made for}} use in AR-15 style rifles, as well as European-type STANAG 4179 {{magazine}} wells (HK416, M27 IAR, SA80, FN SCAR). Also has a redesigned <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> notch for increased <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> clearance, an over-travel stop on the spine to prevent over-insertion, and a new slimmer and easily disassembled floorplate. It is available in 10- (PMAG 10 AR/M4), 20- (PMAG 20 AR/M4), 30- (PMAG 30 AR/M4), and 40-round (PMAG 40 AR/M4) capacities.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. G. (Hysterically, backing to portiere {{and hiding}} {{her face in}} its folds.) The--the Almost Inevitable Consequences! (Flits though portiere as G. {{attempts}} to <b>catch</b> her, and <b>bolts</b> herself in her own room.) ...|$|R
50|$|Higher {{security}} lever locks (such as the 5 lever) {{usually have}} notches {{cut into the}} levers. These <b>catch</b> the locking <b>bolt</b> and prevent it from moving if picking is attempted (similar to the security pins in a pin tumbler lock).|$|R
50|$|Another {{addition}} by IWI to {{the original}} Galil is the last round <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> (for variants of the ACE in 5.56×45mm NATO only). The bolt hold-open feature is a common request of military customers, to reduce reloading times during combat.|$|R
5000|$|Back in 1898, Darla {{returns to}} the house to find her Angelus is no longer the demon she made him. He's been cursed with a soul, and she is ready to kill him because of it. Faith works out a deal with the lawyers, and beating on one of them that dares to {{challenge}} her. While they're waiting for lunch with a prospective client, Faith shows up behind Angel and tries to shoot him with a crossbow. Angel <b>catches</b> the <b>bolt</b> and Faith runs off.|$|R
50|$|The pistol is {{equipped}} with a self-cocking trigger hammer type double-acting SA/DA. The design provides slide <b>catch</b> holding the <b>bolt</b> after firing the last bullet in the rearward position. Blowback action (no barrel grip with a bolt, locking the barrel reached the mass closure and force the return spring).|$|R
25|$|A bolt hold-open device {{locks the}} bolt carrier {{assembly}} open after expending the last cartridge from {{the magazine and}} is released by lifting the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> lever located {{on the left side}} of the receiver. Alternatively, a left-handed shooter may release the bolt by pulling the rubber-coated charging handle to rear a short distance.|$|R
5000|$|The bolt {{assembly}} also contains the spring extractor, while a lever case ejector {{is located at}} the base of the feed tray. Spent casings are ejected downward. The weapon has a striker firing mechanism, a trigger assembly for fully automatic only fire and a cross-bolt safety (the [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch).</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the large}} {{difference}} in size between the 7.62×39mm cartridge and 12-gauge shells, the extractor port has been lengthened, allowing the shotgun to eject spent shells without risk of causing a stovepipe malfunction.Like all firearms with the Vepr designation, the Vepr-12 receiver is patterned after that of the RPK light machine gun. The stamped steel receiver is reinforced, thicker (1.5 mm instead of 1 mm), and more heavily constructed than a standard Kalashnikov-pattern rifle.The Vepr-12 also incorporates a unique safety <b>catch</b> and <b>bolt</b> release mechanism. A side folding stock is present on most models; however, Vepr-12 shotguns are offered with fixed stocks as well.|$|R
50|$|The Ak 5C is the modernized {{version of}} the {{original}} Ak 5, following the trend of modular weapons. One {{of the most significant}} improvements is the MIL-STD-1913 rail system to which a variety of different optics, lights and sights can be mounted, such as telescopic sights and image intensifiers. The double gas position, iron sights and <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> of the original Ak 5 rifle family were discarded.|$|R
5000|$|The {{weapon is}} hammer-fired {{and has a}} trigger {{mechanism}} with a fire mode selector, whose lever (installed {{on the left side}} of the receiver, above the pistol grip) has three settings: [...] "0"—weapon is safe, [...] "1"—semi-automatic mode and [...] "20"—fully automatic fire. The [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and the bolt in the forward position (by sliding the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> lever upwards).|$|R
50|$|The non-reciprocating {{charging}} {{handle on the}} top of the receiver cover is used to retract the bolt. Variants have a ratchet safety mechanism which will <b>catch</b> the <b>bolt</b> and lock its movement if it is retracted past the magazine, but not far enough to engage the sear. When the handle is fully retracted to the rear, the <b>bolt</b> will cock (<b>catch)</b> on the sear mechanism and the handle and cover are released to spring fully forward under power of a small spring. The cover will remain forward during firing since it does not reciprocate with the bolt. The military and police versions will fire immediately upon chambering a cartridge as the Uzi is an open bolt weapon.|$|R
50|$|The MP7 {{allows a}} {{conventional}} 20-round, 30-round or 40-round box magazine to be fitted within the pistol grip (the 20-round magazine being comparable {{in size to}} a 15-round 9×19mm magazine, while the 40-round magazine compares to a 30-round 9×19mm magazine). It features an ambidextrous fire selector, <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> lever and magazine release. It has an extendable stock and a folding front grip; it can be fired either one-handed or two-handed. It is compact and light, due {{to the use of}} polymers in its construction.|$|R
5000|$|The weapon {{incorporates}} a manual forward assist {{that can be}} used to positively close the bolt, similar to the one used on the American M16A1 rifle, and a side-folding heavy-gauge wire carrying handle which resembles that of the FN FAL. It also has a [...] "hold-open" [...] <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> which holds the bolt open after the last round in the magazine has been fired (the bolt release button is just above the magazine release) and has a spring-loaded dust cover that seals the ejection port from debris.|$|R
50|$|The weapon has {{the same}} T-shape as Uzi- and MAC-10 submachineguns, and is {{manufactured}} in semi-automatic for security and automatic for military use. The automatic version fires from the open bolt, while the semi-automatic version fires from the closed bolt. Both versions are blowback operated. The bolt wraps around {{the rear of the}} barrel when closed, saving on overall length. The cocking handle is located {{at the top of the}} receiver. The BXP has an ambidextrous safety lever and a separate fire mode selector built into the trigger. The military-use version can be fired in single-shot mode by partially pressing the trigger, or in full-auto mode by fully pressing the trigger. There is also an interceptor notch that <b>catches</b> the <b>bolt</b> if it is released during the cocking but prior to activating the sear. The weapon is coated with a rust-resistant coating which doubles as a dry lubricant.|$|R
5000|$|Bennet {{comes home}} and slaps the {{newspaper}} {{story about the}} drunk cheerleader in front of Claire, yelling at her for risking exposure. [...] "It's not safe here, anymore," [...] Bennet says. [...] "Pack your bags... we're leaving." [...] Instead of obeying, Claire angrily refuses to leave and runs upstairs. Meanwhile, back in Montreal, Peter attempts to teleport {{back to the future}} to save Caitlin, but is unable to access his time powers. Suddenly distracted by a noise coming from behind him, Peter swings around and looses a bolt of electricity. A hand appears from behind a painting and <b>catches</b> the <b>bolt,</b> leaving the flesh charred and blackened, but instantly regenerates a moment later. Takezo Kensei appears from behind the wall, revealing himself to be the mysterious Adam Monroe. Peter still doesn't recognize who Adam is. Adam comments to Peter, [...] "We are going to change history." ...|$|R
5000|$|The rifle is hammer-fired {{and has a}} {{fire control}} {{selector}} mechanism that is also the safety (lever in the [...] "S" [...] position—indicates the gun is safe, [...] "1"—semi-automatic fire, [...] "3"—3-round burst and [...] "20"—fully automatic fire). The SG 540 is fed from either 20 or 30-round staggered box magazines. After the last round is fired, a hold-open tab in the magazine engages the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> that locks the bolt in its rear (open) position. A bolt release button {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver.|$|R
50|$|The Wildey uses a fixed-barrel, three-lug, rotating-bolt design. The bolt locks {{into the}} aft barrel extension. The bolt {{is linked to}} the slide via one of the bolt lugs. When the {{cartridge}} is fired, the piston is forced against the slide. The retracting slide <b>catches</b> the extended <b>bolt</b> lug which causes the bolt to rotate open. The spent cartridge is ejected by the bolt through the retracting slide's ejection port. The fixed-barrel design is considered to promote greater accuracy over pistols designed around an articulating barrel design. The Wildey can be used as either a single-shot or an auto-loading pistol.|$|R
50|$|The MPX has a gas {{short stroke}} piston system {{in order to}} {{increase}} the accuracy of the weapon which operates in closed bolt. It is designed in this way to prevent water or dirt from entering the chamber and causing malfunctions as well as to use a silencer with greater ease. It features an ambidextrous selector switch for fully automatic (law enforcement/military models) and semi-automatic. It also features an ambidextrous <b>bolt</b> <b>catch,</b> and the weapons exterior appears to be a cross between an AR-15 and a Heckler & Koch MP5A3. The barrel is free-floating and is surrounded by Polymer/Steel Rail mounts.|$|R
50|$|The {{weapon is}} fed from a {{detachable}} box magazine with a 30-round cartridge capacity and made from a lightweight aluminium alloy. When the last round from the magazine is fired, the bolt will remain locked open on the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch,</b> activated by the magazine's follower. The magazine release tab {{is located at the}} base of the receiver on the left side, behind the magazine well. The bolt carrier has a built-in guide rail used for reloading from 10-round stripper clips (from the SKS rifle). Despite their similarity, vz. 58 magazines are not interchangeable with those of the Kalashnikov-pattern weapons.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the design}} phase, {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} safety when operating the weapon. It is impossible to discharge the firearm in its folded position or when the stock is not fully deployed. The PP-90 also has a manual safety and fire selector. The safety toggle, installed {{on the left side of}} the receiver housing, has two settings: a top “P” position - indicating the weapon is safe and the bottom “O” setting - automatic fire. The [...] "safe" [...] setting ensures the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> is disabled mechanically. The weapon’s internal safety mechanism features a drop safety that prevents the weapon from firing when dropped with a loaded chamber.|$|R
60|$|Next {{he pointed}} to the metal cup out of which he had drunk. Bickley filled it again from the thermos flask, which I {{observed}} excited his keen interest, for, having touched the flask with his hand and found that it was cool, he appeared to marvel that the fluid coming from it should be hot and steaming. Presently he smiled as though he had got the clue to the mystery, and swallowed his second drink of coffee and spirit. This done, he motioned to us to lift the lid of the lady's coffin, pointing out a certain <b>catch</b> in the <b>bolts</b> which at first we could not master, for it will be remembered that on this coffin these were shot.|$|R
50|$|A {{study of}} {{significant}} changes to Marine M16A4 rifles released in February 2015 outlined several new features {{that could be}} added from inexpensive and available components. Those features included: a muzzle compensator {{in place of the}} flash suppressor to manage recoil and allow for faster follow-on shots, though at the cost of noise and flash signature and potential overpressure in close quarters; a heavier and/or free-floating barrel to increase accuracy from 4.5 MOA to potentially 2 MOA; changing the reticle on the Rifle Combat Optic from chevron-shaped to the semi-circle with a dot at the center used in the M27 IAR's Squad Day Optic so as not to obscure the target at long distance; using a trigger group with a more consistent pull force, even a reconsideration of the burst capability; and the addition of ambidextrous charging handles and <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> releases for easier use with left-handed shooters.|$|R
2500|$|HK {{included}} several design {{features that are}} essential in modern military firearms. For example, the bolt locks back after the last round is spent (this can be deactivated), and at {{the front end of}} the trigger guard there is a <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> button. The cocking handle can be switched from either end, folds in, and unfolds from a spring so the shooter need not unfold it by hand [...] before firing. Another feature of it is that it doubles as the forward assist, which is used in the instance that the spent cartridge ejected but the next one did not properly extract and go into battery. In addition, the ejection port has a brass deflector to mitigate the amount of casings that may strike the face of left-handed operators. Instead of a dust cover which has the need to be flipped back up when the gun isn't in use, the bolt acts as the seal from dirt.|$|R
5000|$|After {{discharging}} {{the last}} cartridge from the magazine, the bolt carrier and bolt are held {{back on a}} <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> that is released by pulling the cocking handle to the rear. The rifle has a hammer-type striking mechanism and a manual lever safety selector. The firing pin is a [...] "free-floating" [...] type and, as a result, some soft-primered ammunition had the reputation of causing a [...] "slam fire" [...] event. Thus, military-grade ammunition with primers confirmed to be properly seated is recommended for the Dragunov and its variants. This appears to have solved the [...] "slam fire" [...] issue. The rifle's receiver is machined to provide additional accuracy and torsional strength. The Dragunov's receiver bears a number of similarities to the AK action, such as the large dust cover, iron sights and lever safety selector, but these similarities are primarily cosmetic in nature. These cosmetic similarities can lead to mis-categorization of the Dragunov as an AK variant.|$|R
2500|$|The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size {{version of}} the Galil SAR (706mm stock {{extended}} / 465mm folded), weighing 2.98kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located {{on both sides of}} the receiver) has four settings: [...] "S"—weapon is safe, [...] "A"—automatic fire, [...] "B"—3-round burst, [...] "R"—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a <b>bolt</b> <b>catch,</b> plastic magazines weighing 0.164kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.|$|R
50|$|The M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System is {{intended}} to replace the M24 Sniper Weapon System used by snipers, spotters, designated marksman, or squad advanced marksmen in the United States Army. However, the U.S. Army still acquired M24s from Remington until February 2010. After witnessing the effects of USSOCOM snipers and extensive after-action reports from SOF snipers throughout the Iraqi theater of operations, the U.S. Army ran a competition involving several designs, including rifles from Knight's Armament Company, Remington, and DPMS Panther Arms. On September 28, 2005, the Knight's Armament Co. rifle won the competition and was selected to be the supplier of the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System. The XM110 underwent final operational testing in May and June 2007 at Fort Drum, New York by a mix of Special Forces troops and Sniper trained soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division. In April 2008, U.S. Army soldiers from Task Force Fury in Afghanistan were {{the first in a}} combat zone to receive the M110. The troops rated the weapon very highly, noting the quality of the weapon and its semi-automatic capabilities compared to the bolt-action M24. The United States Marine Corps will also be adopting the M110 to replace some M39 and all Mk 11 as a complement to the M40A5. It is manufactured by Knight's Armament Company in Titusville, Florida, though the complete system incorporates a Leupold 3.5-10× variable power daytime optic, Harris swivel bipod, AN/PVS-26 or AN/PVS-10 night sight and PALs magazine pouches of yet unpublished origin. The rifle has ambidextrous features such as a double-sided magazine release, safety selector switch, and <b>bolt</b> <b>catch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ARX200 {{features}} three gas {{settings for}} normal, adverse and suppressed firing, and a fully ambidextrous controls, including the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> lever, magazine release button and fire selector. Unlike the ARX160, {{it is not}} designed to change which side the empty shells are ejected. However, the charging handle remains reversible and can be switched from the right to {{left side of the}} upper receiver and the barrel locking bolt is located in front of the magazine well. It is equipped with a quick-change, free-floating, cold hammer-forged barrel which can be removed and replaced in a minute using one wrench. It has a weight of 4.5 kg without a magazine and 8.6 lb unloaded, a length of 730 mm with the stock folded, 890 mm with the stock collapsed and 1,000 mm with the stock extended, a 406 mm (16 in) heavy barrel (excluding the flash hider) with match-grade rifling with four right-hand grooves and a 279 mm (11 in) twist rate, a monolithic upper receiver with a long Picatinny rail on top made of steel-reinforced polymer which includes internal rails for a weapon bolt carrier, a more streamlined forend for operators who use the C-clamp grip when shooting, and Beretta claims that the it has an accuracy of 1.5 MOA with 5 shots at 100 meters. The polymer lower receiver is equipped with a modular magazine well for the new Beretta 20-round polymer magazine and also has a special magazine-well adapter that can be removed in order to use the M110/SR-25 magazines.|$|R
50|$|The RPD is hammer {{fired from}} an open bolt, the hammer forming part of {{the rear of the}} bolt carrier (which is {{connected}} to the gas piston), which continues moving forward for a short distance after the round is chambered and the bolt locked, the hammer face then striking the rear of the free floating firing pin which passes through the length of the bolt. Locking occurs by means of lateral flaps located along the sides of the bolt, which are forced outwards (by the angled sides of the hammer) into recesses cut into the receiver body, after which firing occurs when the face of the hammer strikes the rear of the firing pin; the mechanism is simple, rugged and reliable, It features a trigger mechanism that is limited to fully automatic fire only. The bolt is equipped with a spring-loaded casing extraction system and a fixed insert inside the receiver housing which passes between the feed horns of the bolt serves as the ejector. Spent cartridge casings are ejected downward through an opening in the bolt carrier and receiver. The RPD has a manually operated lever-type safety mechanism that secures the weapon against accidental firing by blocking the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> when engaged. Unlike Degtyarov's earlier firearm patents, the RPD's return spring is located inside the butt. Like many other rugged Russian-made firearms, the chamber and bore are chrome-lined, greatly decreasing the risk of corrosion and jamming.The weapon has a non-removable barrel with a 3-position gas adjustment valve used to control the performance of the gas system. It is also equipped with a folding integral bipod, wooden shoulder stock, foregrip and pistol grip. The firearm strips down into the following major groups: the receiver and barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, feed tray and feed cover, the recoil mechanism and the trigger group and stock.|$|R
5000|$|The {{position}} of the pistol grip and firing control group has been redesigned to make the 240LWS even shorter than the 240LW. With this, Barrett moved the entire grip forward by about 4 inches, to where {{the front of the}} trigger guard is at a right angle to the ejection port. By moving the fire control group forward, the overall length can be shortened because the machine gunner no longer needs a traditionally longer stock to compensate for the original {{position of}} the pistol group, towards the very rear portion of the receiver. Instead of the operator using a cheek weld on the stock, the operator can now rest his face against the actual receiver of the machine gun, it also allows the operator to have a closer fit of the weapon. But by doing this, the bolt had to be modified accordingly, because the original location of the sear is no longer there. Barrett had to move the {{position of the}} sear <b>catch</b> on the <b>bolt</b> to further down the length of it. The bolt group is still the same as the original M240 design, {{with the exception of the}} position of the sear catch. Though moving the grip forward took away the ability to connect the LWS to the standard pintle adapter from the M192, Barrett made available as part of the system a new adjustable pintle adapter that works with both made by Military Systems Group. As of July 2017, it is not yet clear if that adapter is compatible with the M192 or M122 Traverse and Elevation (T&E) mechanism. However, it should be noted that the primary intended use of the LWS is not to be mounted, but instead being a part of a small man team that needs the additional firepower while on a foot patrol.|$|R
