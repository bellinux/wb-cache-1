40|$|Purpose: Elektron 21 {{magnesium}} alloy <b>containing</b> <b>neodymium,</b> gadolinium and zinc has high strength, good corrosion resistance and excellent castability. It is designed mainly for aerospace applications. The {{purpose of the}} investigation was to study the corrosion resistance of Elektron 21 {{magnesium alloy}} in as cast condition and after heat treatment in 3. 5 % NaCl saturated with Mg(OH) 2 solution. Design/methodology/approach: Solution treatment was performed at 525 °C/ 8 h/water, while ageing treatments at following conditions 250 °C/ 4 - 96 h/air. Immersion test was performed in 3. 5 % NaCl saturated with Mg(OH) 2 solution at room temperature. Specimens were placed in 3. 5 % NaCl solution for periods of time between one and 5 days. After immersion test, the microstructure and the appearances of the corroded structure were examined by optical microscopy (Olympus GX- 70) and a scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S 3400). Findings: The corrosion rates of Elektron 21 alloy increased with increasing the exposure time and finally (after 5 days) reached maximum value 0. 092 mg/cm- 2 day- 1. Solution treatment at 520 °C for 8 h caused decrease in corrosion rate (0. 072 mg cm- 2 day- 1) due to dissolving of intermetallic phase precipitates at matrix. Ageing at 200 °C for 4 h and 16 h caused next decrease in corrosion rate to value 0. 052 and 0, 055 mg cm- 2 day- 1 respectively, while after ageing for 48 h corrosion rate increase to value 0. 067 mg cm- 2 day- 1, due to increase of volume fraction and size of β’ phase and precipitations of equilibrium β phase. It was also noticed that the longer time of ageing the higher corrosion rates were observed.

40|$|Abstract no. MR 33 A- 2313 The {{mobility}} and deposition of REE metals in hydrothermal fluids is {{strongly influenced by}} their speciation, in particular, by molecular clustering and solvation processes. The characterization of individual REE halide cluster stoichiometries and structures poses a special challenge to experimentalists, and this task is in many cases either difficult or impossible to achieve solely by solution-based techniques. On the other hand, electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry is emerging as a promising tool {{for the study of}} the solution chemistry of metal complexes, and in combination with adequate theoretical methods, can provide valuable insight into the molecular-scale speciation of aqueous REE metals. Here we report results from a combined ESI mass spectrometric and theoretical study of the aqueous NdCl 3, EuCl 3 and CeCl 3 systems. Theoretical calculations at the MP 2 and DFT theory level have been applied to examine the structures and energies of Nd, Eu and Ce chloride clusters, both water-free and microsolvated. A brief summary of the results for the NdCl 3 systems is given here, while a more detailed description of our findings for CeCl 3 and EuCl 3 will be given in the presentation. Electrospray ionization of dilute (1 mM) aqueous solutions <b>containing</b> <b>neodymium</b> chloride results in the formation of solvated mononuclear complexes, these being [NdO]+(H 2 O) n, [NdClOH]+(H 2 O) n, [NdCl 2]+(H 2 O) n and the dinuclear clusters [Nd 2 Cl 4 OH]+(H 2 O) n and [Nd 2 Cl 5]+(H 2 O) n. Results from MP 2 and DFT calculations for microsolvated [NdO]+, [NdClOH]+, and [NdCl 2]+ support a solvation shell configuration around the complex, in which up to 5 waters are bound into the first shell. In the case of [Nd 2 Cl 4 OH]+ and [Nd 2 Cl 5]+, both Nd centers are linked via two bridging Cl atoms and closely resemble the equilibrium structure of Nd 2 Cl 6. MP 2 generated structures for microsolvated [Nd 2 Cl 4 OH]+ and [Nd 2 Cl 5]+ reveal that that the first four water molecules are strongly bound onto Nd centers in highly exothermic reactions steps; subsequent water molecules are located in the second shell and are loosely bound (close to the water condensation enthalpy) with first-shell water molecules. We also conducted a series of mass spectrometric experiments in which the concentration dependence (0. 1 - 20 mM) of the neodymium chloride cluster distribution and abundance was probed. Results from these concentration-dependent experiments demonstrate an increasing trend toward cluster growth with increasing NdCl 3 concentration, in other words, at higher NdCl 3 concentrations more neodymium chloride is present as polynuclear [Nd 2 Cl 4 OH]+ and [Nd 2 Cl 5]+. In general, results from this ESI FT-ICR mass spectrometric and MP 2 study indicate that polynuclear species are important because they provide molecular-scale insight into the dominant stoichiometries and structures present in the gas-phase, which is of particular interest for understanding the speciation and transport of REE chloride complexes in hydrothermal fluids with gas-like densities...|$|E
40|$|Critical {{materials}} represent mostly metals {{having a}} big importance {{for the future of}} the economy in the European countries. It is very difficult to replace these critical metals by other metals. Because of their wide application, the demand for these metals is increased, but the production cannot follow their growing consumption. Rare earth elements (REE) belong to critical materials. They include 17 elements, very similar in terms of their chemical and physical properties due to their mineralogical structure (the best-known are lanthanum and thorium, which is radioactive). REE are divided into elements with a lower atomic mass and elements with a higher atomic mass. Heavier metals show a significantly lower presence in the upper earth crust. In 2010, the share of the REE production in China in the global production amounted to 97 %, constituting a near-monopoly in the world market. In different studies, the term “Strategic” is often used instead “of “critical” materials. The materials for military application are called “Strategic” (nickel). In comparison to strategic metals, critical materials have a big importance for the national economies of European countries (platinum group of metals, rare earth elements, cobalt). The European Commission prepared a strategic development plan for critical materials in the next twenty years. The rare earth elements The rare earth elements include 15 elements (Z= 57 through 71) and Yttrium (Z= 39) and scandium. Because of their reactivity and similarity, the REEs were found to be difficult to obtain [...] Lanthanide elements with a low atomic number are generally more abundant in the earth crust than those with high atomic numbers. World demand for rare earth elements is estimated by Humphries (CRS Report for Congress) at 134. 000 tons per year, with the global production of around 114. 000 tons annually. Humphries has reported in 2010 that there is no rare earth mine production in the United States. The major uses for rare earth elements include applications in auto catalysts, petroleum refining, metal alloys, cell phones, portable DVDs, etc. Permanent magnets <b>containing</b> <b>neodymium,</b> gadolinium and dysprosium are used in numerous electrical components and generators for wind turbines. The primary defense application (underwater mine detection, satellite power and communication systems, radar systems,etc.) use new materials: Neodymium Iron Boron, Samarium Cobalt. REEs extraction from monazite is performed by dissolution in a hot concentrated base or acid solutions. After cooling, the hydroxides of REEs and thorium are recovered by filtration, and thorium is separated by dissolution and selective precipitation. Metallurgy of indium   Indium belongs to the group of rare earth elements with a low melting point. Some addition of indium increases the strength, hardness and corrosion resistance of alloys. The most known producers are situated in Belgium, Canada, Russia, France and Japan. Indium is used as coating on metals applied in difficult operation conditions, and in semiconductor techniques for the production of diodes. It is formed as a semi-product after pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical treatment of sulphidic raw materials. Indium can be used with other valuable metals such as vanadium, thallium, gallium, germanium, and cadmium. The coating process based on Indium is performed by an electrolytic treatment on the surface.   Metallurgy of yttrium Yttrium compounds found interesting application in many fields. In particular, yttrium is used in the manufacture of superconductors, in super alloys of nickel and cobalt, and solid oxide fuel cells. Yttrium oxide has a high melting point and is used in ceramics. The compounds of yttrium are also used as catalysts. The growing industrial application of the rare earth elements led to a growing interest in finding new technologies for their recoveries. The selective dissolution of yttrium from lanthanum is performed by ammonium carbonate leaching. Conclusion The EU Raw materials Initiative was decided to identify a list of critical raw materials at the EU level. The EU-report describes a selection of 41 minerals and metals. Then, 14 elements were chosen as critical materials fort the economy of the European countries in the next twenty years. The future use of REEs is expected to be increased in the European countries. About 90 % of metal alloys are produced in China. The price of rare earth elements is reduced for the consumers in China in comparison to some companies in the USA and Europe. Therefore, the European countries and the USA have protested against this situation. The selective winning of rare earth elements is the most important aim in the processing of raw materials. The combination of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods might be a new way of solving this problem in the European countries. </div...|$|E

40|$|The diluent {{effect on}} the solvent {{extraction}} of rare earth elements from neodymium magnet leachate MARINO GERGORIĆ Industrial Materials Recycling Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Chalmers University of Technology ABSTRACT Rare earth elements (REEs) have become vital components {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. The demand for the REEs has grown significantly in the last few decades. This has led to increasing costs and supply chain risk. Today, despite lower prices than in 2011, they are classified as the highest supply risk elements in the EU; thus new incentives for recycling the REEs out of electronic scrap were brought forth. End-of-life neodymium magnets are a viable source for the recovery of some REEs. Although mainly iron alloys, these materials <b>contain</b> <b>neodymium,</b> dysprosium and small admixtures of praseodymium and terbium. Leaching followed by solvent extraction of the REEs out of the leachate is an attractive and efficient way of recycling these elements out of end-of-life neodymium magnets. The issues that are encountered along this recycling path is the separation of the REEs from the other elements that are dissolved with the REEs into the leachate and achieving high separation factors between the REEs from each other. Extracting agents such as D 2 EHPA (di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid) and TODGA (tetraoctyl diglycolamide) have been previously used for achieving good separation of the REEs under specific extraction conditions. This thesis has focused on the development and optimization of REE extraction from real commercial waste sources, the nitric acid and sulfuric acid media leachates of the neodymium magnet waste, using TODGA and D 2 EHPA as extracting agents, respectively. Selective REE extraction from the solution with minimal or no co-extraction of other elements in the leachate is hoped to provide a novel route to a commercially viable route to recyclable REE products. The composition of the organic phase was investigated in order to study the effect of the diluent on the overall extraction process, a well-known optimization parameter, however infrequently used. The effect of the diluent on the separation factors was also discussed as well as some characteristics of the aqueous phase on the overall extraction process. The named extractants were used at various concentrations in different diluents like solvent 70, hexane, octane, cyclohexanone, toluene, 1 -octanol and chloroform. Both extractants demonstrated good selectivity concerning the extraction of the REEs out of the neodymium magnet waste leachates.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Cardiac tissue {{engineering}} is a promising approach towards regenerating healthy myocardium and restoring {{the function of}} infarcted hearts. Using human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiomyocytes seeded in a collagen or fibrin scaffold, we have previously been able to generate engineered heart tissues (EHTs) that spontaneously contract, but with an amplitude that is far inferior {{to that of the}} native myocardium. In order to improve tissue maturation, our goal is to exercise and strengthen EHTs by applying the same mechanical load that the left ventricle faces during contractions—cardiac afterload. My investigation focuses on designing, building, and optimizing a device to apply cardiac afterload on hESC-EHTs. The afterload system involves anchoring tissues between two flexible posts made from polydimethylsiloxane: a rigid post that positions the tissue, and a flexible post <b>containing</b> a <b>neodymium</b> cube magnet that can be manipulated by an external bar magnet. The device is capable of providing a tunable resistance to tissue contractions that models the levels of afterload occurring in the developing heart at particular time points. We tested the load and rate dependency of afterload conditioning on constructs and found that tissues treated with afterload displayed 12. 5 -fold higher active stresses compared to unloaded controls, and were comparable with tissues undergoing isometric contractions (i. e. infinite afterload). The afterload device has provided us with an insight into the role of mechanical stimuli in promoting the maturation of hESC-EHTs. Our findings suggest that both static loads at 2 and 4 kPa, and steady increases in resistive loads from 0 to 8 kPa do not promote tissue contractility compared with isometric controls. Future work includes testing different static and dynamic loading regimes to identify the optimum level of afterload to promote construct maturation. In summary, we were able to engineer a novel system that applies physiological levels of afterload onto hESC-EHTs. With this new system, we performed the first studies to investigate the role of afterload conditioning in promoting the maturation of hESC-EHTs...|$|R

The SiC particles with 15 μm, 45 μm and 250 μm diameter were added to the WE 43 alloy. The microstructure of the composite was investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and XRD analysis. YSi and Y 2 Si reaction products are observed at the interfaces between SiC particles and WE 43 matrix in the composite stirred at 780 °C. Microstructure characterization of WE 43 MMC with the 45 μm, stirred at 720 °C showed relative uniform reinforcement distribution. Moreover, the Zr-rich particles at particle/matrix interface were visible instead of Y-Si phases. In the case of composite with 15 μm particles the numerous agglomerates and reaction products between SiC particles and alloying elements were observed. The presence of SiC particles assisted in improving hardness and decreasing the tensile strength and plastic properties...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: WE 43 is a {{high-strength}} {{magnesium alloy}} characterized by good mechanical properties both at an ambient and elevated temperature (up to 300 °C). It contains mainly yttrium and neodymium. The {{aim of this}} paper is to present the results of research on the microstructure of the WE 43 magnesium alloy in an as-cast condition. Design/methodology/approach: For the microstructure observation, a Reichert metallographic microscope MeF 2 and a HITACHI S- 3400 N scanning electron microscope with a Thermo Noran EDS equipped with SYSTEM SIX were used. A qualitative phase analysis was performed with a JEOL JDX- 7 S diffractometer. Microstrucutral examinations were performed JEOL 3010 transmission electron microscope. Findings: Based on the investigation carried out it was found that the microstructure of WE 43 alloy after continuous casting consists of α-Mg matrix and irregular precipitates of Mg 41 Nd 5, rectangular particles of MgY phase, particles of Mg 24 Y 5, longitudinal precipitates of β (Mg 14 Nd 2 Y) compound at grain boundaries and the grain interiors. All of these phases <b>contain</b> yttrium and <b>neodymium.</b> Research limitations/implications: Future researches should contain investigations of the influence of heat treatment parameters on microstructure, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of WE 43 alloy. Practical implications: WE 43 magnesium alloy is used in the aircraft industry, for wheels, engine casings, gear box casings and rotor heads in helicopters. Results of investigation may be useful for development casting technology of the Mg-Y-Nd alloys. Originality/value: The results of the researches make up a basis for the next investigations of magnesium alloys with addition of Y and Nd designed to exploitation at temperature to 300 °C...|$|R
40|$|Direct-drive {{permanent}} magnet generator (DD-PMG) wind turbines are becoming a larger part of the growing offshore wind turbine market. The strong {{permanent magnet}}s used, the NdFeB magnets, <b>contains</b> <b>neodymium</b> metal. The neodymium metal is a rare earth element (REE), and there are large environmental concerns regarding the mining and processing of the REEs. The research within the field is scarce. Consequently, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge of the environmental consequences of a shift away from the conventional gear-based turbine technology. In this thesis, a life cycle assessment (LCA) of electricity power production from offshore DD-PMG turbines was performed. To my knowledge, there are no previous LCAs of the DD-PMG turbines, thus the thesis will provide the first steps to fill this gap of knowledge. To be able to compare the conventional and the DD-PMG technology, an acknowledged, existing life cycle inventory (LCI) of an offshore wind farm, consisting of conventional wind turbines, was used (Arvesen et al. 2013). The inventory was modified to represent a wind farm with DD-PMG turbines. The scope of the assessment included a detailed inventory of the production of neodymium metal, which was important to accomplish an evaluation of how the use of REEs affected the environmental performance of wind power. In the assessment, it was found that the DD-PMG had less impact than the conventional design in 12 of the 13 included environmental categories. The increased electricity power production for the DD-PMG turbine was one main driver for the reductions, together with reductions because of a more compact nacelle. The omission of the gearbox led to a lighter, more streamlined nacelle configuration that turned out to be important for the results. In addition, there was less copper mass in the DD-PM generator. This caused reductions in the impact, especially in the toxicity and freshwater eutrophication categories. In these categories, we saw the highest reductions, which were in the range of 13 - 24 % for the process-based LCA results. Excluding the foundation, the NdFeB magnet mass share is 0, 46 % of the wind mill construction. Thus, it is a small part of the total wind farm system, but does have a considerate impact in many of the categories. It is dominant for the marine eutrophication category, leading to an impact increase of 58 % from the conventional to the DD-PMG design. The relative share of the total impact related to the neodymium magnet is in the range of 2 - 6 % for 10 of the 13 considered categories. A closer analysis showed that the use of copper was more critical than the use of NdFeB magnet material to the impacts in the toxicity category group. This indicates shortcomings of the neodymium metal inventory, as one would assume that these impacts at least would be similar for the two materials. More data based on the empirical practice of neodymium metal production is a prerequisite to develop the environmental research within the field. The neodymium metal inventory does show robustness for more fossil energy-dependent categories, like climate change, where the use of NdFeB turns out to be more critical than copper. A benefit of the DD-PMG turbines is claimed to be an increased reliability compared to the conventional technology, since critical gearbox failures are avoided. In a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that a decreased downtime, together with less maintenance activities from marine vessels, gives a potential of even higher reductions of the environmental impact. The results from the thesis shows that the DD-PMG design is beneficial from an environmental point of view. The advantages of reduced weight in the nacelle and increased electricity production in the DD-PMG design outperforms the disadvantage of using NdFeB magnets. 	 For å kunne sammenligne vindkraft fra konvensjonelle og DD­PMG­turbiner, ble det brukt et eksisterende, anerkjent livsløpsinventar (LCI) av en offshore vindmøllepark med konvensjonelle turbiner (Arvesen et al. 2013). Inventaret ble modifisert slik at det fremstod som en vindmøllepark med DD­PMG­turbiner. Innenfor rammen av oppgaven var det også ønsket et detaljert inventar av sjeldne jordarter. Dette var viktig for å kunne vurdere hvordan bruken av REE påvirket miljøbelastningene knyttet til vindkraft. I analysen fant vi at DD­PMG­turbiner hadde mindre påvirkning enn konvensjonelle turbiner i 12 av de 13 undersøkte miljøkategoriene. Den økte elektrisitetsproduksjonen og en lettere og mer kompakt nacelle førte til disse reduksjonene. Det viste seg at en lettere nacelle, på grunn at man utelater girkassen i DD­PMG­designet, var viktig for resultatene. I tillegg var det mindre bruk av kobber i DD­PM­generatoren. Dette reduserte særlig miljøpåvirkningene i kategorier for toksisitet- og ferskvannseutrofiering. I disse kategoriene var reduksjonene størst, 13 ­ 24 %, for (de prosessbaserte) LCA­resultatene. NdFeB­magnetene utgjør kun 0, 46 % av vekten til vindmøllekonstruksjonen, om vi utelater fundamentmassen til konstruksjonen. Den har allikevel forholdsvis høy påvirkning på resultatene. Særlig for kategorien for marin eutrofiering, hvor fremstillingen av neodymium fører til en økning i miljøbelastningene på 58 %. Andelen knyttet til NdFeB­magnetene er fra 2 ­ 6 % av resultatene i 10 av 13 miljøkategorier. Nærmere undersøkelser viser at bruken av kobber er viktigere for resultatene enn NdFeB for miljøbelastinger i toksisitetkategorigruppa. Dette kan indikere at inventaret for neodymiummetallet ikke dekker de reelle miljøbelastningene, siden man i utgangspunktet skulle tro at belastningene i det minste var like for de to metallene. Større datatilgjengelighet basert på empirisk forskning er en forutsetning for framtidig utvikling av forskningen innen feltet. I andre kategorier, som påvirkes mer av bruken av fossil energi, ser vi imidlertid at inventaret er robust. Mindre vedlikehold og færre driftsstans hevdes å være en fordel for DD­PMG­turbiner, siden man unngår de kritiske feilene på girkassa. Resultatene fra denne oppgaven viser at mindre nedetid for turbinene, samt mindre bruk av skipsfartøy til vedlikehold, gir et potensiale for enda høyere reduksjoner av de miljømessige påvirkningene. Ved en total vurdering av miljøbelastningene, viser resultatene fra denne oppgaven at DD­PMG­designet er fordelaktig. I denne sammenhengen er ulempene ved å bruke NdFeB­magneter mindre enn fordelene av en lettere nacelle og økt elektrisitetsproduksjon...|$|R
