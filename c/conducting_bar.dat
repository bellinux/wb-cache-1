50|$|Beaulieu (in 1970) {{reported}} a transversely-excited atmospheric-pressure CO2 laser. His {{solution to the}} problem of arc formation was to have a <b>conducting</b> <b>bar</b> facing a linear array of pins with a separation of a few centimetres. The pins were individually loaded with resistors forcing the discharge from each pin into a low current brush or glow discharge which fanned out towards the bar. The laser cavity probed 100-200 of these discharges in series providing the laser gain. A fast discharge capacitor rapidly switched across the laser electrodes using a spark gap or thyratron provided the high voltage pulses.|$|E

40|$|An {{electrical}} impedance spectroscopy-based nondestructive testing (NDT) method is proposed to image both cracks and reinforcing bars in concrete structures. The method utilizes the frequency-dependent behavior of thin insulating cracks: low-frequency electrical currents are blocked by insulating cracks, whereas high-frequency currents can {{pass through the}} <b>conducting</b> <b>bars</b> without being blocked by thin cracks. Rigorous mathematical analysis relates the geometric structures of the cracks and bars to the frequency-dependent Neumann-to-Dirichlet data.

Two approaches to solving this problem are discussed for geometries with two components of eddy current.

The second approach is to combine the Finite Element Method with an analytical scattering technique. These two approaches are applied to the problem of an infinitely long coil surrounding an infinitely long <b>conducting</b> <b>bar</b> with an infinitely long surface crack.

40|$|Objectives] In {{order to}} study the {{vibration}} and noise of induction motors, a method of radial electromagnetic force calculation is established {{on the basis of}} the multi-loop model. [Methods] Based on the method of calculating air-gap magneto motive force according to stator and rotor fundamental wave current, the analytic formulas are deduced for calculating the air-gap magneto motive force and radial electromagnetic force generated in accordance with any stator winding and rotor <b>conducting</b> <b>bar</b> current. The multi-loop theory and calculation method for the electromagnetic parameters of a motor are introduced, and a dynamic simulation model of an induction motor built to achieve the current of the stator winding and rotor conducting bars, and obtain the calculation formula of radial electromagnetic force. The radial electromagnetic force and vibration are then estimated. [Results] The experimental results indicate that the vibration acceleration frequency and amplitude of the motor are consistent with the experimental results. [Conclusions] The results and calculation method can support the low noise design of converters...|$|E
40|$|A sensor for {{measuring}} small convective heat flows (< 0. 2 W/cm^ 2) from micro-structured surfaces is designed and tested. This sensor {exploits {{the notion of}} thermal guard and is purposely designed} to deal with metal samples made by additive manufacturing, {such as} {{direct metal laser sintering}} (DMLS). For validation purposes, we utilize both experimental literature data and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model: Maximum and average deviations from CDF model in terms of the Nusselt number are on the order of +/- 13. 7 % and +/- 6. 3 %, respectively while deviations from literature data are even smaller. Similar works in the literature often have the necessity of maintaining one-directional heat flows along the main dimension of a <b>conducting</b> <b>bar</b> using insulating materials. Such an approach can be critical for small fluxes due to the curse of heat conduction losses along secondary directions. As a result, it is necessary to estimate those secondary fluxes (e. g. by numerical models), thus making the measurement difficult and indirect. On the other hand, depending on the manufacturing accuracy, the present sensor enables to practically reduce at will those losses, with direct measurement of the heat flux. To our knowledge, the adoption of thermal guard is not a common practice in convective heat transfer, especially when local measurements are of interest. We hope that this study may (i) shed light on the usefulness of the approach in this field; and (ii) provide an effective tool for future investigation on electronic cooling and convective heat transfer enhancement by micro-/nano-structured surfaces. Owing to a number of features of the proposed device, we suggest that it can be prospectively utilized in the near future (i) for industrial applications (due to simplicity and robustness of the design); (ii) for high temperature measurements (unlike foil sensors, no delamination issues can be experienced); (iii) in the context of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) (easy to miniaturize) ...|$|E

25|$|The {{diversion}} of farms {{for personal use}} by Zimbabwe's political elite began to emerge as a crucial issue during the mid 1990s. Prime Minister Mugabe, who assumed an executive presidency in 1987, had urged restraint by enforcing a leadership code of <b>conduct</b> which <b>barred</b> members of the ruling party, ZANU-PF, from monopolising large tracts of farmland and then renting them out for profit. Local media outlets soon exposed huge breaches of the code by Mugabe's family and senior officials in ZANU-PF. Despite calls for accountability, the party members were never disciplined. Instead of being resettled by landless peasants, several hundred commercial farms acquired under the Land Acquisition Act continued to be leased out by politically connected individuals. In 1994, a disproportionate amount of the land being acquired was held by fewer than 600 black landowners, many of whom owned multiple properties. One study of commercial farms found that over half the redistributed land that year went to absentee owners otherwise unengaged in agriculture.|$|R
