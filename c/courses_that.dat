5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E

5|$|Exercises were {{conducted}} using live ammunition and explosives to make training as realistic as possible.

Speed and endurance marches {{were conducted}} {{up and down}} the nearby mountain ranges and over assault <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> included a zip-line over Loch Arkaig, all while carrying arms and full equipment. Training continued by day and night with river crossings, mountain climbing, weapons training, unarmed combat, map reading, and small boat operations on the syllabus.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian army {{units were}} skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Starting {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century, {{technique}} evolved from the striding in-track classic technique to include skate-skiing, which occurs on <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> have been groomed with wide lanes for those using the technique. At the same time, equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural materials to comprising such man-made materials as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and polyethylene plastics.|$|E
5|$|Struthers studied {{medicine}} at Edinburgh, winning prizes as an undergraduate. He completed his M.D. degree in 1845, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh {{at the same}} time. In 1847, the college licensed him and his brother James to teach anatomy. The <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> they taught at the medical school in Argyle Square, Edinburgh were recognized by the examining bodies of England, Scotland and Ireland.|$|E

The course has held five amateur championships and from 2001 to 2008 the LPGA had a regular tour stop, latterly known as the SemGroup Championship at Cedar Ridge Country Club. In addition, Tulsa has two golf courses designed by famed golf course architect A.W. Tillinghast: the Oaks Country Club and Tulsa Country Club.|$|E

5|$|In Time Trials, {{the player}} can freely race {{on a course}} to perform the best times, which are {{recorded}} in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon how many rings the player passes through without missing, {{as well as the}} class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E

25|$|The <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> {{a student}} takes {{depending}} on program and orientation {{can be divided}} into four levels: core subjects, program-specific subjects, orientation subjects, and individually selected courses. Core courses are <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> everyone, regardless of program, must study to satisfy the requirements for a student degree. Program-specific courses are the additional <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> a student is required to take to fulfill the program requirements. If a student for some reason does not fulfill the requirements, for example, by electing to replace a program-specific course with another course, the student is considered to have attended a specially designed program, which has no bearing except for what's printed on the school leaving certificate. Orientation subjects are the <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> a student elects to take by selecting an orientation. Normally these courses take place {{in the second and third}} year, although in a few cases the courses start earlier. Finally, individually selected courses are <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> the student freely selects for herself/himself in the second and third year; specific slots have been set aside in the curriculum and the schedule for these.|$|E
