5|$|The {{design of}} the First Issue (postage <b>currency)</b> was {{directly}} based on Spinner’s original handmade examples. Some varieties even had perforated stamp-like edge. While not actually legal tender, postage <b>currency</b> could be exchanged for United States Notes in $5 lots and were receivable in payment of all dues to the United States, up to $5. Subsequent issues would no longer include images of stamps and were referred to as Fractional <b>Currency.</b> Despite the July 1862 legislation, postage stamps remained a form of <b>currency</b> until postage <b>currency</b> gained momentum {{in the spring of}} 1863. In 1863, Secretary Chase asked for a new fractional <b>currency</b> that was harder to counterfeit than the postage <b>currency.</b> The new fractional <b>currency</b> notes were different from the 1862 postage <b>currency</b> issues. They were more colorful with printing on the reverse, and several anti-counterfeiting measures were employed: experimental paper, adding surcharges, overprints, blue end paper, silk fibers, and watermarks to name a few. Fractional <b>currency</b> shields which had single sided specimens were sold to banks to provide a standard for comparison for detecting counterfeits. Postage and fractional <b>currency</b> remained in use until 1876, when Congress authorized the minting of fractional silver coins to redeem the outstanding fractional <b>currency.</b>|$|E

5|$|Treasurer of the United States Francis E. Spinner {{has been}} {{credited}} with finding {{the solution to the}} shortage of coinage: he created postage <b>currency</b> (which led into the use of Fractional <b>currency).</b> Postage (or postal) <b>currency</b> was the first of five issues of US Post Office fractional paper money printed in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations and issued from 21 August 1862 through 27 May 1863. Spinner proposed using postage stamps, affixed to Treasury paper, with his signature on the bottom (see illustration below). Based on this initiative, Congress supported a temporary solution involving fractional <b>currency</b> and on 17 July 1862 President Lincoln signed the Postage <b>Currency</b> Bill into law. The intent, however, was not that stamps should be a circulating <b>currency.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} <b>currency</b> appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This <b>currency</b> appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its <b>currency</b> to buy the exporting country's <b>currency</b> used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its <b>currency,</b> must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own <b>currency</b> to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own <b>currency</b> to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} <b>currency</b> even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E
40|$|Exchange {{rates and}} global volatility: {{implications}} for Asia-Pacific <b>currencies</b> 1 At times of heightened global equity and bond market volatility, high-yielding <b>currencies</b> tend to depreciate while low-yielding ones tend {{to serve as}} a “safe haven”. The whole spectrum of sensitivity to global volatility is represented among Asia-Pacific <b>currencies.</b> JEL classification: F 3, G 1. Emerging market and industrial <b>currencies</b> offering relatively high yields tended to appreciate in 2006 against lower-yielding <b>currencies,</b> except during the selloff in May and June. Among Asia-Pacific <b>currencies,</b> the Indonesian rupiah, the Philippine peso and even the Australian dollar offer examples of this pattern. Thus, much of the year’s trading added to the increasing body of findings (once considered anomalous) that higher-yielding <b>currencies</b> tend to appreciate against lower-yielding <b>currencies</b> (Hodrick (1987), Froot and Thaler (1990), Lewis (1995), Engel (1996), Remolona and Schrijvers (2003)).

5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their <b>currency</b> {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's <b>currency</b> in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the <b>currency</b> will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the <b>currency</b> of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the <b>currency</b> being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the <b>currency</b> and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} <b>currency</b> devaluation has {{to involve}} a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other <b>currency.</b> The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual <b>currency</b> will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own <b>currency</b> or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish <b>currency,</b> Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing almost as much as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national <b>currency.</b> Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, {{on the grounds that the}} United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies.

5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} <b>currency</b> band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the <b>currency</b> snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European <b>Currency</b> Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its <b>currency</b> with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each <b>currency</b> in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that <b>currency</b> pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued <b>currency</b> as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their <b>currency.</b> Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a <b>currency</b> war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used <b>currency</b> devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E
5|$|Iceland, {{not part}} of the EU, is {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its <b>currency,</b> which has effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive. Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by <b>currency</b> devaluations, a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment. Sweden's floating rate <b>currency</b> gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity. Labour concessions, a minimal reliance on public debt, and tax reform helped to further a pro-growth policy.|$|E

5|$|In March 1948 Rau became {{chairman}} of the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which during this period became the centralised administrative organisation for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government. The organisation existed {{during a time of}} very difficult challenges coming from different sides. A particularly momentous event during this time was the <b>currency</b> reform of 1948. On 20June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new <b>currency,</b> leaving the eastern zone to use the old common <b>currency.</b> In order to avoid inflation, the DWK under Rau's leadership, was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own <b>currency</b> too. In doing so, the DWK also exploited the <b>currency</b> reform to redistribute capital by using different exchange rates for private and state-run companies. The disagreement, which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin, triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin.|$|E
