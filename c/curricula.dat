5|$|Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist Max Weber (1864–1920) are {{typically}} {{cited as the}} three principal architects of sociology. Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner, Lester F. Ward, W. E. B. Du Bois, Vilfredo Pareto, Alexis de Tocqueville, Werner Sombart, Thorstein Veblen, Ferdinand Tönnies, Georg Simmel and Karl Mannheim are often included on academic <b>curricula</b> as founding theorists. <b>Curricula</b> also may include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber and Friedrich Engels as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology. Each key figure {{is associated with a}} particular theoretical perspective and orientation.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, in 2003, COBOL {{featured}} in 80% {{of information systems}} <b>curricula</b> in the United States, the same proportion as C++ and Java.|$|E
5|$|Several {{colleges and}} high schools have {{featured}} the film in science <b>curricula.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of that century, some {{boarding}} schools like Eton College and Winchester College thrived educating {{the sons of the}} aristocracy, but most endowed grammar schools were in decline, their classical <b>curricula</b> seen as irrelevant to the industrial age.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1956, the MSU Honors College {{provides}} individualized <b>curricula</b> to MSU's top undergraduate students. Though {{the college}} offers no majors of its own, {{it has its}} own dean and academic advisers to help Honors students with their educational pursuits.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Albert {{was elected}} Chancellor of the University of Cambridge after a close contest with the Earl of Powis. Albert used his {{position}} as Chancellor to campaign successfully for reformed and more modern university <b>curricula,</b> expanding the subjects taught beyond the traditional mathematics and classics to include modern history and the natural sciences.|$|E
5|$|Science {{classes at}} Mrs. Dow's around 1917 {{included}} Physiology, Botany, Chemistry, General Science, and Domestic Science. The latter class involved different <b>curricula</b> each term: dietaries, cookery, household administration and care, food chemistry, and (advanced) cookery. Mrs. Dow's held psychology, history of philosophy, political economy, social science, and ethics and logic classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupiers}} looted {{and destroyed}} much of Poland's {{cultural and historical}} heritage, while persecuting and murdering members of the Polish cultural elite. Most Polish schools were closed, and those that remained open saw their <b>curricula</b> altered significantly.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany <b>curricula</b> and textbooks, fungi are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed with the animals in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts. Analyses using molecular phylogenetics support a monophyletic origin of the Fungi. The taxonomy of the Fungi {{is in a state of}} constant flux, especially due to recent research based on DNA comparisons. These current phylogenetic analyses often overturn classifications based on older and sometimes less discriminative methods based on morphological features and biological species concepts obtained from experimental matings.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{attendance}} {{records for}} the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school <b>curricula</b> were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.|$|E
5|$|BusinessWeek {{annually}} {{publishes a}} {{lists of the}} best programmes that combine design thinking and business thinking (D-schools 2009 and D-school Programmes to Watch 2009). The article Finland – World´s Innovation Hot Spot in the Harvard Business Review shows the interest of business leaders in the blended education of design and management. Business Schools (such as the Rotman School of Management, Wharton University of Pennsylvania and MIT Sloan Executive Education) have acted on this interest and developed new academic <b>curricula.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1965, San Diego State began {{offering}} {{a doctorate in}} chemistry in a joint effort with University of California, San Diego. By 1991, the campus had eight different doctorate programs. Research became a vital practice of the faculty during the 1960s. By 1965, more than 200 books had been authored by SDSC faculty. Federal research grants increased from $398,202 in 1961 to $1,184,387 in 1967. Faculty research included medical and scientific research, teacher enhancement, Peace Corps training, and a review of nursing <b>curricula.</b>|$|E
5|$|In response, Assistant to the Solicitor General Matthew D. Roberts argued {{on behalf}} of the United States that patient care and not {{educational}} <b>curricula</b> occupies the vast majority of residents' time. He also argued that although the 1939 FICA Amendment had originally specifically exempted interns, residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license, that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into Social Security earlier so that they could be eligible for certain benefits.|$|E
5|$|Most {{universities}} {{focus on}} general studies, mixing together such {{areas of study}} as business, engineering and technology. Seven universities have specialized <b>curricula.</b> Two of these are focused on Islamic studies, two on agricultural science, one on healthcare science, one on veterinary medicine, and one on women's studies. A detailed evaluation of all the universities {{can be found in}} the Bangladesh University Ranking 2017 report.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{feature of}} the program was its {{accelerated}} training <b>curricula.</b> The nursing schools were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. Of the 1,300 schools of nursing in the country, 1,125 participated in the program. The Corps operated from 1943 until 1948, and during this period 179,294 student nurses enrolled in the program and 124,065 of them graduated from participating nursing schools. The enrollment included over 3,000 African Americans, 40 Native Americans, and 400 Japanese Americans. The federal government spent $160,326,237 on the nursing program.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} {{is the creation of}} a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized <b>curricula</b> for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E
5|$|Academically, the University of Toronto {{is noted}} for {{influential}} movements and <b>curricula</b> in literary criticism and communication theory, known collectively as the Toronto School. The university was {{the birthplace of}} insulin and stem cell research, and {{was the site of}} the first practical electron microscope, the development of multi-touch technology, the identification of the first black hole Cygnus X-1, and the development of the theory of NP-completeness. By a significant margin, it receives the most annual scientific research funding of any Canadian university. It is one of two members of the Association of American Universities outside the United States, the other being McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff High School hosts several {{theatrical}} {{and musical}} groups. School groups include the Fall Drama, the Spring Musical, Jazz Band, Pep Band, Camerata, Clifftones, Overtones, Chamber Orchestra, and Garage Orchestra. The high school {{prides itself on}} its arts <b>curricula,</b> and produces musicals and dramatic productions at the school auditorium, which was built in 1998 and seats 500. In 2010, it was renamed for former Superintendent Frances G. Wills. The auditorium has hosted other Briarcliff shows and events, including the Centennial Variety Show from April 26–27, 2002, arranged by the nine-member Briarcliff Manor Centennial Committee for the village's centennial celebration. The school was the first US high school to perform the British musical The Hired Man, from March 7–9, 2014.|$|E
5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have <b>curricula</b> {{identical}} {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical rotations through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical rotations with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical rotations where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|Fordham's {{undergraduate}} schools all offer honors {{programs for}} their students. The programs' <b>curricula</b> are modified {{versions of the}} Core Curriculum. For example, the Fordham College Honors Program offers a Great Books curriculum with seminar-style classes and a senior research thesis in each student's major. Most honors students are inducted into the programs upon admission to the university, though some are invited {{at the end of}} their first year. Each program has a designated study space for its members, including Alpha House for the Fordham College Honors Program and the honors wing of Hughes Hall for the Global Business Honors Program. Upon graduating from the university, honors students receive the designation of in cursu honorum on their diploma and transcripts.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 {{through her}} {{retirement}} in 1954, Morgan was a department chair or co-chair. Initially, {{the leadership of}} the Department of Home Economics was split between Morgan (as the head of the household science division) and Mary Patterson (as the head of the household arts division). Morgan was not fond of sharing a department with Patterson, who had a background in decorative arts and no inclination toward science. By 1920, Berkley president David Prescott Barrows agreed to Morgan's request to separate the two divisions into distinct departments since they had different <b>curricula,</b> philosophies and faculty, and Morgan became the sole chair of the Department of Household Science.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school <b>curricula,</b> but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|Premiering at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival {{and opening}} in New York City and Los Angeles on May 24, 2006, the {{documentary}} {{was a critical}} and box office success, winning two Academy Awards for Best Documentary Feature and Best Original Song. The film grossed $24 million in the U.S. and $26 million at the international box office, becoming the tenth highest grossing documentary film to date in the United States. Since the film's release, An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of global warming and reenergizing the environmental movement. The documentary has also been included in science <b>curricula</b> in schools around the world, which has spurred some controversy. A sequel to the film, titled , was released on July 28, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity <b>curricula</b> in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon {{in most of}} the first half of the 20th century. The Scopes Trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson v. Arkansas decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school <b>curricula</b> in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the <b>curricula</b> of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E
5|$|While MIT is {{a private}} institution, Walker's {{extensive}} civic activities as President set the precedent for future presidents to use the post to fulfill civic and cultural obligations throughout Boston. He served {{as a member of}} the Massachusetts Board of Education (1882–1890), Boston School Committee (1885–1888), Boston Art Commission (1885–1897), Boston Park Commission (1890–1896), Massachusetts Historical Society (1883–1897), and a trustee of the Boston Public Library in 1896. Walker was committed to a variety of reforms in public and normal schools such as secular <b>curricula,</b> expanding the emphasis on arithmetic, reducing the emphasis on ineffectual home exercises, and increasing the pay and training of teachers.|$|E
25|$|The school {{combines}} both German and Turkish <b>curricula.</b> Mathematics, geometry, chemistry, physics, biology, {{computer science}} and German classes are instructed in German, while history, geography, civic education, military sciences, religion, philosophy, literature, physical education, {{art and music}} are taught in Turkish. Textbooks, <b>curricula</b> and standards are under the permanent supervision of the German government. German and English are the compulsory foreign languages taught at İstanbul Lisesi.|$|E

25|$|Sarkozy opened another {{avenue of}} {{controversy}} by declaring {{that he wanted}} a reform of the immigration system, with s designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy. He also wants to reform the current French system for foreign students, saying that it enables foreign students to take open-ended <b>curricula</b> {{in order to obtain}} residency in France; instead, he wants to select the best students to the best <b>curricula</b> in France.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, sex {{education}} {{has been part of}} school <b>curricula</b> since 1970. Since 1992 {{sex education}} is a governmental duty by law.|$|E
25|$|Some sex {{education}} is taught {{as part of}} biology-related <b>curricula.</b> There is also an official program intended to provide {{sex education}} for students.|$|E
