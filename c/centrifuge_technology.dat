Furthermore, the success of the Pakistani Gas <b>Centrifuge</b> Enrichment <b>Technology</b> (GCET) - based nuclear weapons program has imposed a great challenge on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) regime. In this context, this study tried to answer two questions: (a) what is the probability of proliferators successfully producing Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) at Gas Centrifuge Enrichment Plants (GCEPs) and (b) how effective is the current NPT regime in dealing with this issue. In order to tackle these two questions, an integrated methodology is used that reflects all factors affecting the nuclear proliferation on the front-end of the nuclear fuel cycle. A quantitative assessment of the proliferation risks of producing HEU for multiple scenarios is presented using success tree models, uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis, importance measures, and expert opinion. This assessment identifies the factors that can reduce the proliferators' success of producing HEU, which will be helpful in prioritizing the use of the IAEA's limited resources. (cont.) The study found that legal capabilities of the NPT regime are more problematic than technological capabilities in preventing proliferators from producing HEU at GCEPs, since the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is the only NPT regime component that has compliance-enforcing resources. This study recommends three approaches as follows: First, the NPT regime should take a multi-faceted approach that incorporates all NPT regime components into each step of nuclear weapons program development. Second, the NPT regime should impose nuclear elements control via Multilateral Export Control Regimes (MECRs). Third, the NPT regime should develop an approach that challenges HEU production from both technological- and legal points of view. Since law governs technological capability, a multidimensional approach that includes this relationship would be more effective than an approach that focuses on either aspect individually. by Taeshin Kwak.

40|$|Background: Short-radius human <b>centrifuge</b> (SRHC) <b>technology</b> {{is being}} {{considered}} as a multi-system integrated microgravity countermeasure for our astronauts. To design SRHC countermeasures, {{it is essential to}} develop the ability to analyze and study the kinematics and dynamics of movement on a SRHC. Aims: By utilizing motion capture (Vicon Bonita) technology, subject movement can be tracked during centrifugation. The effects of camera mounting and vibration on the quality of data collected were the primary focus of this study. Methods: A camera mounting structure (cage) was designed to attach to the ESA short-radius human centrifuge (r= 2. 7 m), to maximize available viewing area, and to minimize effects of vibration. Three tri-axial accelerometers were mounted, two on the cage and one on the nacelle (bed) to capture vibration effects. Motion capture and accelerometer data were taken at acceleration profiles of 0 g (no movement), 0. 5 g, 1 g, 1. 6 g, 2. 3 g, 3. 7 g and 4 g in the Z direction (towards the feet). Fourier spectral analysis and FFT filtering were used to analyze frequency power spectra and estimate displacement of the cage. Root mean square error (RMSE) of the marker positions was analyzed across acceleration profiles. Results: Camera positioning allowed for the observation of the lower body area of the SRHC nacelle. Vibration related displacement of the cage increased proportionally with acceleration to a maximum of 5. 1 ± 0. 87 mm (90 % peak to peak) at 3. 7 g, primarily in the sway (X) direction. At 4 g, this vibration reduced to 3. 3 ± 1 mm. Frequency analysis of vibration profiles of the nacelle and cage showed maximal power spectra at 13 Hz in sway and 38 Hz in surge (Z) directions at 3. 7 g. Mean RMSE values across acceleration profiles showed a maximum position variation of 2. 37 ± 1. 18 mm. Conclusion: Motion capture and reconstruction were successful for static markers using the designed mounting apparatus. Vibration was minimized at the highest acceleration profile, hypothesized to be dampened under deflection during rotation. Mounting of the apparatus could be improved if modifications to the SRHC are possible. This configuration should be considered a worst-case scenario for vibration interference to motion capture. These results suggest the feasibility of capturing large movement dynamic motion, such as squat exercises, on a short-radius human centrifuge for analysis and modeling purposes...|$|R

40|$|Two {{key issues}} defined {{the focus of}} this {{research}} in manufacturing plasmid DNA for use In human gene therapy. First, the processing of E. coli bacterial cells to effect the separation of therapeutic plasmid DNA from cellular debris and adventitious material. Second, the affinity purification of the plasmid DNA in a Simple one-stage process. The need arises when considering the concerns that have been recently voiced by the FDA concerning the scalability and reproducibility of the current manufacturing processes in meeting the quality criteria of purity, potency, efficacy, and safety for a recombinant drug substance for use in humans. To develop a preliminary purification procedure, an EFD cross-flow micro-filtration module was assessed for its ability to effect the 20 -fold concentration, 6 -time diafiltration, and final clarification of the plasmid DNA from the subsequent cell lysate that is derived from a 1 liter E. coli bacterial cell culture. Historically, the employment of cross-flow filtration modules within procedures for harvesting cells from bacterial cultures have failed to reach the required standards dictated by existing continuous <b>centrifuge</b> <b>technologies,</b> frequently resulting in the rapid blinding of the membrane with bacterial cells that substantially reduces the permeate flux. By challenging the EFD module, containing six helical wound tubular membranes promoting centrifugal instabilities known as Dean vortices, with distilled water between the Dean number's of 187 Dn and 818 Dn,and the transmembrane pressures (TMP) of 0 to 5 psi. The data demonstrated that the fluid dynamics significantly influenced the permeation rate, displaying a maximum at 227 Dn (312 Imh) and minimum at 818 Dn (130 Imh) for a transmembrane pressure of 1 psi. Numerical studies indicated that the initial increase and subsequent decrease resulted from a competition between the centrifugal and viscous forces that create the Dean vortices. At Dean numbers between 187 Dn and 227 Dn, the forces combine constructively to increase the apparent strength and influence of the Dean vortices. However, as the Dean number in increases above 227 On the centrifugal force dominates the viscous forces, compressing the Dean vortices into the membrane walls and reducing their influence on the radial transmembrane pressure i. e. the permeate flux reduced. When investigating the action of the Dean vortices in controlling tile fouling rate of E. coli bacterial cells, it was demonstrated that the optimum cross-flow rate at which to effect the concentration of a bacterial cell culture was 579 Dn and 3 psi TMP, processing in excess of 400 Imh for 20 minutes (i. e., concentrating a 1 L culture to 50 ml in 10 minutes at an average of 450 Imh). The data demonstrated that there was a conflict between the Dean number at which the shear rate could control the cell fouling, and the Dean number at which tile optimum flux enhancement was found. Hence, the internal geometry of the EFD module was shown to sub-optimal for this application. At 579 Dn and 3 psi TMP, the 6 -fold diafiltration was shown to occupy 3. 6 minutes of process time, processing at an average flux of 400 Imh. Again, at 579 Dn and 3 psi TMP the clarification of the plasmid from tile resulting freeze-thaw cell lysate was achieved at 120 Iml 1, passing 83 % (2, 5 mg) of the plasmid DNA (6, 3 ng μ- 1 10. 8 mg of genomic DNA (∼ 23, 00 Obp, 36 ng μ- 1), and 7. 2 mg of cellular proteins (5 - 100 kDa, 21. 4 ngμ- 1) into the post-EFD process stream. Hence the EFD module was shown to be effective, achieving the desired objectives in approximately 25 minutes. On the basis of its ability to intercalate into low molecular weight dsDNA present in dilute cell lysates, and be electrophoresed through agarose, the fluorophore PicoGreen was selected {{for the development of a}} suitable dsDNA assay. It was assesseel for its accuracy, and reliability, In determining the concentration and identity of DNA present in samples that were eleclrophoresed through agarose gels. The signal emitted by intercalated PicoGreen was shown to be constant and linear, and that the mobility of the PicaGreen-DNA complex was not affected by the intercalation. Concerning the secondary purification procedure, various anion-exchange membranes were assessed for their ability to capture plasmid DNA from the post-EFD process stream. For a commercially available Sartorius Sartobind Q 15 membrane, the reduction in the equilibriumbinding capacity for  ctDNA in buffer of increasing ionic demonstrated that DNA was being. adsorbed by electrostatic  interactions only. However, the problems associated with fluid distribution across the membrane demonstrated that the membrane housing was the predominant cause of the. erratic breakthrough curves. Consequently, this would need to be rectified before such a membrane could be integrated into the current system, or indeed be scaled beyond laboratory scale. However, when challenged with the process material, the data showed that considerable quantities of protein (1150 μg) were adsorbed preferentially to the plasmid DNA (44 μg). This was also shown for derived Pall Gelman UltraBind US 450 membranes that had been functionalised by varying molecular weight poly-L~lysine and polyethyleneimine ligands. Hence the anion-exchange membranes were shown to be ineffective in capturing plasmid DNA from the process stream. Finally, work was performed to integrate a sequence-specific DNA·binding protein into a single-stage DNA chromatography, isolating plasmid DNA from E. coli cells whilst minimising the contamination from genomic DNA and cellular protein. Preliminary work demonstrated that the fusion protein was capable of isolating pUC 19 DNA into which the recognition sequence for the fusion-protein had been inserted (pTS DNA) when in the presence of the conditioned process material. Althougth the pTS recognition sequence differs from native pUC 19 sequences by only 2 bp, the fusion protein was shown to act as a highly selective affinity ligand for pTS DNA alone. Subsequently, the scale of the process was scaled 25 -fold and positioned directly following the EFD system. In conclusion, the integration of the EFD micro-filtration system and zinc-finger affinity purification technique resulted in the capture of approximately 1 mg of plasmid DNA was purified from 1 L of E. coli  culture in a simple two stage process, resulting in the complete removal of genomic DNA and 96. 7 % of cellular protein in less than 1 hour of process time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract	 Offshore {{oil and gas}} {{drilling}} operations generates slop water, {{which are}} formed when wastewater originating from multiple sources becomes contaminated with drilling fluid components {{and have to be}} disposed or treated prior to discharge in compliance with local discharge regulations. The logistics and treatment of slop water have been suggested to represent {{a significant part of the}} life-cycle environmental footprint of offshore drilling operations but poorly understood due to lack of information regarding volumes, sources and technology descriptions to properly model slop waste treatment technologies with life-cycle assessment. In this thesis, the environmental impacts of offshore injection disposal and a range of slop water treatment technology options applied offshore and onshore for the treatment of different types and volumes of slop water were evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA). The offshore treatment technological set-ups were filtration, dissolved air flotation (DAF) and <b>centrifuge</b> based treatment <b>technologies,</b> while the onshore treatment system involves a combination of chemical and physical treatment processes. The sources, characteristics and volume estimates of slop water treated by the identified treatment technologies were described based on four wells scenarios drilled within the Norwegian continental shelf which includes a normal, deep-water, and high pressure high temperature (HPHT) well, all of which were partly drilled with an oil based mud (OBM) and an arctic well drilled using only water based mud (WBM). The results of the study showed that offshore treatment of slop is a better alternative to offshore injection and onshore treatment with the DAF system emerging as the best alternative overall. When slop cannot be handled at source on the rig, onshore treatment will be a better alternative to offshore injection. The disposal or recycling of oil present in slop water has a significant effect on the environmental performance of the treatment systems. A comparison of the normal well with the three other well scenarios highlighted that the HPHT and deep-water have relatively higher impacts due to the high volumes of slop water generated by both wells. The significant impact contributions of logistics when slop water is sent onshore was highlighted by the deep-water and arctic well scenarios which both has the longest distance from field to shore. The arctic well scenario offshore treatment impacts were the lowest due to the use of WBM only for drilling, thereby highlighting the significant effect of OBM use on slop water treatment impacts. The benefits of using natural gas and onshore electricity (where applicable) instead of diesel as a source of energy when handling slop offshore was also demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. The findings of this study offers new and useful information that allows for the better assessment of offshore slop water management options which also serves as a useful input in the decision objectives used by stakeholders for the overall environmental evaluation of offshore drilling activities...|$|R
