40|$|This paper {{presents}} two computational {{techniques for}} determining the structural capability of <b>clamp</b> band <b>systems,</b> which are typically used in launch vehicle applications. Both techniques utilize three-dimensional finite element models (3 D FEM) and consider contact between all {{the components of the}} <b>clamp</b> band <b>system.</b> One technique models the full circumference of the clamp band structure, while the other technique models a circumferential slice of the <b>clamp</b> band <b>system</b> and uses cyclic symmetry. The analytical predictions for the full 3 D model show reasonable agreement with test data. The cyclic symmetry model underestimates the capability of the hardware to withstand applied loads.

30|$|The current {{automated}} patch <b>clamp</b> <b>system</b> normally applies {{a negative}} pressure {{to catch the}} suspended cell in a buffer medium. This method causes some problems, for example, {{the tip of the}} pipette is blocked by the contaminant in the buffer. Moreover, the automated patch <b>clamp</b> <b>system</b> is currently difficult to fully determine the condition of the cell before catching and selecting the cell for patch clamp recording. Additionally, most of the current automated patch clamps were performed on the suspended cells, and the cells were fixed in the fluid medium by either mechanical method, e.g., cell scrapers or chemical method using trypsin [11], which would change the property of the cells [15],[16]. An automated patch clamp is still difficult to be performed on those adherent cells that are grown directly on the substrate. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automated micromanipulation system for manipulating the glass pipette to perform patch clamp recording on adherent cells.|$|R
