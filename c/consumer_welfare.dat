25|$|Competition law, {{known in}} the U.S. as {{antitrust}} law, is an evolving field that traces {{as far back as}} Roman decrees against price fixing and the English restraint of trade doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the Sherman Act and Clayton Act) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of <b>consumer</b> <b>welfare.</b>|$|E

25|$|Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Bork {{pursued a}} legal career after {{attending}} the University of Chicago. After {{working at the}} law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, he served as a Yale Law School professor. He became a prominent advocate of originalism, calling for judges to hew to the framers' original understanding of the United States Constitution. Bork also became an influential antitrust scholar, arguing that consumers often benefited from corporate mergers and that antitrust law should focus on <b>consumer</b> <b>welfare</b> rather than on ensuring competition. Bork wrote several notable books, including The Antitrust Paradox and Slouching Towards Gomorrah.|$|E
25|$|At Yale, he {{was best}} known for writing The Antitrust Paradox, a book in which he argued that {{consumers}} often benefited from corporate mergers, and that many then-current readings of the antitrust laws were economically irrational and hurt consumers. He posited that {{the primary focus of}} antitrust laws should be on <b>consumer</b> <b>welfare</b> rather than ensuring competition, as fostering competition of companies within an industry has a natural built-in tendency to allow, and even help, many poorly run companies with methodologies and practices that are both inefficient and expensive to continue in business simply for the sake of competition, to the detriment of both consumers and society. Bork's writings on antitrust law—with those of Richard Posner and other law and economics and Chicago School thinkers—were influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s.|$|E

The effects, furthermore, depend upon consumers being or not perfectly informed about qualities.
