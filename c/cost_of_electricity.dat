5|$|The levelized <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> (LCoE) can be {{calculated}} by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hydropower is {{produced}} in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela. The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.|$|E
5|$|The {{water was}} turned off at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city {{would pay for the}} operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E

5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E
5|$|Local trade unions, Durham County Council, {{and even}} the Farmers' Union were {{in support of the}} scheme, along with a number of private persons, the general reason being that it would bring a new form of {{employment}} to the city and surrounding areas. Opponents to the station however claimed that the new jobs at the power station would go to specialist technicians brought into the region, and that the positioning of the station near Durham would not be beneficial to the city's electricity supply or make the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> any cheaper for those living near the station. Critics also claimed that wherever in the region a new power station were to be built, County Durham coal would be used in it, and that despite NESCo's claims, there may be more suitable sites elsewhere. The critics claimed that Durham's functioning as a cultural, educational, administrative and tourist centre, would be ultimately destroyed by heavy industrialisation.|$|E

25|$|A {{key issue}} in {{implementing}} IGCC is its high capital cost, which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies. Currently, ordinary pulverized coal plants are the lowest cost power plant option. The advantage of IGCC {{comes from the}} ease of retrofitting existing power plants that could offset the high capital cost. In a 2007 model, IGCC with CCS is the lowest-cost system in all cases. This model compared estimations of levelized <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> showing IGCC with CCS to cost 71.9 $US2005/MWh, pulverized coal with CCS to cost 88 $US2005/MWh, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS to cost 80.6 $US2005/MWh. The levelized <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> was noticeably sensitive {{to the price of}} natural gas and the inclusion of carbon storage and transport costs.|$|E

30|$|It {{may also}} be noted the {{influence}} of the NG storages over the electric power system. When comparing marginal <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> in Cases A and B (Fig.  8), it can be observed that the existence of NG storages (Case B) produces a decrease in the peaks <b>of</b> the <b>electricity</b> marginal <b>cost</b> (compared to Case A).|$|R
25|$|Generally speaking, {{energy storage}} is {{economical}} when the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> varies {{more than the}} costs of storing and retrieving the energy plus the price of energy lost in the process. For instance, assume a pumped-storage reservoir can pump to its upper reservoir a volume of water capable of producing 1,200 MW·h after all losses are factored in (evaporation and seeping in the reservoir, efficiency losses, etc.). If the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> during off-peak times is $15 per MW·h, and the reservoir operates at 75% efficiency (i.e., 1,600 MW·h are consumed and 1,200 MW·h of energy are retrieved), then {{the total cost of}} filling the reservoir is $24,000. If all of the stored energy is sold the following day during peak hours for an average $40 per MW·h, then the reservoir will see revenues of $48,000 for the day, for a gross profit of $24,000.|$|E
25|$|When {{electricity}} {{was first}} introduced into houses, it was primarily used for lighting. At that time, many electricity companies operated a split-tariff system where the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> for lighting was lower than that for other purposes. This led to portable appliances (such as vacuum cleaners, electric fans, and hair driers) being connected to light bulb sockets using lampholder plugs.|$|E
25|$|In every {{published}} {{fusion power}} plant design, {{the part of the}} plant that produces the fusion reactions is much more expensive than the part that converts the nuclear power to electricity. In that case, as indeed in most power systems, power density is an important characteristic. Doubling power density at least halves the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> In addition, the confinement time required depends on the power density.|$|E
40|$|The {{future use}} of coal depends on {{environmental}} protection measures and the Kyoto Protocol, {{the price of}} CO 2 emission coupons, consumption, new technologies, the price of other energy sources and the liberalization <b>of</b> the <b>electricity</b> markets. The prices of emission coupons will impact the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> energy production. Due to the relatively higher reference <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> alternative energy sources, {{we can not expect}} that the share of coal as an energy source will lower significantly as a source <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> production in the future. From {{the point of view of}} regional economic aspects and the reference <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> production, we could state that using coal in the near future is also tied to the socio-economic aspects of mining domestic coal. Using it in thermo plants is also enabled by the conditions of priority dispatching (since 2000) in the EU economies. We assessed the influence of prices and the use of other energy sources, environmental measures, energy efficiency and the influence <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> market liberalisation on coal price movements.

25|$|Furthermore, {{the main}} line of {{research}} via tokamaks has been developed {{to the point that}} it is now possible to undertake the penultimate step in magnetic confinement plasma physics research with a self-sustained reaction. In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from advanced light-water reactors. In addition, progress in the development of advanced, low activation structural materials supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement. Finally, supporters contend that other potential replacements to the fossil fuels have environmental issues of their own. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power all have a relatively low power output per square kilometer compared to ITER's successor DEMO which, at 2,000 MW, would have an energy density that exceeds even large fission power stations.|$|E
25|$|The major {{advantage}} of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is {{their ability to}} store water at low cost for dispatch later as high value clean electricity.
