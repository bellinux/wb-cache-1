For 852 offences, ‘wheel’ distances are calculated for triangles formed by offenders’ home location, theft location, and vehicle disposal location. The study demonstrates typical isosceles mobility triangles; distances travelled to and from home locations are roughly equal, whereas distances between theft and disposal points were shorter. Distances travelled by offenders under 17 years old and offences involving drug and drink were shown to be shorter than comparison groups. Prolifi c offenders tend to travel further, although there is signifi <b>cant</b> <b>variation</b> in this subgroup. Explanations and implications are discussed...|$|E

Depending on the product range being processed, a given workplace is the bottleneck only for some period of time. When the bottleneck moves to another workplace, it leads to unnecessary loss of capacity of the fl oating bottleneck. To maximize the utilization, it is necessary to protect those bottlenecks by creating special buff ers. The objective {{of this article is to}} design a methodology used for the determination and control of buff ers that are going to protect the fl oating bottlenecks from operating capacity losses caused by transfer of the constrain to another workplace.

Indicators are used to assess {{quality of life and}} to monitor progress towards sustainability over time. An emerging body of literature contends that these indicators need to be derived in close consultation with target populations in order to optimise {{the extent to which they}} capture the real determinants of quality of life in particular places. Furthermore, quality of life considerations vary signifi cantly across urban neighbourhoods and consequently the spatial scale at which such studies are conducted may have signifi cant implications for the results obtained. This study focuses on spatial variations in quality of life in Galway, a city of approximately 70, 000 people, situated on the west coast of Ireland. Galway is reported as having an exceptionally high quality of life, how-ever, signifi <b>cant</b> <b>variations</b> are found to exist across city neighbourhoods.

40|$|A simplifi ed {{approach}} is proposed {{and used to}} study the TiO 2 nanoparticle transport and diffusion in an exposure chamber. This exposure chamber is used to assess lung toxicity in rats resulting from the inhalation of airborne nanoparticles. The simplifi ed approach uses computational fl uid dynamics (CFD) commercial software. The mathematical model for airfl ow {{is based on the}} three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with turbulence modeling. The mathematical model for airborne nanoparticles transport is based on assumptions such that their motions {{are similar to those of}} a single-sized diameter distribution of a passive contaminant. This model is valid as long as the nanoparticle concentration is low and the particle diameter is small enough that settling is negligible, which is the case for the exposure chamber studied. With this model, the diffusion coeffi cient is a property that plays a signifi cant role in the transport of airborne nanoparticles. The particle diffusion coeffi cient can be expressed in terms of a friction coeffi cient, and three possible relationships to model particle diffusion are presented. Their infl uences on the friction and diffusion coeffi cients are considered for the particu-lar case of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Although all the models studied here predict a decrease in the value of the diffusion coeffi cient with increasing particle diameter, some signifi <b>cant</b> <b>variations</b> can be observe...|$|R
40|$|CeRuSn {{exhibits}} {{an extraordinary}} room temperature structure at 300 K with coexistence of {{two types of}} Ce ions, namely trivalent Ce 3 and intermediate valent Ce 4 x, in a metallic environment. The ordered arrangement of these two Ce types on speci c crystallographic sites results in a doubling of the unit cell along the c axis {{with respect to the}} basic monoclinic CeCoAl type structure. Below room temperature, structural modulation transitions with very broad hysteresis have been reported from measurements of various bulk properties. X ray di raction revealed that at low temperatures the doubling of the CeCoAl type structure is replaced by a di erent modulated ground state, approximating a near tripling of the basic CeCoAl cell. The transition is accompanied by a signi cant contraction of the c axis. We present new x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy data at the Ce L 3 absorption edge, measured on a freshly cleaved surface of a CeRuSn single crystal. In contrast to a previous report, the new data exhibit small but signi <b>cant</b> <b>variations</b> as function of temperature that are consistent with a transition of a fraction of Ce 3 ions to the intermediate valence state, analogous to the alpha gamma transition in elemental cerium, when cooling through the structural transitions of CeRuSn.

40|$|The gas of {{magnetic}} monopoles in spin ice {{is governed by}} one key parameter: the monopole chemical potential.

However, all known spin ices have values of chemical potential imposed by their structure and chemistry that place them deeply within the weakly correlated regime, where none of these interesting phenomena occur. Here we use high-pressure synthesis {{to create a new}} monopole host, Dy 2 Ge 2 O 7, with a radically altered chemical potential that stabilizes a large fraction of monopole dimers.

40|$|ABSTRACT – (Modeling {{temporal}} {{variations of}} Gracilaria Greville and Hypnea J. V. Lamouroux (Rhodophyta) assemblages on a midlittoral reef platform at Piedade Beach, Pernambuco State, Brazil). The diversity of algal banks composed of species out the genera Gracilaria Greville and Hypnea J. V. Lamouroux have been impacted by commercial exploitation and coastal eutrophication. The present {{study sought to}} construct dynamic models based on algal physiology to simulate seasonal variations in the biomasses of Gracilaria and Hypnea an intertidal reef at Piedade Beach in Jaboatão dos Guararapes, Pernambuco State, Brazil. Five 20 × 20 cm plots in a reef pool on a midlittoral reef platform were randomly sampled during April, June, August, October, and December/ 2009 and in January and March/ 2010. Water temperature, pH, irradiance, oxygen and salinity levels {{as well as the}} concentrations of ammonia, nitrate and phosphate were measured at the sampling site. Forcing functions were employed in the model to represent abiotic factors, and algal decay was simulated with a dispersal function. Algal growth was modeled using a logistic function and was found to be sensitive to temperature and salinity. Maximum absorption rates of ammonia and phosphate were higher in Hypnea than in Gracilaria, indicating that the former takes up nutrients more effi ciently at higher concentrations. Gracilaria biomass peaked at approximately 120 g (dry weight m- 2) in March/ 2010 and was signifi cantly lower in August/ 2009; Hypnea biomasses, on the other hand, did not show any signifi <b>cant</b> <b>variations</b> among the different months, indicating that resource competition may infl uence the productivity of these algae...|$|R

Th e infl ammatory response involves a complex pattern of humoral and cellular responses and the expression of related factors {{is thought to be}} governed by genetic variations. Th is aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the infl uence of interleukin (IL) single nucleotide poly-morphism (SNP) -C/G and-G/A on the treatment outcome in severely injured patients. Forty-seven severely injured patients were included in this study. Patients were assigned an Injury Severity Score. Blood samples were drawn within h after admission (designated day) and on subsequent days (,, hours and days) of hospitalization. Th e IL- levels were determined through ELISA technique. Polymor-phisms were analyzed by a method of Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR). Among subjects with diff erent outcomes, no statistically relevant diff erence was found with regards to the gene IL- SNP-G/C polymorphism. More than a half of subjects who died had the SNP-G/C polymorphism, while this polymorphism was represented in a slightly lower number in survivors. Th e incidence of subjects without polymorphism and those with heterozygous and homozygous gene IL- SNP-G/A polymorphism did not present statistically signifi <b>cant</b> <b>variations</b> between survivors and those who died.

40|$|Abstract: This project {{investigated}} uncertainties in the gauging {{process to}} permit the devel-opment of improved methods. Preliminary studies investigated the potential sources of error {{in the areas of}} measurement, track and structure position, and vehicle position (including the effects of wind). A Monte-Carlo and an approximate analytic, method quantified individual and total propagated biases and uncertainties in the clearance. The dominant sources of bias were found to be the track tolerances, measurement error allowances, steering allowances, and con-servatism in the swept envelope. The dominant sources of uncertainty were found to be specific measurement uncertainties, surface position variations for irregular or poorly aligned structures, approximations in the swept envelope calculation, and the effects of <b>cant</b> <b>variation</b> or wind on the swept envelope. The present method of applying tolerances (by linear superposition) can be challenged as individual tolerances do not bear a consistent relationship with the potential errors and variations they represent and because the superposition results in a level of safety that will vary according to the relative importance of factors at different locations. An improved method for determining and applying tolerances is recommended. This is based on the probabilistic approach used for the uncertainty analysis...|$|E

Hard X-ray emission up to 50 keV was detected in the PDS instrument during the rise and {{at the peak of}} the are. Time-resolved spectroscopy of the are with the LECS and MECS detectors shows that temperatures as high as 100 MK were reached at the are peak; such high temperatures are responsible for the high-energy tail seen in the PDS.

It encompasses the structural and mechanical properties of a food and its sensory perception in the hand and in the mouth. This study was designed to evaluate the textural properties of the most cultivated and consumed yam Dioscorea varieties in Ghana in order to assess their potential alternative food and industrial processing applications. Matured yam varieties were obtained from the Roots and Tuber Conservatory Division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Plant Genetic Resources Research Institute Bunso Ghana. Textural profile of the cooked yam cultivars was established using texture analyser TA-XT 2 i Stable Microsystem Godalming England with built-in Texture Expert Exceed software. Cluster observation and principal component analyses were used to characterize the varieties based on similarities and differences in properties. The study showed that signiamp 64257 <b>cant</b> <b>variations</b> existed p 0. 05 in the textural properties of different yam varieties.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} design optimization methodology {{was developed for}} a medium range box wing aircraft. A baseline conventional cantilever wing aircraft designed for the same mis- sion and payload was also optimized alongside a baseline box wing aircraft. An empirical formula for the mass estimation of the fore and aft wings of the box wing aircraft was derived by relating conventional cantilever wings to box wing aircraft wings. The {{results indicate that the}} fore and aft wings would use the same correction coe cient and that the aft wing would be lighter than the fore wing on the medium range box wing aircraft because of reduced sweep. As part of the methodology, a computational study was performed to analyze di erent wing/tip n xities using a statically loaded idealized box wing con guration. The analy- ses determined the best joint xity by comparing the stress distributions in nite element torsion box models in addition to aerodynamic requirements. The analyses indicates that the rigid joint is the most suitable. Studies were also performed to investigate the structural implications of changing only the tip n inclinations on the box wing aircraft. Tip n inclination refers to the angle the tip n makes to the vertical body axis of the aircraft. No signi <b>cant</b> <b>variations</b> in wing structural design drivers as a function of tip n inclination were observed. Stochastic and deterministic optimization routines were performed on the baseline box wing aircraft using the methodology developed where the variables were wing area, av- erage thickness to chord ratio and sweep angle. The conventional aircraft design showed similar performance and characteristics to the equivalent in-service aircraft thereby pro- viding some validation to the methodology and the results for the box wing aircraft. Longitudinal stability investigations showed that the extra fuel capacity of the box wing in the ns could be used to reduce trim drag. The short period oscillation of the conventional cantilever wing aircraft was found to be satisfactory but the box wing aircraft was found to be unacceptable hence requiring stability augmentation systems. The eld and ight performance of the box wing showed to be better than the conventional cantilever wing aircraft. Overall, the economic advantages of the box wing aircraft over the conventional cantilever wing aircraft improve with increase in fuel price making the box wing a worthy replacement for the conventional cantilever wing aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Overgrazing along stream {{channels}} in Mongolia may impact streams by increasing stream channel erosion and in-stream sediments, water temperature, pH, and conductivity. Grazing and erosion impacts may impair stream insects. The Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey sampled 250 streams during summer seasons in 2003 - 2006 and 2008. On-site identifi cations of aquatic insect families mostly based on collections of adults were recorded for each site, leading {{us to ask}} whether the family-level data were useful in biological assessment related to impacts and impairment from grazing and erosion. A double dendrogram based on hierarchical cluster {{analysis was used to}} fi nd patterns in sites and aquatic insect communities. Sites did not group by sampling period, but some sites did group by stream size and elevation. However, elevation was not a signifi <b>cant</b> predictor of <b>variation</b> in aquatic insect metrics. Analysis of variance was used to determine whether insect metrics and water quality variables varied signifi cantly between categories of erosion in the stream channel. Plecoptera and Diptera richness decreased with increased erosion and Percent Diptera Richness was the only aquatic insect metric to vary signifi cantly between categories of erosion along the stream channel. Water temperature, conductivity, and pH also signifi cantly increased with increased erosion. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine whether aquatic insect metrics could be predicted by variation in landscape, water quality and stream reach variables. Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Coleoptera richness increased with increased erosion, conductivity, and pH, but not signifi cantly. Percent Diptera Richness formed the only signifi cant model in the multiple regression analysis, with conductivity the only signifi <b>cant</b> predictor of <b>variation</b> in Percent Diptera Richness. Family-level data generated in the fi eld indicated that sampling for Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera diversity would be maximized by sampling streams undergoing intermediate levels of disturbance from grazing and erosion, that sampling for the Diptera and Plecoptera diversity would be maximized by sampling streams with less erosion and grazing, and that Diptera richness was impaired by erosion related to grazing in Mongolian streams...|$|R

However, the majority of imaging studies are cross-sectional, despite the obvious superiority of longitudinal study designs in characterising disease trajectories, response to therapy, progression rates and evaluating the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative conditions. Objectives The aim of this work is to perform a systematic review of longitudinal imaging initiatives in neurodegeneration focusing on methodology, optimal statistical models, follow-up intervals, attrition rates, primary study outcomes and presymptomatic studies. Methods Longitudinal imaging studies were identi fi ed from ? PubMed ? and reviewed from 1990 to 2014. The search terms ? longitudinal ?, ? MRI ?, ? presymptomatic ? and ? imaging ? were utilised in combination with one of the following degenerative conditions; Alzheimer ? s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington ? s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson ? s disease, ataxia, HIV, alcohol abuse/ dependence. Results A total of 423 longitudinal imaging papers and 103 genotype-based presymptomatic studies were identi fi ed and systematically reviewed.

Microscopic images are {{an essential part}} of cancer diagnosis process in modern medicine. However, diagnosing tissues under microscope is a time-consuming task for pathologists. There is also a signi <b>cant</b> <b>variation</b> in pathologists' decisions on tissue labeling. In this study, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that classi es and grades H&E stained liver tissue images for pathologists in order to speed up the cancer diagnosis process. This system is designed for H&E stained tissues, because it is cheaper than the conventional CD 13 stain. The rst step is labeling the tissue images for classi cation purposes. CD 13 stained tissue images are used to construct ground truth labels, because in H&E stained tissues cancer stem cells (CSC) cannot be observed by naked eye. Feature extraction is the next step. Since CSCs cannot be observed by naked eye in H&E stained tissues, we need to extract distinguishing texture features. For this purpose, 20 features are chosen from nine di erent color spaces. These features are fed into a modi ed version of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, which is proposed in this thesis. This algorithm takes covariance matrices of feature matrices of images instead of pixel values of images as input. Images are compared in the eigenspace and classi es them according to the angle between them. It is experimentally shown that this algorithm can achieve 76. 0...|$|E

C. lusitanica of uncertain status, from Guatemala; and 4. two seedlots of doubtful status, believed to be C. arizonica from Durango, Mexico. Statistical analysis suggests that Number of Cotyledons, from 2 to 6 per seedling, varied signifi cantly (p < 0. 05) from one seedlot to another and possibly varied on a regional basis in the wild.

Several glaciers could be mapped back to 1973 based on a KH- 9 Hexagon reconnaissance image. Measured glacier extents of 550 ± 10 km² in 1973, 540 ± 9 km² in 2000, and 521 ± 9 km² in 2011 indicate accelerated shrinkage {{for the last decade}} in the Trans Alai. Glaciers retreated on average by − 4. 3 ± 0. 5 m a⁻¹ before 2000 and subsequently advanced by + 6. 1 ± 1. 0 m a⁻¹ until 2011. Geodetic mass balances of four selected glaciers were determined from a Digital Elevation Model extracted from a 2010 ALOS-PRISM tri-stereo image and the February 2000 SRTM- 3 elevation dataset (1999). Its difference image reveals highly variable glacier elevation changes. While three glaciers showed probably a minor loss (− 0. 16 ± 0. 68 m w. e. a⁻¹ to − 0. 06 ± 0. 68 m w. e. a⁻¹), a more pronounced mass loss was observed for Ujsuu Glacier (− 0. 50 ± 0. 68 m w. e. a⁻¹). This study reveals signifi <b>cant</b> glacier <b>variations</b> and numerous indications of surges in the Trans Alai, a well-known phenomenon in the Pam...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY : Detailed {{knowledge}} of the different components {{of the immune system}} is required for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies. CD 4 T lymphocytes represent a highly heterogeneous group of cells characterized by various profiles of cytokine production and effector vs. regulatory functions. They are central players in orchestrating adaptive immune responses: unbalances between the different subtypes can lead either to aggressive autoimmune disorders or can favour the uncontrolled growth of malignancies. In this study we focused on the characterization of human CD 4 T cells in advanced stage melanoma patients as well as in patients affected by various forms of autoimmune inflammatory spondyloarthropathies. In melanoma patients we report that a population of FOXP 3 CD 4 T cells, known as regulatory T cells, is overrepresented in peripheral blood, and even more in tumor-infitrated lymph nodes as well as at tumor sites, as compared to healthy donors. In tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes, but not in normal lymph nodes or in peripheral blood, FOXP 3 CD 4 T cells feature a highly differentiated phenotype (CD 45 RA-CCR 7 +/-), which suggests for a recent encounter with their cognate antigen. FOXP 3 CD 4 T cells have been described to be {{an important component of the}} several known immune escape mechanisms. We demonstrated that FOXP 3 CD 4 T cells isolated from melanoma patients exert an in vitro suppressive action on autologous CD 4 T cells, thus possibly inhibiting an efficient anti-tumor response. Next, we aimed to analyse CD 4 T cells at antigen-specific level. In advanced stage melanoma patients, we identified for the first time, using pMHCII multimers, circulating CD 4 T cells specific for the melanoma antigen Melan-A, presented by HLA-DQB 1 * 0602. Interestingly, in a cohort of melanoma patients enrolled in an immunotherapy trails consisting of injection of a Melan-A derived peptide, we did not observe signif <b>cant</b> <b>variations</b> in the ex vivo frequencies of Melan-A specific CD 4 T cells, but important differences in the quality of the specific CD 4 T cells. In fact, up to 50 % of the ex vivo Melan-A/DQ 6 specific CD 4 T cells displayed a regulatory phenotype and were hypoproliferative before vaccination, while more effector, cytokine-secreting Melan-A/DQ 6 specific CD 4 T cells were observed after immunization. These observations suggest that peptide vaccination may favourably modify the balance between regulatory and effector tumor-specific CD 4 T cells. Finally, we identified another subset of CD 4 T cells as possible mediator of pathology in a group of human autoimmune spondyloarthropathies, namely Th 17 cells. These cells were recently described to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of some marine models of autommunity. We document an elevated presence of circulating Th 17 cells in two members of seronegative spondyloarthropathies, e. g. psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, while we do not observe increased frequencies of Th 17 cells in peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritic patients. In addition, Th 17 cells with a more advanced differentiation state (CD 45 RA-CCR 7 -CD 27 -) and polyfunctionality (concomitant secretion of IL- 17, IL- 2 and TNFα) were observed exclusively in patients with seronegative spondylarthropathies. Together, our observations emphasize the importance of CD 4 T cells in various diseases and suggest that immunotherapeutic approaches considering CD 4 T cells as targets should be evaluated in the future...|$|R
40|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of a CO 2 storage site and {{containment}} of CO 2 in the subsurface, the integrity of wellbore materials must be maintained. Field and laboratory studies have shown CO 2 -induced reactivity of wellbore cement, but these results have to be extrapolated to the extended time span of CO 2 storage. Geochemical modeling provides a tool for the prediction of cement alteration; however, large uncertainties in input parameters exist and signifi <b>cant</b> <b>variation</b> in subsurface conditionsis expected. This asks for a systematic investigation of the sensitivity of modeled cement alteration towards these factors. In this paper we report PHREEQC simulations of CO 2 diffusion into cement and subsequent chemical reactions. The sensitivity of cement alteration toward reaction rates, initial porosity, temperature/mineralogy and fl ow/no fl ow conditions were investigated. The base case model indicated that intact cement and tight interfaces between the reservoir and the cement would yield less than 1 % porosity change after 300 days of diffusion. For porosity increase or degradation to occur at the cement interface, leaching/fl ow along the wellbore was required. The sensitivity scenarios yield CO 2 penetration depths between 0. 3 cm and 1. 4 cm after 300 days of diffusion. The maximum was reached for the high porosity (fast diffusion) scenario that facilitates CO 2 transport through the cement matrix. The minimum CO 2 penetration was for enhanced calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) decalcifi cation, which increases calcite precipitation, CO 2 consumption, and hence decelerates CO 2 penetration. This is related to high temperatures (and more crystalline C-S-H) or to higher kinetic rate constants used...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We have {{conducted}} the rst thorough {{analysis of the}} market for privacy practices and policies in online social networks. From an evaluation of 45 social networking sites using 260 criteria we nd that many popular assumptions regarding privacy and social networking need to be revisited when considering the entire ecosystem instead {{of only a handful of}} well-known sites. Contrary to the common perception of an oligopolistic market, we nd evidence of vigorous competition for new users. Despite observing many poor security practices, there is evidence that social network providers are making e orts to implement privacy enhancing technologies with substantial diversity in the amount of privacy control o ered. However, privacy is rarely used as a selling point, even then only as auxiliary, non-decisive feature. Sites also failed to promote their existing privacy controls within the site. We similarly found great diversity in the length and content of formal privacy policies, but found an opposite promotional trend: though almost all policies are not accessible to ordinary users due to obfuscating legal jargon, they conspicuously vaunt the sites ' privacy practices. We conclude that the market for privacy in social networks is dysfunctional in that there is signi <b>cant</b> <b>variation</b> in sites ' privacy controls, data collection requirements, and legal privacy policies, but this is not e ectively conveyed to users. Our empirical ndings motivate us to introduce the novel model of a privacy communication game, where the economically rational choice for a site operator is to make privacy control available to evade criticism from privacy fundamentalists, while hiding the privacy control interface and privacy policy to maximise sign-up numbers and encourage data sharing from the pragmatic majority of users. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{hydrothermal}} synthesis in the system Na 2 O-MgO-FeO-Fe 2 O 3 -SiO 2 - H 2 O. Four samples of stoichiometric magnesioriebeckite composition, ideally ■Na 2 Mg 3 Fe 2 3 +Si 8 O 22 (OH) 2, were run at 700  800 °C, 0. 4 GPa, and redox conditions varying from NNO (NickelNickel Oxide) to NNO + 2. 3 log fO 2. Powder XRD and SEM-EDX show a high (> 85 %) amphibole yield for all samples; however, in no case was the end-member composition attained. EMP analyses show that the amphiboles obtained deviate strongly from nominal stoichiometry toward magnesio-arfvedsonite [NaNa 2 Mg 4 Fe 3 +Si 8 O 22 (OH) 2]. Powder XRD patterns were indexed in the space group C 2 /m; reÞ ned cell-parameters reß ect variations in the amphibole composition, and the cell volume is correlated linearly with the A-site occupancy. Mössbauer spectra show that in all samples, Fe 3 + is completely ordered at M 2, whereas Fe 2 + occurs at the M 1, M 3, and M 4 sites. The Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + ratio {{is a function of}} fO 2 : for increasing oxidation conditions, there is signiÞ cant increase in M 2 Fe 3 + and decrease in Fe 2 +, notably in M 4 Fe 2 +. Mössbauer spectra also show signiÞ <b>cant</b> <b>variation</b> in M 1 Fe 2 + and M 3 Fe 2 + quadrupole splitting {{as a function of the}} Fe 3 + content in the amphibole. IR spectra in the OH-stretching region show a well-resolved quadruplet at frequencies < 3680 cm 1, assigned to octahedral M 1, 3 (Mg, Fe 2 +) -OH-A■ conÞ gurations, and a broad band consisting of four overlapping components related to M 1, 3 (Mg, Fe 2 +) conÞ gurations associated with occupied A-sites. Quantitative evaluation of the relative band intensities suggests a linear increase of A-site occupancy with decreasing fO 2 of synthesis. The composition of the amphiboles synthesized, can be best described by a combination of the C(Mg,Fe 2 +) 1 B(Mg,Fe 2 +) 1 CFe 3 +  1 BNa- 1 and the ANa 1 C(Mg,Fe 2 +) 1 A■- 1 CFe 3 +  1 exchange vectors. The experimental trend is in accord with the trend documented for natural amphiboles, and suggests that the amphibole composition can in fact be used to monitor changes in fO 2 during crystallization...|$|E
40|$|Plasminogen {{activator}} inhibitor (PAI- 1) is induced in the vasculature and secreted {{into the}} vascular lumen {{in response to}} inflammation and oxidative stress. We have previously reported a fivefold increase in plasma PAI- 1 from rats exposed to 708 kPa hyperbaric air. In the current study we assess the potential of human serum total PAI- 1 as a biomarker for stress in compressed air diving. Eleven recreational divers, nine males and two females, completed four 2 h hyperbaric air exposures to 280 kPa in a pressure chamber {{over a period of}} 2 weeks. The air pressure corresponds to a diving depth of 18 m in water. Serum was collected before the study and again 3 h 30 min after com- pletion of each hyperbaric exposure. All samples were taken in the afternoon to minimize the contribution of circadian variation. The analysis revealed no change in serum total PAI- 1 after hyperbaric exposures within the group of divers (P = 0. 064), but significant interindividual differences persisted throughout the study (P < 0. 0005). A case of decompression sickness after the third round of hyperbaric exposure did not affect PAI- 1. In conclusion, com- pressed air exposure to 280 kPa does not affect serum total PAI- 1, and signifi- <b>cant</b> interindividual <b>variation</b> in PAI- 1 levels may limit its usefulness as a biomarker. This does, however, not give a complete answer regarding PAI- 1 in physiologically stressful dives. Further studies with different exposures and timing are needed for that. (c) 2013 The Authors.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the static and dynamical response of magnetic clusters in Co 0. 2 Zn 0. 8 Fe 1. 6 Ti 0. 4 O 4 spinel oxide, where a sequence of magnetic phase transitions, i. e, paramagnetic(PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) state at TC ≤ 270 K and ferromagnetic to canted spin glass (CSG) state at Tf ≤ 125 K is observed. The time dependence of remanent magnetization shows a non-equilibrium spin dynamics in the CSG state and above 130 K an weak time dependent relaxation characterizes a canted ferromagnetic state which is followed up by no relaxation effect in the paramagnetic state. The field dependence of the magnetization confirms the absence of long range ferromagnetic order in the system. This brings the idea that all the spins are not necessarily be infinite ordered inside the clusters due to spin <b>canting</b> effects. The <b>variation</b> of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic components and magnetic disorder inside the clusters shows some interesting magnetic and electrical properties in the system, viz, field induced transition in M vs H data, re-entrant magnetic transition in ac susceptiblity vs T data and re-entrant semi-conducting behaviour in resistivity vs T data...|$|R
40|$|A. —A monogamous {{mating system}} that {{includes}} extrapair fertilization can po-tentially generate higher variability in male reproductive success than monogamy without extrapair fertilization. That increased variability {{could provide a}} correspondingly higher op-portunity for sexual selection and, thus, for the origin and persistence of sexual dimorphism in monogamous species. To determine whether extrapair fertilization enhanced the opportunity for sexual selection in a sexually dimorphic, monogamous bird species, we used microsatel-lite DNA typing to assess the prevalence of extrapair fertilization and its eff ect on variation in male reproductive success in a population of Chestnut-sided Warblers (Dendroica pensylvanica). We found {{that the level of}} extrapair fertilization in our study population was at {{the upper end of the}} range reported for bird populations (47 % of nestlings had extrapair fathers; 61 % of broods contained extrapair off spring). We also discovered that almost all extrapair off spring were sired by paired males resident on nearby territories. In addition, we found that variation in male reproductive success was substantially higher than variation in female reproductive success, and that extrapair fertilizations made a signifi <b>cant</b> contribution to <b>variation</b> in male reproductive success. Together, those fi ndings suggest that extrapair fertilization creates an opportunity for sexual selection on male traits in this population. Received 24 May 2003, accepte...|$|R
