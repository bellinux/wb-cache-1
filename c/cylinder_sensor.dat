40|$|Chemical {{modification}} is {{an important}} way to improve the properties of existing polymers, {{and one of the}} important examples is the hydrogenation of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) in organic solvent by homogeneous catalysis in order to extend its application. This process has been industrialized for many years to provide high performance elastomers (HNBR) for the automotive industry, especially those used to produce components in engine compartments. 	In the current commercial process, a batch reactor is employed for the hydrogenation step, which is labor intensive and not suitable for large volume of production. Thus, novel hydrogenation devices such as a continuous process are being developed in our research group to overcome these drawbacks. In order to make the process more practical for industrial application, high concentration polymer solutions should be targeted for the continuous hydrogenation. However, many problems are encountered due to the viscosity of the high concentration polymer solution, which increases tremendously as the reaction goes on, resulting in severe mass transfer and heat transfer problems. So, hydrogenation kinetics in high concentration NBR solution, as well as the rheological properties of this viscous solution are very essential and fundamental for the design of novel hydrogenation processes and reactor scale up. 	In the present work, hydrogenation of NBR in high concentration solution was carried out in a batch reactor. A commercial rhodium catalyst, Wilkinson’s catalyst, was used with triphenylphosphine as the co-catalyst and chlorobenzene as the solvent. The reactor was modified and a PID controller was tuned to fit this strong exothermic reaction. It was observed that when NBR solution is in a high concentration the kinetic behavior was greatly affected by mass transfer processes, especially the gas-liquid mass transfer. Reactor internals were designed and various agitators were investigated to improve the mechanical mixing. Experimental results show that the turbine-anchor combined agitator could provide superior mixing for this viscous reaction system. 	The kinetic behavior of NBR hydrogenation under low catalyst concentration was also studied. It was observed that the hydrogenation degree of the polymer could not reach 95 % if less than 0. 1 %wt catalyst (based on polymer mass) was used, deviating from the behavior under a normal catalyst concentration. 	The viscosity of the NBR-MCB solutions was measured in a rotational rheometer that has a <b>cylinder</b> <b>sensor</b> under both room conditions and reaction conditions. Parameters that might affect the viscosity of the solutions were studied, especially the hydrogenation degree of polymer. Rheological properties of NBR-MEK solutions, as well as NBR melts were also studied for relevant information. 	It is concluded that the hydrogenation kinetics deviates from that reported by Parent et al. [6] when polymer is in high concentration and/or catalyst is in low concentration; and that the reaction solution (HNBR/NBR-MCB solution) deviates from Newtonian behavior when polymer concentration and hydrogenation degree are high...|$|E

The system employs thermally excited resonant silicon micro structural pressure sensor for the pressure measurement.

The volume and weight of this system is only one-twelfth of the original. In addition, it has the characteristics of high accuracy, high resolution, high stability and repeatability. I．Instruction In the modern aircraft, {{air data system}} is used to measure flight parameters such as flight altitude, airspeed and M number. At present, air data computer often adopts vibrating <b>cylinder</b> pressure <b>sensor</b> to measure pressure. Due to measure two atmospheric parameters: total pressure and static pressure, internal configuration of air data computer is two vibrating <b>cylinder</b> pressure <b>sensors.</b> Therefore, volume and weight of air data computer depends on two vibrating <b>cylinder</b> pressure <b>sensors.</b> Bigger the volume is, greater the weight is.

40|$|The various {{multi-sensor}} signal features from {{a diesel}} engine constitute a complex high-dimensional dataset. The non-linear dimensionality reduction method, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), provides {{an effective way}} to implement data visualization for complex high-dimensional data.

In this method, the optimal feature subset is constructed by a feature subset score criterion. Then the high-dimensional data are visualized in 2 -dimension space.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the air mass in the cylinder of a spark ignition (SI) engine is crucial in order to regulate the exact air fuel (A/F) ratio for the catalyst and thus minimize the emissions. Conventional algorithms for estimating the air mass are based on sensor information measured {{in front of the}} throttle or in the manifold. Thus, the determination of cylinder individual sizes, particularly the air mass, is impossible. In this work, new <b>sensors,</b> which provide <b>cylinder</b> individual information are investigated and the air mass in each individual cylinder is calculated with adaptive, model based algorithms. Sensors within the combustion chamber of an SI engine enable a cylinder specific evaluation of the thermodynamic work process. In particular, the combustion pressure sensor or ionisation current sensing are two independent methods of measuring direct combustion information. In a few cases such sensors are used in mass production cars. The combustion pressure sensor exhibits two significant advantages when compared to ionisation current. First, it provides information of the pressure in the cylinder during the complete working cycle of the engine and this pressure information {{is a measure of the}} entire combustion chamber. In contrast, the ionisation sensing represents a local measurement during the combustion and part of the expansion phase and this measurement can only be seen as a part of the information contained in the combustion pressure sensor signal. Second, the determination of the air mass in the cylinder, the most significant process information, can only be determined by cylinder pressure measurements and not by ionisation current. Reducing costs by eliminating the mass air flow meter is a requirement for the implementation of combustion pressure sensors in a mass production throttled SI engine. Thus, the <b>cylinder</b> pressure <b>sensor</b> must be able to determine the air mass in the cylinder. However, the <b>cylinder</b> pressure <b>sensors</b> will not be implemented in a mass production application based only on replacing the mass air flow meter, but must in addition provide much more cylinder specific information.

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{key issues}} {{in the design of}} fault {{detection}} and diagnosis (FDD) schemes for hydraulic systems is the effect of model uncertainties such as severe parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics on their performance. This paper presents the application of a nonlinear model based adaptive robust observer (ARO) to the fault detection and diagnosis of some common faults that occur in hydraulic systems. The ARO presented in this paper is designed by explicitly taking into account the nonlinear system dynamics. Some robust filter structures are designed to attenuate the effect of model uncertainties and controlled on-line parameter adaptation helps in reducing the extent of model uncertainty and in increasing the sensitivity of the fault detection scheme to help in the detection of incipient failure. The state and parameter estimates are continuously monitored to detect any off-nominal system behavior even in the presence of model uncertainty.

The first of the proposed methods estimates entire burned mass fraction traces from corresponding combustion net torque traces.

The other proposed estimation method estimates the well established combustion phasing measure referred to as 50 % burned mass fraction directly from combustion net torque using a nonlinear black-box mapping.
