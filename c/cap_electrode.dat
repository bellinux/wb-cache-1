40|$|AbstractPerforming {{wideband}} ion {{image current}} detection mass spectrometry experiments {{with an electric}} ion trap—e. g., the Paul trap—is a difficult task, {{as there is a}} strong crosstalk current induced by the high voltages of the radio frequency (rf) storage field. In a classic Paul trap the metallic hyperbolic electrodes (a ring electrode and two end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes)</b> are shaped following the isopotential lines of the quadrupole potential distribution. In our new design the ring electrode is replaced by a cylindrical series of ring electrodes with a parabolic potential distribution, whereas the end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes</b> are used without modification. Thus the quadrupole field within the trap remains unchanged but the capacitances between the electrodes and therefore the crosstalk currents are significantly reduced. The remaining crosstalk is balanced out by an electronic compensation technique. As a consequence the weak signals of the ion-induced charge can be detected with a wideband low-noise amplifier to perform Fourier transform mass spectrometry experiments with improved signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R

40|$|An {{ion trap}} source has been {{designed}} for use with time-of-flight (TOF) mass analysis. Two thin diaphragms make up a segmented ring electrode; the end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes</b> are planar wire mesh. The potential field produced by the rf voltage applied between the ring and end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes</b> resembles that of the cylindrical ion trap. The trapped ion population for ions created by electron impact exhibits linear growth against a first-order loss that has a time constant of about 50 μs; no ion loss occurs when the electron beam is off. The observed value of qz. gif"> at low-mass cutoff for rf ion storage is − 0. 84. Pulsed extraction of all ions is accomplished by switching the trap electrodes from rf to voltages required to provide a linear dc extraction field.

Preliminary results on the 0, 0 vibrational band of the A-X electronic transition are presented. Our approach involves confining Ions to a small (1 - 2 cc) region of space within a cylindrical R. F.

A voltage of fixed frequency and variable amplitude is applied to the center electrode which is maintained at some variable bias voltage with respect to the end caps.

50|$|A Kingdon trap {{consists}} of a thin central wire, an outer cylindrical electrode and isolated end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes</b> at both ends. A static applied voltage results in a radial logarithmic potential between the electrodes. In a Kingdon trap there is no potential minimum to store the ions; however, they are stored with a finite angular momentum about the central wire and the applied electric field in the device allows for {{the stability of the}} ion trajectories. In 1981, Knight introduced a modified outer electrode that included an axial quadrupole term that confines the ions on the trap axis. The dynamic Kingdon trap has an additional AC voltage that uses strong defocusing to permanently store charged particles. The dynamic Kingdon trap does not require the trapped ions to have angular momentum with respect to the filament. An Orbitrap is a modified Kingdon trap that is used for mass spectrometry. Though the idea has been suggested and computer simulations performed neither the Kingdon nor the Knight configurations were reported to produce mass spectra, as the simulations indicated mass resolving power would be problematic.|$|R
50|$|The 3D trap itself {{generally}} {{consists of}} two hyperbolic metal electrodes with their foci facing each other and a hyperbolic ring electrode halfway between the other two electrodes.

The AC radio frequency voltage oscillates between the two hyperbolic metal end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes</b> if ion excitation is desired; the driving AC voltage is applied to the ring electrode. The ions are first pulled up and down axially while being pushed in radially. The ions are then pulled out radially and pushed in axially (from the top and bottom). In this way the ions move in a complex motion that generally involves the cloud of ions being long and narrow and then short and wide, back and forth, oscillating between the two states. Since the mid-1980s most 3D traps (Paul traps) have used ~1 mtorr of helium. The use of damping gas and the mass-selective instability mode developed by Stafford et al. led to the first commercial 3D ion traps.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of EEG source reconstruction {{has benefited from}} {{the increasing use of}} advanced head modeling techniques that take advantage of MRI together with the precise positions of the recording electrodes. The prevailing technique for registering EEG electrode coordinates involves electromagnetic digitization. However, the procedure adds several minutes to experiment preparation and typical digitizers may not be accurate enough for optimal source reconstruction performance (Dalal et al., 2014). Here, we present a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective alternative method to register EEG electrode positions, using a single digital SLR camera, photogrammetry software, and computer vision techniques implemented in our open-source toolbox, janus 3 D.

This method yields a final electrode coregistration error of 0. 8 mm, while a standard technique using an electromagnetic digitizer yielded an error of 6. 1 mm. The technique furthermore reduces preparation time, and could be extended to a multi-camera array, which would make the procedure virtually instantaneous. In addition to EEG, the technique could likewise capture the position of the fiducial markers used in magnetoencephalography systems to register head position...|$|R
30|$|The EEG signals {{represent}} the electrical activity {{of one or}} several assemblies of neurons [22]. The area of a neuron assembly is small compared to {{the distance to the}} observation point (the EEG sensors). Therefore, the electromagnetic fields produced by an active neuron assembly at the sensor level are very similar to the field produced by a current dipole [23]. This simplified model is known as the equivalent current dipole (ECD). These ECDs are also known by other names such as BES and current sources. Due to the uniform spatial organization of their dendrites (perpendicular to the brain cortex), the pyramidal neurons are the only neurons that can generate a net current dipole over a piece of cortical surface, whose field is detectable on the scalp [3]. According to [24], it is necessary to add the field of ∼ 104 pyramidal neurons in order to produce a voltage that is detectable on the scalp. These voltages can be recorded by using different types of electrodes [22], such as disposable (gel-less, and pre-gelled types), reusable disc electrodes (gold, silver, stainless steel, or tin), headbands and <b>electrode</b> <b>caps,</b> saline-based <b>electrodes,</b> and needle electrodes.|$|R

40|$|A Paul trap mass {{spectrometer}} has a three-electrode geometry mass analyzer {{consisting of two}} identical end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes</b> and a ring electrode. Traditionally, the two end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes</b> are electrically grounded and an RF potential {{is applied to the}} central ring electrode to generate the "trapping field". Ions of the analyte sample are formed in situ by electron bombardment and mass analysis of the fragment ions is performed by mass selectively destabilizing the ions from the trap. The inhornogeneities present in the trapping field (introduced either by misalignment of the trap geometry or by applying a dipolar auxiliary excitation across the end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes)</b> give rise to various interesting phenomena including, resonance ejection of the trapped ions This thesis is concerned with taking a look into the experimental aspects associated with resonance ejection of ions caused by the dipolar excitation Additionally, u also reports the work undertaken to develop necessary instrumentation for resonant excitation experiments and my contribution to operational>zc the Paul trap {{mass spectrometer}} fabricated in the laboratory. The thesis is divided into 5 chapters. Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter. After discussing the conditions for stability of the trapped ions, it goes on to present a brief survey of a variety of applications in literature, which have used resonant excitation. Towards the end, the motivation of the present effort and the scope of work in the thesis have been spelt out. This includes (a) redesign of the ion detector electronics, (b) design of an auxiliary excitation generator, and (c) studies on resonance ejection. Chapter 2 outlines the design considerations, circuit description and fabrication details for the ion detector electronics. The circuits presented in this chapter include (a) electrometer amplifier and (b) - 3 kV DC supply for the electron multiplier detector. The electrometer amplifier amplifies the ion current signal from the electron multiplier detector and it needs to have a high input impedance and a high slew rate. The electron multiplier detector requires - 3 kV DC power supply for operation. The - 3 kV DC power supply is required to have a regulated output voltage with low ripple in the output. Chapter 3 presents the design considerations, circuit description and fabrication details for the auxiliary excitation generator. The auxiliary excitation generator is a three channel DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) oscillator with independent control of frequency amplitude, and phase of the output signal. Chapter 3 also discusses the micro controller based control sub-system that allows the user to set above mentioned output parameters. The control sub-system provides a user-friendly keyboard interface and 2 -line alphanumeric LCD display per channel. It also provides various bus interfaces (such as I 2 C and SPI) to interface with DDS oscillator ICs, amplitude control DAC, and LCD displays. The chapter then goes on to describe the implementation details of the software written for the control sub-system. The hardware design is simplified by using a micro controller as heart of the control sub-system and employing the software to handle the complex functions. As an example, the design of the keyboard interface is simplified by directly connecting a matrix keyboard to the input/output port of the micro controller. The software is used to scan the keyboard, detect key press and find out the key pressed. Nonetheless, in order to meet specific performance required for the present work, the software needs {{to have a sense of}} time, be portable and scalable. Details of the "layered" architecture adopted by as to meet these specific requirements, the lower level "driver" functions implemented for various interfaces of the control sub-system, and the higher level or the "application" software, are described. The application software uses the driver functions to accomplish various tasks required to be executed by the control sub-system. Finally, the chapter presents the design consideration and fabrication details of the coupling transformer used to couple the output of the auxiliary excitation generator to the Paul trap Chapter 4 describes the resonant excitation experiments performed as part of the present work. First of all the chapter presents the improvement in the performance of the Paul trap mass spectrometer as a result of redesigned ion detector electronics It is seen that the resolution is improved significantly due to the improved response time of the electrometer amplifier. The chapter then describes the effect of the resonant excitation on the ions and also that the frequency of the applied auxiliary excitation should be between 500 kHz to 125 kHz. Next, a number of mass spectra for different frequencies of the applied auxiliary excitation are presented. These mass spectra indicate that the resonant ejection sets in for lower masses even at lower amplitude of the auxiliary excitation where as higher amplitude is required for the resonant ejection of the higher masses. It is seen that the resonant excitation of ions improves resolution of the mass spectrum. Moreover, the auxiliary excitation results in ejection of the ions at lower amplitude of the RF voltage and thus allows extending the mass range of the mass spectrometer. We present the mass spectrum of CCI 4 which is not possible to normally record in our instrument. We also present results intended to understand the relation between frequency and amplitude of the auxiliary excitation on the mass spectra of benzene. Finally, results of an interesting experiment are presented which indicates the presence of the non-linear resonance points in the Paul trap. Chapter 5 presents the concluding remarks.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{applicability}} of energy-filtered photoemission microscopy {{for the analysis of}} future electronic devices for the information technology is studied. The long-term perspective is the analysis of the switching-dynamics in oxide-based nonvolatile resistive memories. These are regarded as promising new components in the development of more powerful processing units or storage devices, since the improvements of the classical silicon or magnetism-based technologies are approaching their physical limits. Nevertheless, the efficiency and functionality of suitable material systems strongly depend on the quality and properties of their surfaces and interfaces. The energy-filtered photoemission microscopy provides a spatially resolved chemical study of these systems, especially in combination with high brilliance synchrotron light sources. The high photon intensities are needed, if characteristic core levels of a specimen should be analyzed with a high spatial and energy resolution. Studies of metal-insulator-metal structures based on the valence change effect in strontium titanate, which is a model system for resistive switching devices, showed that the spatial resolution needs to be in the 100 nm regime and the energy-resolution in the 100 meV regime to resolve the relevant changes in a switching cycle. Therefore, a big focus of this thesis lies on the determination of the relevant experimental parameters which are needed to fulfill these requirements. Another challenging task is to study the functional layer of such a device through a <b>capping</b> <b>electrode.</b> Hard X-ray synchrotron radiation allows the use of high kinetic energy photoelectrons with an up to ten times lager information depth.

Improvements to the to the design of the traps were defined to minimize voltage drop to the substrate, thereby increasing trapping voltage applied to the ring electrode, and to allow for electron injection into, ion ejection from, and optical access to the trapping region...|$|R
40|$|Simple {{geometries}} {{which are}} possible alternatives for the Orbitrap are studied in this paper. We {{have taken up}} for numerical investigation two segmented-electrode structures, ORB 1 and ORB 2, to mimic the electric field of the Orbitrap. In the ORB 1, the inner spindle-like electrode and the outer barrel-like electrode of the Orbitrap {{have been replaced by}} 35 rings and 35 discs of fixed radii, respectively. In this structure two segmented end <b>cap</b> <b>electrodes</b> have been added. In this geometry, different potentials are applied to the different electrodes keeping top-bottom symmetry intact. In the second geometry, ORB 2, the inner and outer electrodes of the Orbitrap were replaced by an approximate step structure which follows the profile of the Orbitrap electrodes. In the present study 45 steps have been used. In the ORB 2, like the Orbitrap, the inner electrode is held at a negative potential and the outer electrode is at ground potential. For the purpose of comparing the performance of ORB 1 and ORB 2 with that of the Orbitrap, the following studies have been undertaken: (1) variation of electric potential, (2) computation of ion trajectories, (3) simulation of image currents. These studies have been carried out using both 2 D and 3 D Boundary Element Method (BEM), the 3 D BEM was developed specifically for this study. It has been seen in these investigations that ORB 1 and ORB 2 have performance {{similar to that of the}} Orbitrap, with the performance of the ORB 1 being seen to be marginally superior to that of the ORB 2. It has been shown that with proper optimization, geometries containing far fewer electrodes can be used as mass analyzers. A novel technique of optimization of the electric field has been proposed with the objective of minimizing the dependence of axial frequency of ion motion on the initial position of an ion. The results on the optimization of 9 and 15 segmented-electrode traps having the same design as ORB 1 show that it can provide accurate mass analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|QEEG was {{measured}} using a NeuroSearch- 24 (Lexicor Medical Technology, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA). Monopolar QEEG recordings, with linked ear references, were obtained using a lycra <b>electrode</b> <b>cap</b> (Electro-Cap International, Inc., Eaton, OH, USA) containing 19 pure tin electrodes filled with EC 2 electrode gel. The electrodes were arranged according to the International 10 / 20 System. Silver–silver chloride electrodes filled with conductive paste were used for ear references and for measuring electro-oculography. A model 1089 mkII Checktrode Electrode Tester (Lexicor Medical Technology, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) was used to check the impedance levels of the electrodes.|$|R
40|$|The {{polarity}} of the resistive switching (RS) {{characteristic of}} metal-oxide-metal devices from atomic layer deposited polycrystalline ZrO 2 films was studied {{by means of}} impedance spectroscopy. Pt/ZrO 2 /Ti/Pt cells made with 10 [*]nm Ti and 30 [*]nm Pt <b>capping</b> top <b>electrodes,</b> served as unipolar switching (US) devices. Bipolar switching (BS) devices were represented by Pt/ZrO 2 / 30 [*]nm TiN cells. Temperature measurements of the ON-state resistances clearly show metallic and semiconducting behavior for the US and BS cells, respectively. The pristine and the ON and OFF states of the devices were analyzed by means of impedance spectroscopy. All ZrO 2 based RS devices exhibited similar impedance characteristics in the pristine states. In contrast, after electroforming clear differences in the Nyquist-plots of the US and BS devices were observed. The effect of the device structure on the RS polarity is discussed under consideration of the pillar-shaped grainy microstructure of the ZrO 2 thin films. An empirical model based on redox reactions between ZrO 2 and the non-noble metal electrode is proposed emphasizing defect formation prior at the ZrO 2 grain boundaries...|$|R
