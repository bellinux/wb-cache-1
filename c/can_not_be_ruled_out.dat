2500|$|Proponents of {{the view}} that PCS has a {{physiological}} basis point to findings that children demonstrate deficits on standardized tests of cognitive function following a mild TBI. A few {{studies have shown that}} people with PCS score lower than controls on neuropsychological tests that measure attention, verbal learning, reasoning, and information processing, but issues related to effort and secondary gain <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>out</b> as contributing to these differences. [...] Recovery as measured by scores on cognitive tests frequently do not correlate with resolution of symptoms; individuals diagnosed with PCS may still report subjective symptoms after their performance on tests of cognitive functioning have returned to normal. Another study found that although children with PCS had poorer scores on tests of cognitive functioning after the injury, they also had poorer behavioral adjustment before the injury than children with no persistent symptoms; these findings support the idea that PCS may result from a combination of factors such as brain dysfunction resulting from head injury and preexisting psychological or social problems. Different symptoms may be predicted by different factors; for example, one study found that cognitive and physical symptoms were not predicted by the manner in which parents and family members coped with the injury and adjusted to its effects, but psychological and behavioral symptoms were.|$|E

40|$|Here we {{test the}} idea that new {{globular}} clusters (GCs) are formed in the same gaseous ("wet") mergers or interactions {{that give rise to}} the young stellar populations seen in the central regions of many early-type galaxies. We compare mean GC colors with the age of the central galaxy starburst. The red GC subpopulation reveals remarkably constant mean colors independent of galaxy age. A scenario in which the red GC subpopulation is a combination of old and new GCs (formed in the same event as the central galaxy starburst) <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> out; although this would require an age-metallicity relation for the newly formed GCs that is steeper than the Galactic relation. However, the data are also well described by a scenario in which most red GCs are old, and few, if any, are formed in recent gaseous mergers. This is consistent with the old ages inferred from some spectroscopic studies of GCs in external systems. The event that induced the central galaxy starburst may have therefore involved insufficient gas mass for significant GC formation. We term such gas-poor events "damp" mergers.

40|$|Producción CientíficaIntroduction Bisphosphonates {{are used}} {{worldwide}} to treat osteoporosis and, thus, to prevent fractures. Though {{they have been}} proven in clinical trials to avoid some fractures, their effectiveness in reducing hip fractures is unclear. The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the relationship between bisphosphonate use and hip fracture trends in Spain. Methods For this purpose, an ecologic study spanning 2002 to 2008 was conducted in Spain. Consumption data were obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy. The number of hip fractures was obtained from hospital discharges; annual hip fracture rates were determined and standardized using the Spanish 2002 population census. A linear regression was performed between fracture rate and use of bisphosphonates; R 2 and Pearson correlation coefficient were calculated. Results From 2002 to 2008, dispensed prescriptions of bisphosphonates in Spain increased from 3. 28 to 17. 66 DDD/ 1, 000 inhabitants per day. In the same period, the crude hip fracture rate increased from 2. 85 to 3. 02 cases per 1, 000 inhabitants older than 50 years; however, when age standardized rates were estimated, the rate declined from 2. 85 to 2. 79. Analyzed by sex, the standardized rate for men slightly increased from 1. 45 to 1. 48, while for women the rate significantly dropped from 4. 00 to 3. 91. Conclusion A small effect of bisphosphonates on hip fracture rates <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>ruled</b> out; however, other factors might partially explain this decline. Assuming this medication was the only cause for hip fracture rate reduction, the elevated medication cost to avoid a single hip fracture makes it necessary to explore less expensive intervention...|$|R
