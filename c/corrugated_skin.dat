25|$|The Viastra was envisaged as a one or three-engined {{commercial}} aircraft {{capable of carrying}} ten passengers and designed {{with an eye to}} operations in countries with poor surface transport facilities. Vickers built several variants, largely similar apart from the engines: ultimately, there were Viastras with one, two and three engines. They were high-wing monoplanes, the wings having constant chord, square tips and a thick Raf 24 section. The wings, {{like the rest of the}} aircraft were covered with the <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin</b> and carried balanced ailerons and outboard slots. There was a biplane tail unit with a pair of narrow chord planes, the lower attached to the fuselage underside and the upper mounted clear above. The outboard vertical tail surfaces were again very narrow and served as the main rudders; the single-engined and tri-motor variants also had a small triangular central fin, carrying an auxiliary rudder and supporting the upper horizontal plane. With one exception, the twin-engined Viastras had the central fin and rudder replaced by tubular bracing.|$|E
25|$|Ordered as a {{follow-on}} to the NA-57 as a two-seat advanced trainer, the NA-64 P-2/NAA-64 P-2 {{represented a}} major structural improvement, with a longer all-metal fuselage replacing the fabric covered fuselage of the NA-57. As well as metal skin replacing the fabric on the fuselage, the fin was changed {{from having a}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin</b> to being a smooth stressed skin structure and was moved slightly aft, lengthening the rear fuselage while the engine was moved forward to maintain the center of gravity. The rudder was also changed from the rounded shape used previously to one with a roughly triangular shape with the broadest part being at the bottom to improve handling at high angles of attack. In one respect however, it was a step backwards from its immediate predecessor, the BT-14, with which it is often confused, in that the earlier straight wings were used {{with the result that}} in RCAF service, when compared to the later and more powerful Harvard II it was flown alongside, it had different handling characteristics and lower performance.|$|E
2500|$|And {{the first}} {{all-metal}} aircraft built by this company was the Hamilton Metalplane H-18 christened the “Maiden Milwaukee” in 1927. [...] Its design {{came from the}} chief designer of the Metalplane Company of the time – James McDonnell. [...] McDonnell had worked for Stout and Ford and incorporated similar features and new ideas into {{the construction of the}} metal Maiden. The Hamilton H-18 used a tubular frame with <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin,</b> a thick mono wing projecting out of the fuselage underneath the open cockpit, at the front was the 200 HP J-4 Wright Radial engine, and using a Hamilton propeller (metal) as a means of propulsion. [...] The “Maiden Milwaukee” was the first plane produced by the Hamilton Metalplane Company and it achieved a number of awards. [...] It first came in second during the Ford Air Tour of 1927 and it won the Spokane Air Races of the same year. It was also given the distinction of being the first US air certificate for an all-metal airplane in the United States. It was a plane designed to haul mail with the passengers as an extra revenue bonus for the airline. [...] The design reflects this for the wing root came right out of the center of the fuselage and hardly any passengers could fit.|$|E
25|$|The wings {{were covered}} with a 3 ply wood veneer only 1/20th of an inch thick. The {{internal}} bracing consisted of hundreds of spruce struts. Nine spars tested to 1 ton of load each. Like encountering a Junkers F.13, Bill Stout abandoned wood construction for metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>skinning</b> over a metal frame.|$|R

50|$|The Ba.27 was a low-wing braced {{monoplane}} with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. As originally designed, the Ba.27 had a fuselage {{of steel}} tube construction, <b>skinned</b> with light <b>corrugated</b> alloy metal, and wooden wings and tailplane. Evaluation {{of the two}} prototypes by the Regia Aeronautica in 1933 was strongly negative, resulting in an extensive redesign of the aircraft. The fuselage shape was made more rounded and the pilot's open cockpit was moved higher and forward to improve visibility. The <b>corrugated</b> <b>skinning</b> was also replaced with smooth sheet metal.|$|R
60|$|With the {{increased}} {{length of the}} beak in pigeons, not only the tongue increases in length, but likewise the orifice of the nostrils. But {{the increased}} length of the orifice of the nostrils perhaps stands in closer correlation {{with the development of}} the <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin</b> or wattle {{at the base of the}} beak, for when there is much wattle round the eyes, the eyelids are greatly increased or even doubled in length.|$|E
60|$|But {{this was}} not all. Set across the little bay of water just above the canoe that floated there was a wooden platform, eight feet or so square, {{on either side of}} which stood an {{enormous}} elephant's tusk, bigger indeed than any I have seen in all my experience, which tusks seemed to be black with age. Between the tusks, squatted upon rugs of some kind of rich fur, was what from its shape and attitude I at first took to be a huge toad. In truth, it had all the appearance of a very bloated toad. There was the rough <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin,</b> there the prominent backbone (for its back was towards us), and there were the thin, splayed-out legs.|$|E
60|$|Domestic breeds {{often have}} an {{abnormal}} or semi-monstrous character, as amongst dogs, the Italian greyhound, bulldog, Blenheim spaniel, and bloodhound,--some breeds of cattle and pigs,--several breeds of the fowl,--and the chief breeds of the pigeon. In such abnormal breeds, parts which differ but slightly {{or not at}} all in the allied natural species, have been greatly modified. This may be accounted for by man's often selecting, especially at first, conspicuous and semi-monstrous deviations of structure. We should, however, be cautious in deciding what deviations ought to be called monstrous: there can hardly be a doubt that, if the brush of horse-like hair on the breast of the turkey-cock had first appeared in the domesticated bird, it would have been considered as a monstrosity; the great plume of feathers on the head of the Polish cock has been thus designated, though plumes are common on the heads of many kinds of birds; we might call the wattle or <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin</b> round the base of the beak of the English carrier-pigeon a monstrosity, but we do not thus speak of the globular fleshy excrescence {{at the base of the}} beak of the Carpophaga oceanica.|$|E
50|$|In 1921, B. Douglas Thomas, chief {{designer}} of Thomas-Morse Aircraft designed two closely related parasol monoplanes, a single-seat fighter, the MB-9 and a two-seat trainer, the MB-10. They were of all-metal construction, with <b>corrugated</b> duralumin <b>skinning.</b>|$|R
50|$|The XO-36 {{made its}} first flight at the Santa Monica, California factory of Douglas in spring 1931. On 22 August 1931, the Air Corps placed an order for a small batch of service test aircraft, {{consisting}} of seven Y1B-7 bombers and five Y1O-35 observation aircraft. These differed from the prototypes by having smooth fuselage skins rather than the <b>corrugated</b> <b>skins</b> used on the prototype, while the fuselage was 11 in longer to adjust the aircraft's center of gravity. A revised fuel system was fitted, with more fuel carried {{in order to give}} the two-hour endurance specified by the Air Corps. More powerful Conqueror engines were fitted, with all aircraft using geared engines as used on the XO-35.|$|R
2500|$|The Type 151 Jockey was {{a compact}} and rather angular, low {{cantilever}} wing monoplane, built using the Wibault-Vickers <b>corrugated</b> <b>skinned</b> all-metal method as {{used on the}} Vireo. [...] The unstressed skin was riveted onto a largely duralumin structure, a few steel tubes forming highly stressed members. [...] The parallel chord, square-tipped wing used the thick, high-lift RAF 34 cross-section that Vickers had employed on the Viastra. The tailplane was equally rectangular and the fin clipped. [...] All control surfaces apart from the rudder were unbalanced. [...] The pilot's open cockpit was at the highest part of the fuselage at mid-chord. [...] The [...] Bristol Mercury IIA nine-cylinder radial was initially mounted without a cowling. A single-axle undercarriage had legs attached to front and rear wing spars.|$|R

50|$|The {{condition}} was first reported by Alibert in 1837, who called it cutis sulcata. A clinical {{description of the}} {{condition was}} provided by Robert in 1843 and was named by Unna in 1907. It has also been called Robert-Unna syndrome, bulldog scalp, <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin,</b> cutis verticis plicata, and pachydermia verticis gyrata.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, a {{specification}} for {{a modern}} twin-engined aircraft capable of operating both as a high speed airliner for the German airline Luft Hansa and as a medium bomber for the nascent Luftwaffe was issued to both Junkers and Heinkel. Five prototypes were ordered from each company; the Junkers Ju 86 and Heinkel He 111. Junkers' design was a low-winged twin engined monoplane, of all-metal stressed skin construction. Unlike most of Junkers' previous designs, it discarded their typical <b>corrugated</b> <b>skinning</b> in favour of smooth metal skinning which helped to reduce drag. The craft was fitted with a narrow track retractable tailwheel undercarriage and twin fins and rudders. It {{was intended to be}} powered by the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines, which although heavy, gave better fuel consumption than conventional petrol engines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{attempt to}} use duralumin for a heavier-than-air aircraft structure occurred in 1916, when Hugo Junkers first introduced its use {{in the creation of}} the Junkers J 3's airframe, a single-engined monoplane [...] "technology demonstrator" [...] that marked the first use of the Junkers trademark duralumin <b>corrugated</b> <b>skinning.</b> Only the covered wings and tubular fuselage framework of the J 3 were ever completed, before the project was abandoned. The slightly later Junkers J.I armoured sesquiplane had its all-metal wings and horizontal stabilizer made in the same manner as the J 3's wings had been, along with the experimental and airworthy all-duralumin Junkers J 7 single-seat fighter design, which led to the Junkers D.I low-wing monoplane fighter, introducing all-duralumin aircraft structural technology to German military aviation in 1918.|$|R
50|$|Derived {{from the}} Wibault 9, the Wib 10/II, (the Wibault 10 {{designation}} was re-used from an unbuilt project), was a parasol monoplane with two cockpits in tandem {{to house the}} pilot and observer. As with previous Wibault aircraft the Wib 10/II was built entirely from Duralumin with <b>corrugated</b> sheet <b>skin</b> and a strut-braced parasol wing.|$|R
50|$|A less radical {{design by}} Dr. John E. Younger {{featured}} all-metal construction; the aircraft was built as an all-metal, low-wing, retractable gear, twin engine transport with a triple vertical tail supporting a dual (biplane arrangement) horizontal stabilizer. The wing used a large box-spar construction with <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin</b> panels. The partly retracting {{landing gear extended}} automatically when the throttle was closed.|$|E
50|$|The high {{temperatures}} generated in flight required special design and operating techniques. Major {{portions of the}} skin of the inboard wings were corrugated, not smooth. Aerodynamicists initially opposed the concept, disparagingly referring to the aircraft as a Mach 3 variant of the 1920s-era Ford Trimotor, known for its corrugated aluminum skin. The heat would have caused a smooth skin to split or curl, whereas the <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin</b> could expand vertically and horizontally and increased longitudinal strength.|$|E
50|$|The SABCA S.2 was an {{airliner}} built in Belgium in 1926. It was a conventional, high-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed, tailskid undercarriage. The flight deck was open, but the passenger cabin was fully enclosed. Power {{was provided by}} a single engine in the nose, driving a two-blade propeller, and whose exhaust was collected in a single stack that extended up over the wing. Metal was construction throughout, with <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin.</b> Only a single example was built, which served with SABENA.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} {{corrugated}} panels has wide application in engineering. For example corrugated panels {{are often used}} in roof structures in civil engineering. More recently corrugated laminates have been suggested as a good solution for morphing aircraft skins due to their extremely anisotropic behaviour. The optimal design of these structures requires simple models of the panels or skins that may be incorporated into multi-disciplinary system models. Thus equivalent material models are required that retain the dependence on the geometric parameters of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>skins</b> or panels. An homogenisation-based analytical model, {{which could be used}} for any corrugation shape, is suggested in this paper. This method is based on a simplified geometry for a unit-cell and the stiffness properties of original sheet. This paper outlines such a modelling strategy, gives explicit expressions to calculate the equivalent material properties, and demonstrates the performance of the approach using two popular corrugation shapes...|$|R
50|$|The H.P47 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. Forward of {{the single}} spar the wing {{was covered with a}} stressed metal skin, forming a torsion box. Behind the spar it was fabric-covered, the trailing edge carrying flaps inboard, from the wing fillet out to the ailerons, though the centre section was metal-skinned throughout. The leading edge carried slats in three sections to form slots across the whole span when extended. The inboard pair were opened when the flaps were lowered and the outer slots were automatic, with interceptors connected to the ailerons for lateral control at high angles of attack. Behind the radial Bristol Pegasus IM3 engine, producing 650 hp (485 kW) and enclosed in a Townend ring, the semi-monocoque, <b>corrugated</b> <b>skinned</b> fuselage grew in diameter to the pilot's midwing cockpit then remaining constant rearwards to the gunner's position. He sat facing rearwards below the upper fuselage line and out of the slipstream, at a point where the fuselage stepped to a slim and narrowing oval boom. There was usable space inside the fuselage between the cockpits, enough to carry three passengers or two stretcher cases. All the tail surfaces moved; the fin, mounted ahead of the tailplane, moved with the horn-balanced rudder but through smaller angles, changing the camber, and the tailplane and single elevator were similarly coupled. All these rear control surfaces were covered with <b>corrugated</b> stressed <b>skin.</b> Specification G.4/31 included the dropping of torpedoes, so the underside of the aircraft had to be clear, and with wing fuel tanks the main undercarriage was fixed. The legs were mounted {{at the end of the}} centre section, each with a rearward strut and a long bracing strut outwards to the main spar. These struts were faired and both main and tailwheels spatted. The mainwheels were fitted with brakes.|$|R

TsAGI gave the task to the division led by Andrei Tupolev. Tupolev's team designed a twin-engined all-metal monoplane with a <b>corrugated</b> Duralumin <b>skin</b> — based on Tupolev's earlier work utilizing the all-metal aircraft design techniques first pioneered by Hugo Junkers in 1918 — powered by two Napier Lion engines, and named the ANT-4.|$|R
5000|$|Above {{speeds of}} around Mach 2.2 the {{airframe}} starts {{to heat up}} with the friction of the air, causing both thermal expansion and loss of strength in the cheap, easily workable light alloys used for lower speeds. Also, jet engines begin to reach their limits. The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird was constructed of titanium alloy, had a special <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin</b> to absorb thermal expansion and dual-cycle turbofan-ramjet engines which ran on a special temperature-tolerant fuel. Mach tuck was reduced {{through the use of}} long [...] "chine" [...] extensions of the wing along the fuselage, which contributed greater lift at supersonic speeds.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, {{a single}} TB-3-4M-17F was {{streamlined}} with removal of turrets and bomb shackles, covering of all openings, and fitting of wheel spats. This resulted {{in only a}} 4.5% increase in top speed and a similar increase in the range. Tupolev concluded that streamlining was minimally beneficial for large and slow aircraft. To study the effect of <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin,</b> in January-February 1935 a single TB-3-4AM-34R had the corrugations incrementally covered with fabric. This resulted in a 5.5% gain in top speed and a 27.5% increase in the ceiling. The same aircraft demonstrated {{a significant increase in}} climb rate when fitted with experimental four-blade propellers.|$|E
5000|$|The Junkers Ju 90 was a four-engine all-metal, low-wing {{aircraft}} {{fitted with}} twin end-plate vertical stabilizers. The wings were built around five tubular girder spars {{covered with a}} smooth stressed skin. The leading edge was quite markedly swept, the trailing edge almost straight. The Junkers [...] "double wing", a full-span movable flap/aileron combination was fitted. The tail units on the prototypes used the traditional Junkers <b>corrugated</b> <b>skin,</b> {{the only part of}} the aircraft to do so, abandoning the exposed corrugated skinning on later Ju 90 production models for the Luftwaffe. The fins and rudders, the latter with prominent horn balances assemblies were placed at the end of the tailplane; this latter carried the elevators separated by a gap, forming another double wing. These components were as used in the Ju 89.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 a {{team led}} by Ernő Rubik {{designed}} an all-metal glider, the R-23 Gébics, with a pod and boom fuselage, V-tail, fuselage mounted fan airbrakes and <b>corrugated</b> wing <b>skinning.</b> These features were carried forward into a series of gliders that included the R-25 Mokány. This was designed to compete as a Standard Class glider, with a span increased to 15 m (49 ft 5½ in), and introduced a laminar flow NACA 64 series wing profile.|$|R
25|$|The Gull was {{assembled}} at the Kirkham {{facility in}} Garden City, New York and Mitchel Field. It used conventional landing gear, a mid-wing arrangement, <b>corrugated</b> aluminum <b>skins,</b> and a radial engine. The cockpit featured a large streamlined greenhouse bubble with two seats. The large tailwheel was steerable and fully faired. The tail used small vertical stabilizers, with large elevators {{that could be}} swept back in flight. The aircraft profile was not unusual for the era {{with the exception of}} the highly tapered and swept back wings with a large dihedral and large tapered tail surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{the idea of}} the {{interceptor}} fighter was forming. To deal with the faster and higher flying bombers, fighters had both to be fast at height and quick to get there. The Air Ministry was keen to determine the best aircraft configuration and sought, under Air Ministry specification F.20/27, manufacturers to build biplanes and both low- and high-wing monoplanes. Vickers were asked for a prototype low-wing fighter and this became (somewhat unofficially) called the [...] "Jockey", or sometimes the Jockey I.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the approaches {{for the design}} and manufacturing of morphing skins based on rectangular-shaped composite corrugated laminates and proposes a novel solution to prevent detrimental effects of corrugation on aerodynamic performances. Additionally, more complex corrugated shapes are presented and analysed. The manufacturing {{issues related to the}} production of corrugated laminates are discussed and tests are performed to compare different solutions and to assess the validity of analytical and numerical predictions. The solution presented to develop an aerodynamically efficient skin consists in the integration of an elastomeric cover in the corrugated laminate. The related manufacturing process is presented and assessed, and a fully nonlinear numerical model is developed and characterized to study the behaviour of this skin concept in different load conditions. Finally, configurations based on combinations of individual rectangular-shaped corrugated panels are considered. Their structural properties are numerically investigated by varying geometrical parameters. Performance indices are defined to compare structural stiffness contributions in non-morphing directions with the ones of conventional panels of the same weight. Numerical studies also show that the extension of the concept to complex corrugated shapes may improve both the design flexibility and some specific performances with respect to rectangular shaped corrugations. The overall results validate the design approaches and manufacturing processes to produce corrugated laminates and indicate that the solution for the integration of an elastomeric cover is a feasible and promising method to enhance the aerodynamic efficiency of <b>corrugated</b> <b>skins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Morphing {{concepts}} {{have great}} importance {{for the design of}} future aircraft as they provide the opportunity for the aircraft to adapt their shape in flight so as to always match the optimal configuration. This enables the aircraft to have a better performance, such as reducing fuel consumption, toxic emissions and noise pollution or increasing the maneuverability of the aircraft. However the requirements of morphing aircraft are conflicting from the structural perspective. For instance the design of a morphing skin is a key issue since it must be stiff to withstand the aerodynamic loads, but flexible to enable the large shape changes. Corrugated sheets have remarkable anisotropic characteristics. As a candidate skin for a morphing wing, they are stiff to withstand the aerodynamic loads and flexible to enable the morphing deformations. This work presents novel insights into the multi-objective optimization of a trapezoidal corrugated core with elastomer coating. The geometric parameters of the coated composite corrugated panels are optimized to minimize the in-plane stiffness and the weight of the skin and to maximize the flexural out-of-plane stiffness of the skin. These objective functions were calculated by use of an equivalent finite element code. The gradient-based aggregate method is selected to solve the optimization problem and is validated by comparing to the GA multi-objective optimization technique. The trend of the optimized objectives and parameters are discussed in detail; for example the optimum corrugation often has the maximum corrugation height. The obtained results provide important insights into the design of morphing <b>corrugated</b> <b>skins...</b>|$|R
