40|$|Abstract In this study, using a tin {{chloride}} solution as the raw material, a nano-sized tin oxide powder {{with an average}} particle size below 50 nm is generated by a spray pyrolysis process. The properties of the tin oxide powder according to the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size are examined. Along {{with an increase in}} the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size from 1 mm to 5 mm, the generated particles that appear in the shape of droplets maintain an average particle size of 30 nm. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size increases from 1 mm to 2 mm, the average size of the generated particles is around 80 - 100 nm, and the ratio of the independent particles with a compact surface structure increases significantly. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size is at 3 mm, the majority of the generated particles maintain the droplet shape, the average size of the droplet-shaped particles increases remarkably compared to the cases of other <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> sizes, and the particle size distribution also becomes extremely irregular. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size is at 5 mm, the ratio of droplet-shaped particles decreases significantly and most of the generated particles are independent ones with incompact surface structures. Along with an increase in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size from 1 mm to 3 mm, the XRD peak intensity increases, whereas the specific surface area decreases greatly.

A spray pyrolysis system was specially designed and built for this study. The influence of <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size on {{the properties of the}} produced powder was examined. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size was 1 mm, the particle size distribution was more uniform than when other <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> sizes were used and the average particle size of the powder was about 15 nm. When the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> size increases to 2 mm, the average particle size increases to roughly 20 nm, and the particle size distribution becomes more uneven. When the tip size increases to 3 mm, particles with an average size of 25 nm and equal to or less than 10 nm coexist and the particle size distribution becomes much more uneven. When the tip size increases to 5 mm, large particles with average size of 50 nm partially exist, mostly consisting of minute particles with average sizes in the range of 15 ~ 25 nm. When the tip size increases from 1 mm to 2 mm, the XRD peak intensities greatly increase while the specific surface area decreases.

The design is based on the theories of gas dynamics and the aim is to convert the potential energy of high stagnation gas pressure into effective kinetic energy such that a high momentum gas jet with uniform and tidy boundary could be obtained. The designed supersonic nozzle consisted of four sections: stable, convergent, throat and divergent. Each of these sections are designed strictly based on gas dynamic theories. The behavior of the exit jet and the distance of normal shock under condition of stagnation gas pressure ranging from 4 to 16 bar were investigated by computer simulation. The behavior of the exit jet in boundaryless condition as well as in slots of controlled dimensions were observed by Shadowgraphy.

The main objective of this thesis to perform a computational study of pure gasoline fuel sprays structure development where it covers to parts; to determine the pure gasoline fuel spray angle and spray penetration depth characteristics using sing-hole port fuel injector (PFI) and to determine the impact of different injection pressure on the spray structure of pure gasoline fuel. The spray simulations are done completely by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) ANSYS CFX software with three <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter; 0. 2 mm, 0. 3 mm and 0. 4 mm. The Computational Aided Design (CAD) model for each nozzle was drawn using the SolidWorks software, the nozzle is attached with 110 mm bore and 125 mm stroke combustion chamber. In the ANSYS CFX software, the ready CAD model is imported into the design modeler and under goes meshing process with fine relevance center, 4 m min size, 4 m max face size and 8 m max size. There are three types of boundary conditions applied to the meshed geometry model, the first is inlet boundary condition with various injection pressure of 100 bar, 150 bar, 200 bar and 250 bar. Opening boundary condition is then place at the combustion chamber with atmospheric pressure value that is 101325 Pa and the third boundary condition is wall. The iteration calculation is solved until the convergence approached to the desired residual value {{and the result is}} obtained and analyzed. The first comparison made is between penetration depth versus injection pressure and the other is between spray angle versus injection pressure, the results are then compared between nozzle diameter for each injection pressure. The results show that as the injection pressure increased, the penetration depth is also increased as well as the spray angle. The conclusion has shown that the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter is also effecting the overall spray structure because wider <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter will released more fuel quantity compared to the smaller <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> diameter...|$|R

40|$|Gas {{atomization}} process, especially Closed Coupled Gas Atomization (CCGA) is a {{very efficient}} processing method to produce ultra fine, spherodised metal powders. In this process, the high-pressure gas jet is used to disintegrate the molten metal stream in to the spherical powders. Due to hydrodynamic and thermal interaction between high-pressure gas jet and molten metal stream especially near melt delivery nozzle, this technique is very complex and challenging for atomization industries. Melt delivery nozzle design {{is one of the}} key factors to control powders properties. The optical Schlieren technique and analogue water atomizer along with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical methods are practical methods for observing the single or two-phase flow of gas-metal interaction during CCGA. This research is focused on the optical Schlieren and numerical CFD techniques to observe single-phase gas flow behaviour with different melt <b>nozzles</b> <b>tip</b> design and gas dies profile.

40|$|A {{new method}} {{for the design}} of a {{supersonic}} <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> for high gas pressure laser cutting is presented. The design is based on the theory of gas dynamics in that the potential energy of high stagnation pressure is converted totally into effective velocity energy so that a high momentum of the exit jet can be obtained for improving the capability of removing molten debris quickly and minimizing the heat-affected zone of the cut edges. Another purpose is to increase the cutting speed and minimize gas consumption under high pressure cutting conditions. The behavior of the exit jet under the condition of stagnation gas pressure ranging from 4 ∼ 16 bar are investigated by means of a computer simulation test.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} with conventional diesel engines is the emission of soot. To reduce soot emission whilst maintaining fuel efficiency, an important pathway {{is to improve the}} fuel-air mixing process. This can be achieved by creating small droplets in order to enhance evaporation. Furthermore, the distribution of the droplets in the combustion chamber should be optimized, making optimal use of in-cylinder air. To deal with these requirements a new type of injector is proposed, which has a porous <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> with pore diameters between 1 and 50 µm. First, because of the small pore diameters the droplets will also be small. From literature it is known that (almost) no soot is formed when orifice diameters are smaller than 50 µm. Second, the configuration of the nozzle can be chosen such that the whole cylinder can be filled with fine droplets (i. e., spray angle nearly 180 °). However, injecting through a porous nozzle {{is not the same as}} an infinite number of very small holes, due to the difference in nozzle internal flow. Therefore, the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> is modeled in COMSOL Multiphysics in order to predict the outflow direction and velocity of the fuel. The Darcy-Forchheimer equation, which follows from the Navier-Stokes equation, is used for this purpose.

Part 1 (of 2), San Diego, CA, USA, 17 - 20 November 1997 A {{supersonic}} <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip</b> {{for high}} pressure gas assist laser cutting was designed {{based on the}} gas dynamic theories and the characteristics of its exit jet at free space were reported in last year's conference. More investigations {{have been carried out}} since. The effect of stand-off upon the jet momentum was studied using shadowgraphic technique. The behaviour of the gas jet inside the cut slot at different stand-off distance and inlet pressure were investigated. Cutting experiments were carried out using a 3. 5 kw CO 2 laser.

The coking occurred after the engines were shut down due to the fuel trapped in the line and temperature ranges present at the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tip.</b> As the coke built up, {{the holes in the}} swirlplate clogged and the aircraft required intensive servicing. The search for alternative solutions led to the possibility of using swirlplates that had been polished or coated in an attempt to reduce the coking rates. Several swirlplates surface finishes were investigated[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
