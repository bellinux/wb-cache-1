40|$|The {{performance}} of a compressor changes during its lifetime, depending on various parameters such as operating conditions, type of the compressor, working fluid and type of the oil being used. Most performance degradation of the compressor is due to wear on the moving mechanical parts inside the compression vessel. Wear develops on the contact point(s) or area(s) between the moving and fixed mechanical parts inside the compressor {{when there is a}} lack of lubrication. In a rolling piston rotary compressor, the most vulnerable regions are the vane and roller contact area, and the shaft and journal bearing area. As the amount of wear increases, leakage through the clearances inside the <b>compression</b> <b>compartment</b> increases as well. An increase in the amount of leakage degrades the volumetric efficiency and the overall {{performance of}} the compressor. The objectives of this study are to predict the life span of rolling piston rotary-type compressors through the measurement of wear on the roller under accelerated test conditions, and predict the effect of wear on the degradation of compressor performance. In order to be able to estimate the amount of wear under different operating pressures, a correlation between operating pressures, amount of wear, and degradation of performance was developed. Then the change in compressor performance was estimated using a computer simulation program which takes into account the effect of leakage through the clearances inside the compression vessel based on the operating conditions provided. One unit of rolling piston rotary type compressor was tested under accelerated operating conditions. An initial increase in the capacity and volumetric efficiency of the compressor was achieved due to aging affects. Then the performance of the compressor started to degrade due to increase in the amount of refrigerant leakage from suction pocket to discharge pocket of the <b>compression</b> <b>compartment...</b>|$|E
30|$|Pudendal {{neuralgia}} {{caused by}} compression of the pudendal nerve in Alcock’s canal (Alcock’s canal syndrome) typically induces severe pudendal nerve pain on sitting, which is relieved by standing, and absent when recumbent or when {{sitting on a}} toilet seat. Neuropathic pain induced by endometriosis of the pelvic nerves increases during menstruation and may decrease in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. In pelvic nerve irritation by vascular entrapment or <b>compression</b> (sacral <b>compartment</b> syndrome), pain is aggravated by all situations that induce an increase in pelvic venous pressure (prolonged standing or sitting, the Valsalva maneuver, etc.) or marked pulsation of the pelvic veins (tricuspid insufficiency, close anatomic relationship with arteries, etc.).|$|R
40|$|Orthostatic {{hypotension}} (OH) is {{the most}} disabling and serious manifestation of adrenergic failure, occurring in the autonomic neuropathies, pure autonomic failure (PAF) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). No specific treatment is currently available for most etiologies of OH. A reduction in venous capacity, secondary to some physical counter maneuvers (e. g., squatting or leg crossing), {{or the use of}} compressive garments, can ameliorate OH. However, there is little information on the differential efficacy, or the mechanisms of improvement, engendered by compression of specific capacitance beds. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of <b>compression</b> of specific <b>compartments</b> (calves, thighs, low abdomen, calves and thighs, and all compartments combined), using a modified antigravity suit, on the end-points of orthostatic blood pressure, and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Fourteen patients (PAF, n = 9; MSA, n = 3; diabetic autonomic neuropathy, n = 2; five males and nine females) with clinical OH were studied. The mean age was 62 years (range 31 - 78). The mean +/- SEM orthostatic systolic blood pressure when all compartments were compressed was 115. 9 +/- 7. 4 mmHg, significantly improved (p < 0. 001) over the head-up tilt value without compression of 89. 6 +/- 7. 0 mmHg. The abdomen was the only single <b>compartment</b> whose <b>compression</b> significantly reduced OH (p < 0. 005). There was a significant increase of peripheral resistance index (PRI) with compression of abdomen (p < 0. 001) or all compartments (p < 0. 001); end-diastolic index and cardiac index did not change. We conclude that denervation increases vascular capacity, and that venous compression improves OH by reducing this capacity and increasing PRI. <b>Compression</b> of all <b>compartments</b> {{is the most}} efficacious, followed by abdominal compression, whereas leg compression alone was less effective, presumably reflecting the large capacity of the abdomen relative to the legs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Langmuir trough {{described}} is {{specially designed}} to fabricate alternate multilayers automatically by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Its working principle consists of: (i) making two different films {{at the surface}} of a double Langmuir trough; (ii) programming the path of the substrate so that it passes in turn through each film. The apparatus consists principally of a two-compartment Langmuir trough and a system to transfer the substrate from one compartment to the other underneath water. The Langmuir trough contains a single subphase. Its surface is divided into two compartments by a fixed surface barrier located above the central well. Each compartment is equipped with a mobile barrier, {{so that it can be}} operated independently for film fabrication and <b>compression.</b> Each <b>compartment</b> is also equipped with an independently programmable dipping arm. Substrate transfer is carried out in the following way: while the two dipping arms are at rest, an auxiliary rotating arm picks up the substrate from one of the arms, transfers it to the other compartment underneath the central barrier and hangs it on the other dipping arm. This sample transferrer is described in detail, together with the way it operates. When the films in the compartments are made of different molecules, this trough builds up alternate LB layers. According to the programme imposed on the substrate transferrer, either centrosymmetric, or non-centrosymmetric, or paired alternate layers can be built. Examples of such alternate layers are given. Their actual structure is discussed: in some cases the films are found to reorganize on or after transfer...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{previously}} published experimental work, computational models {{were developed to}} simulate the effect of different dynamic compression regimens on the activity of chondrocytes seeded in agarose constructs. In particular, the balance between proliferation and matrix synthesis can be adjusted by applying different intervals of continuous or intermittent mechanical <b>compression.</b> A phenomenological <b>compartment</b> based-modeling approach was used as first model. A more mechanistic cell cycle model {{was used as the}} second model. The compartment-based modeling approach was found to be useful in representing a balance between proliferation and proteoglycan synthesis, when the effect of a certain stimulation protocol is known. In order to predict the response to different intervals of mechanical stimulation, however, a more mechanistic cell cycle-based approach is required. The cell cycle model supports an important role of the onset of loading. In addition, an inhibitory effect of further loading is required, which {{is more likely to be}} related to cell cycle progression velocity than to a decreased probability of commitment to the cell cycle. The mechanisms behind this inhibitory effect and the computational implementation, however, require further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Five {{patients}} suffered injuries {{around the}} wrist complicated by acute tunnel syndrome. Pam associated with median nerve paraesthesia or hypo-aesthesia are indications for urgent treatment; in four patients where operation was delayed, {{the outcome was}} poor. Acute compression of the median nerve at the wrist after injury occurs infrequently; the cases reported below show typical and easily recognised clinical features which contribute to a poor outcome if operative treatment is delayed. CASE REPORTS Case 1. A 17 -year-old man sustained a displaced fracture ofthe distal radius in a motorcycle accident. The fracture was promptly reduced under general anaesthesia on the evening ofadmission within two hours ofthe injury and a dorsal plaster was applied with 20 #{ 176 }fiexion at the wrist. During the night the patient suffered increasing pain in the wrist and needed analgesia with papaveretum. The plaster slab bandage was split and elevation continued. Fourteen hours after admission severe pain had persisted and profound anaesthesia {{in the distribution of}} the median nerve was noted. There was no clinical evidence of forearm compartment syndrome. An exten-sive decompression of the carpal tunnel and forearm was carried out and the median nerve was observed to be tightly compressed by a haematoma in the carpal tunnel. There was no forearm <b>compartment</b> <b>compression.</b> The fracture had not re-displaced, and the reduction was maintained with a Kirschner wire; only a light plaster was required...|$|R
40|$|A osteoartrite (OA) é uma desordem articular, com degenerações causadas principalmente pelo uso excessivo dessas estruturas, sendo comum nos membros inferiores e com prevalência nas articulações do joelho. Com o surgimento da doença, as estruturas cartilaginosas tornam-se ásperas, diminuindo a congruência da articulação afetada, geralmente apresentando crepitação durante o movimento. Devido à dificuldade de regeneração da cartilagem, os danos podem ser irreversíveis. Desta forma, a OA caracteriza-se por diminuir a qualidade de vida, tendendo para a evolução de seus sintomas ao longo do tempo, podendo apresentar dores e rigidez na sua forma crônica. Esses sintomas são facilmente encontramos em idoso, população com maior frequência de casos, devido às consequências do envelhecimento, no qual ocorre um déficit funcional do sistema musculo esquelético podendo resultar em uma maior sobrecarga nas articulações. Aparentemente, todas as causas que proporcionam um aumento dessas forças nas articulações, predispõem ao desenvolvimento de OA no joelho. Associado à estas desvantagens, observa-se uma grande quantidade de fatores de riscos, dentre os principais podemos destacar a obesidade, possivelmente pela compressão excessiva nos compartimentos do joelho. Além do mais, os prejuízos podem ser ainda maiores se combinados a uma deformidade articular, como um trauma ou um desalinhamento entre os segmentos que pode ser classificado em geno valgo – aumento de pressão no compartimento lateral do joelho – e geno varo – maior pressão no compartimento medial do joelho. Assim, observa-se na {{literatura}} que os fatores de riscos para o desenvolvimento de osteoartrite são diversificados, podendo ser cumulativos, referindo-se a predisposição para a doença. Desta forma, por meio dessas informações a respeito da osteoartrite, este trabalho almeja elucidar os principais fatores de riscos e suas características sintomáticas e morfológicas, visando agregar esses indivíduos à prática de atividade física. Para tal, este estudo foi produzido através de trabalhos experimentais e revisões bibliográficas, pesquisados em portais da Internet como PUBMED e CAPES. Para melhor entendermos as informações colhidas, esses artigos foram organizados e detalhados em uma tabela, fazendo referência aos autores encontrados. The osteoarthrits (OA) is {{a disorder}} to articulate, with degenerations caused mainly by the {{excessive use of}} those structures, being common in the inferior members and with prevalence in the articulations of the knee. With {{the appearance of the}} disease, the cartilaginous structures become rough, reducing the consistency of the affected articulation, usually presenting crackling during the movement. Due to the difficulty of cartilage’s regeneration, the damages can be irreversible. This way, OA is characterized by reducing the life quality, tending to the evolution of their symptoms over time, could present pains and rigidity in your chronic form. Those symptoms are easily found in senior, population more frequently of cases, due to the consequences of the aging, in which it happens a functional deficit of the system skeletal muscle could result in a larger overload in the articulations. Seemingly, all the causes that provide an increase of those forces in the articulations, predispose to the development of OA in the knee. Associated to these disadvantages, a great amount of factors of risks is observed, among the principal can be detach the obesity, possibly for the excessive <b>compression</b> in the <b>compartments</b> of the knee. Besides, the damages can still be larger if combined the a deformity to articulate, as a trauma or a misalignment among the segments that it can be classified in geno valgus - pressure increase in the lateral compartment of the knee - and geno varus - larger pressure in the compartment medial of the knee. Like this, it is observed in the literature that the factors of risks for the osteoarthrits development are diversified, could be cumulative, referring the predisposition for the disease. This way, through that information regarding the osteoarthrits, this work want elucidate the principal factors of risks and your symptomatic and morphologic characteristics, in order to add these individuals to the practice of physical activity. For such, this study was produced through experimental works and bibliographical revisions, researched in portals of Internet as PUBMED and CASTRATE.
