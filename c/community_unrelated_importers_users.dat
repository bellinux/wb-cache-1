30|$|The {{identification}} of PFOA and APFO as SVHC in the EU might indicate to states {{outside of the}} EU the need to minimize risks, and might also be {{a starting point for}} other regulatory measures on national or international level. Furthermore, this might be a strong signal to manufacturers and downstream users to replace PFOA and APFO. Authorization is the foreseen instrument in the REACH regulation to control the risks of SVHC. Once PFOA and APFO are included in the Candidate List they could be included into Annex XIV of the REACH regulation. Following inclusion into this Annex, manufacturers, <b>importers</b> and downstream <b>users</b> {{would not be allowed to}} use or to place these substances as such on the European market without an authorization of any single use. Risk control, good functioning of the internal market, and the replacement of SVHC by substitutes are aims of the authorization.

40|$|Eighteen {{species of}} wild fruits were {{examined}} for fruit-decaying fungi in nature. Surface-sterilized and non-sterilized fruits were incubated for 1 - 4 weeks and the fruiting bodies were identified. A total of 540 samples and 495 microfungi from 102 taxa were identified. Colletotrichum and Phomopsis {{were the most}} frequently recorded fungal genera. Ilex cinerea had the most diverse fungal species, while Wikstroemia nutans had the lowest diversity. Fifty-eight percent of fungal genera found in this survey have not been recorded on cultivated fruits. The fungal community that developed on non-sterilized fruits after incubation was generally more diverse than on surface-sterilized fruits, but both were colonized mostly by non-specific fungi. Related fruit species did not, in general, have more similar fungal <b>communities</b> than <b>unrelated</b> species. The ability of detached fruits to resist fungal infection under incubation varied greatly, with 77 % of fruits of Wikstroemia nutans still not infected after 4 weeks.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} principles introduced by REACH is that it is for manufacturers, <b>importers</b> and downstream <b>users</b> to ensure that manufacturing, placing on the market or use of chemicals does not adversely affect human health or the environment (Art. 1 (3)). Companies need to register the chemicals they manufacture or import with a yearly volume exceeding 1 ton. In addition to that the safe use for the whole life-cycle of a substance needs to be demonstrated in a chemical safety report (CSR) as important part of the registration for substances with a yearly volume exceeding 10 tons. If risks are identified in the CSR, the responsible registrants need to propose and apply appropriate measures to adequately control the risks. These measures also need to be recommended to downstream users in the (extended) safety data sheet (Art. 14 (6)). The safety data sheet is also the instrument to communicate registered uses, hazards, risks and appropriate risk management measures within the supply chain.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The Regulation (EC) No. 1272 / 2008 on classification, {{labelling}} {{and packaging}} of substances and mixtures (CLP) sets further obligations for manufacturers, <b>importers,</b> distributors, downstream <b>users</b> of substances either {{on their own}} or in mixtures.

30|$|According to Art. 59 (1) REACH all {{identified}} SVHC are {{candidates for}} inclusion in Annex XIV REACH, this candidate status being {{the first step to}} subject a substance to the authorisation scheme. By mid-July 2016 Annex XIV lists 31 substances [10]. Examples of listed SVHC are DEHP and lead chromate [10]. Following Art.  56 (1) REACH a manufacturer, <b>importer</b> or downstream <b>user</b> shall not place an Annex XIV substance on the market for use or use it himself, unless this use is exempt from the authorisation requirement or the actor, or his supplier, respectively, attained an authorisation for the corresponding use. The authorisation scheme thus establishes a use specific ban that is effective from a specified sunset date with permit reservation: by applying for authorisation actors may temporarily—according to Art. 60 (8) REACH every authorisation decision is subject to review—overcome the barrier of the ban. For this they must, prior to the placing on the market or usage, prove that the risks posed by the substance use are adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks [11].|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIDarwin's naturalization {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the success of an invasive species will be lower when colonizing communities are formed by phylogenetically related rather than unrelated species due to increased competition. Although microbial invasions are involved in both natural and anthropogenic processes, factors affecting the success of microbial invaders are unknown. A biological invasion assay was designed using Trichoderma cf. harzianum as the invader and two types of recipient communities assembled in microcosm assays: communities phylogenetically related to the invader, and <b>communities</b> phylogenetically <b>unrelated</b> to it. Both types of communities were invaded by T cf. harzianum, and the success of colonization was monitored by qPCR; its effect on the genetic structure of recipient fungal communities was then assessed by DGGE profiles. T cf. harzianum established itself in both communities, reaching 1000 - 10, 000 times higher copy numbers in the non-related communities. However, invader establishment does not affect the structure of the invaded communities. These results suggest that the composition of recipient communities and their phylogenetic relationship to the invader affect the success of colonization by T cf. harzianum. While this approach represents a very simplified assay, these microcosms enable an experimental test of Darwin's hypothesis {{in order to understand the}} biological invasion process in microbial communities.
