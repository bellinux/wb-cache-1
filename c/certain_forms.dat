In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).|$|E
5|$|Some {{heavy metals}} are either {{essential}} nutrients (typically iron, cobalt, and zinc), or relatively harmless (such as ruthenium, silver, and indium), {{but can be}} toxic in larger amounts or <b>certain</b> <b>forms.</b> Other heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury, and lead, are highly poisonous. Potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining, tailings, industrial wastes, agricultural runoff, occupational exposure, paints and treated timber.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> {{of dance}} were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, {{such as those}} of the dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.|$|E

5|$|Bucer {{believed}} that the Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did not achieve this, as political events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg Interim, which imposed <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.|$|E
5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> {{of birth control}} may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, it was {{determined}} that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the virus was found in <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal or desire. Just as a philosophy may strive for truth, it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E
5|$|Varner then {{considers}} {{a range of}} proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; factory farming, for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with {{a consideration of the}} relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> of humane agriculture.|$|E
40|$|This comment {{discusses}} Hans Lindahl’s central idea of a-legality. It {{begins by}} positioning {{the idea of}} a-legality {{in the literature on}} the constituent power of the people, showing how it ad-vances the discussion at hand. Having done that, it raises two questions regarding the conceptu-al and normative significance of the politics of a-legality. Is a-legality contingent on a <b>certain</b> <b>form</b> of consciousness, or a <b>certain</b> <b>form</b> of government? And, what is the basis of the normative recommendation that legal collectives ought to respond to a-legality with collective self-restraint?

5|$|Usage of {{the flag}} is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws {{relating}} to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use {{of the flag}} by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use {{in conjunction with other}} national and non-national flags.|$|E
5|$|In December 1483, Richard instituted what {{later became}} known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal {{representation}} could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted <b>certain</b> <b>forms</b> of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.|$|E
