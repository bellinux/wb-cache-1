40|$|IR + visible sum {{frequency}} generation (SFG) {{has been used}} to obtain the vibrational spectra and orientations for both the nitrile (<b>CN)</b> <b>head</b> group and the methyl (CD 3) tail of the insoluble long-chain amphiphile CD 3 (CH 2) 1 &N at the aidwater interface. The results show that the orientations of the head group and the terminal group vary with amphiphile surface density, but in markedly different ways. It is found at the amphiphile density, which corresponds to the phase transition from the gasfliquid coexistence region to the liquid region, that the hydrogen bonds of the <b>CN</b> <b>head</b> groups to water are broken, the water is squeezed out of the monolayer, and the orientation of the head group changes sharply. The possibility that the rupturing of the hydrogen bonds and reorientation of the <b>CN</b> <b>head</b> groups may be the trigger for the phase transition is discussed. In addition to the SFG study of the amphiphile at the aidwater interface, a method was discovered that enables SFG to remove the ambiguity in the ratio of the two Raman polarizability elements for a symmetric stretch. Depolarization measurements in linear Raman experiments cannot determine whether the ratio of elements is greater than or less than one, whereas the SFG method can...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the five}} years double-pass {{spectrometer}} observations of the Sun-as-a-star revealed significant changes in line intensities. The photospheric component weakened linearly with time 0 to 2. 3 %. From a lack of correlation between these line weakenings and solar activity indicators like sunspots and plage, a global variation of surface properties is inferred. Model-atmosphere analysis suggests a slight reduction in the lower-photospheric temperature gradient corresponding to a 15 % increase in the mixing length within the granulation layer. Chromospheric lines such as Ca II H and K, Ca II 8543 and the <b>CN</b> band <b>head</b> weaken synchronously with solar activity.

40|$|Aims. We {{promote the}} use of {{narrow-band}} (0. 05 — 0. 20 nm FWHM) imaging in the molecular <b>CN</b> band <b>head</b> at 388. 33 nm as an effective method for monitoring small-scale magnetic field elements because it renders them with exceptionally high contrast. Methods. We create synthetic narrow-band CN filtergrams from spectra computed from a three-dimensional snapshot of a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar convection to illustrate the expected high contrast and explain its nature. In addition, we performed observations with the horizontal slit spectrograph at the Dunn Solar Tower at 388. 3 nm to experimentally confirm the high bright-point contrast, and to characterize and optimize the transmission profile of a narrow-band (0. 04 FWHM) Lyot filter, which was built by Lyot and tailored to the CN band at Sacramento Peak in the early 70 ’s. Results. The presented theoretical computations predict that bright-point contrast in narrow-band (0. 04 FWHM) CN filtergrams is more than 3 times higher than in CN filtergrams taken with 1 nm FWHM wide filters, and in typical G-band filtergrams. Images taken through the Lyot filter after optimizing its passband confirm that the filter is capable of rendering small-scale magnetic elements with contrasts that are much higher than in traditional G-band imaging. The filter will be available as an user instrument at the Dunn Solar Tower. Key words. Techniques: spectoscopic – Sun: photosphere – Sun: magnetic fields – Radiative transfer –Molecular dat...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{striatum}} (caudate nucleus, CN, and putamen, Put) is a {{group of}} subcortical nuclei involved in planning and executing voluntary movements as well as in cognitive processes. Its neuronal composition includes projection neurons, which connect the striatum with other structures, and interneurons, whose main roles are maintaining the striatal organization and the regulation of the projection neurons. The unique electrophysiological and functional properties of the cholinergic interneurons give them a crucial modulating function on the overall striatal response. Methodology/Principle Findings. This study was carried out using stereological methods to examine the volume and density (cells/mm 3) of these interneurons, as visualized by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity, in the following territories of the CN and Put of nine normal human brains: 1) precommissural head; 2) postcommissural head; 3) body; 4) gyrus and 5) tail of the CN; 6) precommissural and 7) postcommissural Put. The distribution of ChAT interneurons was analyzed with respect to the topographical, functional and chemical territories of the dorsal striatum. The CN was more densely populated by cholinergic neurons than the Put, and their density increased along the anteroposterior axis of the striatum with the CN body having the highest neuronal density. The associative territory of the dorsal striatum was by far the most densely populated. The striosomes of the <b>CN</b> precommissural <b>head</b> and the postcommissural Put contained the greatest number of ChAT-ir interneurons.

The river then turns southeast through Thor Lake and begins a long stretch paralleled by the <b>CN</b> line. It <b>heads</b> through Post Lake and past the settlement of Laforest to reach Baseline Lake and the settlement of Raphoe. The Vermilion River enters Greater Sudbury near the settlement of Sellwood, takes in the right tributary Roberts River at the settlement of Milnet where it also meets Sudbury Municipal Road 84 (formerly Ontario Highway 545), turns south, and reaches the community of Capreol, where the river and railway line part. The river heads west, takes in the right tributary Rapid River, passes over the Kettle Rapids, takes in the right tributary Nelson River, turns southwest, passes the community of Rayside-Balfour and takes in the right tributary Onaping River near the community of Onaping Falls.
