50|$|The rough sets {{can be used}} {{to induce}} {{three-way}} classification decisions. The positive negative and boundary regions can be interpreted as regions of acceptance, rejection and deferment decisions, respectively. The probabilistic rough set model extends the conventional rough sets by providing more effective way for classifying objects. A main result of probabilistic rough sets is the interpretation of three-way decisions using a pair of probabilistic thresholds. The game-theoretic rough set model determine and interprets the required thresholds by utilizing a game-theoretic environment for analyzing strategic situations between cooperative or <b>conflicting</b> <b>decision</b> making criteria. The essential idea is to implement a game for investigating how the probabilistic thresholds may change in order to improve the rough set based decision making.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{difficult}} problems in decision analysis relates to the situation, when the decision must be undertaken by a committee. There exist several formalizations of decision making process based on the utility function approach. This approach is however very difficult to apply in the group decision case, since the number of coefficients characterizing the utility function is very high and it is practically impossible to directly identify such utility function. Therefore, reduction of dimensionality of the parameter space is necessary. In this paper a concept of convex dependence between two <b>conflicting</b> <b>decision</b> makers is presented. This concept was effectively used by the author to develop a decomposition principle of the group utility function {{as well as to}} formulate the conditions necessary to perform such a decomposition. The concept was successfully applied for a practical example...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{manufacturing}} variability, {{the strength of}} a component may vary significantly and unpredictably. When a component is put into use, it is subjected to a stress, which is also unpredictable. If the strength of the component is sufficient to withstand stress, then the component is functional. Otherwise, the component fails immediately. Achieving higher reliability requires higher costs. This paper first shows two reliability optimization models using normally distributed strength and stress: one is to maximize reliability subject to maximally allowable cost associated with reliability, while the other is to minimize the cost subject to a required minimum reliability level. The paper then proceeds by showing how these two <b>conflicting</b> <b>decision</b> criteria are comprised in a joint manner by presenting a proposed cost-reliability compromise model.

40|$|Decision {{making in}} today's world {{certainly}} incorporates {{the consideration of}} assessment in view {{of a number of}} criteria, instead of a favored single criteria. Solving a multi-criteria decision issue offers decision makers suggestions, regarding the best decision choices (Alternatives). At the point when discovering the best decision of alternatives, subject to various distinctive criteria is almost impossible, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been very instrumental, effective, extraordinary and much of the time utilized strategy in solving problems in much complex decision making processes. This paper briefly discusses Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and AHP {{as one of the most}} popular MCDM methods for group decision making. Also, steps, techniques and formulae used in AHP have been discussed to help handle the problems arising from choosing alternative(s). Finally, the paper offers recommendations to researchers and professionals to apply AHP methodology techniques when analyzing multiple, complicated and <b>conflicting</b> <b>decision</b> making problems...|$|E

Most of the existing sources to generate energy are fossil fuels and it is known that fossil fuels are scarce. In order to satisfy increasing energy demand, searches for new energy generation sources have been conducted and these searches are ended with the proposal of generation of energy by using renewable sources. Decision makers are facing with some important decision problems related to energy generation from renewable sources. In the scope of this study, site selection problem {{which is one of the}} most important problems related to renewable energy is considered. Site selection decision consists of many alternatives and many <b>conflicting</b> <b>decision</b> criteria. Due to the hesitance of decision makers in criteria evaluation, a decision making approach based on hesitant fuzzy sets is proposed for solution of the problem.

40|$|Due to the {{complementary}} nature {{of radio and}} optical wireless (OW) both in capacity and coverage, the combined use of both for data transmission could have advantages over a single media. However, big technical challenges for vertical-handover (VHO) strategy arise for such an integrated system. According to different interruption types and traffic modes, two basic VHO schemes can be applied: immediate VHO (I-VHO) and dwell VHO (D-VHO). This paper proposes a novel fuzzy-logic (FL) -based decision-making algorithm for VHO, which is capable of combining the merits of both schemes to achieve excellent handover in terms of packet transfer delay for all the cases considered here. The strength of FL in handling uncertain and <b>conflicting</b> <b>decision</b> metrics is exploited.

With reference to that event, this research aims to examine the usefulness of the evaluation tools that are currently employed and the positive effects that one of these techniques would have had, as support for the identification of the “winner” project, are highlighted. Therefore, an hypothetical examination/adjustment of the decision process of that competition through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is developed, analyzing the outputs obtained by the implementations of this technique on the final decision.

When processing non-ideal images the variation in the quality of features at different levels of abstraction may cause individual classifiers to generate <b>conflicting</b> genuine-impostor <b>decisions.</b> Existing fusion approaches are non-adaptive and do not always guarantee optimum performance improvements. We propose a contextual unification framework to dynamically select the most appropriate evidence theoretic fusion algorithm for a given scenario. The effectiveness of our approach is experimentally validated by fusing match scores from level- 2 and level- 3 fingerprint features. Compared to existing fusion algorithms, the proposed approach is computationally efficient, and the verification accuracy is not compromised even when <b>conflicting</b> <b>decisions</b> are encountered.
