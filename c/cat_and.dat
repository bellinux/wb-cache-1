5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> dog fleas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{pathology}} {{of severe}} acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in <b>cats</b> <b>and</b> ferrets is poorly described, {{and the distribution}} of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), a receptor for SARS-CoV, in the respiratory tracts of these species is unknown. We observed SARS-CoV antigen expression and lesions in the respiratory tracts of 4 <b>cats</b> <b>and</b> 4 ferrets at 4 days postinoculation and ACE 2 expression in the respiratory tracts of 3 <b>cats</b> <b>and</b> 3 ferrets without infection. All infected <b>cats</b> <b>and</b> ferrets had diffuse alveolar damage associated with SARS-CoV antigen expression. A novel SARS-CoV– associated lesion was tracheo-bronchoadenitis in cats. SARS-CoV antigen expression occurred mainly in type I and II pneumocytes and serous cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands of <b>cats</b> <b>and</b> in type II pneumocytes of ferrets. ACE 2 expression occurred mainly in type I and II pneumocytes, tracheo-bronchial goblet cells, serous epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in <b>cats,</b> <b>and</b> type II pneumocytes and serous epithelial cells of tracheo-bronchial submucosal glands in ferrets. In conclusion, the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in <b>cats</b> <b>and</b> ferrets resembles that in humans except that syncytia and hyaline membranes were not observed. The identification of tracheo-bronchoadenitis in cats has potential implications for SARS pathogenesis and SARS-CoV excretion. Finally, these results show the importance of ACE 2 expression for SARS-CoV infection in vivo: whereas ACE 2 expression in type I and I...|$|R
