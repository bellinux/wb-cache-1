5|$|Curie's {{quest to}} create a new {{laboratory}} did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now <b>Curie</b> Institute, Institut <b>Curie),</b> a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving <b>Curie</b> a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of <b>Curie</b> leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the <b>Curie</b> Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E
5|$|Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon {{starred in}} the 1943 U.S. Oscar-nominated film, Madame <b>Curie,</b> based on her life. More recently, in 1997, a French film about Pierre and Marie <b>Curie</b> was released, Les Palmes de M. Schutz. It was adapted from a play of the same name. In the film, Marie <b>Curie</b> was played by Isabelle Huppert.|$|E
5|$|Okafor and Alexander vied {{for a host}} {{of local}} and {{national}} player of the year awards, with each winning multiple national player of the year awards. Young and <b>Curie</b> were both in the Marist Class 4A sectional in the 2014 IHSA playoffs and could have met again in the round of sixteen on March 14 if they had both won three regional contests. Despite forfeiting all wins in CPL games, <b>Curie</b> remained eligible to compete in the IHSA playoffs due to differences in eligibility rules. On March 4, <b>Curie</b> lost their opening IHSA playoff game to 11–11 DuSable High School by an 88–85 margin in overtime. It marked Curies first loss of the season on the court with Alexander in the lineup. Alexander posted 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks despite fouling out in the final minute of regulation time. <b>Curie</b> trailed 13–2 early and led 47–32 midway through the third quarter. <b>Curie</b> starters Josh and Joseph Stamps were ineligible for IHSA play as was Malik Washington.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Curie</b> {{family has}} {{received}} the most prizes, with four prizes awarded to five individual laureates. Marie <b>Curie</b> received the prizes in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911). Her husband, Pierre <b>Curie,</b> shared the 1903 Physics prize with her. Their daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband Frédéric Joliot-Curie. In addition, the husband of Marie Curie's second daughter, Henry Labouisse, {{was the director of}} UNICEF when it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965.|$|E
5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of <b>Curie,</b> Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that <b>Curie</b> was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed <b>Curie</b> as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, Nobel Prizes {{have been}} awarded to 844 men, 48 women (Marie <b>Curie</b> won it twice), and 27 organizations. Sixteen women {{have won the}} Nobel Peace Prize, {{fourteen}} have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, twelve have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, four have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, two have won the Nobel Prize in Physics and one, Elinor Ostrom, has won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie <b>Curie,</b> who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre <b>Curie,</b> and Henri Becquerel. <b>Curie</b> is also the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes. The most Nobel Prizes awarded to women {{in a single year}} was in 2009, when five women became laureates. The most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Tu Youyou and Svetlana Alexievich (2015).|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre <b>Curie,</b> the husband of Madam <b>Curie.</b> Professor <b>Curie</b> drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. <b>Curie</b> explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

40|$|Aeroacoustics is {{a growing}} field in {{aeronautical}} and automotive industry, mainly {{through the application of}} the aeroacoustical analogy. <b>CurIe's</b> analogy is particularly popular in automotive industry. This paper presents some preliminary results of an aeroacoustical study of the sound produced by the leapfrogging of two rectilinear filament vortices within an infinite two-dimensional straight duct. The flow field is obtained from an inviscid kinematic description of the vortical motion. Such incompressible flow description does not contain any acoustical information over the source region. The sound is predicted in frequency domain following two approaches: using a tailored Green's function based on the non-evanescent duct modes, and applying <b>CurIe's</b> analogy to the incompressible flow model. The results show that the pressure field obtained applying <b>CurIe's</b> analogy differ significantly from the pressure field obtained using the tailored Green's function. This is particularly severe at frequencies for which non-planar duct acoustical modes are excited by the vortex motion. The discrepancies are attributed to the lacking acoustical information in the source description. A hybrid method combining <b>CurIe's</b> analogy with a boundary element method to determine a numerical tailored Green's function, is likely to yield a better sound prediction...|$|R

5|$|On November 30, at a Draffenville, Kentucky tournament {{game against}} Oak Hill Academy, Alexander scored 26 of his teams 39 points on 12–14 field goal {{shooting}} in a 72–39 defeat. On December 29, <b>Curie</b> again faced Parker and Simeon in the Pontiac Holiday Tournament (this {{time in the}} semifinals). Alexander posted 21 points on 9–10 field goal shooting, but Simeon still prevailed 62–57. Notably, Parker assumed Alexander as a defensive assignment after Alexander gave <b>Curie</b> a 48–47 lead with 4:58 time remaining and Alexander went scoreless {{the rest of the}} game. Despite 11 points, 9 rebounds and 8 blocked shots from Alexander, <b>Curie</b> was eliminated from the CPL playoffs in a February 11 quarterfinals 60–58 loss to the Billy Garrett, Jr.-led Morgan Park High School that went on to become 2013 IHSA Class 3A state champion. On February 26, the Associated Press Illinois Class 4A basketball rankings showed Whitney Young at number 1, and it was also expected that Young's road to the sectional finals would include a March 6 meeting with <b>Curie.</b> According to Henricksen, the March 6 state playoff meeting between Young and <b>Curie</b> was anticipated because it would pit Okafor against Alexander, making it the most highly touted IHSA playoff matchup of centers since 1988 when LaPhonso Ellis led East Saint Louis' Lincoln High School against Eric Anderson's St. Francis de Sales High School. Mike Helfgot of the Chicago Tribune said that there have not been many matchups between big men this good with so much at stake. On March 2, Alexander attended Senior night at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Assembly Hall. The February 2013 Great Plains blizzard caused controversial postponements of several IHSA games including the March 6 Young-Curie game, which was delayed one day. Young defeated <b>Curie</b> 62–58 as the supporting cast made up for Alexander's 14–13 scoring edge over Okafor.|$|E
