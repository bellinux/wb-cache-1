5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on the}} subject {{even in the face}} of additional <b>conflicting</b> <b>evidence.</b> In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain <b>conflicting</b> <b>evidence</b> as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been <b>conflicting</b> <b>evidence</b> {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E

But this method just calculated {{the mean of the}} <b>conflicted</b> <b>evidence</b> and didn’t pay much attention on their correlation. Based on the combination method of Murphy, a new method to calculate the weighted average of the <b>conflicted</b> <b>evidence</b> using consistent strength is proposed by taking the correlation into account. The proposed combination method can combine highly <b>conflicted</b> <b>evidences</b> to be more satisfactory. A numerical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. </p...|$|R

Based on the support degree of focal element, we establish a combination rule of evidence theory. Besides, the paper also gives the strict demonstration and makes simulated experiments of the new rule. The new rule rationally assigns the probability of <b>conflicted</b> <b>evidences</b> to every focal element according to the support degree.

5|$|Paranota plus leg gene {{recruitment}} hypothesis: The fossil larvae of Coxoplectoptera provided {{important new}} {{clues to the}} disputed question of the evolutionary origin of insect wings. Before the larvae fossil discovery the paranotal-hypothesis and the leg-exite-hypothesis have been considered as incompatible alternative explanations, which have both been supported {{by a set of}} evidences from the fossil record, comparative morphology, developmental biology and genetics. The expression of leg genes in the ontogeny of the insect wing has been universally considered as conclusive evidence in favour of the leg-exite-hypothesis, which proposes that insect wings are derived from mobile leg appendages (exites). However, the larvae of Coxoplectoptera show that the abdominal gills of mayflies and their ancestors, which are generally considered as corresponding structures to insect wings, articulated within the dorsal tergite plates. This cannot be seen in modern mayfly larvae, because their abdominal tergites and sternites are fused to rings, without any traces left even in embryonic development. If larval gills and wings are corresponding ("serial homologous") structures and thus share the same evolutionary origin, the new results from Coxoplectoptera demonstrate that also wings are of tergal origin, as proposed by the classical paranotal-hypothesis. Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) therefore suggested a new hypothesis that could reconcile the apparently <b>conflicting</b> <b>evidence</b> from paleontology and developmental genetics: wings first originated as stiff outgrowths of tergal plates (paranota), and only later in evolution became mobile, articulated appendages through secondary recruiting of leg genes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{findings}} in auditing indicate that sequential processing of <b>conflicting</b> audit <b>evidence</b> {{can lead to}} possible non-normative responses. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the effects of <b>conflicting</b> audit <b>evidence</b> and source reliability on audit judgement during sequential processing. Eightyeight auditors from the Big 5 CPA firms in Fiji participated in the study. The results suggests that auditors only display significant differences in judgments when presentation order is reversed for <b>conflicting</b> audit <b>evidence</b> from a source with high reliability. Application of a weighted average model supports the notion that the reliability of source affects the weighting of <b>conflicting</b> audit <b>evidence.</b> Additional analysis shows that presentation order inhibits auditors from rationally weighing <b>conflicting</b> audit <b>evidence</b> with varying source reliability. The arithmetic weights computed using a linear model are likely to be useful in setting benchmarks for the validation of cue weights in expert systems and for policy decisions on formulation of audit practice statements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:In {{the belief}} {{function}} theory framework, {{how to measure}} <b>conflict</b> between <b>evidences</b> {{is the first step}} in the combination of <b>conflicting</b> <b>evidences.</b> However, the existing conflict measurement methods have some limitations. Two new methods based on binary function of the combined belief assigned to the emptyset before normalization and the distance betting commitments of beliefs are proposed. Two methods have three advantages. Firstly, they are more suitable for people's intuitive logic reasoning. Secondly, they overcome the operational problem of the existing binary conflict measurement methods. Thirdly, new methods can measure the conflict between any pieces of evidence simultaneously, which can satisfy the interchangeability and combinability. Some illustration results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved methods. ...|$|R
