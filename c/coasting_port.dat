60|$|In {{the time}} of Spanish rule, and for many years afterwards, the town of Sulaco--the {{luxuriant}} beauty of the orange gardens bears witness to its antiquity--had never been commercially anything {{more important than a}} <b>coasting</b> <b>port</b> with a fairly large local trade in ox-hides and indigo. The clumsy deep-sea galleons of the conquerors that, needing a brisk gale to move at all, would lie becalmed, where your modern ship built on clipper lines forges ahead by the mere flapping of her sails, had been barred out of Sulaco by the prevailing calms of its vast gulf. Some harbours of the earth are made difficult of access by the treachery of sunken rocks and the tempests of their shores. Sulaco had found an inviolable sanctuary from the temptations of a trading world in the solemn hush of the deep Golfo Placido as if within an enormous semi-circular and unroofed temple open to the ocean, with its walls of lofty mountains hung with the mourning draperies of cloud.|$|E

We had made out the red light in that bay and steered for it, guessing it must mark some small <b>coasting</b> <b>port.</b> We passed two vessels, outlandish and high-sterned, sleeping at anchor, and, approaching the light, now very dim, ran the boat's nose against {{the end of a}} jutting wharf. We were blind with fatigue. My men dropped the oars and fell off the thwarts as if dead. I made fast to a pile. A current rippled softly. The scented obscurity of the shore was grouped into vast masses, a density of colossal clumps of vegetation, probably--mute and fantastic shapes. And at their foot the semicircle of a beach gleamed faintly, like an illusion. There was not a light, not a stir, not a sound. The mysterious East faced me, perfumed like a flower, silent like death, dark like a grave.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{capacity}} of the USA <b>coast</b> <b>port</b> industry to sustain the development of the US economic system, which is predicted to undergo further strong expansion throughout the period up to 2020. The analysis is based on the observation that GDP depends on international trade, which in turn depends on maritime transport and therefore on the efficiency of the United States <b>coast</b> <b>port</b> industry system. The paper also points out that in many respects the US <b>coast</b> <b>port</b> industrial system is very efficient. It boasts a large number of ports, strategically located, efficient in their production specialization and competitiveness; in addition, the US <b>coast</b> <b>ports</b> are integrated with the national intermodal system. Despite this, the system reveals numerous weaknesses that need to be addressed. The most evident deficiencies involve land access to the ports, inadequate modernization of the intermodal system, dredging and its funding, the power the liner shipping companies wield over the ports, container terminal productivity, the organization of dock work and labour. A number of interesting proposals emerge, to some extent favourably re-assessing the role of federal coordination in the maritime transport sector and putting forward the suggestion of a form of specific financing for the transport sector rather than generic funding; this could be achieved by setting up a purpose-created bank and the subsequent emission of transportation bonds. The paper concludes with the assertion that although the US <b>coast</b> <b>port</b> industry is the most powerful in the world, measures need to be undertaken for technological, organizational and financial rationalization in the <b>coast</b> <b>ports,</b> considered synergically with the intermodal system. Such measures are vital in order to sustain the development that is expected for the period up to 2020; nevertheless, if the proposed measures are not carried out or prove to require a longer time period for completion, this would not lead to an irremediable breakdown, although it would certainly cause a noticeable slow-down of development [...] US <b>coast</b> <b>ports,</b> US maritime transport, intermodality, ports weaknesses, dredging, naval gigantisms, transport bonds...|$|R
40|$|Kurt Nagle, {{president}} of the American Association of Port Authorities, and David Matsuda, maritime administrator for the United States Department of Transportation, have both labeled the Panama Canal expansion project as a "game-changer" for seaports in the United States. The true effects of the canal’s expansion will not be definitively known for years to come. Yet such uncertainty has not reduced the anticipation of economic benefits {{to a number of}} East and Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>ports.</b> The prospect for increased cargo being shipped to East and Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>ports,</b> and consequently away from West <b>Coast</b> <b>ports,</b> has generated an assortment of activity at numerous ports, as each prepares for an increase in both cargo volume and the size of incoming vessels...|$|R
