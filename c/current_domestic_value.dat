40|$|During {{the present}} decade, Austria has {{experienced}} {{a dramatic increase in}} organic farming among those countries that comprise the European Union (EU). For example, in 1992, approximately 2, 000 farms were practicing organic, ecological, or biodynamic farming methodes. By 1997 the number of certified organic farms plus those in transition from conventional farming had increased 10 -fold to some 20, 000 farms. This represents almost 9 % of the total farms in Austria and an area of 345, 375 ha, or 10 % of the total cultivated farmland. The largest concentration of organic farms is in regions with a high proportion of alpine grassland or pastures. Approximately 50 % of the organic farms range in size from 5 to 15 ha. The strong organic movement in Austria can be attributed to a) government subsidies which provide incentives to organic farmers and b) widepread acceptance of organic products and their brand names by large food chains and supermarkets. More than 60 % of organic farmers are affiliated with associations and organizations that provide advisory and support services in marketing activities. Certification of organic farms and food processors is conducted by seven monitoring bodies according to EU regulations No. 2092 / 91, which guarantees legally-binding standards of food saftey and quality to EU consumers, and according to the Austian Alimentari Codex. Since January 1998, all monitoring/certifying bodies in Austria must verify accreditation according to rgulation European Norm 45011. The major supermarket chain offers a variety of organic dairy and meat products, as well as organic ice cream, pizza, vegetables, fruits, baby foods, and bread. The <b>current</b> <b>domestic</b> wholesale <b>value</b> of organic products arketed from Austria farms is approximately 170 million US$ annually. Unfortunately, funding for support of scientific research and extension to enhance organic farming and marketing has not kept pace with the increasing number of organic farms and farmers. Additional funding is essential to ensure the sustainable development of the organic movement and the organic market...|$|R

40|$|As {{domestic}} exports usually require imported inputs, {{the value}} of exports differs from the <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added contained in exports. The higher the <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added contained in exports, the higher the domestic national income created by exports will be. In this case, exports will expand the domestic market. Therefore, exports will push economic growth in two ways: through their direct effect on aggregate demand, and through their effect on the domestic market. For these reasons, the estimate {{of the magnitude of}} the <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added contained in exports helps explain the capacity of exports to lead economic growth. Domestic exports may be classified as direct and indirect exports. Direct exports are the goods sold to other countries; indirect exports are the domestically produced inputs incorporated in direct exports. The distinction between direct and indirect exports leads to a distinction between direct and indirect <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added contained in exports. The income of the factors directly involved in the production of exports constitutes direct <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added; the income contained in domestically produced inputs incorporated into exports constitutes the indirect <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added. Therefore, the magnitude of indirect value added depends on the density of the domestic intersectorial linkages. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an estimation of the <b>domestic</b> indirect <b>value</b> added contained in Mexico's manufacturing exports in two ways. The first derives from the fact that a direct exporting sector may be the vehicle through which other sectors export in an indirect way; this leads us to estimate the indirect value added contained in exports by sector of origin. The second refers to the destination of this indirect value added - that is, to the direct exporting sectors in which the value added contained in indirect exports of each sector appears. Based on the input-output table for Mexico (National Institute of Statistics and Geography-INEGI 2008), we estimate the <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added contained in inputs used to produce Mexican manufacturing exports. We show separately the <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added from maquiladora exports and from exports produced by the rest of the manufacturing sector. In order to distinguish the indirect value added in exports by sector of origin and destination of the intermediate inputs, we work with square matrices of indirect domestic value-added multipliers...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{perception}} that Mexico's insertion in global supply chains has been mostly in assembly operations and that efforts {{should be made to}} incorporate additional <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> in the international production networks in which the country participates. To examine this issue properly one needs to have a measure of the share of <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added that is effectively embodied in Mexico's exports. We analyze firm-level data from the IMMEX census which covers all the firms that benefit from the Maquiladora and the PITEX programs. We find that the share of <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added as a proportion of the firm's exports has been declining in the last 6 years. We show that the decline is not the result of market share re-allocations; that it persists after controlling for price changes and that is observed across firms of all sizes. The results suggest that more segments of the supply chains are generally not moving into Mexico and that on the contrary there is a trend of falling <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added. This result contrasts with that of other countries engaged in similar export processing activities, like China. ...|$|R

I show that GVC participation is positively related to <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added along the value chain. However, this effect is only significant for middle- and high-income countries. Deriving novel source/destination country-specific indicators, I present evidence on theoretical transmission channels between GVCs and <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added that explain these results. More specifically, I find support for productivity enhancing effects through cost savings when richer countries source from low-wage countries. In contrast, low- and middle-income countries only benefit from technology upgrading and spillovers if they have sufficient levels of absorptive capacity...|$|R

Only younger workers might be against immigration since they will coincide with immigrants in their retirement periods.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the topic of The <b>Domestic</b> <b>value</b> added of Czech exports, its {{increasing}} {{and the role of}} the state in this process. The main focus is on the low <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added of the crucial Czech export industries that represent the core of the Czech economy. We examine the data based on TiVA methodology which is the joint OECD-WTO initiative coping with changing global trade relations. It captures not only the <b>domestic</b> <b>value</b> added but also the origin of the foreign value added embedded in domestic exports. In this context, we critically examine the low level of territorial diversification of Czech exports and outdated policies in these areas. According to the outcomes of the analysis, the Czech economy is pursuing the path from the status of a transition economy that follows foreign markets to an innovation-driven economy that shapes industries, creates new ones and specializes on activities with high value added in GVCs. The Czech Republic can become one of these innovative economies only if it reviews its comparative advantages and adopts sound policies...|$|R

Over the past two decades, Central American countries have experienced significant export growth. Yet exports have not been an engine of sustained economic growth and employment generation.

In addition, we show that the PRC's processing exports demonstrate significant heterogeneity across its trading partners; processing exports account for a large portion of total exports to high income countries but a relatively small portion of exports to low income countries.
