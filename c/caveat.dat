This <b>caveat</b> was a compromise introduced on the third reading of the bill; the Commons had provided that no support could be given for a person under sixteen at all, and the Lords wished to remove this restriction. The compromise was to state that no support could come from Parliamentary funds, but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|Xenon {{can also}} form endohedral {{fullerene}} compounds, where a xenon atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. The xenon atom {{trapped in the}} fullerene can be observed by 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These observations are not without <b>caveat,</b> however, because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Caveats</b> {{are also}} applied in Iraq. According {{to an article}} written by Major General Rick Lynch and Lieutenant Colonel Phillip D. Janzen, US Army, [...] "National <b>caveats</b> on {{personnel}} participating in NATO-led operations are not a new challenge. Lessons learned from operations in the Balkans often emphasize the impact of <b>caveats</b> on that mission. Nations contributing personnel to the NATO Training Mission - Iraq (NTM-I) also apply operational <b>caveats</b> to their force offerings, to include restrictions on the place of duty and length of deployment. Operational impacts from <b>caveats</b> are countless but include restricting force protection troops from securing vehicle convoys. Another case involves limiting personnel to duty in Baghdad's International Zone." ...|$|R
40|$|Exaggerated or simplistic news {{is often}} blamed for {{adversely}} influencing public health. However, recent findings suggested many exaggerations were already present in university press releases, which scientists approve. Surprisingly, these exaggerations were {{not associated with}} more news coverage. Here we test whether these two controversial results also arise in press releases from prominent science and medical journals. We then investigate the influence of mitigating <b>caveats</b> in press releases, to test assumptions that <b>caveats</b> harm news interest or are ignored. Using quantitative content analysis, we analyzed press releases (N = 534) on biomedical and health-related science issued by leading peer-reviewed journals. We similarly analysed the associated peer-reviewed papers (N = 534) and news stories (N = 582). Main outcome measures were advice to readers and causal statements drawn from correlational research. Exaggerations in press releases predicted exaggerations in news (odds ratios 2. 4 and 10. 9, 95 % CIs 1. 3 to 4. 5 and 3. 9 to 30. 1) but were not associated with increased news coverage, consistent with previous findings. Combining datasets from universities and journals (996 press releases, 1250 news), we found that when <b>caveats</b> appeared in press releases there was no reduction in journalistic uptake, {{but there was a}} clear increase in <b>caveats</b> in news (odds ratios 9. 6 and 9. 5 for <b>caveats</b> for advice and causal claims, CIs 4. 1 to 24. 3 and 6. 0 to 15. 2). The main study limitation is its retrospective correlational nature. For health and science news directly inspired by press releases, the main source of both exaggerations and <b>caveats</b> appears to be the press release itself. However we find no evidence that exaggerations increase, or <b>caveats</b> decrease, the likelihood of news coverage. These findings should be encouraging for press officers and scientists who wish to minimise exaggeration and include <b>caveats</b> in their press releases...|$|R

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the <b>caveat</b> that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human angler. Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E
5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the <b>caveat</b> that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the <b>caveat</b> that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E

5|$|Major {{public works}} {{projects}} financed with deficit spending included {{the construction of a}} network of Autobahns and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements. To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The <b>caveat</b> that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the <b>caveat</b> that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The Badminton World Federation (BWF) rankings {{are used}} to {{determine}} the qualification of the players for the tournament. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, each singles tournament had 38 competitors, while each doubles tournament had 16 pairs. All players or pairs from the top 16 places on the BWF rankings automatically qualify, although each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can send less than three players or pairs in each tournament. The top 64 then qualify with the <b>caveat</b> that each NOC can send only two players/pairs from that portion of the list. Players and pairs ranked below the 64th place only qualify if they are the highest-ranked competitor from their nation. Two places each in the men's and women's singles will be determined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Tripartite Commission. The host nation, if it has not already qualified two competitors, receives at least either two singles players or one pair. The rules used in the tournament are the same as the BWF rules.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols {{executed}} Mstislav of Kiev and the Kievan nobles {{with the}} traditional Mongol <b>caveat</b> reserved for royalty and nobility: without shedding blood. Mstislav and his nobles were buried and suffocated under the Mongol general's victory platform at the victory feast. Meanwhile, Mstislav the Bold managed to reach {{the western side of}} the Dnieper with what remained of his army. To stop the Mongols from crossing to the western side of the Dnieper, Mstislav destroyed all the boats he could find.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 122* Hector Hugh Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 84. After the battle, the people of Rus trembled in fear of this unknown scourge who had emerged from the frontier and destroyed the flower of their army. However, the Mongols were not there to conquer, and merely marched east after plundering.|$|E
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about Davies's date of birth. Most records say November 1886, though usually with the <b>caveat</b> {{that he might}} have been born several years earlier. His birthplace was 39 John Street, Abercwmboi (then known as Cap Coch) in the South Wales coalfields, the fourth child of Thomas Davies and his wife Esther. Thomas was a miner and trade union activist, who under the pseudonym Y Llwynog ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper Tarian y Gweithiwr ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners, and after spells of unemployment he eventually found work as an insurance agent.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William's {{excise tax}} (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the <b>caveat</b> that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the patrol}} boats of Squadron One were an {{essential}} part of the blockade of war supplies entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam, it was decided that they would be transferred to the South Vietnamese navy after crews had been trained to operate them effectively. On 2 November 1968, Zumwalt, Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam, presented a plan to General Creighton W. Abrams, Commander, MACV to turn over all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard resources to the RVN by 30 June 1970. Abrams approved the Navy's plan with the <b>caveat</b> that any equipment turned over to the Vietnamese would have to be in first-class condition and that they would have to be properly trained in its use. The Navy plan called for the enlisted Vietnamese personnel to report aboard vessels for training first with the officers finally reporting aboard after the crews were trained. In a recommendation made 14 January 1969, the Commander, Coast Guard Activities Vietnam, Captain Ralph W. Niesz, suggested that English speaking Vietnamese officers report aboard first and be given the chance to receive extensive procedural training with Coast Guard crews before any junior personnel report aboard. Neisz cited cultural imperatives that required seniors to be more knowledgeable than subordinates and that it would be very difficult for officers to accept instruction from junior personnel without losing face. Zumwalt agreed with the Coast Guard plan enthusiastically and ordered it implemented immediately.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} story, Gray's <b>caveat</b> {{was taken to the}} US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application.

Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's <b>caveat</b> was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his <b>caveat</b> and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.|$|E
