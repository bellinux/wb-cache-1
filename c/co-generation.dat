25|$|UTC Power was {{the first}} company to {{manufacture}} and commercialize a large, stationary fuel cell system {{for use as a}} <b>co-generation</b> power plant in hospitals, universities and large office buildings.|$|E
25|$|The amount {{supplied}} {{to the final}} consumer was 1,445,285 ktoe (16,430 TWh) which was 33% of the total energy consumed at power plants and heat and power <b>co-generation</b> (CHP) plants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Co-generation</b> {{systems can}} reach 85% {{efficiency}} (40–60% electric + remainder as thermal). Phosphoric-acid fuel cells (PAFC) comprise the largest segment of existing CHP products worldwide and can provide combined efficiencies close to 90%. Molten Carbonate (MCFC) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) {{are also used}} for {{combined heat and power}} generation and have electrical energy efficiences around 60%. Disadvantages of <b>co-generation</b> systems include slow ramping up and down rates, high cost and short lifetime. Also their need to have a hot water storage tank to smooth out the thermal heat production was a serious disadvantage in the domestic market place where space in domestic properties is at a great premium.|$|E
25|$|Electricity output (gross) was 1,735,579 ktoe (20,185 TWh), {{efficiency}} was 39%, and {{the balance}} of 61% was generated heat. A small part (145,141 ktoe, which was 3% of the input total) of the heat was utilized at <b>co-generation</b> heat and power plants. The in-house consumption of electricity and power transmission losses were 289,681 ktoe.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{sources in}} use for various {{district}} heating systems include: power plants designed for {{combined heat and power}} (CHP, also called <b>co-generation),</b> including both combustion {{and nuclear power}} plants; and simple combustion of a fossil fuel or biomass; geothermal heat; solar heat; industrial heat pumps which extract heat from seawater, river or lake water, sewage, or waste heat from industrial processes.|$|E
25|$|In {{industrial}} production, some lignocellulosic residue remains {{after the}} removal of the furfural. This residue is dried and burned to provide steam for the operation of the furfural plant. Newer and more energy efficient plants have excess residue, which is or can be used for <b>co-generation</b> of electricity, cattle feed, activated carbon, mulch/fertiliser, etc. It also {{has been used as a}} glue extender in the North American board industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy of}} a thermal power station not {{utilized}} in power production must leave the plant {{in the form of}} heat to the environment. This waste heat can go through a condenser and be disposed of with cooling water or in cooling towers. If the waste heat is instead utilized for district heating, it is called <b>co-generation.</b> An important class of thermal power station are associated with desalination facilities; these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of natural gas and in these plants, freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003 the Ministry of Water and Electricity (MOWE) is {{responsible}} for policy and regulation of water and sanitation services. There is no separate regulatory agency for the sector. The recently established Electricity and <b>Co-generation</b> Regulatory Authority (ECRA) only regulates privately owned desalination plants. The functions of the Ministry of Agriculture overlap with those of MOWE, since agriculture {{is by far the}} main water user in the country and contributes in the depletion of fossil aquifers on which a large share of the country’s drinking water supply depends. There is also some overlap between the two Ministries in the area of wastewater reuse. There is no Ministry of Environment in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, 11.4% of {{the heat}} supply in Estonia was {{generated}} by direct combustion of oil shale and 5.88% by combustion of shale oil. Shale oil {{was used as a}} fuel by 9.36% of all boiler houses in Estonia. [...] Heat produced by <b>co-generation</b> at the Balti Power Station is used for district heating of Narva, the third largest city in Estonia with 58,700 inhabitants (2013). The <b>co-generation</b> plants in Kohtla-Järve, Sillamäe, and Kiviõli burn oil shale to produce electrical power and supply district heating to nearby towns. In addition to raw oil shale, the Kohtla-Järve Power Station uses oil shale gas, a by-product of shale oil production, for the same purposes.|$|E
500|$|Dow ceased {{operations}} at its Sarnia site in 2009. The plant was decommissioned, {{and the land}} has been sold to neighbouring TransAlta Energy Corporation. TransAlta produces power and steam for industry, and is the largest natural gas <b>co-generation</b> plant in Canada. It has created the Bluewater Energy Park on the former Dow site. Lanxess produces more than [...] of butyl rubber annually at its Sarnia location, and is the sole producer of regulatory-approved, food-grade butyl rubber, used {{in the manufacture of}} chewing gum. [...] Within the boundaries of its Sarnia plant Lanxess has also created the Bio-industrial Park Sarnia.|$|E
2500|$|As in October 2006, the Ontario Power Authority signed {{contacts}} with seven high-efficiency <b>co-generation</b> projects across Ontario, with combined capacity of 414 megawatts. [...] All {{of the plants}} are expected to come online by May 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Considered {{perhaps the}} [...] "greenest" [...] mayor in the United States, Anderson gained {{international}} renown for his Salt Lake City Green Program – a comprehensive {{effort to improve}} sustainability and reduce the City's environmental footprint – which achieved a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from municipal operations in just 3 years. Elements of the program, which Anderson described as covering [...] "everything from dog waste to nuclear waste”, included initiatives to improve {{the efficiency of the}} City’s fleet and use of electricity, measures to make Salt Lake City more bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly, and <b>co-generation</b> plants at the City's landfill and wastewater treatment facilities that recapture methane to generate electricity.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all coal, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, {{solar thermal}} electric, and waste {{incineration}} plants, {{as well as}} many natural gas power stations are thermal. Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers. [...] The waste heat from a gas turbine, in the form of hot exhaust gas, can be used to raise steam, by passing this gas through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) the steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency. Power stations burning coal, fuel oil, or natural gas are often called fossil-fuel power stations. [...] Some biomass-fueled thermal power stations have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power stations, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use <b>co-generation</b> are sometimes referred to as conventional power stations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conglomerate}} operates {{with considerable}} latitude which the Irving family's wealth permits—operating somewhat as a maverick to the consternation {{of many of}} Central and Western Canada's business leaders. Irving Oil, J.D. Irving and all subsidiary companies are actively supporting Canada's ratification and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, since the family has invested considerable funds into environmental controls and alternative energy for its operations and wishes to capitalize on these investments at the expense of its slow-to-respond publicly traded competitors. [...] J.D. Irving's food processing plants in Prince Edward Island are looking to build one of the largest wind farms in Canada in that province to completely power their operations, and many Irving-owned sawmills and factories in the rest of northeastern North America are rapidly adopting <b>co-generation,</b> bio-gas and solar/wind power to complement current energy usage.|$|E
