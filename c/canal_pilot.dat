50|$|The Gold Crew {{relieved}} the Blue Crew, {{and spent}} the next few weeks in Honolulu giving the people of Hawaii the opportunity to go aboard and see the submarine named in honor of the King of Hawaii. In early June 1970, with the Gold Crew operating the boat, Kam got underway for Charleston, South Carolina, via the Panama Canal, for duty with Submarine Squadron 18, based at Charleston. The submerged transit to the canal took about seven days, and upon arrival off the coast of Panama, Kam surfaced and was met by the Panama <b>Canal</b> <b>pilot</b> who would take her through. The passage through the Panama Canal was given priority by the Canal authorities, and little time was spent waiting to enter. The boat was the object of considerable curiosity from those on ships nearby, and from the onlookers ashore. Once clear of the canal, Kam again submerged and began the final leg of the transit, passing through the Caribbean and out into the Atlantic.|$|E

5000|$|The Leans is {{the most}} common type of spatial {{disorientation}} for aviators. Through stabilization of the fluid in the semicircular <b>canals,</b> a <b>pilot</b> may perceive straight and level flight when in actuality the plane will be in a balanced turn - Banked turn. This is caused by a quick return to level flight after a gradual, prolonged turn that the pilot failed to notice. The phenomenon consists of a false perception of angular displacement about the roll axis and therefore becomes an illusion of bank. This illusion is often associated with a vestibulospinal reflex that results in the pilot actually leaning in the direction of the falsely perceived vertical. Other common explanations of the leans are due to deficiencies of both otolith-organ and semicircular-duct sensory mechanisms.|$|R

[...] She was a refrigerated vessel, designed to carry frozen meat and live cattle, and was claimed {{to be one of}} the largest meat-carrying ships then afloat. She made a successful maiden voyage from Canada and up the new canal to Manchester, taking two days and stopping overnight at Irlam to give the crew a rest. The Manchester Guardian reported on 16 January 1899 that [...] "there were many shakings of the head, not only in Liverpool, at the audacity of the attempt" [...] and that [...] "the <b>canal</b> <b>pilots,</b> on reaching Irlam, looked as if they had not been in bed for a week, as their eyes were bleared with exhaustion". The City discharged 450cattle and 150sheep at Manchester Corporation's Foreign Animals Wharf near the Mode Wheel locks in Salford. With an overall length of , she was by far the largest vessel to have ventured up the waterway, and her successful navigation disproved the claim of Liverpool owners that only ships of [...] or less could safely reach Manchester. The vessel continued to Manchester docks for further unloading, where she was met by the Lord Mayor, accompanied by a band and a festive crowd. This successful voyage did much to encourage other shipowners to use the new port. On her first voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia in March 1899, the City took nine days and sixteen hours; and arrived before the mail boat, which had left the Mersey twelve hours ahead of her.|$|R

We studied {{the impact of}} two surface types, machined and electropolished, of ProTaper shaping files on torque and force during simulated root <b>canal</b> preparation. <b>Pilot</b> holes of 0. 5 -mm diameter were drilled perpendicularly through 3 -mm thick human dentin discs and served as standardized simulated root canals (SSRCs). A total of 300 SSRCs were prepared with ProTaper Sx, S 1, and S 2 instruments using an automated testing platform. Maximum torque (in Ncm) and maximum force values (in N) were measured. In three experimental groups (Sx, S 1, and S 2) preparation of SSRCs was performed using electropolished versus machined instruments in the same dentin disc. For all three tested instruments, peak torque was higher for electropolished files; apically exerted forces were similar, except for Sx, in which machined instruments developed higher forces. We conclude that surface treatment by electropolishing alters the cutting ability of nickel-titanium rotary instruments...|$|R

40|$|The Port of Ghent (Belgium) is {{connected}} to the Scheldt Estuary by the Maritime Canal Ghent-Terneuzen (Fig- 1). The canal has a length of 32 km, 15. 5 km of which are located on Dutch territory. Originally, this canal was designed for 30 000 tdw vessels, but nowadays 80 000 tdw ships are allowed, provided that their dimensions do not exceed 256 m of length over all, 34 m of beam and 12. 25 m of draught. The Port of Ghent strongly insists on increasing the maximum allowed ship's length to 265 m, so that the Port would be accessible for all Panamax sized vessels. The passage of such ships through the lock at Terneuzen should not raise any major technical problems. There were fears that passage of longer vessels might cause problems due to the limited available width, especially at Sluiskil and at Sas van Gent where ships have to pass two long bends with a radius of 3000 m. Another reason for concern is the passage of three bridges. A Committee of Dutch and Flemish Waterways and Marine Affairs Administrations agreed that a risk analysis was required in order to evaluate the differences in risk caused by allowing longer Panamax sized vessels (L OA = 265 m, B = 32. 2 m, T = 12. 25 m) to the canal. This Study was performed by Flanders Hydraulics, a research laboratory of the Ministry of the Flemish Community (Department of Environment and infrastructure) The work reported here involved: • Systematic captive motion tests in the shallow water towing tank at Flanders' Hydraulics on three ship models, in open shallow water and in restricted water including a cross-section of the canal and a scale model of the geometry of the bends. • Development of suitable mathematical models of the hydrodynamic forces for the three ships in open water and in the canal • Comparison of the behaviour of the wee ships sailing along the canal through fast-time simulation. An autopilot, based on a cost-function concept, was used to perform the manoeuvring as it was expected that the: variance between different pilots would mask differences between ships. Attention was paid to construct an auto-pilot unbiased with respect to the ship length. • Evaluation {{of the results of the}} fast-time simulation • Validation of the autopilot runs through real-time simulation by experienced Terneuzen-Ghent <b>Canal</b> <b>pilots</b> on Flanders' Hydraulics manoeuvring simulato...|$|R

40|$|Pulse oximetry {{has become}} a {{standard}} for patient monitoring in the operating room, and the finger {{is the most common}} site used for monitoring blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2). However, SpO 2 measurements made from extremities such as the finger, ear lobe and toes become susceptible to inaccuracies, when patients become hypothermic, hypovolemic and vasoconstrictive. This is due to the week arterial pulsations detected in these conditions. To overcome this limitation, the external auditory canal has been proposed as an alternative monitoring site for estimating SpO 2, on the hypothesis that this central site will be better perfused. A dual wavelength optoelectronic sensor along with a processing system was developed to investigate the suitability of measuring photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals and SpO 2 values in the human auditory <b>canal.</b> A <b>pilot</b> study was conducted on 12 healthy volunteers to validate the developed sensor.

5000|$|At {{the same}} time the land {{operation}} was concluding, a water clearance operation called [...] "Nimbus Moon (Water)" [...] was underway. It continued to run until the end of 1974and, at a much reduced rate, on into 1975. In [...] ""Nimbus Moon (Water)", U.S. Navy EOD divers were to provide both diving and explosives training to Egyptian Navymen. While the Americans were prohibited from actual ordnance operations, they accompanied the Egyptians in the diving boats, serving as on-scene advisors. The canal was searched from bank to bank by an American sonar installed in a Suez <b>Canal</b> Authority <b>pilot</b> boat. Linked with a precise radio navigation system, the sonar made highly accurate charts of the canal bottom. These charts were given to the diving advisors, who directed the Egyptians in systematic investigations of likely ordnance contacts. The ordnance that was discovered, ranging from hand grenades to 907 kg bombs, was usually destroyed in place with explosive charges. Non-ordnance items, from oil drums to tanks, were marked for later removal by Egyptian police divers. Because the canal was slated for future dredging, every piece of refuse of any substantial size had to be removed. The American-Egyptian team completed one full sweep of the canal bottom in late November 1974.|$|R
25|$|In 1972, Mubarak became Commander of the Air Force and Egyptian Deputy Minister of Defense.

Mubarak was credited in some publications for Egypt's initial strong performance in the war. The Egyptian analyst Mohamed Hassanein Heikal said the Air Force played a mostly psychological role in the war, providing an inspirational sight for the Egyptian ground troops who carried out the crossing of the Suez Canal, rather than for any military necessity. However Mubarak's influence was also disputed by Shahdan El-Shazli, the daughter of the former Egyptian military Chief of Staff Saad el-Shazly. She said Mubarak exaggerated his role in the 1973 war. In an interview with the Egyptian independent newspaper Almasry Alyoum (26 February 2011), El-Shazli said Mubarak altered documents to take credit from her father for the initial success of the Egyptian forces in 1973. She also said photographs pertaining to the discussions in the military command room were altered and Saad El-Shazli was erased and replaced with Mubarak. She stated she intends to take legal action.|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the development of a distributed LQG controller for a water delivery canal. The control structure proposed relies on a set o LQG control agents interconnected through a communication network. Each of these local control agents controls a canal reach made of a pool and the corresponding downstream gate and receives information (output signal and control moves) only from the corresponding canal reach and the ones that are adjacent to it. An algorithm is proposed to achieve coordinated action of the different local control agents. This distributed control structure is compared with centralized multivariable LQG control. Several aspects with incidence on performance are addressed, including the modification of the quadratic cost to ensure a constraint on closed-loop poles, the use of a nonlinear filter to limit noise effects and the impact of a quantization commonly forced in gate position. Experimental results obtained in a <b>pilot</b> <b>canal</b> are presented...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing fault tolerant controllers for a water delivery canal that tackle actuators faults. The type of faults considered consists of blocking {{of one of the}} gates. The detection of the fault is made by comparing the gate position command with the actual (measured) gate position. Both centralized and distributed controllers are made for local upstream water level control. Centralized controllers are multivariable LQG-LTR controllers that use a model of the system with all the available manipulated inputs (gate positions) and all the available outputs (pool levels). Initially, three gates and three pools are controlled. After the fault detection, the controller is reconfigured to use the only two still operating gates and the corresponding two pool water levels. Distributed control uses local (SISO) LQG-LTR controllers that negotiate with their neighbors in order to be coordinated. When a fault occurs, this negotiation takes place only among the controllers connected to the actuators that are not in a fault state.

Good quality baseline PPG signals with high signal-to-noise ratio were obtained from the EC, the LIF and the RIF sensors. During the ice water immersion, significant differences in the amplitude of the red and infrared PPG signals were observed from the RIF and the LIF sensors. The average drop in amplitude of red and infrared PPG signals from the RIF was 52. 7 % and 58. 3 %. Similarly, the LIF PPG signal amplitudes have reduced by 47. 52 % and 46. 8 % respectively. In contrast, no significant changes were seen in the red and infrared EC PPG amplitude measurements, which changed by + 2. 5 % and - 1. 2 % respectively. The RIF and LIF pulse oximeters have failed to estimate accurate SpO 2 in seven and four volunteers respectively, while the EC pulse oximeter has only failed in one volunteer. These results suggest that the EC may be a suitable site for reliable monitoring of PPGs and SpO 2 s even in the presence of peripheral vasoconstriction...|$|R
