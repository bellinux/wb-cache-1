40|$|Abstract: Studies {{were carried}} out to {{determine}} the suitability of a coagulating preparation, Rhizomucor proteinase, obtained from Rhizomucor miehei for production of Camembert, Edam and Cheddar cheeses. While analyzing the cheese-making process, {{it was found that}} the obtained preparation could be used in the production of high quality cheeses without the need for changing the established technological parameters. In cheeses produced with Rhizomucor proteinase, proteolysis and lipolysis was more intense than in renin cheeses- which has a beneficial effect on cheese sensory properties. Lower utilization of milk nitrogen compounds and fat encourages further studies into the application of the obtained preparation in combination with other coagulating enzymes.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between product quality (as indicated by unit value) and export performance, both measured in absolute (per capita) and relative terms, is investigated. Five EU countries (DE, UK, FR, ES, IT), three product categories (<b>cheese,</b> meat <b>preparations</b> and wine), three export destinations (intra EU, extra EU and world) and two time periods (1995 - 1999 and 2000 - 201) are analysed. The estimation {{results show that}} the connection between quality and export performance is positive for Italy, Spain and France but depends on the product category (but not on the period), and differs (but not in all cases) according to the export destination. While the signs of the estimated slope coefficients are stable, the obtained statistical significance levels for these parameters depend on the measure used (relative or absolute) and on the estimation method (OLS or GLS). The main implication arising from this analysis is that it may be justified to introduce 'marketing of high-quality products' as a new academic discipline, teaching students and professionals in it and thus to contribute to the enhancement of EU agribusiness competitiveness in increasingly liberalised markets.

40|$|The {{buffering}} capacity of milk products {{is an important}} physico-chemical characteristic that corresponds {{to the ability of}} the product to be acidified or alkalinized. The parameters of this value depend on several compositional factors including small constituents (inorganic phosphate, citrate, organic acids) and milk proteins (caseins and whey proteins). Natural and induced variations in the composition of milk affect this physico-chemical parameter. Thus, some technological treatments and physico-chemical changes, such as heat treatment, membrane separation technology, high-pressure treatment and salt addition, result in a {{buffering capacity}} specific to the transformed product (heated milk, retentate, fermented milk). In <b>cheese</b> manufacture, the <b>preparation</b> of <b>cheese</b> milk and the cheesemaking parameters have major influences on the buffering capacity of the curd at mould removal and during ripening.

40|$|Changes in the physico-chemical {{properties}} and microstructure of milk fat globules were investigated during the manufacture and ripening of Emmental cheese. The measurement of fat globule size and apparent zeta-potential showed {{that they were}} slightly affected during <b>cheese</b> milk <b>preparation,</b> i. e. storage of cheese milk overnight at 4 °C and pasteurisation. After rennet-induced coagulation and heating of curd grains, coalescence caused the formation of large fat globules (i. e. > 10 μm). The structure of fat in Emmental cheese was characterised in situ using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The rennet-induced coagulation lead {{to the formation of}} a continuous network of casein strands in which fat globules of various sizes were entrapped. Heating of curd grains induced the formation of fat globule aggregates. Pressing of the curd grains resulted in the greatest disruption of milk fat globules, their coalescence, the formation of non-globular fat (free fat) and the release of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) material. This study showed that milk fat exists in three main forms in ripened Emmental cheese: (i) small fat globules enveloped by the MFGM; (ii) aggregates of partially disrupted fat globules and (iii) free fat, resulting from the disruption of the MFGM and allowing free triacylglycerols to fill voids in the protein matrix. The curd grain junctions formed in Emmental cheese were also characterised using CLSM: they are compact structures, rich in protein and devoid of fat globules...|$|R

30|$|Microorganisms produce various enzymes and {{antimicrobial}} agents potentially useful in agriculture, the chemical industry, and {{both human and}} veterinary medicine (Daniel 2004). Among these are proteases, ubiquitous enzymes playing vital roles in most cellular processes, being required mainly for protein turnover and maturation and also for nutrition (Rao et al. 1998). As their ability to hydrolyse the peptide bonds of various proteinaceous substrates has attracted the interest of industrialists in several fields, proteases {{are among the most}} important enzymes in industrial use. The alkaline proteases used in the detergent industry represent the largest share of the protease market. They are present mainly in laundry detergents, where they help remove protein stains such as blood, grass, or milk from clothing. They also find various applications in the leather, photographic, and pharmaceutical industries and in the management of industrial and household wastes. Furthermore, they are widely used in the food industry, notably for <b>cheese</b> making, baking, <b>preparation</b> of soy hydrolysates, and meat tenderizing (Fujinami and Fujisawa 2010; Gupta et al. 2002; Rao et al. 1998; Saeki et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Surface {{proteins}} are key actors of {{the complex}} interactions between bacteria (pathogens, commensals or symbionts) and their host. In beneficial (probiotic) bacteria, they participate in competition with pathogens, adhesion to the host cells, and immunomodulation. We investigated such proteins in the beneficial bacterium Propionibacterium freudenreichii, consumed both in Swiss-type <b>cheeses</b> and probiotic <b>preparations.</b> P. freudenreichii genome was sequenced and annotated, the localization of the encoded proteins was predicted using SurfG+. A combination of 3 biochemical methods confirmed surface exposure of P. freudenreichii proteins: shedding, shaving and labelling. Shedding consisted in the extraction of cell-wall associated proteins using guanidine, followed by trypsinolysis of the extracted proteins. Shaving consisted in enzymatic hydrolysis of surface protruding proteins which were accessible to trypsin in situ on live bacteria. For labeling, an NHS-ester-cyanine was added to live bacteria in order to label surface proteins, prior to 2 -D electrophoresis and detection of fluorescent protein spots. For the 3 methods, the resulting tryptic peptides were identified by NanoLC-MS/MS on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer This combination of methods allowed identification of surface layer type-proteins, lipoproteins, proteins associated to the cell wall, to the membrane, or predicted to be secreted, as well as moonlighting proteins predicted to be cytoplasmic. Some of these proteins are known to participate in adhesion and in the modulation of the immune response by probiotics. This work constitutes a decisive step in the elucidation of P. freudenreichii ability to interact with host cells and {{in the understanding of}} protein sorting in this bacterium...|$|R
40|$|Background:Propioni{{bacterium}} freudenreichii is a {{food grade}} bacterium consumed both in <b>cheeses</b> and inprobiotic <b>preparations.</b> Its promising probiotic potential, relying {{largely on the}} active release of beneficialmetabolites within the gut {{as well as the}} expression of key surface proteins involved in immunomodulation,deserves to be explored more deeply. Adaptation to the colon environment is requisite for the active release ofpropionibacterial beneficial metabolites and constitutes a bottleneck for metabolic activity in vivo. Mechanismsallowing P. freudenreichii to adapt to digestive stresses have been only studied in vitro so far. Our aim wastherefore to study P. freudenreichii metabolic adaptation to intra-colonic conditions in situ. Results:We maintained a pure culture of the type strain P. freudenreichii CIRM BIA 1, contained in a dialysis bag,within the colon of vigilant piglets during 24 hours. A transcriptomic analysis compared gene expression to identify the metabolic pathways induced by this environment, versus control cultures maintained in spentculture medium. We observed drastic changes in the catabolism of sugars a nd amino-acids. Glycolysis, the Wood-Werkman cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation pathways were down catabolisms and alternative pathways were induced to produce NADH, NADPH, ATP and precursors (utilizing of propanediol, gluconate, lactate, purine and pyrimidine and amino-acids). Genes involved in stress response were down-regulated and genes specifically expresse d during cell division were induced, suggesting that P. freudenreichii adapted its metabolism to the conditions encountered in the colon. Conclusions:This study constitutes the first molecular demonstration of P. freudenreichii activity and physiological adaptationin vivo within the colon. Our data are likely specific to our pig microbiota composition but opens an avenue towards understanding probiotic action within the gut in further studies comparing bacterial adaptation to different microbiot...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Santo Giorno cheese, {{obtained}} from raw milk and selected autochthonous starters, {{is emerging as}} the newest typical food product from the Southwestern region of Paraná, Brazil. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the acceptance of the cheese with two ripening times of 60 and 180 days, produced in two dairy factories, testing two starters and two preservatives. Subjective sensory evaluation was applied using 129 consumers and hedonic scales for the attributes and for purchasing intent. A questionnaire involving the rate of cheese consumption was also used. The results suggested good reproducibility of the <b>cheese</b> <b>preparation</b> by the dairy factories, with no significant differences between the type of preservative used and the suitability of the two types of starter tested. An inverse relationship between hedonic scores for attributes (appearance, color, odor, texture, flavor) and ripening time was observed, except for texture. By applying multinomial logistic regression and a box plot analysis, a significant effect of age on cheese purchasing intent was verified, with a mean acceptance rate of 87. 8 % for 60 days ageing and 81. 8 % for 180 days ageing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Moderate {{and high}} {{humidity}} cheeses {{are described as}} important vehicles of pathogens in many foodborne diseases outbreaks. Microbial contamination can occur in raw material or in the different steps of the product processing due to inadequate hygiene practices. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the microbiological quality and safety in the production of moderate and high humidity cheese. Samples from raw milk, handlers’ hands surface, final product were collected in three cheese manufacturing plants located in southern Brazil, with different levels of sanitary control. Effectiveness of milk pasteurization was also evaluated. Thermotolerant coliforms, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes were evaluated. Raw milk samples showed the highest contamination levels, with enumeration of 1. 1 x 105 most probable number (MPN) mL- 1 for thermotolerant coliforms, 4 x 105 colony-forming units (CFU) mL- 1 for CPS and presence of Salmonella spp. CPS were also reported in one sample of handler’s hands surface. However, only one sample of the final product was out of Brazilian regulatory standards, exceeding the limit allowed for CPS. Milk pasteurization process used in <b>cheese</b> <b>preparation</b> was effective, regardless the level of sanitary control of the industries.

40|$|Traditionally globe {{artichoke}} and leafy cardoon have been cultivated {{for use as}} vegetables but these crops are now finding multiple new roles in applications ranging from paper production to <b>cheese</b> <b>preparation</b> and biofuel use, with interest in their functional food potential. So far, their chromosome complements have been poorly investigated and a well-defined karyotype was not available. In this paper, a detailed karyo-morphological analysis and molecular cytogenetic studies were conducted on {{globe artichoke}} (Cynara cardunculus Linnaeus, 1753 var. scolymus Fiori, 1904) and leafy cardoon (C. cardunculus Linneaus, 1753 var. altilis De Candolle, 1838). Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization In Suspension (FISHIS) was applied to nuclei suspensions as a fast method for screening of labelling probes, before metaphase spread hybridization. Classic Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on slide, using repetitive telomeric and ribosomal sequences and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) oligonucleotide as probes, identified homologous chromosome relationships and allowed development of molecular karyotypes for both varieties. The close phylogenetic relationship between {{globe artichoke and cardoon}} was supported by the very similar karyotypes but clear chromosomal structural variation was detected. In the light of the recent release of the globe artichoke genome sequencing, these results are relevant for future anchoring of the pseudomolecule sequence assemblies to specific chromosomes. In addition, the DNA content of the two crops has been determined by flow cytometry and a fast method for standard FISH on slide and methodological improvements for nuclei isolation are described...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to develop an {{original}} probiotic cheese based on the Estonian open-texture, smearripened, semisoft cheese “Pikantne. ” Cheese was produced by two methods using cheese starter cultures (Probat 505) in combination with 0. 04 % of probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum strain ME- 3 (10 9 cfu/mL) with high antimicrobial activity and antioxidative properties. The probiotic Lactobacillus was added into milk simultaneously with starter cultures (cheese A) and into drained curd (cheese B). After addition of probiotic L. fermentum ME- 3, the cheese composition, flavor, and aroma were comparable to the control cheese (score values = 4. 5, 4. 2, and 3. 7 for control cheese, cheese A, and cheese B, respectively). Cheese A, which had good sensory properties, was chosen for further testing of viability and probiotic properties. The probiotic strain was found to withstand the technological processing of cheese, surviving and sustaining moderate antimicrobial and high antioxidative activity throughout ripening and storage (the ripened cheese contained approximately 5 × 10 7 cfu/g viable ME- 3 cells), although {{the viability of the}} ME- 3 strain incorporated into the cheese showed a slight decrease between d 24 and 54 after <b>cheese</b> <b>preparation.</b> Semisoft cheese “Pikantne ” serves as a suitable carrier of antimicrobial and antioxidative L. fermentum ME- 3.

40|$|Streptococcus thermophilus is a {{thermophilic}} {{lactic acid}} bacterium used for the manufacture of yoghurt and cheese. Most strains of S. thermophilus were galactose negative (Gal-) due to the weak induction of gal operon. Galactose positive (Gal+) strains can be exploited in reducing problems like browning of Mozzarella cheese. In this study, six galactose positive lactic Streptococcus spp. submitted to National Collection of Dairy Cultures (NCDC) were screened for galactose fermentation and characterized. Out of six isolates, four isolates namely NCDC 659, NCDC 660, NCDC 527, NCDC 661, were confirmed as S. thermophilus by phenetic and molecular methods. Galactose fermentation of these isolates in J 8 broth containing 1 % galactose revealed that NCDC 659 utilized 0. 44 % of galactose, followed by NCDC 661 (0. 36 %), and NCDC 660 (0. 29 %). In milk fermentation, NCDC 659 released less galactose (0. 24 %), followed by NCDC 661 (0. 34 %) and NCDC 660 (0. 39 %) after 8 h. Gal+ isolates exhibited enhanced stability in galactose broth than in milk after ten sub-cultures.

40|$|Generally in Macedonia keeping farm {{records and}} farm {{business}} planning {{is not often}} practiced like an ordinary activity in farming. Therefore one of the crucial things {{to do it is}} to comprise and continuously practice record keeping of farm data. The efficient and justified farm business planning should be based on farm records about the previous work of the farm, which will bring a structured approach for planning all the activities, as well as provide a good basis for attracting investors and creditors for the additional expansion of the business. Given that sheep breeding holds {{an important part of the}} livestock production in Macedonia, there is a need for adding analytical sheep enterprise budgets to support the farm business planning process at sheep farms. The aim of this research was to develop sheep enterprise budgets created on the best production practice for Macedonian conditions of breeding and test their applicability into the farm business plan model Agriwise Macedonia. The sheep budgets were composed with a process of data collecting consisted of direct farm data (for the cases), expert's consultation and relevant desk research, as well as a literature study. The aim of doing it was to attain more accurate calculations of the enterprise budgets, which will result in a more precise outcome in the farm business plan model Agriwise Macedonia. For the fulfilment of the aim of the study two types of sheep enterprise budgets were composed. One type of budgets is with the accelerating lambing system (potential) and another with the current (traditional) technology of production. The main users of the sheep enterprise budgets and the farm business planning model Agriwise Macedonia will be advisors, providing it for farmers. The budgets integrated in the Agriwise Macedonia model can be used in the teaching process as well. From the composed sheep enterprise budgets with 2009 price level it can be concluded that the traditional-cheese enterprise budget was the most profitable with 8937 MKD total income (including subsidies) per ewe and after covering 6526 MKD for direct-separate costs 1, the obtained gross margin 1 is 2411 MKD per ewe. The main reason for this outcome is the high market price of the cheese. The income from white sheep cheese is 3483 MKD per ewe, or represents 44 % of the total incomes. From the obtained results with the Agriwise Macedonia model can be concluded/suggested that for the family farms with a herd size between 200 - 500 ewes for production like most profitable is the traditional system with production of traditional white sheep cheese. These results can be even better with improvement of the conditions for <b>cheese</b> <b>preparation</b> and taking some initiatives for making a brand of traditional Macedonian white cheese. As a result it can be exported out of the country with a higher than the present price which means it will accumulate more profit. The traditional way of breeding with selling the milk as raw without processing it is not that profitable and that does not depend on the size of the flock. The accelerating lambing system with production of three lambs in 2 years from the obtained results can be recommended for a herd size above 500 ewes for production. The reason is more efficient use of the available resources, as it was tested in the case study with the agricultural company. And also confirmed with the family farm where with 260 ewes in total, it was more profitable to use only the traditional-cheese system of production With support of constant farm record keeping and the farm business model Agriwise Macedonia, these sheep budgets can be of great value for the strategic and operational planning in sheep farms in Macedonia, as well as an investment document in applying for credit or grant. That will contribute for justified future decisions in achievement of more profitable results, which will lead/contribute to a modern and competitive farm management tool in the Macedonian agriculture...|$|E
