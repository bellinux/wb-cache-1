50|$|It was {{designed}} by Ian Proctor c. 1965. It's a relatively stable cruising dinghy, and {{is equipped with a}} metal <b>centreplate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The rig is lofty, {{supported}} by standing rigging and usually by runners, and the hull is a scow with metal <b>centreplate.</b>|$|E
50|$|It has a {{heavy metal}} <b>centreplate,</b> and is {{equipped}} for pulling {{in addition to}} sailing. There is also a sculling notch on the transom.|$|E
5000|$|The {{club has}} an active racing and social program for its fleet of over 100 Classic Day Boats. These are yachts of {{a design that}} would have seemed {{familiar}} to spectators of Chichester Harbour races during the years up to the 1950s having no sheltered accommodation and having pivoting <b>centreplates.</b> They are more heavily built than a dinghy and are capable of being left on an open mooring. The club hosts its annual Classic Boat Revival for classic racing dinghies and dayboats each September which {{has been described by}} Yachts & Yachting magazine as the “premier classic small boat event in the UK” ...|$|R
50|$|Double ended open {{boat with}} a {{standing}} lug main, small offset mizzen with bumkin and a jib, a folding rudder and galvanised steel <b>centreplate.</b> An outboard motor well is incorporated on the aft port side {{to carry a}} small (2 hp) outboard motor. The forerunner to the Peterboat 4.5m.|$|E
50|$|The Wanderer has Main and Jib sails; it {{can also}} be fitted with a Spinnaker. Reefing of the main sail is by slab reefing. The jib can be fitted with a roller furling system. The boat has high {{intrinsic}} stability, and the normal wooden <b>centreplate</b> can be replaced with an 38.5 kg steel centre board which makes it even harder to capsize. The relatively light weight of the boat contributes to its ease of launching and recovery. The design allows for fitting of a long shafted outboard motor of up to 3.3 hp. There is very ample storage which includes a waterproof locker for storage of the outboard motor when not in use.|$|E
5000|$|In 1899 Shepherd {{established}} his own design office in London, based at Norfolk Street, off the Strand. During {{his early years}} in this office he designed a notable selection of larger yachts including Nereus (1899, 95' long), Coral of Cowes (1902, 98' long), and Pelagia, later renamed Diogene (1903, 92' long). Having {{established his}} 'big boat' credentials he spent the years until {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 focused mainly on mid-sized cruising sailing yachts in the range 35' to 65' in length. These were interspersed with a more varied range of boats such as Coralind (1904, a 5 ton yawl), Baby II (a racing motor boat), Thalia (1911, a wildfowling and cruising cutter) and Corona (1911, a 50'6" [...] long <b>centreplate</b> yawl which had a minimum draught of just 3'10") ...|$|E
