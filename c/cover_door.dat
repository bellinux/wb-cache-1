500|$|The B-1A's {{engine was}} {{modified}} slightly {{to produce the}} GE F101-102 for the B-1B, {{with an emphasis on}} durability, and increased efficiency. The core of this engine has since been re-used in several other engine designs, including the GE F110 which has seen use in the F-14 Tomcat, F-15K/SG variants and most recent versions of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. It is also the basis for the non-afterburning GE F118 used in the B-2 Spirit and the U-2S. [...] The F101 engine was the basis for the core of the extremely popular CFM56 civil engine, which can be found on some versions of practically every small-to-medium-sized airliner.

50|$|Two {{models of}} motor winder were produced. The {{original}} 110 Winder took 2 AA batteries and could wind through 100 cartridges of 110 film with {{one set of}} batteries. It worked only in single-shot mode. It took about 1.5 s to wind a frame. The 110 Winder II, introduced in 1982, added a continuous shooting mode and improved the battery <b>cover</b> <b>door,</b> which was fragile on the original.|$|E
50|$|The Heckler & Koch HKM4D was a {{prototype}} of the HK416 that bore heavy resemblance to a standard M4 Carbine. The weapon featured the short stroke proprietary piston system later found in the HK416. The rifle came fitted with a polymer two piece handguard, and could also fit the standard M4 Rail Integration System handguard. Two variants, one with a fixed stock and one with a collapsible stock were on display at SHOT Show 2004. These early prototypes lacked the dust <b>cover</b> <b>door</b> found on most rifles of the type.|$|E

50|$|The {{drive to}} recover scrap metal {{and a strong}} dislike of {{anything}} German in the islands saw the metalwork in the battery removed and scrapped from 1947 onwards, this included the armoured <b>cover,</b> <b>doors,</b> hoists, engines etc. with the barrels and mounts cut up in 1952/3.|$|R
5000|$|To use {{a central}} vacuum, the vacuum hose {{is taken from}} storage and fitted with any needed {{cleaning}} accessories (such as a brush). The {{other end of the}} hose is inserted into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded <b>cover</b> <b>door.</b> [...] In some designs, opening the door switches on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on. Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via wireless signaling.|$|E

50|$|U-matic is an {{analogue}} recording videocassette format first shown by Sony in prototype in October 1969, and {{introduced to the}} market in September 1971. It {{was among the first}} video formats to contain the videotape inside a cassette, as opposed to the various reel-to-reel or open-reel formats of the time. Unlike most other cassette-based tape formats, the supply and take-up reels in the cassette turn in opposite directions during playback, fast-forward, and rewind: one reel would run clockwise while the other would run counter-clockwise. A locking mechanism integral to each cassette case secures the tape hubs during transportation to keep the tape wound tightly on the hubs. Once the cassette is taken off the case, the hubs are free to spin. A spring-loaded tape <b>cover</b> <b>door</b> protects the tape from damage; when the cassette is inserted into the VCR, the door is released and is opened, enabling the VCR mechanism to spool the tape around the spinning video drum. Accidental recording is prevented by the absence of a red plastic button fitted to a hole on the bottom surface of the tape; removal of the button disabled recording.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the tests was to obtain overall {{performance}} and influencing factors as well as detailed measurements of the internal flow characteristics. The first experiment consisted of crossflow tests of a 15 -inch diameter fan installed in a two-dimensional wing. Tests were run with and without exit louvers over a range of tunnel speeds, fan speeds, and wing angle of attack. The wing was used {{for a study of}} installation effects on lift fan performance. The model tested consisted of three 5. 5 -inch diameter tip-turbine driven model VTOL lift fans mounted chord-wise in the two-dimensional wing to simulate a pod-type array. Several inlet and exit <b>cover</b> <b>door</b> configurations and an adjacent fuselage panel were tested. For the third program, a pod was attached to the wing, and an investigation was conducted of the effect of design tip speed on the aerodynamic performance and noise of a 15 -inch diameter lift fan-in-pod under static and crossflow conditions. Three single VTOL lift fan stages were designed for the same overall total pressure ratio but at three different rotor tip speeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus on}} process {{improvements}} in high performance lightweight structures is mainly located on thermoset material. Resin transfer moulding processes {{have been developed}} to decrease cost for high performance structures in competition to prepreg material. However, thermoplastic materials, such as CF/PEEK, CF/PEKK or CF/PPS, offer interesting opportunities despite the higher material cost compared to thermosets. This paper shows two examples using continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic material and the joining processes among themselves as well as to titanium in a hybrid structure design. Cost reduction is demonstrated using vacuum consolidation, special moulds and several welding techniques. The first example is a rudder from the vertical tail plane of a military aircraft. Several manufacturing steps including forming or shaping with flat plates, positioning stringers during vacuum consolidation, welding of ribs and welding of the central spar are shown. A cost statement is given analysing the overall manufacturing process. The second example shows the design study of a hybrid fan blade of an aero engine, made from titanium and CFRP part joined along an extended surface. The fan blade is a newly developed high performance blade to save weight and to increase the pressure ratio per compressor stage, so that one complete compressor stage is obsolete. A newly developed finite element model for combining titanium and CFRP is introduced and the special aspects of draping and consolidation in low cost moulds are shown. Future prospects are the integration of additional functions into the structure like lightning protection, bird impact improvement and combination of short fibre and continuous fibre material. Heated press processes during consolidating or welding are reducing cycle times. Some examples such as the man hole access <b>cover,</b> <b>door</b> frame or suspension arm in automotive application are shown with feasible process cycles. ...|$|E
