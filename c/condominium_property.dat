40|$|Cities concern {{themselves}} with the organization of space. Their principal work involves the mapping, zoning, regulating, taxing, developing, owning, protecting, patrolling, and servicing of land. As a result, cities exert considerable control over the rights of use that property owners enjoy, but they also make many uses possible through the building of infrastructure {{and the provision of}} services. However, the effects are not unidirectional; the institution of property is not simply inert clay {{in the hands of a}} city. Cities govern the actions of owners and, by extension, shape the institution of property, but this multidimensional institution is, in turn, a powerful influence on the shape and character of cities. The four papers in this “Property in the City” special issue of the UBC Law Review were part of a workshop of the same name devoted to considering the interplay of property and cities. Two of the articles—Teresa Scassa’s “Sharing Data in the Platform Economy: A Public Interest Argument for Access to Platform Data” and Elizabeth Judge and Tenille Brown’s “Pokémorials: Placing Norms in Augmented Reality”—highlight the transformative power of technological change on the institution of property and, in varying ways, on the composition of cities. The two other articles—Dorit Garfunkel’s “High-Rise Residential Condominiums and the Transformation of Private Property Governance” and Douglas Harris’s “Owning and Dissolving Strata Property”—focus on <b>condominium</b> <b>property.</b> The result is a collection of papers that begin to capture something of the constitutive power of property and of cities...|$|E
40|$|Strata or <b>condominium</b> <b>property</b> creates {{multiple}} {{privately owned}} lots or units within {{an association of}} owners. Dissolving strata property involves winding-up the association and terminating the private interests. As a result, the non-consensual dissolution of strata property involves the taking of property from those owners who oppose dissolution. The owners of individual lots become co-owners of the land formerly within the association, but the non-consenting owners have their property interests in separate lots taken from them. Beginning with the observation that non-consensual dissolution of strata property results in a taking of property, this article analyzes British Columbia’s move to facilitate non-consensual dissolution by lowering the required threshold in a dissolution vote from unanimous consent to 80 percent of owners. A supermajority of owners within strata property may now impose dissolution on a dissenting minority. The dissolution provisions in British Columbia’s Strata Property Act require court confirmation of dissolution votes and indicate that courts must consider “the {{best interests of the}} owners”, and the probability and extent of “significant unfairness” or “significant confusion and uncertainty” when determining whether or not to confirm a dissolution vote. The article predicts how courts will interpret these provisions, and it suggests how they should. It concludes by insisting that the courts recognize they will be making important decisions about the character of property when they rule in contested strata property dissolution cases, and that these decisions will {{have a significant impact on}} cities, particularly those, such as Vancouver, where strata property is increasingly prominent as a legal architecture of ownership...|$|E

The recent law regarding condominium contained in Act No 39 of 2003 has given greater powers to the management corporation and its authorities as a legal body.

As {{a result of this}} situation, many urban dwellers those living outside the capital are attracted to the city. The traffic conditions, environmental pollution around Colombo district is getting higher due to these unavoidable movements of vehicles, etc. Solutions for the situation are being implemented as part of the master plan for development of the city. Most of the suburban population who travel to Colombo daily cannot afford to build their own houses within city limits as the cost of land and cost of construction are not within their means. Purchasing an apartment on payment in instalments is an ideal alternative especially to private sector executives who travel to Colombo daily with their whole family as most such children attend prestigious schools in Colombo. The Sky Residencies high-rise building project was planned to cater to this sector of population with availability of state of the art apartments priced reasonably leading to improvement of quality of life. The Sky Residencies will be located in Buthgamuwa road Rajagiriya very close to the city of Colombo. The land area is approximately 180 perches. Sky Residencies is is planned for a height of 165 m and consist of 46 stories including 5 parking floors, 40 apartment floors and a recreational floor. This is designed to facilitate 160 apartments with the choice of 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom apartment. Sky Residencies is designed according to the green concept to achieve sustainable development.
