For very high data rates or very long distance links, a laser source may be operated continuous wave, and the light modulated by an external device, an optical modulator, such as an electro-absorption modulator or Mach-Zehnder interferometer. External modulation increases the achievable link distance by eliminating laser chirp, which broadens the linewidth of directly modulated lasers, increasing the chromatic dispersion in the fiber.

40|$|Modulation {{filtering}} is {{a technique}} for filtering slowly-varying envelopes of frequency subbands of a signal, without affecting the signal’s phase and fine-structure. <b>Coherent</b> <b>modulation</b> filtering is a promising subtype of such techniques where subband envelopes are determined through demodulation of the subband signal with a coherently detected subband carrier. In this {{paper we propose a}} <b>coherent</b> <b>modulation</b> filtering technique that detects the carriers using the frequency reassignment (FR) operator from timefrequency reassignment. We show how this technique avoids the use of finite differences in the computation of instantaneous frequency (IF), and that it estimates IF more accurately than a past technique as a result.

The relay gain is optimized {{with the objective of}} maximizing the received signal-to-noiseratio (SNR) at the destination, given that the fading statistics of the links in the cooperative system are known at the relay node. The Gaussian finite mixture is utilized to mathematically formulate, in a simple and unified way, the statistics of the received SNR at optimal power gain.

40|$|Collective {{synchronous}} {{motion of}} the phases is introduced in {{a model for the}} stochastic passive advection-diffusion of a scalar with external forcing. The model for the phase coupling dynamics follows the well known Kuramoto model paradigm of limit-cycle oscillators. The natural frequencies in the Kuramoto model are assumed to obey a given scale dependence through a dispersion relation of the drift-wave form -βk 1 +k 2, where β is a constant representing the typical strength of the gradient. The present aim is to study the importance of collective phase dynamics on the characteristic time evolution of the fluctuation energy and the formation of coherent structures. Our results show that the assumption of a fully stochastic phase state of turbulence is more relevant for high values of β, where we find that the energy spectrum follows a k- 7 / 2 scaling. Whereas for lower β there is a significant difference between a-synchronised and synchronised phase states, one could expect the formation of <b>coherent</b> <b>modulations</b> in the latter case.

40|$|The {{development}} of coherent optical networks and processing are catalysing increasing attention as solutions {{to accelerate the}} data transfer speed and data processing. Conventional technology in coherent optical networks can perform at the maximum speed of 100 Gb/s. Here we evaluate the effect of plasmonic finite response time on the coherent perfect absorption process for a plasmonic metamaterial absorber, to achieve 100 Tb/s. All-optical modulation means control of the phase or intensity of one light beam by another. In the coherent perfect absorption scenario, the interference of two counter-propagating coherent beams on a highly absorbing material of sub- wavelength thickness can either lead to nearly total transmission or to nearly total absorption of the incident light, depending on their mutual intensity and phase. We study the <b>coherent</b> <b>modulation</b> of the total energy {{as a function of}} the pulse duration, from few hundreds fs down to 6 fs. Our measurements allow us to assess the maximal bandwidth for all-optical control of femtosecond pulses, which is about 100 THz. All optical switching also eliminate the disadvantages of optical-electrical-optical conversion thus opening a road to advances in terabits per second communications for high-performance communications and computing. Our device based on coherent absorption has the advantage of being compact, intrinsically low power (as low as single photons), while demonstrating large modulations (modulation bandwidth ~ 7 : 1) and speed exceeding 100 THz has been observed.

40|$|Effect of doping on the carrier-phonon {{interaction}} in wurtzite GaN is investigated by pump-probe reflectivity measurements using 3. 1 eV light in near resonance with the fundamental band gap of 3. 39 eV. <b>Coherent</b> <b>modulations</b> of the reflectivity {{due to the}} E 2 and the A 1 (LO) modes, {{as well as the}} 2 A 1 (LO) overtone are observed. Doping of acceptor and more so for donor atoms enhances the dephasing of the polar A 1 (LO) phonon via coupling with plasmons, with the effect of donors being stronger. Doping also enhances the relative amplitude of the coherent A 1 (LO) phonon with respect to that of the high-frequency E 2 phonon, though it does not affect the relative intensity in Raman spectroscopic measurements. This enhanced coherent amplitude indicates that transient depletion field screening (TDFS), in addition to impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), contribute to generation of the coherent polar phonons even for sub-band gap excitation. Because the TDFS mechanism requires photoexcitation of carriers, we argue that the interband transition is made possible at the surface with photon energies below the bulk band gap through the Franz-Keldysh effect...|$|R

40|$|Masked {{detection}} threshold for a {{pure tone signal}} depends on the coherence of masker envelope fluctuation across frequency, with lower thresholds for coherent fluctuation under some conditions. The benefit of <b>coherent</b> masker <b>modulation</b> is larger for detection than for suprathreshold tasks, such as pure tone intensity discrimination [Hall, J. W. and Grose, J. H. (1995). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 98, 847 – 852]. In the present study, sensitivity to increments in signal intensity was measured for a 1000 -Hz signal, either a tone or a 20 -Hz-wide narrowband noise. In one set of conditions the masker was one or more bands of noise, each 20 Hz wide, and in another set of conditions the masker was a single 1620 -Hz-wide band of Gaussian noise or noise multiplied by the envelope of a 20 -Hz bandpass noise. Coherent masker envelope fluctuation improved {{detection threshold}}s in all conditions.

40|$|Accreting {{neutron stars}} (NSs) often show <b>coherent</b> <b>modulations</b> during type I X-ray bursts, called burst oscillations. We {{consider}} whether a nonradial mode {{can serve as}} an explanation for burst oscillations from those NSs that are not magnetic. We find that a surface wave in the shallow burning layer changes to a crustal interface wave as the envelope cools, a new and previously uninvestigated phenomenon. The surface modulations decrease dramatically as the mode switches, explaining why burst oscillations often disappear before burst cooling ceases. When we include rotational modifications, we find mode frequencies and drifts consistent with those observed. The large NS spin (≈ 270 − 620 Hz) needed to make this match implies that accreting NSs are spinning at frequencies ≈ 4 Hz above the burst oscillation. Since the long-term stable asymptotic frequency is set by the crustal interface wave, the observed late time frequency drifts are a probe of the composition and temperature of NS crusts. We compare our model with the observed drifts and persistent luminosities of X-ray burst sources, and find that NSs with a higher average accretion rate show smaller drifts, as we predict. Furthermore, the drift sizes are consistent with crusts composed of iron-like nuclei, as expected for {{the ashes of the}} He-rich bursts that are exhibited by these objects...|$|R
