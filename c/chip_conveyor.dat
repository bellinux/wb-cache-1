50|$|In 1994, AME {{developed}} a cost-effective pivot saw with {{the brand name}} AMSAW 200 for the US market. In 2011, AME of Rockford, IL, {{developed a}} high-efficiency carbide saw where the pivot axis of the gearbox is fixed on {{the lower end of}} the machine bed, for cutting 350 mm (14 inch) billets. The force is contained in a close loop and the machine is extremely stiff. In this machine the chip flow is also improved, as the chips are thrown directly onto the <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with cutting farm machine and it consists of three parts. Theoretical part describes mechanism of chip formation, shape of the chips, temperature of the chips, technological variables describing chips, <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor,</b> chip crusher, briquetting press and coolant filter. In the next part there is proposal of design of cutting farm machine for production cell consists of six machining center. At last part there is design proposal and calculation of <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} devided to three parts - {{theoretical}} overview of cutting farm components, design of cutting farm for specified production cell {{and the design}} of <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor</b> for specified cuting machine. Theoretical overview introduces common commercial used components of cutting farm, their properties and using possibilities in particular regarding their applicability at cutting farm design and <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor</b> design. In the second part there is proposal of design of cutting farm for production cell consist of six identical multi-function machinig centers. For produced amount of chips there is proposal of their processing from the begining at cuting proccess up to their leavig production hall as a briquetts in a containers. At last part of this project there is complete design proposal of <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor</b> for mentioned multi-function maching center. Design is built from a basic line diagram up to design of particular components including calculations and analysis...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the design {{modification}} of existing outdated <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor</b> for the lathe SPT 32 NC, owned by Slovácké strojírny OJSC factory 1 Strojírny Uherský Brod. The work is divided into acquaintance {{with the problem of}} <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor</b> and the requirements that are placed on the conveyor. The thesis summarizes possible design solutions, of which is chosen the best design solution. Followed by calculations dimensions, choice of materials and semifinished products for creating drawings. The primary input for the work is existing conveyor frame. All dimensions and functional members were chosen with regard to the parameters of the conveyor frame, which will be modified at least. The output is a complete drawing documentation and accompanying report...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the construction design of the conveyor {{selected on the basis}} of the research. The bachelor thesis describes the purpose of the <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor</b> and how it works. It is described here by which parameters the conveyor is selected, what are the types of these conveyors and the list of companies that specialize in their production. The next section describes the design of the conveyor for maximum versatility and a description of its design elements. Further, the strength calculation of the shaft and basic calculations of the other elements are made. The work is displayed in 3 D visualization and is also accompanied by drawings of important detailed drawings...|$|E
40|$|A {{new model}} for {{evaluating}} the energy consumed by a machine tool for processing a prismatic workpiece was developed. The model {{takes into account the}} energy absorbed by different machine components such as the auxiliary systems, the axes, the axes chiller, the tool change system, <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor</b> and the spindle system. The relationships between the power absorption of each considered machine component and the main cutting parameters were adequately modeled. The cutting energy was also taken into consideration. Since the wear of the tool was included in the model, the energy absorbed by the machine during passive phases (e. g. tool changes) was also evaluated. Each machine component model was opportunely configured according to the considered production phase. Some of the parameters of the machine tool energy model were identified through experimental tests performed on a real machining center equipped with linear motors. A multivariable energy optimization was carried out considering the cutting speed, the feed and the radial depth of cut as the main parameters. The energy minimization was performed through exhaustive enumeration methods. Results were properly discussed and analyzed. The optimization analysis was also repeated emulating various machine tool configurations and different production scenarios...|$|E
40|$|We were tasked by Micro-Vu to design, build, {{and test}} a {{small-scale}} low-cost metal chip separator {{to operate on}} one of their 24 / 7 mills. The goal of the project was to separate the steel and aluminum chips coming off of the mill’s <b>chip</b> <b>conveyor</b> to end up with a bin of 99 % pure aluminum by mass. To accomplish this goal we first brainstormed various possible ideas and performed small scale tests the best ones. After further review we determined the best solution to this problem was a design that involved a cycling magnetic backing that would pull steel out of the flow and drop it into a separate bin. To prove our concept we build a small scale wooden mockup. After running various tests using this mockup we determined that our design was a viable solution to the problem. We then moved on to completing our final design and building the prototype. In the end the prototype was fully functional and in testing was able to separate metal chips and achieve a separation rate of 92 - 99 % separation by mass...|$|E
