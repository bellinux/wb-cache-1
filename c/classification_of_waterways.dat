50|$|The European Conference of Ministers of Transport {{established}} in 1953 a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>waterways</b> {{that was later}} expanded {{to take into account}} the development of push-towing. Europe is a continent with a great variety of waterway characteristics, which makes this classification valuable to appreciate the different classes of waterway. There is also a remarkable variety of waterway characteristics in many countries of Asia, but there has not been any equivalent international drive for uniformity. This classification is provided by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport. A low resolution version of that map is shown here.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> European Inland <b>Waterways</b> {{is a set}} of {{standards}} for interoperability <b>of</b> large navigable <b>waterways</b> forming part <b>of</b> the Trans-European Inland Waterway network within Continental Europe and Russia.

50|$|The {{critical}} detail for the péniche is the dimension, 38.50m (126 ft) {{long and}} 5.05 m wide. They were especially {{designed for the}} Belgian and French canal locks, {{and as a result}} of the wish to maximise space for freight, the barges tend to be flat-sided, with short, rounded bows and sterns. Nowadays the specification is still applied for commercial navigation as Class I in the <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> European Inland <b>Waterways.</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} a definition <b>of</b> inland <b>waterway</b> parameters {{with the emphasis}} on the international waterway classes IV, Va and Vb relevant to the Sava River. The parameters have been defined through the comparative analysis based on international <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> inland <b>waterways,</b> the available theoretical assumptions, and available and published physical model researches. The channel parameter problems have not been considered herein. The philosophy of the applicable UN/ECE <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> 1992 consists in defining the relevant waterway structures and navigable water levels only. The waterway parameters are then determined in compliance therewith for each individual waterway based on the navigable channel morphology, through the morphological, technical and economic analysis. Through such an iterative procedure, a detailed standardization of the Sava River waterway parameters was created for the international classes IV, Va and Vb, serving as basis for the current analysis of the Sava River navigability for the purpose of gaining informative concept of the scope of water works to be executed and the financial dimension of requested works for short-term and long-term periods.

50|$|British Waterways Board was required, {{under the}} Act, to keep Commercial Waterways, {{mainly in the}} north-east, fit for {{commercial}} use; and Cruising Waterways fit for cruising. However, these obligations were subject to the caveat of being by the most economical means. There was no requirement to maintain Remainder waterways or keep them in a navigable condition; {{they were to be}} treated in the most economic way possible, which could mean abandonment. British Waterways could also change the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> an existing <b>waterway.</b> Parts, or all, <b>of</b> a Remainder <b>Waterway</b> canal, could also be transferred to local authorities, etc.; and this transfer could, as happened, allow roads and motorways to be built over them, mitigating the need to provide (expensive) accommodation bridges or aqueducts. The act also allowed local authorities to contribute to the upkeep <b>of</b> Remainder <b>Waterways.</b>|$|R

An previous version of this document has been published as the ECLAC FAL Bulletin 346 : Inland waterways classification as a tool for public policy and planning: core concepts and proposals for South America and discussed during the expert meeting on inland navigation and its role in a more sustainable use of natural resources, which was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on October 19 th 2016, back-to-back with the 9 th edition of quadrennial Conference on Coastal and Port Engineering in Developing Countries (COPEDEC).

50|$|The minimum {{technical}} characteristics for <b>waterways</b> forming part <b>of</b> the network should be those laid {{down for a}} class IV <b>waterway</b> in the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> European Inland <b>Waterways</b> (CEMT), which allows {{the passage of a}} vessel or a pushed train 80 to 85 m and 9.50 m. Where a <b>waterway</b> forming part <b>of</b> the network is modernized or constructed, the technical specifications should correspond at least to class IV, should enable class Va/Vb to be achieved at a later date, and should make satisfactory provision for the passage of vessels used for combined transport. Class Va allows the passage of a vessel or a pushed train of craft 110 m long and 11.40 m wide, and class Vb allows the passage of a pushed train of craft 172 to 185 m long and 11.40 m wide.|$|R
40|$|This joint paper, {{prepared}} by the Natural Resources and Infrastructure Division of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and experts from the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure (PIANC), looks at the benefits <b>of</b> developing a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> navigable inland <b>waterways</b> in South America. Taking the European classification system as an example, the paper demonstrates the role such a system can play in developing inland navigation and highlights {{the potential benefits of}} a South American classification system, including helping to identify and monitor the status of existing waterways; providing a basis for estimating the need for infrastructure investment; facilitating access to financing; providing a common basis for bilateral and regional agreements; and contributing to a more sustainable use <b>of</b> inland <b>waterways.</b> The paper sets out an initial classification proposal, including overall objectives and requirements in terms of quality, the technical and operational classification criteria and monitoring mechanisms. As the process for developing a South American classification system is at an early stage, the aim of the paper is to highlight any strategic and technical issues that should be examined during national and regional discussions to design and implement a regional classification for inland waterways.

A syntaxonomic <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the identified riparian forests plant communities is presented. Riparian forests in Benin belong to the Mitragynetea Schmitz 1963, which is the phytosociological class of hygrophile fresh water forests of tropical Africa. Based on similarities of ecological conditions and floristic composition, we classified the 12 plant communities into 3 orders : Alchornetalia cordifoliae Lebrun 1947, Lanneo-Pseudospondietalia Lebrun & Gilbert 1954 and Pterygotetalia Lebrun & Gilbert 195...|$|R
