5|$|By 9March1968, the U.S. {{facility}} {{on top of}} Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite {{the gravity of the}} situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of U.S. personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages. Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration. Inside the facility, U.S. technicians immediately grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, thereby abandoning the very equipment which <b>could</b> <b>enable</b> them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. technicians returned to their positions.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with malicious intent could send information that <b>could</b> <b>enable</b> human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or {{information on how}} to make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly. While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclopædia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{sound and}} music were handled by Takahiro Ogata, Masaki Kurokawa and Kenichi Tsuchiya: Ogata acted as sound director. To {{accurately}} create {{the sound of}} modern-day Tokyo within Nine, Ogata and Kurokawa went to districts such as Kichijōji and Roppongi to make recordings of ambient sounds {{at different times of}} day. While there was a general theme for various city districts, the music subtly changed depending on the player's overall alignment: for instance, to represent the Law and Chaos alignments in the game, piano was used for the former and guitar for the latter. Battle music also featured randomly-generated soundtrack variations, with Ogata estimating somewhere over three hundred possible variants on battle themes. A major improvement enabled by the Xbox was the use of 5.1 surround sound, which <b>could</b> <b>enable</b> richer use of both music and in-game sound effects. According to Okada, this additional sound capacity would compensate for what could not be managed at a visual level. Maken X had already given the team a chance to use 3D sound, but Nine was the first title to make major use of 5.1, and implementing it alongside all the other features proved a challenge for the team.|$|E

Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as integrated circuits, medicines, genetic material and tools.|$|E
25|$|Cellulosic ethanol commercialization is {{the process}} of {{building}} an industry out of methods of turning cellulose-containing organic matter into fuel.

25|$|Up {{until the}} year 2010, telescopes could only {{directly}} image exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, {{it is easier to}} obtain images when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than Jupiter), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. However, in 2010 a team from NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory demonstrated that a vortex coronagraph <b>could</b> <b>enable</b> small scopes to directly image planets. They did this by imaging the previously imaged HR 8799 planets using just a 1.5 m portion of the Hale Telescope.|$|E

25|$|Many {{arguments}} {{have been}} made for and against space colonization. The two most common in favor of colonization are survival of human civilization and the biosphere {{in the event of}} a planetary-scale disaster (natural or man-made), and the availability of additional resources in space that <b>could</b> <b>enable</b> expansion of human society. The most common objections to colonization include concerns that the commodification of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and military institutions, and to exacerbate pre-existing detrimental processes such as wars, economic inequality, and environmental degradation.|$|E

25|$|India {{continues}} {{to maintain a}} strong {{military presence in the}} region, despite extremely inhospitable conditions. The conflict over Siachen is regularly cited as an example of mountain warfare. The highest peak in the Siachen glacier region, Saltoro Kangri, could be viewed as strategically important for India because of its immense altitude which <b>could</b> <b>enable</b> the Indian forces to monitor some Pakistani or Chinese movements in the immediate area. Maintaining control over Siachen poses several logistical challenges for the Indian Army. Several infrastructure projects were constructed in the region, including a helipad at 21,000 feet (6,400m) above the sea level. In 2004, the Indian Army was spending an estimated US$2 million a month to support its personnel stationed in the region.|$|E

25|$|Many {{fish that}} exhibit biofluorescence, such as sharks, lizardfish, scorpionfish, wrasses, and flatfishes, also possess yellow intraocular filters. Yellow intraocular filters in the lenses and cornea of certain fishes {{function}} as long-pass filters, thus enabling {{the species that}} possess them to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fishes that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing biofluorescence potentially exploit a light signal from members of it or a similar functional role. Biofluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage, and {{that many of these}} lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that <b>could</b> <b>enable</b> visualization of such patterns.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Kamanin's own {{force was}} heavily engaged over Tisza valley, flying 150-200 sorties daily, paving {{the road to}} Budapest. In December, 1944, his regiments {{relocated}} to an extremely dangerous position - airfields only 10-12 kilometers behind the front line. This was, however, the only solution that <b>could</b> <b>enable</b> effective support of ground troops after an all-out offensive was launched 20 December 1944. This day, the corps flew over 1000 sorties. Kamanin's corps operations in the Battle of Budapest were limited mostly by the physical state of dirt airfields (other formations, based farther from the front line, were also limited by long approach distances). The new position happened to be placed directly on the axis of German Operation Konrad, and was key in tying up this counteroffensive.|$|E
