One way to test a generation method - the “outside in” approach - is to incorporate it in a Nested Sampling algorithm and compare the resulting model estimates with known cases. Another way - the “inside out” approach - is to validate the uniformity of prior samples produced by the new method before its incorporation in a Nested Sampling system. Using the “inside out” approach, we show that E T Jaynes’ Entropy Concentration Theorem (ECT) and a Bayes Factor test of a particular type provide sensitive tests of uniformity in irregular 2 D regions...|$|R

40|$|The body {{temperature}} of ectothermic (2 ̆ 2 cold-blooded 2 ̆ 2) animals is closely {{linked with the}} temperature of the surrounding environment. Many ectotherms living in cold regions behaviorally avoid freezing temperatures by seeking hibernation sites that do not freeze. Some ectotherms are unable to do so and have evolved physiological mechanisms for surviving sub-zero temperatures. We are measuring the lethal limits of freezing in hatchling painted turtles in the field. Painted turtle females lay eggs in a terrestrial nest near the water in early summer. These eggs hatch in August or September. However, the hatchling turtles remain in the mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>nest,</b> only a few centimeters under the soil’s surface, until the following spring. Consequently, these turtles are exposed to freezing Midwestern winter temperatures while they are still in the nest.

We hypothesize that nests experiencing temperatures below - 8 C will have substantial mortality...|$|R

Positives were typed by sequence analysis of 18 <b>S</b> <b>nested</b> PCR products. The qPCR prevalence of Cryptosporidium species in farmed and wild buffalo was 30 and 12 %, respectively. Sequence analysis identified two species: C. parvum and C. bovis, with C. parvum accounting for ~ 80 % of positives typed from the farmed buffalo fecal samples compared to 50 % for wild buffalo. Subtyping at the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp 60) locus identified C. parvum subtypes IIdA 19 G 1 (n = 4) and IIdA 15 G 1 (n = 1) in the farmed buffalo and IIaA 18 G 3 R 1 (n = 2) in the wild buffalo.

We must therefore explore nest-site selection strategies in a range of mating systems, including the interaction between resource-defence polygyny and polyandry (i. e. polygynandry). In this study, we imposed a re-settlement event in the terrestrial toadlet Pseudophryne bibronii and measured the influence of the spatial position of each male 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>nest</b> site with respect to rival males on the likelihood that it would be abandoned or receive eggs. We captured every calling male in a population, measured their breeding success and released them back into the breeding area. We then recorded the establishment and abandonment of nest sites by males over 26 consecutive nights. Spatial positioning did not have any significant effects on male-breeding success, supporting claims that females show less discrimination between nest sites when they are polyandrous and spread their eggs amongst multiple male nests. However, we found that males consistently selected nest sites according to a site 2 ̆ 7 s spatial position, which suggests that fitness benefits unrelated to male breeding success (e. g. reduced mortality risk) might influence male nesting decisions. Overall, our study provides new evidence that the mating system adopted by a population can influence the cues that individuals respond to when selecting nest sites...|$|R
