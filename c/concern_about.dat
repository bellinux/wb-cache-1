40|$|This {{presentation}} provides conceptual {{frameworks for}} understanding critics of educational technology; these frameworks are developed {{by using a}} series of concepts, approaches, and techniques of historical analysis from the area of intellectual history. The difference between study {{in the history of}} ideas and the history of culture is noted. The following problems with the way that the history of ideas is conducted as a research method are identified: the "whole " of the concept is neglected; an elitist perspective; insufficient concern with content; and lack of objectivity. Factors in the history of ideas and four types of definitions are examined. The presentation format revolves around the following conceptual frameworks for analyzing the criticisms of educational technology: (1) <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the development of man-machine systems, (2) <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> technological momentum; (3) <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> individualizing instruction; (4) <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> gender bias; and, (5) <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> dehumanization.
