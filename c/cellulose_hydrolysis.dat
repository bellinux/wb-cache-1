The present study is focused on two models of “pure” cellulose (cellulose C 200 microtechnik, cellulose FD 100 FMC biopolymer) in order to analyse the effects of mechanical pretreatments on the kinetics and yields of hydrolysis.

The influence of carboxyl group introduction at the C 6 {{position on the}} <b>hydrolysis</b> rate of <b>cellulose</b> in 82.5 % phosphoric acid was studied {{as a model of}} the oxidation of cellulose during pulping. The rate constant of hydrolysis for dissolving pulp was larger than that of cotton cellulose at temperatures of 25 °– 35 °C. Mercerized cotton cellulose was partially oxidized regioselectively at the C 6 position by a free radical system using 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine 1 -oxyl (TEMPO).

40|$|A continuous-culture device, {{adapted for}} use with solid substrates, was used to {{evaluate}} the effects of 3 -phenylpropanoic acid (PPA) upon the ability of the South African strain Ruminococcus albus Ce 63 to ferment cellulose. Steady states of fermentation were established with a dilution rate of 0. 17 h− 1, and the extent and volumetric rates of cellulose fermentation were determined over four consecutive days. When the growth medium contained no additions (control), 25 μM phenylacetate alone, 25 μM PPA alone, or 25 μM each of phenylacetate and PPA, the extent of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> was determined to be 41. 1, 35. 7, 90. 2, and 86. 9 %, respectively, and the volumetric rate of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> was 103. 0, 97. 9, 215. 5, and 230. 4 mg liter− 1 h− 1, respectively. To evaluate the effect of PPA availability on affinity for cellulose, the values for dilution rate and extent of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> were used in combination with values for maximum specific growth rate determined from previous studies of growth rates and kinetics of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> The findings support the contention that PPA maintains a competitive advantage for R. albus when grown in a dynamic, fiber-rich environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} hydrolysis of cellulose, {{which is}} one major component of plant biomass, is crucial for the economic production of 2 nd and 3 rd generation biofuels. Enzymatic <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> allows for the selective conversion of cellulose to glucose at moderate reaction conditions. The efficiency of enzymatic <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> is primarily limited by the accessibility of the cellulose polymer to cellulases due to the highly organized and recalcitrant cellulose structure. Therefore, cellulose is pretreated to increase the availability of cellulose for cellulases. For cellulose pretreatment ionic liquids, as new generation of solvents, are attractive because some of them can dissolve cellulose and thereby open the highly organized cellulose structure. Dissolved cellulose can then be precipitated by addition of water, leading to an amorphous regenerated cellulose structure with large pores. Therefore, regenerated cellulose can be hydrolyzed much more efficiently with strongly increased reaction rates. The enzymatic heterogeneous hydrolysis of undissolved, regenerated cellulose with a commercial cellulase preparation was characterized {{and the effect of}} residual ionic liquid from the pretreatment was analyzed. The ionic liquid strongly reduced the cellulase activity but the enzyme stability was maintained. Therefore, regenerated cellulose was hydrolyzed much faster, also in the presence of residual ionic liquid. However, with increasing amounts of ionic liquid, the yields were reduced. To improve the hydrolysis of regenerated cellulose a semi-empiric mathematical model was developed. This was successfully used to rationally optimize the cellulase mixture and increase the yield by 10 % points. An even further improved process was achieved by combining a chemical hydrolysis step with the enzymatic hydrolysis to achieve nearly quantitative conversion in only 5 hours. In addition to the heterogeneous hydrolysis of undissolved cellulose, the homogeneous hydrolysis of dissolved cellulose in ionic liquid was evaluated. Since common cellulases are not active at such high ionic liquid concentrations, two new analytical techniques based on sugar formation and viscosity decrease were developed to quantify cellulase activity in this ionic liquid reaction system. Using a new cellulase from the extremophile archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, it was possible to measure cellulase activity in nearly pure ionic liquid for the first time. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the homogeneous enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose dissolved in ionic liquid is generally feasible. For a holistic understanding of enzymatic <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> mechanistic modeling is a powerful tool. A mechanistic population balance model for homogeneous <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> was developed that describes changes in chain length distributions. The parameters of a chemical hydrolysis model were estimated to verify the applicability of population balance modeling to describe <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> Afterwards, models for the enzymatic <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> were developed and parameter variations revealed influencing factors of homogeneous enzymatic <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> For a further in-depth analysis of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> and to provide the required experimental data for future population balance modeling, a new method to analyze cellulose chain length distributions was developed. This method simplifies sample preparation and thereby, allows to measure cellulose chain length distributions much faster. This method was applied to measure and compare chain length distributions of different cellulose substrates, in original form and regenerated from ionic liquid, during the enzymatic hydrolysis. It was found that the cellulase hydrolysis reaction was significantly influenced by the accessibility of the different substrates. Based on the work presented here, fundamental new aspects of ionic liquid assisted enzymatic <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> were identified. Future work based on these results can ultimately lead to a fully mechanistic model of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> that allows for the optimization of enzymatic <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> irrespective of biomass origin or pretreatment method. Furthermore, {{it will be possible to}} identify targets for the optimization of cellulases and pretreatment method. Therefore, this will be a central element for the economic conversion of cellulose in future biorefineries...|$|E
50|$|Thickeners {{are used}} for {{thixotropic}} formulas to help the mixture form gel that adheres to vertical surfaces and to reduce the evaporation of the solvents, thus prolonging the time the solvent can penetrate the paint. Cellulose-based agents, e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose, are commonly used for mixtures that are not extremely acidic or basic; under such conditions <b>cellulose</b> undergoes <b>hydrolysis</b> and loses effectiveness, so fumed silica is used for these instead. Another possibility is using waxes (usually paraffin wax or polyethylene or polypropylene derivatives), or polyacrylate gels.|$|R

In this study, aspect ratio-controlled bacterial cellulose nanowhiskers (BCNWs) were prepared simply by varying the hydrolysis time. The nanowhiskers prepared from bacterial <b>cellulose</b> at different <b>hydrolysis</b> times were relatively longer than those produced from cotton and wood <b>cellulose,</b> even after <b>hydrolysis</b> {{for a long time}} in a strong acid solution. The bacterial cellulose nanowhiskers did not sediment or flocculate due to the surface acid groups that formed during hydrolysis. This was demonstrated by the phenomenon of flow birefringence. All the samples prepared by hydrolysis for 1 – 3 hours showed flow birefringence. Lyophilized BCNWs could also be re-dispersed in aqueous solutions, even in polar organic solvents...|$|R

30|$|Current {{strategies}} to produce fuel ethanol from cellulose {{can be categorized}} depending on the process configurations, namely; separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), which involves four discrete process steps. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) consolidates hydrolysis and fermentation of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> products into one process step, with cellulase production and fermentation of hemicellulose hydrolysis products occurring in two additional separate process steps. Simultaneous saccharification and co fermentation (SSCF) involves two process steps: cellulase production and a second step in which <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> and fermentation of both cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis products occurs (Lee 1997; Lynd et al. 2002).|$|E
30|$|A novel {{approach}} of stochastic molecular modeling based on basic sciences and computer algorithms {{was used to}} model complex <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> process. In this work, the model was further improved by incorporating some critical phenomenon, especially the enzyme crowding effect, and the model was validated with actual hydrolysis experiments using purified enzymes. Model was accurate in predicting the <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> profiles obtained from experimental studies from both literature as well as this work. The model captured the dynamics of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> during action of individual as well as multiple cellulase enzymes. Model results successfully followed all important trends, such as product inhibition, low cellobiohydrolase activity on high DP substrates, low endoglucanases activity on crystalline substrate, inverse relationship between degree of synergism and substrate DP, observed experimentally and reported in literature studies.

30|$|Judging {{from the}} {{correlation}} between C. cellulyticum activity and adhesion to cellulose, Lynd et al. (2006) predicted biofilm formation might facilitate cellulose degradation. The direct observation and measurement of biofilm formation and cellulose degradation in {{this study suggests that}} only the portions of the cellulose substrate colonized by the biofilm were effectively hydrolyzed. These data emphasize the critical role of biofilm formation in cellulose degradation. Hence, a rapid startup of <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> is theoretically achievable by increasing the number of bacteria attached on the cellulose substrate during the initial phase until the maximum rate of hydrolysis is reached, correlating to complete substrate coverage by the biofilm. This saturation hydrolysis rate is about 5.33 × 10 - 5 g h- 1 cm- 2 as measured from the linear degradation profile in Figure 4 a. This kind of constant hydrolysis rate has been widely reported and thought {{to be the result of}} microbial attachment to all accessible substrate (Batstone et al. 2001). Consistent with this assumption, even a 3 -fold increase in the number of planktonic cells did not increase the <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> rate (Figure 4 a), suggesting that <b>cellulose</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> is performed mainly by attached cells.|$|E
