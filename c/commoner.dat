5|$|This finding, in {{conjunction}} with those of <b>Commoner</b> et al. shows that Chemetco's dioxins were almost entirely released as smokestack emissions (also called flue gas stack) emissions.|$|E
5|$|The {{royal family}} {{believed}} that these afflictions flowed through their blood, which {{was believed to}} be purer than the blood of a <b>commoner,</b> and, as such, wished to hide as much as possible in regard to John's illness.|$|E
50|$|Officially, <b>commoners</b> did {{not have}} kamei. At some point in history, <b>commoners</b> in the capital region, Shuri and Naha, started to assume kamei. However, kamei of <b>commoners</b> were {{differentiated}} verbally and in writing. The last syllable of a <b>commoner's</b> kamei was lengthened (e.g. Arakachii) while that of a Pechin was not (e.g. Arakachi). For <b>commoners,</b> his warabi-naa is written first and is followed by his kamei. For example, Taraa (warabi-naa) from Yamagushiku was written as たら山城 (Taraa Yamagushiku).|$|R
5000|$|Owners of land {{in general}} have all the rights of {{exclusive}} ownership, to use the land as they wish. However, for common land the owner's rights are restricted, and other people known as <b>commoners</b> have certain rights over the land. The landowner may retain other rights to the land, such as rights to minerals and large timber, and to any common rights left unexercised by the <b>commoners.</b> The <b>commoners</b> will continue to exercise their rights, or have a document which describes their rights, which {{may be part of}} the deeds of another property. A number of <b>commoners</b> still exercise rights, for example, there are 500 practising <b>commoners</b> in the New Forest, and there is a federation of <b>commoners</b> in Cumbria. [...] In many cases commons have no existing <b>commoners,</b> the rights having been neglected.|$|R
50|$|The British Empire {{is falling}} apart. Many <b>commoners</b> {{are unhappy with}} the current government, though none of the <b>commoners</b> claim {{responsibility}} for the status quo. The magician's demons are being assaulted by the children's natural abilities to see and resist the demons. Some <b>commoners</b> advocate slow reform, while others advocate open revolt, while still others say the <b>commoners</b> should learn how to summon spirits of their own to combat those spirits belonging to the magicians. Ptolemy's Gate concludes with a council of surviving magicians and important <b>commoners</b> {{trying to work out}} a government that is beneficial to everyone.|$|R
5|$|Though Olga {{repeatedly}} asked Tsar Nicholas II {{to allow}} her to divorce, her brother refused on religious and dynastic grounds; he believed marriage was for life and that royalty should marry within royalty. When their brother, Grand Duke Michael, eloped with his mistress, Natasha Wulfert, the Tsar and Olga were scandalized {{along with the rest of}} society. Natasha was a <b>commoner</b> who had been divorced twice, and one of her former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky. Michael was banished from Russia, and the likelihood of the Tsar ever granting Olga's divorce, or permitting her to marry a <b>commoner,</b> looked remote.|$|E
5|$|Xerxes, {{the eldest}} son of Darius and Atossa, succeeded to the throne as Xerxes I; however, prior to Xerxes's accession, he contested the {{succession}} with his elder half-brother Artobarzanes, Darius's eldest son who was born to his <b>commoner</b> first wife before Darius rose to power.|$|E
5|$|Careful {{selection}} of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending {{on the law of}} the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a <b>commoner</b> who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as a son of a sovereign, he might not be able to claim any of the royal status of his father.|$|E
5000|$|Social {{structure}} was anchored on the ana murinda ("children of the murinda") or free <b>commoners.</b> In {{addition to the}} <b>commoners,</b> there were two servile groups [...] the ijiko (sing., kijiko), unfree <b>commoners</b> who were permanently attached to the land as serfs, and the abika (sing., mubika) or salable slaves.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the era of}} enclosure, {{there was}} {{relatively}} little common land remaining of value. Some residual <b>commoners</b> remained, until such as after the Second World War, lowland commons became neglected because <b>commoners</b> could find better-paid work in other sectors of the economy. As a result, they largely stopped exercising their rights, and relatively few <b>commoners</b> exist today.|$|R
50|$|Contrary to the {{situation}} of the gentries, <b>commoners</b> of Yuan dynasty found themselves less protected by the law. Mongol rulers did not seem to take the interests of <b>commoners</b> a priority. A great number of ordinary farmers were converted to plantation workers working for the gentries. The wealthy entered upon the properties of <b>commoners</b> while making them essentially slave-peasants.|$|R
5|$|Contemporary sources also {{differed}} on his status. Foreign visitors {{often called}} him a chief, especially during his capacity as royal governor, but most of his contemporaries like Samuel Kamakau, missionary Hiram Bingham I, and even King Kamehameha III considered him a makaʻāinana or <b>commoner.</b> Kapeau {{was one of the}} first non-royal Hawaiians to receive a western education from the missionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{internal}} {{tensions and}} economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were held under house arrest. The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dowager Empress Marie, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Olga, and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the Crimea where they lived for a time before they too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates. As a <b>commoner,</b> Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs, and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony-cart, which allowed him to run errands, obtain food, and seek news of the outside. On 12 August 1917, Olga and Kulikovsky's first child and son, Tikhon, was born in the Crimea. He was named after one of the Grand Duchess's favorite saints, Tikhon of Zadonsk. Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, Tikhon received no titles because his father was a <b>commoner.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Caroline {{published}} her memoirs, A <b>commoner</b> {{married a}} king: As told by Baroness de Vaughan to Paul Faure; in it, she stated {{she had loved}} and was faithful to the king, {{and that he had}} loved her and their two sons. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 at Cambo, Pyrénées-Atlantiques in France.|$|E
50|$|Adding {{even more}} {{complexity}} to Aztec social stratification was the calpolli. Calpolli, meaning ‘big house’ {{is a group}} of families related by either kinship or proximity. These groups consist of both elite members of Aztec society and <b>commoners.</b> Elites provided <b>commoners</b> with arable land and nonagricultural occupations, and <b>commoners</b> performed services for chiefs and gave tribute.|$|R
50|$|The naval {{plantations}} encroached on {{the rights}} of the <b>Commoners,</b> but the Forest gained new protection under the New Forest Act 1877, which confirmed the historic rights of the <b>Commoners</b> and prohibited the enclosure of more than 65 km2 at any time. It also reconstituted the Court of Verderers as representatives of the <b>Commoners</b> (rather than the Crown).|$|R
50|$|<b>Commoners</b> {{in rural}} areas unofficially used names for households, which were also called Yaa-n-naa (屋の名). They were similar to yagō, private family names used by <b>commoners</b> in Japan.|$|R
5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} <b>commoner</b> Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, every male <b>commoner</b> aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military. The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's (r.87–74 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy. The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) standing army was stationed near the capital.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the game are two main {{characters}}, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral. The two characters are childhood friends, and while both are born of differing social classes; Ramza a noble and Delita a <b>commoner,</b> both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor, as taught by Ramza's father Balbanes. However, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks to manipulate the upper class to achieve his dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.|$|E

5|$|Commoners are {{estimated}} to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively {{little is known about}} them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some <b>commoner</b> dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of <b>commoner</b> houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote-sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain. The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions. Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as cotton and cacao, as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools. Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors. Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game. It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.|$|E
5|$|Constance who {{was born}} in 1128 was the only child of Prince Bohemond II of Antioch and Alice, the second {{daughter}} of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Bohemond was killed in a battle at the Ceyhan River in February 1130. After his death, Alice assumed the regency for Constance. According to rumors spreading in Antioch, Alice was planning to send Constance to a monastery or to marry her off to a <b>commoner.</b> Bohemond's cousin, Roger II of Sicily, regarded himself as Bohemond's lawful successor because he was the senior member of the House of Hauteville.|$|E
5|$|Daughter of the Chedi king, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparichara Vasu) and a cursed apsara (celestial nymph) turned fish called Adrika, Satyavati {{was brought up}} as a <b>commoner.</b> She is the adopted {{daughter}} of a fisherman chieftain, Dusharaj (also a ferryman) {{on the banks of}} the river Yamuna. Due to the smell emanating from her body, she was known as Matsyagandha ("She who smells like fish"), and helped her father in his job as a ferryman.|$|E
50|$|More distant royal progeny, {{starting}} from the children of male Mom Chao, are considered <b>commoners.</b> However, these <b>commoners</b> have titles indicating that their ancestry {{can be traced back}} to a king.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>commoners</b> made up {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the population and included skilled craftsmen. The individual homes of the <b>commoners</b> were occupied by nuclear families. This included parents and their children.|$|R
50|$|Once attainted, nobles were {{considered}} <b>commoners,</b> and as such, could {{be subjected to}} the same treatments, including torture and methods of execution. For example, <b>commoners</b> could be burned at the stake, whereas nobles could not.|$|R
5|$|For centuries, in {{accordance}} with the vision of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street clothing for a peasant or <b>commoner.</b> But in the late sixteenth century, the costumes became stylized with certain symbolic and stylistic conventions. During the Edo (Tokugawa) period, the elaborate robes given to actors by noblemen and samurai in the Muromachi period were developed as costumes.|$|E
5|$|King William {{appointed}} his friend, the Duchess of Northumberland, as Victoria's official governess in 1831, but {{the role}} was mostly ceremonial, and the princess continued {{to depend on}} Lehzen. The Duchess was dismissed in 1837 by Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, for attempting to become more influential in Victoria's education. During this time, Lehzen held no official position at court; despite her recently acquired title, her <b>commoner</b> status {{continued to be a}} hindrance.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{reached the age of}} 21, the prince became {{infatuated}} with Maria Fitzherbert. She was a <b>commoner,</b> six years his elder, twice widowed, and a Roman Catholic. Despite her complete unsuitability, the prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the Act of Settlement 1701, which barred the spouse of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which prohibited his marriage without the King's consent, which would never have been granted.|$|E
40|$|Permanent {{economic}} inequality {{is unknown}} among mobile hunter-gatherers, but hereditary class distinctions between elites and <b>commoners</b> exist in some sedentary foraging societies. With {{the spread of}} agriculture, such stratification tends to become more pronounced. We develop a model to explain the associations among productivity, population density, and inequality. We show that regional productivity growth leads to enclosure of the best sites first, creating inequality between insiders and outsiders. This {{is followed by the}} emergence of elites and <b>commoners</b> at the best sites. As this process unfolds, elites and <b>commoners</b> have increasingly unequal food consumption. In some cases, the elite specializes in guarding land while relying entirely on the food produced by <b>commoners.</b> Our analysis is consistent with archaeological evidence from southern California, the northwest coast of North America, southwest Asia, and Polynesia. inequality, stratification, prehistory, archaeology, anthropology, insiders, outsiders, elites, <b>commoners,</b> productivity, population density, foraging, hunting and gathering, agriculture...|$|R
50|$|The <b>commoners</b> {{are those}} who are ignorant of magic and who make up the rest of society. They are kept in line by the {{governing}} class through fear and ignorance. The <b>commoners</b> are fully aware of the magical world and know of the magicians' dominance. Increasingly during the time period of these stories, some <b>commoners</b> are born with a resistance to magic, or a sensitivity to its presence, or with the ability to see demons naturally.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 {{the title}} to the land was {{purchased}} by the Chairman of the <b>Commoners</b> Committee, for £500, who then sold it to the <b>Commoners</b> for the same price. The title is held in trust by the Trustees and {{the conduct of the}} Commoners' affairs is regulated by the Trust Deed. In 1967 the common was registered as a common under the Commons Registration Act. After that time, all commoners' rights not registered by individual <b>commoners</b> were lost.|$|R
