5000|$|<b>Corvus</b> <b>capensis</b> - Cape crow or Cape rook (Eastern and {{southern}} Africa) ...|$|E
50|$|The Cape crow {{or black}} crow (<b>Corvus</b> <b>capensis)</b> is {{slightly}} larger (48-50 cm in length) than the carrion crow and is completely black {{with a slight}} gloss of purple in its feathers. It has proportionately longer legs, wings and tail too and has a much longer, slimmer bill {{that seems to be}} adapted for probing into the ground for invertebrates. The head feathers have a coppery-purple gloss and the throat feathers are quite long and fluffed out in some calls and displays.|$|E
50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern red-billed hornbill (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (<b>Corvus</b> <b>capensis)</b> and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
40|$|While {{living in}} Bedele, Illubabor, Ethiopia {{a few years}} back (16 September 1989) we came across an {{incident}} worth reporting after more than 20 years. At about 14 : 00 our attention was drawn to a group of four Thick-billed Ravens Corvus crassirostris, normally a noisy species, but the present ones appeared to be unusually agitated in a nearby acacia tree. As we approached, a Harrier Hawk Polyboroides radiatus flew off with two ravens in close pursuit and all disappeared from sight, but the ravens returned after about two minutes. Almost immediately afterwards, {{what appeared to be a}} Wahlberg’s Eagle Aquila wahlbergi also flew away with another two ravens in pursuit. It landed in a nearby dead tree, and was thereafter ignored by the ravens. Although two possible candidates for the consternation had gone, the agitated calling continued unabated and was increased through the arrival of a pair of vociferous Cape Rooks <b>Corvus</b> <b>capensis.</b> It was now obvious that there was some other cause for the mobbing behaviour of the ravens. On closer approach we found a fully grown Verreaux’s Eagle Owl Bubo lacteus perched high in the tree being closel...|$|E
40|$|Complaints of {{crop damage}} by cranes on planted maize in the North Eastern Cape, South Africa, have been {{increasing}} since the mid- 1990 ‘s, {{and in some}} instances severe losses have been reported. Crop damage by the Grey Crowned Crane Balearica regulorum regulorum near the town of Maclear (31 º 04 ´S 28 º 22 ´E), has been quantified over two growing seasons, and assessed relative to losses caused by foraging Cape Crows <b>Corvus</b> <b>capensis</b> and other feeding damage assumed to be caused by insects. Twelve fields were selected based on previous patterns of crop depredation. Maize seed in seven of the fields was treated with the chemical ‗Gaucho‘ and five fields were planted with untreated maize. In order to determine the source of losses, twenty quadrats (4 m x 4 m) randomly distributed within each field were visited on average every second day, for a period of up to twenty eight days. Results indicate that seed treatments do act as a deterrent to feeding by both cranes and crows, however crane damage is generally insignificant compared to other sources of damage. My study also reviewed past sightings data of the Grey Crowned Crane in an effort to determine if the conversion of former grassland to plantations in this region may have increased foraging activity in maize fields. The data did not allow for clear-cut conclusions regarding changes in distribution or population trends. Conclusions provide direct input into the management of agricultural areas by enabling landowners to take steps to mitigate crop damage. These mitigation measures may either involve the application of seed treatments, or the planting of low risk crops in high risk areas. Future studies should consider the ppossible detrimental effects of chemical seed treatments on crane biology. ...|$|E
