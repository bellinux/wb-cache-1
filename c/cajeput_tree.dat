5000|$|<b>Cajeput</b> <b>tree</b> is {{a common}} name used for certain {{classification}} of tree that has a white spongy bark that is flexible and can easily flake off the trunk. The <b>Cajeput</b> <b>tree</b> is of the genus Melaleuca, native to Australia and is commonly known in North America as the Tea Tree. The name [...] "Cajeput tree" [...] is primarily used for the species M. cajuputi, M. leucadendra, M. linariifolia, M. viridiflora and M. quinquenervia. Other names for these trees are the paperbark tree, punk tree, or the white bottle brush tree. Similar subtropical trees from the eucalyptus family are evergreens with pointed leaves and white, red or green flowers. Aborigines of Australia often used the <b>cajeput</b> <b>tree</b> bark for shields, canoes, roofing material and timber.|$|E
5000|$|The name of {{the area}} {{is thought to be}} derived from the <b>cajeput</b> <b>tree,</b> called [...] "gelam" [...] in Malay. [...] "Kampong" [...] (modern {{spelling}} [...] "kampung") simply means [...] "village".|$|E
50|$|Melafix (a {{proprietary}} name) is an all-natural aquarium antibiotic {{consisting of}} an essential oil of the Melaleuca genus. Contrary to popular opinion {{it is not}} made from the common Tea tree, Melaleuca alternifolia, but from Melaleuca leucadendra, {{also known as the}} <b>Cajeput</b> <b>Tree.</b> This is confirmed by the manufacturer's Safety Data Sheet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cajeput</b> <b>trees</b> are {{a source}} of cajeput oil in Southeast Asia, an {{essential}} oil that is extracted from the leaves and twigs of the <b>tree.</b> <b>Cajeput</b> oil is primarily used in aromatherapy as an expectorant, painkiller, antifungal oil and skin mite reducer. The oil is produced by steam distillation of the Melaleuca leucadendra and Melaleuca quinquenervia species. A similar essential oil known as tea tree oil is extracted from the species Melaleuca alternifolia, a native of Australia. Melaleuca pollen can be an allergen and tea tree oil may cause allergic reactions for some people. <b>Cajeput</b> <b>trees</b> grown in Australia are well known for having powerful therapeutic properties. Compared to other countries, Australia's cajeput contains high amounts of anti-infectious properties (cineol, pinene and others), and is a favorite among health professionals.|$|R
50|$|The park {{features}} the lakeside walkways which was completed and opened to public in 2007 {{with a total}} distance of 1.4 km. There is also a nine-turn bridge. It houses various flora as well, such as willows, bald cypresses, <b>cajeput</b> <b>trees,</b> golden showers, royal poincianas, Chinese hibiscus, azaleas and Ixora westii. The park management center houses a 45-seating capacity reading room, tennis courts, swimming pool and other recreational facilities. Visitors can also fish and hike in its six mountain trails to choose from with rest pavilions along the way.|$|R
5000|$|Ko Samet {{is one of}} the driest archipelagos in Thailand. Ko Samet gets {{significantly}} less rainfall than Rayong Province, even though it is only a few kilometres offshore. The island's [...] "rainy season" [...] extends only from May to July, but even during this season it has less rain than other islands in Thailand. The island, despite being arid, consists of lush forested hills, covered with evergreen and deciduous forest and <b>cajeput</b> <b>trees</b> grow abundantly (the name [...] "samet" [...] means [...] "cajeput"). Owing to the lack of rain, Ko Samet must import potable water from the mainland.|$|R
50|$|The park's beach forests, {{approximately}} 2 km2 in area, {{consist of}} numerous tree species with {{the effect of}} providing a windbreak during tropical storms and stabilising the beach sands. Tree species include common ironwood, tulip tree, tropical almond, white barringtonia, <b>cajeput</b> <b>tree,</b> Alexandrian laurel, screwpine, ashoka tree, black plum, elephant apple and morning glory.|$|E
40|$|Myrtaceae), is an {{invasive}} {{woody plant}} that {{is native to}} Australia, New Guinea, and the Soloman Islands. Melaleuca, {{also known as the}} paper bark <b>tree,</b> <b>cajeput,</b> punk <b>tree,</b> or white bottlebrush tree, was introduced into Florida in the late 19 th century but apparently failed to naturalize until 1906. It was planted extensively as an ornamental, and eventually invaded suitable forested and non-forested wetland habitats in south Florida forming dense monocul-tures (Figure 1). In 2008, Melaleuca infested over 110, 000 ha of wetland ecosystems in this region, most notably the sawgrass marshes that comprise the Florida Everglades. Currently, control costs are $ 1. 5 million, in losses to Florida economy. A combination of chemical, mechanical, cultural, and biological control practices have been used to manag...|$|R
40|$|The legislated {{mission of}} the National Park Service (NPS) is to preserve, protect, and {{maintain}} the natural ecosystems in its care. In south Florida, many of these "natural areas " have been invaded by or, are threatened by, exotic plant species-particularly the successful "weed " trees, Brazilian Pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius, A tralian Pine (Casuarina spp.), and <b>Cajeput</b> or Punk <b>Tree</b> (Melaleuca quinquenervia) Though originally introduced as useful plants, it is now apparent that they can cause many problems. These three trees not only quickly colonize sites disturbed by human activity (abandoned farmland and homesites, road edges, etc.), but it also appears that they {{can take advantage of}} disturbances that are the results of natural phenomena (like hurricanes and fires) or management practices (manipulation of water levels and prescribed burning) to out-compete and exclude native species. The NPS has devoted considerable time and effort toward the control of these plants with varying degrees of success. Eradication of Casuarina from beaches has been temporarily successful, but removal of Schinus from abandoned farmland has proved difficult. At present, several studies have been initiated to further understand the dynamics of Schinus in hopes that control methods can be found...|$|R
50|$|Whole, {{unbroken}} henna leaves {{will not}} stain the skin. Henna will not stain skin until the lawsone molecules are made available (released) from the henna leaf. Dried henna leaves will stain the skin {{if they are}} mashed into a paste. The lawsone will gradually migrate from the henna paste into the outer layer of the skin and bind to the proteins in it, creating a fast stain.Since {{it is difficult to}} form intricate patterns from coarse crushed leaves, henna is commonly traded as a powder made by drying, milling and sifting the leaves. The dry powder is mixed with {{one of a number of}} liquids, including water, lemon juice, or strong tea, and other ingredients, depending on the tradition. Many artists use sugar or molasses in the paste to improve consistency and keep it stuck to the skin better. The henna mix must rest for 1 to 48 hours before use, to release the lawsone from the leaf matter. The timing depends on the crop of henna being used. Essential oils with high levels of monoterpene alcohols, such as tea <b>tree,</b> <b>cajeput,</b> or lavender, will improve skin stain characteristics. Other essential oils, such as eucalyptus and clove, are also useful but are too irritating and should not be used on skin.The paste can be applied with many traditional and innovative tools, starting with a basic stick or twig. In Morocco, a syringe is common. In India, a plastic cone similar to those used to pipe icing onto cakes is used. In the Western world, a cone is common, as is a Jacquard bottle, which is otherwise used to paint silk fabric. A light stain may be achieved within minutes, but the longer the paste is left on the skin, the darker and longer lasting the stain will be, so it needs to be left on as long as possible. To prevent it from drying or falling off the skin, the paste is often sealed down by dabbing a sugar/lemon mix over the dried paste, or simply adding some form of sugar to the paste. After time the dry paste is simply brushed or scraped away.|$|R
