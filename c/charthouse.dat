500|$|Furiouss superstructure, masts, funnel {{and landing}} deck were removed {{and she was}} given a [...] flight deck that {{extended}} over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of {{the way from the}} stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes {{at the time it was}} designed. That era's fore-and-aft arresting gear, initially [...] long on Furious, was not intended to stop landing aircraft—the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind—but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, Furious was flush-decked and lacked an island, like Argus; instead she was provided with a retractable <b>charthouse</b> at the forward end of the flight deck.|$|E
500|$|A {{two-level}} hangar {{was built}} under the flight deck, [...] in height per level. The lower hangar was [...] long by [...] wide {{and the upper}} was [...] Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted {{down the side of}} the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters which improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility allowing the ship to simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck or to speedily fly off her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Like Argus, Furious was flush-decked and lacked an island superstructure to minimise any turbulence over the flight deck; instead she had a navigating position at the leading edge of the flight deck, starboard, and was provided with a retractable <b>charthouse</b> forward, on the flight deck centreline. The ship could normally only carry about 36 aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two ships}} sighted {{each other when}} they were about a [...] apart. The captain of Pisagua burnt a warning flare, which was seen by the crew and senior officer on duty {{on the bridge of}} Oceana, who then gave the order to turn to port. The pilot from Tilbury and for the Strait of Dover, Mr Penny, who was board Oceana in the <b>charthouse,</b> came to the bridge and {{realized}} that this manoeuvre would not be enough to avert a collision. He called [...] "hard to port", but before Oceana could get out of the course, Pisagua struck Oceana amidships, making a [...] gash in her side. The collision was [...] off of Beachy Head.|$|E
60|$|Harold, {{despite the}} wild turmoil of winds and seas around him, which usually lifted his spirits, was sad, feeling lonely and wretched; he was {{suffering}} from the recoil of his little friend's charming presence. Pearl came on deck again looking for him. He did not see her, and the child, seeing an opening for a new game, avoided both her father and mother, who also stood in the shelter of the <b>charthouse,</b> and ran round behind it on the weather side, calling a loud 'Boo!' to attract Harold's attention as she ran.|$|E
60|$|A {{few seconds}} later the Scoriac put her nose into a coming wave at just the angle which makes for the full {{exercise}} of the opposing forces. The great wave seemed to strike the ship on the port quarter like a giant hammer; {{and for an instant}} she stood still, trembling. Then the top of the wave seemed to leap up and deluge her. The wind took the flying water and threw it high in volumes of broken spray, which swept not only the deck but the rigging as high as the top of the funnels. The child saw the mass of water coming, and shrieking flew round the port side of the <b>charthouse.</b> But just as she turned down the open space between it and the funnel the vessel rolled to starboard. At the same moment came a puff of wind of greater violence than ever. The child, calling out, half in simulated half in real fear, flew down the slope. As she did so the gale took her, and in an instant whirled her, almost touching her mother, over the rail into the sea.|$|E
50|$|The Llansantffraed Court Hotel is {{situated}} nearby, {{as well as}} the <b>Charthouse</b> Pub Restaurant, currently an Italian restaurant. The <b>Charthouse</b> was the Carpenters Arms around 1901 when Samuel Summers was the publican and the Herbert Arms around 1911 when William Williams was the publican.

5000|$|On a {{visit to}} Seattle in 1997, John Christensen, owner of <b>ChartHouse</b> Learning, {{observed}} fish sellers at Pike Place Fish Market, tossing trout and salmon through {{the air of the}} market providing high energy which energized many pedestrians passing by on their lunch breaks. [...] They gave their complete attention to each customer and ensured each had an enjoyable visit.|$|E
50|$|In layout, the gunboats {{were also}} modern, {{resembling}} a miniature version of contemporary protected cruisers, {{with a straight}} stem, high forecastle, taller <b>charthouse,</b> and a long low deckhouse extending aft to an even lower quarterdeck. This was a distinct contrast with the sloops of the Condor and Cadmus classes, which resembled contemporary sailing windjammers with a bowsprit and figurehead, a high freeboard, and a raised poop deck aft.|$|E
50|$|Rockingham Beach Primary School {{was founded}} in 1895 and is {{supplemented}} by Bungaree, <b>Charthouse,</b> East Waikiki, Hillman, Safety Bay and Waikiki primary schools.

50|$|The Graf Zeppelins starboard-side island {{housed the}} command and {{navigating}} bridges and <b>charthouse.</b> It {{also served as a}} platform for three searchlights, four domed stabilized fire-control directors and a large vertical funnel. To compensate for the weight of the island, the carrier's flight deck and hangars were offset 0.5 m to port from her longitudinal axis. Design additions proposed in 1942 included a tall fighter-director tower, air search radar antennas and a curved cap for her funnel, the latter intended to keep smoke and exhaust gases away from the armored fighter-director cabin.|$|E
5000|$|A single M2, [...]50 cal {{mounted on}} a M4-style pipe stand tended to appear, disappear, and move around from scene to scene on the forward deck. Normally, the forward gun {{would have been an}} either an M2 [...]50 cal. heavy machine gun or Oerlikon 20-mm antiaircraft cannon on a {{pedestal}} to the right of centerline, back nearer the <b>charthouse</b> and possibly a 37-mm Browning aircraft cannon or a 37-mm M3 Army antitank gun strapped or bolted to the deck forward (as had been thought the case for the PT-109).|$|E
50|$|To economize on crew, Matson rigged Falls of Clyde {{down as a}} barque, {{replacing}} the five yards on her (jigger) mast with two more easily managed fore-and-aft sails. At the same time, he added a deckhouse, <b>charthouse,</b> and rearranged the after quarters to accommodate paying passengers. From 1899 to 1907, she made over sixty voyages between Hilo, Hawaii, and San Francisco, California, carrying general merchandise west, sugar east, and passengers both ways. She developed {{a reputation as a}} handy, fast, and commodious vessel, averaging 17 days each way on her voyages.|$|E
50|$|By March 1942, Dickerson {{was back}} at Norfolk for coastal patrol and escort duty. On 19 March, while {{returning}} to Norfolk, she sighted an unidentified ship which fired on the destroyer and badly damaged the <b>charthouse.</b> Four of Dickersons crew was killed, including her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander J. K. Reybold. The attacking ship {{was identified as a}} nervous merchantman, , and Dickerson continued on to Norfolk for repairs. She returned to duty in April and escorted convoys between Norfolk and Key West until August; between Key West and New York until October; and between New York and Cuba until January 1943.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{before the}} convoy was attacked, Seattles helm jammed; and she sheered out of {{formation}} sharply, sounding her whistle {{to warn the}} other vessels. A few minutes later, the ship was brought back on course. Soon lookouts noted a white streak in the water 50 yd ahead of the vessel, crossing from starboard to port {{at right angles to}} Seattles course. Admiral Gleaves, asleep in the <b>charthouse</b> at the time, awoke and was on the bridge {{in time to see the}} armored cruiser's gun crews manning their weapons and the transport De Kalb opening fire on the U-boat.|$|E
50|$|PT-658 Heritage Museum {{is located}} in Portland, Oregon at the Swan Island Industrial Park. She is moored to Pier 307 of Vigor Industrial Shipyard as of October, 2013. Visitor access is {{provided}} via the marked Gate 18 at 5555 N. Lagoon Avenue. The PT-658 Heritage Museum {{is open to the}} public every Monday, Thursday and Saturday 9am to 4pm for visitors. She has been moved into the new boathouse and the group continues to raise money for ongoing projects such as deck replacement, <b>charthouse</b> repair, and bottom replacement. Money is also being raised for final boathouse improvements and to build a PT-658 Heritage and Education Center. In May 2010, replacement of the deck was completed in time for various summer festivals and shows.|$|E
5000|$|Following the war Carron {{paid off}} into reserve. She {{was the first}} of her class to be {{selected}} for modernistion and the work was completed at Chatham. Work included a new bridge and gunnery fire control system, as well as the addition of Squid anti-submarine mortars. [...] The ship emerged from modernisation in 1955 for service with the Dartmouth Training Squadron. Her 'B' gun turret was replaced by a <b>charthouse.</b> In 1960 the ship was further de-equipped so she could serve as a navigational training ship, with only her torpedo tubes remaining and further charthouses fitted on the Squid deck. In 1961 she carried out Foul Weather trials in the Atlantic including the use of new Life Raft and survival suits.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two ships}} sighted {{each other when}} they were about a 1/2 nmi km apart.

50|$|Tradewind {{remained}} in the South Pacific during the late 1980s and early 1990s, based in New Zealand. She was used for charter cruises to the subantarctic islands south of New Zealand, the Antarctic Peninsula and around Fiji. During this period, she appeared in the romance adventure film Return to the Blue Lagoon. Returning {{from one of the}} voyages to the subantarctic islands, Tradewind ran into a storm south of New Zealand and was struck by a rogue wave. The radar, situated 14 m above the waterline, was carried away and the <b>charthouse</b> was flooded. The ship was knocked down, with the mastheads in the water, but righted itself. Only one crew member, the helmsman, was on deck at the time the wave struck. He saved himself from being washed overboard by thrusting his arms through the spokes of the wheel, although he was injured.|$|E
5000|$|Exactly what {{happened}} to the papers is not clear. The ship carried more than one copy of the SKM codebook and copy number 151 was passed to the British. The German account {{is that most of the}} secret papers were thrown overboard, but the British copy was undamaged and was reportedly found in the <b>charthouse.</b> The current key was also needed in order to use the codebook. A gridded chart of the Baltic, the ship's log and war diaries were all also recovered. Copies numbered 145 and 974 of the SKM were retained by the Russians while [...] was dispatched from Scapa Flow to Alexandrovosk in order to collect the copy offered to the British. Although she arrived on 7 September, due to mix-ups she did not depart until 30 September and returned to Scapa with Captain Kredoff, Commander Smirnoff and the documents on 10 October. The books were formally handed over to the First Lord, Winston Churchill, on 13 October.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 January 1973, Duchess {{arrived at}} Williamstown Naval Dockyard for {{conversion}} into a training ship. The aft funnel was streamlined, {{and the remaining}} torpedo launcher, aft gun turret, and Squid mortar were all removed. This allowed for the installation of an extended aft superstructure, with classrooms, instructor offices, and additional accommodation for the embarked trainees. The former turret's loading bay was converted into library and study areas. A semi-enclosed <b>charthouse</b> was fitted above and behind the bridge for navigation training. The refit concluded on 14 August 1974, with Duchess replacing [...] as the RAN's dedicated training vessel. From January 1975 to July 1976, Duchess operated on a sequence of training cruises, visiting ports along the eastern Australian coast, as well as New Zealand and the South Pacific. She was docked from July to October at Cockatoo Island Dockyard to combat hull corrosion, then resumed her training schedule. Her final training cruise ran during August and September 1977, after which, Duchess was replaced by [...]|$|E

50|$|Christensen {{noticed the}} actual work of selling fish was repetitive, cold and exhausting. It {{occurred}} to him that the fishmongers might not enjoy every part of their job, but they chose to bring joy to how they approached it. They also sold a lot of fish. He asked the fishmongers if he could film them and they agreed. Lee Copeland Gladwin reports the events at hand spawned a film entitled Fish to be released, June 1998. John Christensen created the Fish Philosophy in 1998. From the film, a book entitled Fish! A Remarkable Way to Boost Morale and Improve Results, by Stephen C. Lundin, Harry Paul, and John Christensen was written. When Christensen and his team examined the footage, they identified four simple practices anyone could apply to their work and life. Karen Boynes, asserts once application of the four concepts of choosing one's attitude, playing at work, making someone's day, and being present, start, the environment changes to welcome positivity into the work place. <b>ChartHouse</b> Learning called these concepts The Fish! Philosophy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design was}} based closely {{on the design}} of King George V, but with a number of modifications. British battleships of the period were {{required}} by the Admiralty to be of a size that could be accommodated by existing docks, which imposed absolute limitations on beam and on draught. Erin was built with a greater beam and a shorter length than King George V, the greater stability so produced allowing for the installation of a heavier secondary battery and the positioning of [...] "Q" [...] turret one deck higher. She had only a single mast, the foremast, which supported the fighting top and was situated ahead of the forefunnel. The legs of the tripod foremast spread forward rather than the more usual aft orientation; This was to allow the ship's boats to be worked by booms from this mast, {{in the absence of a}} mainmast. As a further result of this mast arrangement the <b>charthouse</b> could not be built as part of the conning tower, but was built as a separate structure around the base of the mast.|$|E
50|$|A {{two-level}} hangar {{was built}} under the flight deck, 15 ft in height per level. The lower hangar was 550 ft long by 35 - 50 ft wide {{and the upper}} was 520 by 50 ft.
