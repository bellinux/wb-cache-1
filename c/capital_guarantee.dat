In this paper we analyze if multiple reference point theories {{can explain the}} relatively high attractiveness of annuities containing a <b>capital</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Therefore, we conducted a laboratory experiment where participants were confronted with an experimental annuitization decision from a mental accounting perspective. Previous {{research has shown that}} combining mental accounting and prospect theory can explain why annuities containing a guarantee are preferred to standard annuities, but this approach suffers from the shortcoming that from this perspective people would not annuitize their assets at all, but rather invest the money in a risk-free alternative. Recent research has extended prospect theory by additional reference points, in particular goals and thereby found a “cushion effect”. When all possible outcomes of two options are above a certain goal, this goal serves as a cushion against negative emotions like disappointment and regret. Hence, individuals have a higher propensity to choose the risky option over the risk-free alternative with the same expected value. In our experiment, we find that individuals are more willing to purchase an annuity if it contains a <b>capital</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Moreover, we find evidence that individuals using this guarantee as a cushion were even more willing to choose the annuity. Hence, the “cushion effect ” can partially explain the high demand for <b>capital</b> <b>guarantee</b> features in annuity contracts. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze what {{transaction}} costs are acceptable for customers in different investments. In this study, two life insurance contracts, a mutual fund and a risk-free investment, as alternative investment forms are considered. The first two products under scrutiny are a life insurance investment with a point-to-point <b>capital</b> <b>guarantee</b> and a participating contract with an annual interest rate guarantee and participation in the insurer's surplus. The policyholder assesses the various investment opportunities using different utility measures. For selected types of risk profiles, the utility position and the investor's preference for the various investments are assessed. Based on this analysis, the authors study which cost levels can make all of the products equally rewarding for the investor. Design/methodology/approach - The paper notes the risk-neutral valuation calibration using empirical data utility and performance measurement dynamics underlying: geometric Brownian motion numerical examples via Monte Carlo simulation. Findings - In the first step, the financial performance of the various saving opportunities under different assumptions of the investor's utility measurement is studied. In the second step, the authors calculate the level of transaction costs that are allowed in the various products to make all of the investment opportunities equally rewarding from the investor's point of view. A comparison of these results with transaction costs that are common in the market shows that insurance companies must be careful with respect to the level of transaction costs that they pass on to their customers to provide attractive payoff distributions. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, their research question - i. e. which transaction costs for life insurance products would be acceptable from the customer's point of view - has not been studied in the above described context so far...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis was to {{determine}} what is a good index. Through a theoretical discussion, empirical analysis and consideration of practical aspects, the best index for a case study structured product, the US Residential Real Estate <b>Capital</b> <b>Guaranteed</b> Index-Linked Note, was chosen. The main motivation behind this study was that it is essential to understand how the construction and characteristics of an index affect the performance of the index, especially if one is creating or purchasing an instrument whose return depends on the index. A case study was chosen to give this paper a practical application, and the chosen case study was a <b>capital</b> <b>guaranteed</b> index-linked note because of their unique return possibilities. The research concentrates mainly on choosing the index, but also describes how the case study product is constructed. The thesis included two research questions. The first research question was how is an index constructed. First, indices were examined from a theoretical point of view via studying index theories and index formulae. The material used was academic literature on index theory, as well as material published by financial institutions. The conclusion of this discussion was that there is no unified opinion upon which is the most accurate or suitable index formula for this case study. The research then took an empirical approach. The two candidates for the index-linked product were the Dow Jones U. S. Real Estate Index and the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. The Dow Jones Index was more suitable from a practical point of view, as the existence of an exchange traded fund linked to this index makes the options market more liquid. On the other hand, the contents of the Philadelphia Housing Sector index suit the product better – the Philadelphia Index measures the performance of residential real estate sector while the Dow Jones index contains only commercial real estate. The empirical study utilised time series data acquired from the Bloomberg database. Because of the better availability of options for the Dow Jones Index, it was chosen for closer statistical testing. A regression was run using EViews comparing the monthly returns of the Dow Jones Index and the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Composite- 20 Index, which was chosen to represent the return development of the housing market. The Dow Jones Index did in fact have a strong positive correlation with the S&P/Case-Shiller Composite index, and thus it was selected as the best index for the case study product. The empirical study, nonetheless, requires further statistical testing to solidify the results. The second research question was how is a <b>capital</b> <b>guaranteed</b> index-linked note constructed. To answer this question, pricing aspects, different types of structured products and investor and issuer goals were discussed. The study utilised some academic references, marketing materials from financial institutions and an interview from a structured product professional. The construction of the case study was kept to a basic form, consisting of a zero coupon bond and a long position in American call options on the underlying, the iShares Dow Jones U. S. Real Estate Index Exchange Traded Fund. The final conclusions were that even though the projected returns seem promising, the current low interest rate, high volatility, low confidence in financial institutions environment makes the timing poor for issuing the case study product...|$|R

40|$|For {{households}} seeking {{retirement income}} security, short-term deposits (such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and Treasury bills) seem an ideal and appropriate investment choice – particularly given the recent extraordinary turbulence {{in the financial}} markets. Over the past year, an investment in short-term deposits would have actually outperformed investments in corporate bonds and far outperformed corporate stocks. Retired households exhibit a strong preference for holding such apparently safe investments. One study found that 86 percent of households nearing retirement (ages 60 - 64) had bank accounts, while only 33 percent owned stocks directly and only 7 percent owned bonds directly. And the desire for short-term investments increased with age. But short-term investments, while safe, produce uncertain returns. This Issue in Brief highlights the trade-off that households must make between a <b>guaranteed</b> return of <b>capital</b> and a <b>guaranteed</b> return on <b>capital</b> – they cannot have {{both at the same}} time. Short-term deposits provide a <b>guaranteed</b> return of <b>capital,</b> but offer no guarantees as to the return the household will receive on its capital. In contrast, a portfolio of Treasury bonds of appropriate maturities provides a <b>guaranteed</b> return on <b>capital,</b> but with the return of <b>capital</b> <b>guaranteed</b> only at maturity. This brief argues that retired households seeking a secure and dependable income should prioritize return on capital over return of capital. For such households, the true risk-free asset is a portfolio of bonds and, in particular, inflation-protected bonds of appropriate maturities. ...|$|R
