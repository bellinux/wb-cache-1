40|$|Fast <b>carry</b> <b>chains</b> {{featuring}} dedicated adder circuitry is {{a distinctive}} feature of modern FPGAs. The <b>carry</b> <b>chains</b> bypass the general routing network and {{are embedded in}} the logic blocks of FPGAs for fast addition. Conventional intuition is that such <b>carry</b> <b>chains</b> can be used only for implementing carry-propagate addition; state-of-the-art FPGA synthesizers can only exploit the <b>carry</b> <b>chains</b> for these specific circuits. This paper demonstrates that the <b>carry</b> <b>chains</b> {{can be used to}} build compressor trees, i. e., multi-input addition circuits used for parallel accumulation and partial product reduction for parallel multipliers implemented in FPGA logic. The key to our technique is to program the lookup tables (LUTs) in the logic blocks to stop the propagation of carry bits along the <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> at appropriate points. This approach improves the area of compressor trees significantly compared to previous methods that synthesized compressor trees solely on LUTs, without compromising the performance gain over trees built from ternary carry-propagate adders. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{programmable}} logic block (PLB) {{in a modern}} FPGA features a built-in <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> (or adder) and a decomposable LUT, where such an LUT may be decomposed into two or more smaller LUTs. Leveraging decomposable LUTs and underutilized <b>carry</b> <b>chains,</b> we propose to decompose a logic function in a PLB into two subfunctions and to combine the subfunctions via a <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> to make the circuit more robust against single-event upsets(SEUs). Note that such decomposition can be implemented using the decomposable LUT and <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> in the original PLB without changing the PLB-level placement and routing.

Reaction between any two molecules undergoing Brownian diffusion takes place if the reactive chain ends approach {{each other to}} within a certain reaction radius, and if the chain end carrying segments are collinear within certain specified limits. The second order reaction rate constant is found to decrease with time as the molecular lengths increase and the diffusivities decrease. Application of a shear flow is seen to result in alignment of the molecules along the flow direction, thereby enhancing the concentration of molecular pairs with parallel orientation of reactive-end <b>carrying</b> <b>chain</b> segments, and hence the overall reaction rate. This effect {{is found to be}} more pronounced in the case of long rigid molecules as compared to flexible molecules because of the slow rotation and high level of orientation under flow of the former. Even the molecular weight distribution (MWD) obtained during polymerization may be affected. For example, longer molecules have lower diffusivities and hence lower reactivities, resulting in a narrower MWD in the absence of flow, as compared to the results with the usual assumption of molecular reactivity being independent of chain length. Furthermore, in the presence of an external flow, the longer molecules orient to a higher degree and hence display a higher enhancement in reactivity. This results in a wider MWD of the polymer.

Not all logic families have these internal nodes however, CMOS being a major example. Dynamic logic can support shared logic, as can transmission gate logic.

40|$|Look-up table based FPGAs have {{migrated}} from a niche technology for design prototyping to a valuable end-product component and, in some cases, {{a replacement for}} general purpose processors and ASICs alike. One way architects have bridged the performance gap between FPGAs and ASICs is through the inclusion of specialized components such as multipliers, RAM modules, and microcontrollers. Another dedicated structure that has become standard in reconfigurable fabrics is the arithmetic <b>carry</b> <b>chain.</b> Currently, it is only used to map arithmetic operations as identified by HDL macros. For non-arithmetic operations, it is an idle but potentially powerful resource.;Obstacles to using the <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> for generic logic operations include lack of architectural and computer-aided design support. Current carry-select architectures facilitate <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> reuse, although they do so only for (K- 1) -input operations. Additionally, hardware description language (HDL) macros are the only recourse for a designer wishing to map generic logic chains in a carry-select architecture. A novel architecture that allows the full K-input operational capacity of the <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> to be harnessed {{is presented as a}} solution to current architectural limitations. It is shown to have negligible impact on logic element area and delay. Using only two additional 2 : 1 pass transistor multiplexers, it enables the transmission of a K-input operation to the <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> and general routing simultaneously. To successfully identify logic chains in an arbitrary Boolean network, ChainMap is presented as a novel technology mapping algorithm. ChainMap creates delay-optimal generic logic chains in polynomial time without HDL macros. It maps both arithmetic and non-arithmetic logic chains whenever depth increasing nodes, which increase logic depth but not routing depth, are encountered. Use of the chain is not reserved for arithmetic, but rather any set of gates exhibiting similar characteristics. By using the <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> as a generic, near zero-delay adjacent cell interconnection structure a potential average optimal speedup of 1. 4 x is revealed. Post place and route experiments indicate that ChainMap solutions perform similarly to HDL chains when cluster resources are abundant and significantly better in cluster-constrained arrays...|$|R

40|$|This {{innovation}} {{is a series}} of time-tag pulses from a photomultiplier tube, featuring short time interval between pulses (e. g., 2. 5 ns). Using the previous art, dead time between pulses is too long, or too much hardware is required, including a very-high-speed demultiplexer. A faster method is needed. The goal of this work is to provide circuits to time-tag pulses that arrive at a high rate using the hardwired logic in an FPGA - specifically the <b>carry</b> <b>chain</b> - to create what is (in effect) an analog delay line. High-speed pulses travel down the chain in a "wave.

The propagation delay of CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) logic circuits will differ and/or change as a result of temperature, voltage, age, radiation, and manufacturing variances.
