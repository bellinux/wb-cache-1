The optimal <b>combining</b> rule based on the maximum-likelihood criterion is derived for Rayleigh fading channels. Two <b>combining</b> schemes, a noncoherent <b>combining</b> and a coherent <b>combining,</b> {{are found to be}} merely extreme cases of the optimal <b>combining.</b> As a result of investigations on improved <b>combining</b> schemes, a novel differentially coherent <b>combining</b> scheme is proposed.

The detection and mean acquisition time performances of the differentially coherent <b>combining</b> as well as the optimal <b>combining,</b> noncoherent <b>combining,</b> and coherent <b>combining</b> are analyzed for Rayleigh fading environments with frequency offset.

5|$|<b>Combined</b> {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes <b>combined</b> hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several <b>combined</b> hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of <b>combined</b> hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, <b>combined</b> hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
