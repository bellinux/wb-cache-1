5|$|In July 2017 after {{modelling}} for the French fashion brand The Kooples's Fall 2017 collection, Ratajkowski was enlisted {{to design}} a 38-piece bag collection for the company. The collection, named Emily By The Kooples, comes in 6 colors and features a leather <b>carryall</b> bag, The Emily Bag. The bags are Italian-made and represent The Kooples' first foray into bags. Later that month she was announced as the feature of cover stories in the August issues of Allure and British Glamour {{as well as a}} nude Patrick Demarchelier photospread for Love magazine.|$|E
25|$|Collecting the melange is {{hazardous}} in the extreme, since rhythmic {{activity on}} the desert surface of Arrakis attracts the territorial worms, which are capable of swallowing even the largest mining equipment whole. Harvesting is carried out by a gigantic machine called a Harvester, which is carried to and from a spice blow by a larger craft called a <b>Carryall.</b> The Harvester on the ground has four scouting ornithopters patrolling around it watching for wormsign — the motions of sand indicating that a worm is coming. Melange is collected from the open sand until a worm is close, at which time the <b>Carryall</b> lifts the Harvester to safety. The Fremen, who base their entire industry around the sale of spice and the manufacture of materials out of spice, have learned to co-exist with the sandworms in the desert and harvest the spice manually for their own use and for smuggling off-planet.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, Jeff Koons {{collaborated with}} the luxurious French fashion house Louis Vuitton for the 'Masters Collection' and {{designed}} a series of handbags and backpacks featuring the reproductions of his favorite masterpieces by the Old Masters, such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Titian, Vincent Van Gogh, Peter Paul Rubens and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Later this year he presented another handful of bags and accessories featuring the reproductions of works by Claude Monet, J. M. W. Turner, Edouard Manet, Paul Gauguin and François Boucher. The prices range from $585 for a key chain to $4,000 for the large <b>carryall.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Early suppers {{instead of}} dinners were the rule at Leith {{on the evening}} of the {{historic}} day, and the candidate himself, in his red Leviathan, was not inconsiderably annoyed, on the way to Ripton, by innumerable <b>carryalls</b> and traps filled with brightly gowned recruits of that organization of Mrs. Pomfret's which Beatrice Chillingham had nicknamed [...] "The Ladies' Auxiliary.". In vain Mr. Crewe tooted his horn: the sound of it was drowned by the gay talk and laughter in the <b>carryalls,</b> and shrieks ensued when the Leviathan cut by with only six inches to spare, and the candidate turned and addressed the drivers in language more forceful than polite, and told the ladies they acted as {{if they were going to}} a Punch-and-Judy show.|$|R
60|$|The next {{afternoon}} the Rovers and {{a crowd of}} their chums {{took one of the}} college <b>carryalls</b> and drove over to Ashton station to witness the sport. Tom had been to town {{early in the morning and}} had arranged matters with eight colored waiters from the hotel, and also with a local liveryman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes! Here {{he comes}} now!" [...] And as Polly spoke the big <b>carryall</b> {{of the school}} swung into view, with Jackson Lemond, {{commonly}} called [...] "Horsehair," [...] on the driver's seat. The boys made a rush for the <b>carryall,</b> throwing their suit-cases in the rack on top, and piling inside one over the other.|$|E
60|$|That Saturday {{was the day}} {{scheduled}} for the football game with Lemington. As Nat could not take the eleven to that town in his motor-boat, as promised, the school <b>carryall</b> was pressed into service. This made {{some of the other}} students, who had arranged to go in the <b>carryall,</b> find other means of conveyance, and there was considerable grumbling.|$|E
60|$|The next afternoon, all was in {{readiness}} at {{the appointed}} hour. The <b>carryall</b> {{was at the}} door, waiting to receive its portion of the party, and the wagon was fastened to a post behind. Jonas stood {{at the head of}} the <b>carryall</b> horse, to hold him still while the people should be getting in. Rollo was near the wagon horse.|$|E
6000|$|That {{afternoon}} Mr. Hamlin drew {{largely on}} his convalescence {{to mount a}} half-broken mustang, {{and in spite of}} the rising afternoon wind to gallop along the highroad in quite as mischievous and breezy a fashion. He was wont to allow his mustang's nose to hang over the hind rails of wagons and buggies containing young couples, and to dash ahead of sober <b>carryalls</b> that held elderly [...] "members in good standing." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{messenger}} bag (also {{called a}} courier bag) {{is a type}} of sack, usually made out of some kind of cloth (natural or synthetic), that is worn over one shoulder with a strap that goes across the chest resting the bag on the lower back. While messenger bags are sometimes used by couriers, they are now also an urban fashion icon. Some types of messenger bags are called <b>carryalls.</b> A smaller version is often called a sling bag.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear mother, I {{wish that}} you and Jinny and Uncle Comyn could have [...] seen this country rabble. How you would have laughed, and cried, [...] because we are just like them. In the {{combined}} army two thousand [...] have only bowie-knives or clubs. Some have long rifles of Daniel [...] Boone's time, not fired for thirty years. And the impedimenta are a [...] sight. Open wagons and conestogas and <b>carryalls</b> and buggies, and [...] even barouches, weighted down with frying-pans and chairs and [...] feather beds. But we've got spirit, and we can whip Lyon's Dutchmen [...] and Yankees just as we are. Spirit is what counts, and the Yankees [...] haven't got it, I was made to-day a Captain of Cavalry under [...] Colonel Rives. I ride a great, raw-boned horse like an elephant. [...] He jolts me until I am sore,--not quite as easy as my thoroughbred, [...] Jefferson. Tell Jinny to care for him, and have him ready when we [...] march into St. Louis." ...|$|R
60|$|But here, at a {{word from}} the major, the whole party debouched from the woods. Everything {{appeared}} to be awaiting them,--the large covered <b>carryall</b> for the guests, and the two saddle horses for Mrs. Lascelles and Lady Elfrida, who had ridden there together. Peter, also mounted, accompanied the <b>carryall</b> {{with two of the}} officers; the troopers and wagons brought up the rear.|$|E
60|$|So {{the cries}} rang on, as the {{carriage}} and the <b>carryall</b> rolled {{away from the}} Ashton depot.|$|E
60|$|The next day, Rollo's {{father told}} him that they had {{concluded}} to make a party {{to go to the}} sea-shore. There was a shore and a beach about twelve miles from where they lived, and he said that they were going the next day in the <b>carryall.</b> Rollo's father and mother, with Mary and her cousin Lucy, were to ride in the <b>carryall,</b> and Rollo and Jonas in the wagon behind.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} still unaccountably angry over that mysterious affair of the post-office, {{and sat with}} flushed cheeks staring out on the green field, past the line of buggies and <b>carryalls</b> on the farther side to the {{southern}} shoulder of Coniston towering, above them all. The painter, already, beginning to love his New England folk, listened to the homely chatter about him, until suddenly a cheer starting in one corner ran like a flash of gunpowder around the field, and eighteen young men trotted across the turf. Although {{he was not a}} devotee of sport, he noticed that nine of these, as they took their places on the bench, wore blue,--the Harwich Champions. Seven only of those scattering over the field wore white; two young gentlemen, one at second base and the other behind the batter, wore gray uniforms with crimson stockings, and crimson piping on the caps, and a crimson H embroidered on the breast--a sight that made the painter's heart beat a little faster, the honored livery of his own college.|$|R
2500|$|After some debate, the {{engineers}} {{decided to build}} an advanced base for two fighter groups and a medium bombardment group near the junction of the Ramu and Gusap Rivers, at a site called Gusap. The US 872nd Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion was flown in to develop it. This unit had air-portable equipment for just such a mission. With {{the exception of the}} 2½-ton trucks, 3½-ton <b>carryalls</b> and D4 tractors, which made the trek overland, all equipment was flown in by C-47s. Initially {{the engineers}} attempted to improve the existing strip, which they called No. 1, but this site was found unsuitable for large volumes of traffic, so another site was selected [...] away, which became No. 2. This location proved suitable for more airstrips. To construct an all-weather strip, the US 871st Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion was flown in from Nadzab. The all-weather strip was completed by January 1944, at which time the two battalions were joined by a third, the US 875th Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion. Machine gunners from the 6th Machine Gun Battalion were deployed to the airfield in a defensive role.|$|R
6000|$|I {{spent the}} week before {{election}} in the city, where I had the opportunity of observing what may be called the charitable side of politics. For a whole month, or more, the burden of existence had been lifted from {{the shoulders of the}} homeless. No church or organization, looked out for these frowsy, blear-eyed and ragged wanderers who had failed to find a place in the scale of efficiency. For a whole month, I say, Mr. Judd Jason and his lieutenants made them their especial care; supported them in lodging-houses, induced the night clerks to give them attention; took the greatest pains to ensure them the birth-right which, as American citizens, was theirs,--that of voting. They were not only given homes for a period, but they were registered; and in the abundance of good feeling that reigned during this time of cheer, even the foreigners were registered! On election day they were driven, like visiting notables, in <b>carryalls</b> and carriages to the polls! Some of them, as though in compensation for ills endured between elections, voted not once, but many times; exercising judicial functions for which they should be given credit. For instance, they were convinced that the Hon. W. W. Trulease had made a good governor; and they were Watling enthusiasts,--intent on sending men to the legislature who would vote for him for senator; yet there were cases in which, for the minor offices, the democrat was the better man! ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Good-by, everybody!” cried our hero, as {{he entered}} the <b>carryall</b> sleigh. “Take good care of the school until we come back!” ...|$|E
60|$|Back of {{the dock}} stood the big <b>carryall</b> {{attached}} to Putnam Hall, with the old Hall driver, Peleg Snuggers, on the box.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. The captain is too kind-hearted. He {{ought to}} drive 'em all away," [...] {{answered}} Peleg Snuggers; {{and then the}} <b>carryall</b> passed on.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was quite}} dark {{when he reached}} the upper field or first terrace of the Rancho. He could see the white walls of the casa rising dimly out of the green sea of early wild grasses, like a phantom island. It was here that the cut-off joined the main road--now the only one that led to the casa. He was {{satisfied}} that no one could have preceded him from Fair Plains; but it was true that he must take precautions against his own discovery. Dismounting near a clump of willows, he unsaddled and unbridled his horse, and with a cut of the riata over its haunches sent it flying across the field {{in the direction of a}} band of feeding mustangs, which it presently joined. Then, keeping well in the shadow of a belt of shrub-oaks, he skirted the long lesser terraces of the casa, intending to approach the house by way of the old garden and corral. A drizzling rain, occasionally driven by the wind into long, misty, curtain-like waves, obscured the prospect and favored his design. He reached the low adobe wall of the corral in safety; looking over he could detect, in spite of the darkness, that a number of the horses were of alien brands, and even recognized one or two from the Santa Inez district. The vague outline of buggies and <b>carryalls</b> filled the long shed beside the stables. There WAS company at the casa--so far Susy was right! ...|$|R
6000|$|America was in Freeport that day, {{the rush}} of her people and the {{surprise}} of her climate. The rain had ceased, and quickly was {{come out of the}} northwest a boisterous wind, chilled by the lakes and scented by the hemlocks of the Minnesota forests. The sun smiled and frowned Clouds hurried in the sky, mocking the human hubbub below. Cheering thousands pressed about the station as Mr. Lincoln's train arrived. They hemmed him in his triumphal passage under the great arching trees to the new Brewster House. The Chief Marshal and his aides, great men before, were suddenly immortal. The county delegations fell into their proper precedence like ministers at a state dinner. [...] "We have faith in Abraham, Yet another County for the Rail-sputter, Abe the Giant-killer,"--so the banners read. Here, much bedecked, was the Galena Lincoln Club, part of Joe Davies's shipment. Fifes skirled, and drums throbbed, and the stars and stripes snapped in the breeze. And here was a delegation headed by fifty sturdy ladies on horseback, at whom Stephen gaped like a countryman. Then came <b>carryalls</b> of all ages and degrees, wagons from this county and that county, giddily draped, drawn by horses from one to six, or by mules, their inscriptions addressing their senatorial candidate in all degrees of familiarity, but not contempt. What they seemed proudest of was that he had been a rail-splitter, for nearly all bore a fence-rail.|$|R
40|$|To obtain vehicle {{registration}} data that consistently and accurately reflect {{the distinction between}} automobiles and light-duty trucks, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was asked by FHWA to estimate the current and historical {{vehicle registration}} numbers of automobiles and of other two-axle four-tire vehicles (i. e., light-duty trucks), and their associated travel. The term automobile is synonymous with passenger car. Passenger cars are defined as all sedans, coupes, and station wagons manufactured primarily {{for the purpose of}} carrying passengers. This includes taxicabs, rental cars, and ambulances and hearses on an automobile chassis. Light-duty trucks refer to all two-axle four-tire vehicles other than passenger cars. They include pickup trucks, panel trucks, delivery and passenger vans, and other vehicles such as campers, motor homes, ambulances on a truck chassis, hearses on a truck chassis, and <b>carryalls.</b> In this study, light-duty trucks include four major types: (1) pickup truck, (2) van, (3) sport utility vehicle, and (4) other 2 -axle 4 -tire truck. Specifically, this project re-estimates statistics that appeared in Tables MV- 1 and MV- 9 of the 1995 Highway Statistics. Given the complexity of the approach developed in this effort and the incompleteness and inconsistency of the state-submitted data, it is recommended that alternatives be considered by FHWA to obtain vehicle registration data. One alternative is the Polk`s NVPP data (via the US Department of Transportation`s annual subscription to Polk). The second alternative is to obtain raw registration files from individual states` Departments of Motor Vehicles and to decode individual VINs...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! no! Oh, crickey!" [...] groaned {{the driver}} of the <b>carryall.</b> [...] "This is a mess! I--I didn't mean nuthin', gents, indeed, I didn't--" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the whip}} cracked, the <b>carryall</b> rolled from the door; and the Rover boys' days at Putnam Hall {{military}} school were at an end.|$|E
6000|$|Rose was {{up again}} before Dr. Alec {{was out of}} the <b>carryall,</b> and threw two dusty arms about his neck crying with a breathless voice, ...|$|E
60|$|The hour {{set for the}} Talk {{to begin}} was three o'clock, so that people could have their naps comfortably over, after the one o'clock dinner, and be just in the right frame of mind for listening. But long before the {{appointed}} time the people who dine at twelve, and never take an afternoon nap, began to arrive, on foot, in farm-wagons, smart buggies, mud-crusted <b>carryalls,</b> {{and all manner of}} ramshackle vehicles. They arrived as if coming to a circus, old husbands and wives, young couples and their children, pretty girls and their fellows, and hitched their horses to the tails of their wagons, and began to make a picnic lunch {{in the shadow of the}} grove lying between the hotel and the station. About two we heard the snorting of a locomotive at a time when no train was due, and a construction train came in view, with the men waving their handkerchiefs from the windows, and apparently ready for all the fun there was to be in the thing. Some of them had a small flag in each hand, the American Stars and Stripes and the white flag of Altruria, in compliment to my guest, I suppose. A good many of the farmers came over to the hotel to buy tickets, which they said they expected to get after they came, and Mrs. Makely was obliged to pacify them with all sorts of lying promises. From moment to moment she was in consultation with the landlord, who decided to throw open the dining-room, which connected with the parlor, so as to allow the help and the neighbors to hear without incommoding the hotel guests. She said that this took a great burden off her mind, and that now she should feel perfectly easy, for now no one could complain about being mixed up with the servants and the natives, and yet every one could hear perfectly.|$|R
60|$|His {{mother and}} James looked up, {{wondering}} what Rollo meant. He {{was looking out}} {{at the side of the}} <b>carryall,</b> at something about the wheel.|$|E
6000|$|So, when Rollo saw {{his father}} {{getting out of the}} <b>carryall,</b> he ran to meet him, and called out to him, talking very loud and rapidly, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I know, sir. But them hosses don't know nothin' about football, an' fust {{thing you}} know they'll run away," [...] pleaded the <b>carryall</b> driver.|$|E
60|$|The <b>carryall</b> was now {{leaving the}} little village of Cedarville. Soon {{it came out}} on a country road that ran in the {{direction}} of Putnam Hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look out, {{that you}} don't hit nobody with that fishin' pole!" [...] warned the <b>carryall</b> driver, as the turnout swung around a {{bend of the}} road.|$|E
6000|$|... "A carriage--with ladies!" [...] gasped Sam. [...] "Come on {{and stop}} them!" [...] And away he, dusted up the hill, {{as well as}} his short legs would carry him. Hans, Larry, and several others followed. They had barely gained {{the top of the hill}} when a large <b>carryall</b> {{belonging}} to John Laning appeared. In the <b>carryall</b> were the farmer and his two charming daughters, and, Mrs. Stanhope, who was his sister-in-law, and her daughter Dora. Mrs. Laning was also present, along with several neighbors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{he comes}} now," [...] was the answer, and looking {{back toward the}} highway, the cadets saw {{the driver of the}} <b>carryall</b> {{approaching}} on a swift limp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! Hi! What {{does this}} mean?" [...] {{came in a}} high-pitched voice, and Josiah Crabtree, the first assistant, rushed up to the <b>carryall.</b> [...] "What was that exploded?" ...|$|E
