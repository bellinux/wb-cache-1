40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Islets on 31 October 2014, available online: [URL] efforts have been invested to understand the mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory cytokines mediate the demise of β-cells in type 1 diabetes but much less {{attention has been paid}} to the role of anti-inflammatory cytokines as potential <b>cytoprotective</b> <b>agents</b> in these cells. Despite this, there is increasing evidence that anti-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 10 and IL- 13 can exert a direct influence of β-cell function and viability and that the circulating levels of these cytokines may be reduced in type 1 diabetes. Thus, it seems possible that targeting of anti-inflammatory pathways might offer therapeutic potential in this disease. In the present review, we consider the evidence implicating IL- 4, IL- 10 and IL- 13 as <b>cytoprotective</b> <b>agents</b> in the β-cell and discuss the receptor components and downstream signaling pathways that mediate these effects...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether audit/feedback and educational materials improve adherence to recommendations for laboratory monitoring and <b>cytoprotective</b> <b>agents</b> {{to detect and}} prevent adverse events caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). STUDY DESIGN: Controlled, cluster-randomized trial. METHODS: Physicians commonly prescribing NSAIDs were identified within a large managed care organization and randomized to a control or an intervention group (audit/feedback with peer-derived benchmarks and continuing medical education). Medical records were examined 10 months {{before and after the}} intervention for clinical data and receipt of complete blood count (CBC), creatinine testing, and <b>cytoprotective</b> <b>agents</b> (process measures). Primary analysis compared intervention versus control physicians among those who initially performed below a peer-derived benchmark. General estimating equations accounted for patient clustering. RESULTS: Of 101 physicians initially randomized, 85 remained eligible (38 internists, 36 family physicians, 11 rheumatologists) postintervention. Mean percent change in performance between intervention and control physicians for CBC monitoring was 16 % versus 10 %; for creatinine monitoring, 0 % versus 17 %; and use of <b>cytoprotective</b> <b>agents,</b> - 3 % versus - 1 %. None of these changes were significant. Rheumatology specialty, number of NSAID prescriptions and physician visits, and patient risk factors for NSAID-related toxicity were more strongly associated with improved safety practices than the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Audit/feedback and educational materials had no observed effect on improving NSAID-related safety practices. Potentially contributing factors include high baseline performance (ceiling effect), dilution of the intervention effect by case mix and provider factors, nonreceipt of intervention materials, and diverse indications for lab tests...|$|R

We have previously published that squalene protects light-density bone marrow cells against cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) -induced toxicity without protecting tumor cells in vitro. Here, we developed an in vivo mouse model of cisplatin and cis-diammine (cyclobutane- 1, 1 -dicarboxylato) platinum(II) (carboplatin) -induced toxicity to further investigate squalene-mediated LD-BM cytoprotection including the molecular mechanism behind selective cytoprotection. We found that squalene significantly reduced the body weight loss of cisplatin and carboplatin-treated mice. Light-density bone marrow cells from squalene-treated mice exhibited improved formation of hematopoietic colonies (colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage). Furthermore, squalene also protected mesenchymal stem cell colonies (colony-forming unit-fibroblast) from cisplatin and carboplatin-induced toxicity. Squalene-induced protection was associated with decreased reactive oxygen species and increased levels of glutathione and glutathione peroxidase/glutathione-S-transferase. Importantly, squalene did not protect neuroblastoma, small cell carcinoma, or medulloblastoma xenografts against cisplatin-induced toxicity.

We found that binding of caprylic acid (CA) and N-acetyl-L-tryptophan (N-AcTrp) to defatted mercaptalbumin increased S-nitrosation by S-nitrosoglutathione (GS-NO) by making Cys- 34 of HSA more accessible and by protecting it against oxidation, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the cytoprotective activity of GST-TAT-SOD against cisplatin-induced damage. The current study showed that cisplatin induced the formation of reactive oxygen species in normal L- 02 cells. GST-TAT-SOD (2000 [*]U/mL) executed its antioxidant role by directly scavenging excess intracellular free radicals and augmenting cellular antioxidant defense such as reducing MDA level, enhancing the SOD activity, GST activity, and T-AOC. Thus, it suppressed the growth inhibition and apoptosis of cisplatin-treated normal cells. Meanwhile, the growth inhibition of tumor cells (SMMC- 7721) caused by cisplatin was unaffected by GST-TAT-SOD pretreatment. GST-SOD, as a comparison, seemed to be powerless for related indicators as it could not enter into cells without cell-permeating peptide.

This study describes the direct effect of amifostine on kidney and tumor uptake of 111 In- DOTA,Tyr 3 -octreotate. Methods: In vivo biodistribution studies were performed using CA 20948 tumor-bearing rats, with or without amifostine coadministration, via several routes. In vitro uptake was studied in somatostatin receptor-expressing CA 20948 and megalin or cubilin receptor-expressing BN- 16 cells, in the absence or presence of amifostine or its active metabolite WR- 1065. Results: Coadministration of amifostine decreased renal uptake of radiolabeled octreotate in vivo, whereas tumor uptake was not affected. In agreement, amifostine and WR- 1065 coincubation reduced uptake in BN- 16 but not in CA 20948 cells. Conclusion: Amifostine may provide renal protection during PRRT using somatostatin analogs, both by mitigation of radiation damage and the currently observed reduction of absorbed kidney radiation dose.

Eckol suppressed the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and increased glutathione level in HepG 2 cells. Eckol treatment enhanced the expression of HO- 1 at the both level of protein and mRNA in HepG 2 cells.
