40|$|Accurate {{co-registration}} of multi-sensor data is {{a primary}} step in data integration for photogrammetric and remote sensing applications. A proven intensity-based registration approach is Mutual Information (MI). However the effectiveness of MI for automated registration of multi-sensor remote sensing data can be impacted {{to the point of}} failure by its non-monotonic <b>convergence</b> <b>surface.</b> Since MI-based methods rely on joint probability density functions (PDF) for the datasets, errors in PDF estimation can directly affect the MI value. Certain PDF parameter values, such as the bin-size of the joint histogram and the smoothing kernel, need to be assigned in advance, since they {{play a key role in}} forming the <b>convergence</b> <b>surface.</b> The lack of a general approach to the assignment of these parameter values for various data types reduces both the automation level and the robustness of registration. This paper proposes a new approach for selection of optimal parameter values for PDF estimation in MI-based registration of optical imagery to LiDAR point clouds. The proposed method determines the best parameters for PDF estimation via an analysis of the relationship between similarity measure values of the data and the adopted geometric transformation in order to achieve the optimal registration reliability. The performance of the proposed parameter selection method is experimentally evaluated and the obtained results are compared with those achieved through a feature-based registration method...|$|E

I investigated two sites in southern Oregon with different nearshore hydrodynamics: the first site, Sunset Bay, is a small cove with a topographic front that extends across the mouth during upwelling-favorable winds. Using holey sock drogues at 1. 5 m and 5. 5 m depths and surface drifters at 10 cm depth, I found that, when the front was present, water at 1. 5 m was retained within the bay whereas water was exchanged across the front {{at a depth of}} 5. 5 m. Surface drifters indicated a surface <b>convergence.</b> <b>Surface</b> plankton tows on either side and within the frontal convergence (a shore-parallel foam line) found significantly higher concentrations of barnacle cyprids, crab megalopae and zoea, polychaete larvae, platyhelminthes juveniles, isopods, amphipods, harpacticoid copepods, and fish eggs. Crustacean nauplii (barnacle, euphausiid, and copepod) and calanoid copepods were not concentrated in the convergence, and when the front and foam line were absent, no taxa were concentrated. Plankton tows taken within the foam line as it dissipated shoreward during a wind-reversal event found that concentrations of cyprids, megalopae, and gastropod veligers remained high as the foam line moved, suggesting that it acts as a moving convergence propagating competent larvae shoreward. I measured settlement of two taxa at Sunset Bay and Shore Acres, an open-coast site < 2 km away. Barnacle settlement measured every other day from June-September 2013 was significantly cross-correlated with the maximum daily tidal height at lags of - 2 days at Sunset Bay and + 2 and + 4 days at Shore Acres. Settlement was also significantly negatively cross-correlated with wave height at a lag of - 4 days at Sunset Bay. Coralline algae settlement measured during eight 48 -hr periods in July-August 2013 was significantly negatively correlated with wave height (n = 8, R 2 = 0. 76, P = 0. 0049) at Shore Acres but not at Sunset Bay. Despite the close proximity of the Sunset Bay and Shore Acres sites, settlement patterns differed between taxa, suggesting that differences in nearshore hydrodynamics might affect the supply of water and larvae to shore.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to develop and test a 3 -dimensional method for direct measurement of flow convergence (FC) region surface area and for quantitating regurgitant flows with an in vitro flow system. BACKGROUND: Quantitative methods for characterizing regurgitant flow events such as flow convergence with 2 -dimensional color flow Doppler imaging systems have yielded variable results and may not be accurate enough to characterize those more complex spatial events. METHOD: Four differently shaped regurgitant orifices were studied: 3 flat orifices (circular, rectangular, triangular) and a nonflat one mimicking mitral valve prolapse (all 4 orifice areas = 0. 24 cm(2)) in a pulsatile flow model at 8 to 9 different regurgitant flow rates (10 to 50 mL/beat). An ultrasonic flow probe and meter were connected to the flow model to provide reference flow data. Video composite data from the color Doppler flow images of the FC were reconstructed after computer-controlled 180 degrees rotational acquisition was performed. FC surface area (S cm(2)) was calculated directly without any geometric assumptions by measuring parallel sliced flow convergence arc lengths through the FC volume and multiplying each by the slice thickness (2. 5 to 3. 2 mm) over 5 to 8 slices and then adding them together. Peak regurgitant flow rate (milliliters per second) was calculated as the product of 3 -dimensional determined S (cm(2)) multiplied by the aliasing velocity (centimeters per second) used for color Doppler imaging. RESULTS: For all of the 4 shaped orifices, there was an excellent relationship between actual peak flow rates and 3 -dimensional FC-calculated flow rates with the direct measurement of the surface area of FC (r = 0. 99, mean difference = - 7. 2 to - 0. 81 mL/s, % difference = - 5 % to 0 %), whereas a hemielliptic method implemented with 3 axial measurements of the flow convergence zone from 2 -dimensional planes underestimated actual flow rate by mean difference = - 39. 8 to - 18. 2 mL/s, % difference = - 32 % to - 17 % for any given orifice. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional reconstruction of flow based on 2 -dimensional color Doppler may add quantitative spatial information, especially for complex flow events.

40|$|I {{agree with}} the authors that {{forecasting}} the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in a high resolution global model is important for numerous reasons, including improved weather forecast skill beyond 10 days, and resolving small scale features embedded in the MJO that coarse resolution ({approx} 100 - 300 km horizontal grid spacing) climate models do not (e. g., tropical cyclones). Unfortunately, the authors promote the (incorrect) overall impression that coarse resolution climate models cannot simulate the MJO by (a) only discussing aspects of works that indicate the poor ability of coarse resolution climate models to simulate the MJO, and (b) by promoting the use of higher resolution models, and the use of embedded two-dimensional cloud resolving models embedded in coarse resolution climate models as the principal methods for realistically representing the MJO because of the difficulty of coarse resolution models 'to estimate the vertical redistribution of heat and moisture by unresolved convective clouds'. Regarding items (a) and (b), I have co-authored two of the works cited by Miura et al. that bemoan the poor ability of coarse resolution climate models to simulate the MJO, and indeed simulating the MJO in coarse resolution climate models is a grand challenge. However, I would like to draw to their attention to work that has demonstrated that two different coarse resolution climate models, using conventional parameterizations of convection and clouds, can represent the MJO with high fidelity. In the later study, where more complete model diagnostics were available, important aspects of the MJO that were realistically represented included the relationship between convection and low-level moisture <b>convergence,</b> <b>surface</b> fluxes, the vertical structure of winds and divergence, and important air-sea interactions. Additionally, regarding item (b), convection is certainly of central importance in representing the MJO, but it is the interaction of convection (parameterized or otherwise) with other aspects of the model physics that is important. Thus, it is the implementation of the full physics package that is relevant, not simply the manner in which convection is represented. The issue at hand is to determine what aspects of the physics present in the high resolution (and embedded 2 -dimensional cloud resolving model) simulations are essential for incorporation into coarse resolution climate model parameterizations {{in order for them to}} adequately represent the MJO. In the foreseeable future, models used for climate and climate change studies will continue to require convective parameterization in order to produce simulations that span decadal to centennial time scales to estimate the impact of anthropogenic influences on the statistics of weather variability and extremes. As such, intercomparison across different classes of modeling is essential to better understand the physics relevant to the climate system...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 Frictional <b>surface</b> <b>convergence</b> {{is shown}} to be {{important}} to the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) of the tropical troposphere using both observations and an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). An observed composite MJO lifecycle is created using the first two empirical orthogonal functions of the NCEP 850 mb equatorial zonal wind as an index. Lower tropospheric water vapor over the Indian and western Pacific Oceans is significantly correlated with 1000 mb convergence during an MJO lifecycle. Frictional convergence may help to precondition the atmosphere for strong MJO convection by moistening the lower troposphere. Several convection schemes were substituted into the NCAR CCM 3 GCM to improve model intraseasonal variability. The McRAS convection scheme, that includes a parameterization of unsaturated convective downdrafts and a relative humidity threshold for convective initiation, produces much improved intraseasonal variability over the default CCM 3 convection scheme of Zhang and McFarlane. Intraseasonal variability is decreased for higher relative humidity thresholds with McRAS, contrary {{to the results of}} Wang and Schlesinger (1999). Removal of the unsaturated convective downdraft and rain evaporation parameterization greatly diminishes intraseasonal variability in zonal winds and precipitation. An excessively dry tropical troposphere is most likely responsible for the degradation of intraseasonal variability. Low-level MJO specific humidity anomalies in the model are strongly correlated with <b>surface</b> <b>convergence.</b> This strong coupling with <b>surface</b> <b>convergence</b> causes model MJO convection anomalies to be associated with 850 mb easterly perturbations. Where the eastward propagating model MJO signal is strong, low-level specific humidity anomalies precede those at middle and upper levels. <b>Surface</b> <b>convergence</b> affects model convection by moistening the lower troposphere, suggesting that <b>surface</b> <b>convergence</b> during an MJO lifecycle may help to precondition the atmosphere for intense MJO convection. Meridional convergence onto the equator contributes most of the anomalous convergence during an MJO lifecycle in both the model and observations.

Composite analysis using NCEP reanalysis data indicates that perturbation available potential energy (PAPE) production through the positive correlation of intraseasonal temperature and convective diabatic heating anomalies supports the local intensification of MJO-related east Pacific warm pool wind anomalies. PAPE production is maximum {{during periods of}} strong MJO convection and low-level westerly wind perturbations. PAPE is converted to perturbation kinetic energy through positive correlations between intraseasonal temperature and vertical velocity. Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) temperature and NOAA outgoing longwave radiation data support the energy budget results derived from NCEP reanalysis. The amplified east Pacific circulation enhances <b>surface</b> <b>convergence</b> and latent heat flux anomalies during MJO convective periods. The <b>surface</b> <b>convergence</b> anomalies have a strong frictional component. Intraseasonal <b>surface</b> <b>convergence</b> and latent heat flux anomalies are strongly correlated (greater than 0. 7) with the negative outgoing longwave radiation anomalies {{that is associated with}} east Pacific MJO convective regions. Surface latent heat and convergence variations may therefore be important in modulating MJO convective anomalies over the east Pacific during June–November. Enhanced <b>surface</b> flux and <b>convergence</b> anomalies associated with an enhanced surface circulation may intensify MJO convection, thereby creating a feedback loop that leads to the further intensification of local wind and convection anomalies. Work with mesoscale or general circulation models is needed to confirm that surface latent heat and convergence variations are indeed important for modulating east Pacific MJO convection. Enhanced MJO convection over the boreal summer east Pacific is accompanied by positive water vapor anomalies throughout the troposphere. Column precipitable water anomalies from both NASA Water Vapor Project (NVAP) and NCEP reanalysis are in phase with MJO convection anomalies over the east Pacific.

Such a thickness was enough to assure <b>convergence</b> in <b>surface</b> energy with respect to the slab thickness. All of the atoms in the slab were allowed to relax. We adopted the same exchange and correlation potentials and energy cut-off as for SiNWs and GeNWs. The <b>convergence</b> in <b>surface</b> energy was found to be satisfactory (less than 0.01 eV/Å 2) on the grid of 9 × 9 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack points for the (112), (011) and (001) surfaces and on the grid of 7 × 15 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack points for the (111) surfaces. Atomic relaxation was stopped when the forces on atoms were less than 0.01 eV/Å. The surface energy is calculated as a difference between the energy of a silicon or germanium atom in the bulk multiplied by the number of atoms in a slab and the total energy of a slab. Then this difference can be expressed per unit cell or square unit area. In order to calculate a dependence of the surface energy on an in-plane lattice parameter, we have eliminated any residual elastic effect caused by compression or expansion of an in-plane lattice parameter for corresponding bulk cases, where the tetragonal-like distortion has occurred in the unit cell to construct a slab along with relaxation of the lattice parameter which is perpendicular to the corresponding surface plane.
