5000|$|<b>Cabin</b> <b>seat,</b> These {{seats are}} {{designed}} to give the business class traveler the most privacy they can attain while in flight. These seats are typically positioned in a 1 - 2 - 1 arrangement on a wide body jet. On {{each side of the}} seat is a privacy panel about 4 feet in height. Aircraft such as these offer the best ergonomic comfort on long haul business class flights. These were first introduced on US Airways ...|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} with NBC's Today Show on October 5, 2006, Sharkey said he was relaxing in his <b>cabin</b> <b>seat</b> with the window shade down when he was jolted by a bang. [...] "It {{was more like a}} car that hits a pothole rather than 'boom!'" [...] he said. The plane steadied itself and it became serenely silent again. It was only when Sharkey opened the shade and looked out his window that he noticed something was dreadfully amiss. [...] "My heart just sank because I looked at the wing tip and I saw that it was shorn off,” he told Today host Matt Lauer. [...] "Basically four feet of the wingtip, the part that curves up, the winglet, gone... I’ve flown a lot, and I’m thinking, 'This is definitely, definitely not good.'" ...|$|E

40|$|In current {{research}} design and optimisation of cargo truck <b>cabin</b> <b>seat</b> plate has been executed. In particular study a traditional steel sheet material {{has been replaced}} by thermoplastic glass/polypropylene composite. Such a design should enable a possibility of quick one shot manufacturing of composite structure and in addition it provides a significant weight savings. As a basis for redesign serves topological optimisation based on existing metallic part geometry which has been imported in finite elements code ANSYS. The load case corresponding to the car crash seat pull test according to ECE-R 14 standard has been applied for selection of material savings and for additional reinforcement. Preliminary optimisation results indicated areas where volume of material should be increased or in contrary decreased. It was confirmed that the special treatment should be given to areas under front and rear load bearing points in order to prevent them from the local stress concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out {{as a part of}} the iSPACE project and its aim was to assist in the scope of {{fulfilling}} specific human thermal comfort needs in the frame of an individual aircraft <b>cabin</b> <b>seat.</b> A detailed simulation study of individualized ventilation schemes in aircraft cabin seats was performed with the use of CFD methods. The ventilation schemes were selected based on a previously conducted parametric numerical study of personalised ventilation inlets of various sizes and locations in the aircraft suite. These selected schemes were then applied to business class seats and first class suites, with the boundary conditions based on physical measurements taken during actual subject testing. The study was was performed in an aircraft lining section, comprising of actual human subjects, passive manikins and some empty ’control’ seats. The simulation study was conducted using an open source based CFD process (ICON FOAMpro) and a proprietary software (STAR CCM+). The results were validated against probe measurements from the subject testing and evaluated in order to illustrate the thermal conditions achieved by the individualized ventilation scenarios...|$|E
40|$|In current {{research}} design, optimisation and prototyping of truck <b>cabin</b> <b>seat</b> plate made of thermoplastic GF/PP composite has been performed. In particular study a conventional steel sheet material has been substituted by lightweight thermoplastic alternative. Such a design should enable {{a possibility of}} quick one shot manufacturing of composite structure and in addition it provides a significant weight savings. As a basis for redesign serves topological optimisation based on existing metallic part geometry which has been imported in finite elements code for material distribution analysis. The load case corresponding to the car seat pull test ECE-R 14 standard has been applied. Optimisation results indicated that composite part could reach 35 % of the initial steel part. However special treatment {{should be given to}} areas under front and rear load bearing points in order to prevent them from the local stress concentration. Therefore final seat plate design has reinforcement areas (patches) under the frame fixation points. For validation purposes prototypes have been examined by non-destructive methods comparing experimental and numerical eigenfrequencies and mode shape results. It was confirmed that experimental prototypes has close matching mode shapes and eigenfrequencies values. In addition local loading on the seat plate fragment have been performed prior to general installation of the whole structure in the truck cabin and executing seat pull-out test. Test demonstrated that displacements at the required load level do not exceed design load values...|$|E

China railway {{high-speed}} {{still in}} the infant stage, no matter referring to technology or design, we have relative big gap comparing to German ICE, French Alstom and Japanese Shinkansen.

Accordingly, it is easily to cause a lot of problems. This paper discussed the man-machine measure of the VIP seat in our country’s new generation very high-speed train and the main elements which influencing body comfort index from the aspect of anthropometry. And through Jack TM- body modeling and simulation software to the seat measure to process verification, so that we can make sure the rationality of design, and consequently offering a dependable and comfortable VIP seat man-machine measure for China railway high-speed.
