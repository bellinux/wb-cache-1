5|$|At {{the turn}} of the year, Johnson was subject to {{interest}} from First Division club Nottingham Forest. An initial £2.5million bid was turned down on 4 January 2001, but Forest <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> an improved bid of £3.5million, and the transfer was completed on 12 January 2001. He made his debut two days later in a 3–0 home defeat to Crystal Palace. He scored just two goals in the remainder of the season, the first against Grimsby Town on 24 February 2001, and the second against Sheffield United on 10 March.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees did {{not reach}} the World Series in 1997, but <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> {{one of the better}} seasons in {{baseball}} history in 1998, which culminated in a win over the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series. The Red Sox, too, made the playoffs in 1998, but as a Wild Card, they did not seriously contend for the division title. They ultimately lost their ALDS.|$|E
5|$|Accusing the Song {{of violating}} the {{agreement}} and realizing {{the weakness of the}} Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege, <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E
5|$|By around 1981 in the UK, {{the future}} for Concorde looked bleak. The British {{government}} had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for £16.5million plus the first year's profits. British Airways was subsequently privatized in 1987.|$|E

5|$|This {{would be}} a turning point of the game, as the Giants, who had trouble {{mounting}} many drives to that point, <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a 95–yard drive. The key play of the drive was Conerly's pass to Kyle Rote, who after a 62–yard gain, fumbled at the Colts' 25–yard line, where Alex Webster picked up the ball and ran it to the 1–yard line. New York then scored a touchdown, to make the score 14–10. The Giants drove again, with quarterback Charley Conerly throwing a 15–yard touchdown pass to Frank Gifford to take the lead, 17–14.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Clark was reinstated. With Clark back in {{the lineup}} for a home game against St. Bonaventure Bonnies, Ron Everhart tried a new {{starting}} lineup: one that included Bolding and Monteiro, but left Senior Jason Duty on the bench. The Dukes took a 15point lead at half time, but the Bonnies <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> <b>With</b> less than thirty seconds left, Bill Clark drew a charging penalty which gave his team the ball, down by two. One quick possession by each team left it 67–69 {{in favor of the}} Bonnies. On the final play, Damian Saunders drove towards the basket before passing it out to Melquan Bolding, who hit a 3-point shot to put the Dukes up by one with 3.5 seconds remaining. Duquesne won 70–69, giving them their first win since December 22.|$|E
5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E

5|$|In {{the main}} event and final {{scheduled}} match on the card, Bret Hart defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Yokozuna. Hart tried to use his technical wrestling abilities against Yokozuna, while Yokozuna relied on his size advantage in the match. Hart gained control at the beginning, but Yokozuna <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a clothesline, leg drop, and nerve hold. Hart regained the advantage when Yokozuna missed a running splash. Yokozuna applied another nerve hold but missed a running splash again. He recovered and carried Hart {{to the middle of}} the ring, but Hart removed the protective padding on the turnbuckle in the corner of the ring. He threw Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle and applied the Sharpshooter, his signature submission hold that stretches the opponent's legs and back. Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, threw salt in Hart's eyes, which enabled Yokozuna to pin Hart and win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{practice}} session was 17minutes {{shorter than the}} scheduled 60minutes, due to Kovalainen's Renault having a suspected engine failure. The failure caused oil to be split on the track, this failure persisted during the race weekend. This resulted in a red flag period, from 10:33am until 10:50am local time. Hamilton led the practice with the fastest lap; with Räikkönen, Alonso and Massa posting the second, third and fourth fastest laps respectively. Sato finished the session with the fifth fastest lap in the Super Aguri car, outpacing the Honda works team {{for the second time}} during the race weekend. Toyota continued a disappointing race weekend, with the 14th and 16th fastest laps. Their suspension problems from the day before had not been resolved, and the two drivers were given instructions to avoid the kerbs at turn 8 to minimise further damage to the suspension. Red Bull <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> both of the two repaired cars entering the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish fleet arrived off Roatán at 6am on March 13, {{and after}} its {{defenders}} fired several ineffectual cannon shots, the Santa Maltilda {{and the other}} ships anchored out of range. At 8am Gálvez sent his second-in-command on the 'Santa Matilda' Enrique MacDonell, who spoke English, in to request the surrender of the island's defenders. The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options, which Gálvez granted. After that time had elapsed MacDonell <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> word that the defenders refused to surrender and were prepared to stand their ground 'to the death'. The Spanish were not surprised as their sailors had noticed the English appeared to be preparing defenses during grace period. An Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so Gálvez then held council of his eleven officers, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E

5|$|The 2010–11 season saw {{virtually}} no {{change to the}} structure of the season or league. All teams from the previous season remained in the league, and the number of games remained at 36. The regular season ran from 18 September 2010 to 20 February 2011. After two years of leading the league, Halla slipped to fourth place and Oji Eagles took the regular season honors with 76 points. Shunhei Kuji of Oji lead the league with 24 goals, while his teammate Yosuke Kon led with 45 assists. However, with a couple of second-place finishes, Go Tanaka of the Free Blades led the overall points race with 59. The League also maintained the number of play-off teams at four. Anyang faced Oji while Nippon faced Tohoku. Halla managed to take two of three in Japan and defeat Oji on home ice to advance. The Free Blades needed all five games to defeat the Cranes but the team <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> two straight wins to advance to the final {{for the first time in}} their short time in the league. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake near the Free Blades hometown forced the League to cancel the finals. Halla had already in Japan just an hour before the disaster struck the area. Fortunately, both teams survived, but the League felt the final could not go on. On 22 March 2011 the League declared that both Halla and the Free Blades would be declared co-champions. Though shortened, Masato Domeki of Oji led the playoffs with four goals, Bruce Mulherin led with six assists and fellow Free Blade Brad Farynuk had eights points overall.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Brooklyn Dodgers {{in the sixth}} game of the season. While the Dodgers had not won a game all season, they started off strong against Cleveland. The Browns took a 10–0 lead in the first quarter, but the Dodgers {{answered}} with 10 points of their own {{in the second quarter}} to tie the score at halftime. Edgar Jones ran for Cleveland's first touchdown, which Groza followed with a 53-yard field goal, the longest of his career at the time. Brooklyn's Mickey Colmer ran in the team's second-quarter touchdown after a 66-yard drive. The Browns <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> another touchdown in the third quarter, aided by two long Horace Gillom receptions, but the Dodgers again evened the score after a Groza field goal was blocked and returned by Hank Foldberg for a touchdown. Cleveland pulled away in the fourth quarter, however, with a fumble recovery for a touchdown by George Young and a short run by Motley. The Browns had 23 first downs in the game, setting a team record. Groza missed an extra point after one of Cleveland's touchdowns, breaking a long streak. He also narrowly missed a 57-yard field goal attempt that would have set a professional football record if it were good.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Steel cage {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Triple H and Randy Orton. During the {{beginning}} of the match, Triple H gained the advantage over Orton, as he performed a High Knee on Orton. Orton <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a kick to the gut before starting his prolonged attack and attempting to escape through the cage door but Triple H prevented him from escaping. Triple H took control as he took out Orton's knee with a chop block and applied a figure four leglock. After Orton broke the hold, he crawled across to the cage door to escape, but Triple H grabbed him back inside. But, on the way back in, Orton managed to grab a steel chair that was on the ring floor. Orton tried to hit Triple H with the chair, but Triple H managed to avoid being hit. Triple H grabbed the chair to hit Orton with it, but Orton hit him in the groin. Orton followed this with a chair shot to Triple H's back and performed a DDT. Throughout the match, Orton tried escaping from the cage, but was not in successful in doing so, as Triple H dragged him back in each time. The match came to an end when Orton tried to execute a running punt on Triple H's head, however, Triple H grabbed the chair and hit Orton with it. Triple H followed up by executing a pedigree. Triple H covered Orton for the pinfall victory, and thus retaining his title.|$|E
