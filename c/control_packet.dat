5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General <b>Control</b> <b>Packet</b> and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General <b>Control</b> <b>Packet</b> carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E

50|$|The Flow Control {{specification}} defines packet formats and protocols {{for simple}} XON/XOFF flow control operations. Flow control packets can be originated by switches and endpoints.

50|$|Since the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) {{does not}} perform {{congestion}} <b>control</b> on <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> (pure ACKs, SYN, FIN segments), <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> {{are usually not}} marked as ECN-capable.|$|R
30|$|If <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> are {{transmitted}} serially, one after one, to avoid risk of <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> corruption and to save cost and complexity from signal processinga in MU-MIMO, {{it leads to}} heavy overhead in time and ultimately decreases the network performance. If the <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> {{are transmitted}} simultaneously to decrease overhead's effect, it leads to higher cost and complexity in signal processing and may also {{increase the risk of}} <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> corruption. Hence, MU-MIMO fails to give similar performance to that of SU-MIMO while maintaining the same level of network cost and complexity.|$|R

40|$|ZRP {{is one of}} the {{well-known}} Hybrid routing protocols in MANET. But still it has lots of limitations due to network load by many useless <b>control</b> <b>packets.</b> When the protocol searches for a new route, it sends many worthless <b>control</b> <b>packets.</b> To enhance the ZRP in this paper, we propose ZMRP (Zone Multicast Routing Protocol). ZMRP reduces the network load by limiting the number of <b>control</b> <b>packets,</b> when the protocol searches for a new route...|$|R
30|$|Protocol {{operation}} overhead {{is measured}} as {{the ratio of}} the average number of <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> transmitted by the APs during the simulation period and network throughput.

5000|$|If P0 is a {{full-length}} packet whereas P1 {{is only a}} small <b>control</b> <b>packet</b> of size of few flits, then this scheme allows P1 pass through both routers while P0 is slowed down for a short time corresponding to the transmission of few packets. This reduces latency for P1.|$|E
50|$|It {{was found}} that the {{simplest}} way to <b>control</b> <b>packet</b> traffic is to limit the length of queues. Long queues in the network invariably occur at hosts (entities that can transmit and receive packets). Congestion control can therefore be achieved by reducing the rate of packet production at hosts with long queues.|$|E
30|$|Routing Overhead Ratio (ROR): ROR {{is defined}} as the ratio between the total number of bytes of <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> and the {{cumulative}} size of data packets which are delivered to the destinations to the total number of <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> and the cumulative size of data packets sent.|$|R
50|$|The packets {{exchanged}} {{within an}} L2TP tunnel are categorized as either <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> or data packets. L2TP provides reliability features for the <b>control</b> <b>packets,</b> but no reliability for data packets.

3000|$|... b {{illustrates}} that NRL is smaller in the MATF {{as compared to}} the SATF. The reason is the more packet delivery ratio per <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> in the MATF. As the SATF suffers from more packet loss as shown in the figure, <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> sent per data packet is higher, which causes higher NRL in the SATF. Overall, the routing overhead is increasing in both the schemes with an increase in the node speed. The reason for this behavior is that to maintain the routes under high node mobility, more <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> are transmitted.|$|R
50|$|The QoS {{concept as}} used in LTE {{networks}} is class-based, where each bearer type is assigned one QoS Class Identifier (QCI) by the network.

50|$|In addition, both {{standards}} define {{audio control}} packets.

The audio <b>control</b> <b>packet</b> contains audio-related metadata, such as its timing relative to video, which channels are present, etc.|$|E
50|$|The Data Streaming {{specification}} also defines Extended Header flow <b>control</b> <b>packet</b> formats and semantics {{to manage}} performance within a client-server system. Each client uses extended header flow control packets {{to inform the}} server {{of the amount of}} work that could be sent to the server.

50|$|At {{the time}} of setup of L2TP connection, many <b>control</b> <b>packets</b> are {{exchanged}} between server and client to establish tunnel and session for each direction.

50|$|The Model 70 was a multi-node, {{fault-tolerant}} {{solution for}} distributed and large installations. The Model 70 could support more than 20,000 stations in 15 nodes. The Model 70 offered redundancy, like the Model 50, with added redundancy in the hardware supporting the multi-node configuration: the <b>Control</b> <b>Packet</b> Network (CPN, for CPU-to-CPU communications) and the internode links (INLs, the node-to-node links). Power redundancy was optional. Model 70 nodes may be: Co-located: up to 200 ft with right-of-way, connected with twinaxial INLs; Distributed: up to abbr=on 20,000 ft with right-of-way, connected with fiber-optic INLs; Remote: up to 50 miles km, or with no right-of-way, connected using Extended Digital Interties (XDI) over standard T1 facilities.|$|E

ABR is an on-demand routing protocol, i.e., routes are created only as and when needed. This, in contrast, to the existing Internet where routes are immediately available and routing tables are constantly updated among routers. According to the publications, on-demand routing is chosen because it can reduce the amount of <b>control</b> <b>packet</b> traffic and this is suitable for a wireless network because bandwidth is limited.|$|E

The control signal is transmitted in optical form in a separated wavelength termed the control channel, but signaled out of band and processed electronically at each OBS router, whereas the data burst is transmitted in all optical form from one end to the other end of the network.
