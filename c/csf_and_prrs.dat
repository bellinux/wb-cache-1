40|$|This {{study had}} two {{different}} aims. The main {{aim was to}} investigate the dynamics and impact of African swine fever (ASF) on a farm in Uganda during a recent outbreak through a case study. The second aim was to estimate the presence of two important differential diagnoses of ASF: Classical swine fever (CSF) and Porcine Reproduction and Respiratory syndrome (PRRS). The field and laboratory based case study of the farm level dynamics of ASF virus during a recent outbreak (October-December 2010) on a farm in the district of Mityana, Uganda, was conducted, using interviews, ELISA and RT-PCR. The financial impact on the farm was also estimated. The impact of the outbreak was profound. The farmer lost approximately over half of the population of pigs; mainly adults and newborn piglets were affected. Weaners and older piglets survived to a relatively larger extent. The outbreak spread between pens and units probably via direct and indirect contact. The source of the infection was difficult to identify since there were several suspected sources. A pilot study of presence <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> <b>PRRS</b> in Uganda was conducted using ELISA and RT-PCR in a cross-sectional study on 239 samples from the district of Rakai in southern Uganda and 80 samples from reported outbreaks of mortality in pigs where ASF virus had not been confirmed as the cause. All samples were negative for CSF and only one sample was seropositive for PRRS. The one positive sample for PRRS was suspected to be a false positive.

40|$|The {{state of}} {{diseases}} in South African domestic pigs drastically changed when Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) {{was introduced in}} the Western Cape Province during 2004 and was followed by an outbreak of Classical swine fever (CSF), primarily in the Eastern Cape, in 2005. These outbreaks occurred mostly in rural and backyard pig populations. Subsequent to an intensive culling operation, it became necessary to implement country-wide surveillance to substantiate that freedom from these two diseases had been achieved. Samples for a country-wide cross-sectional study were collected from commercial and non-commercial pig establishments in a combined effort between the South African Pig Producers Organisation (SAPPO) and the National and Provincial Departments of Agriculture, Veterinary Services. The survey targeted the high-risk sector of the pig population and included rural pig populations, pigs from “grey” herds (commercial farms with inadequate bio-security) and commercial establishments. Samples were also tested for Swine influenza (SI), Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), Aujeszky’s Disease (Aujeszky’s), Foot-and-mouth Disease (FMD) and African swine fever (ASF). The first objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the validity of the survey design. The second objective was to evaluate the results and, thereafter, make valid inferences regarding the disease status of the domestic pig population. This also included the confidence level of the overall survey. The third objective was to qualify and quantify sample losses to enable improved future survey design and execution. The outcome of the survey indicated that the results were sufficient to conclude that the non-commercial pig population is free from CSF, PRRS and SI at the expected minimum prevalence of 1 %. The calculations also indicated that the results were adequate to conclude that the commercial pig population is free from CSF, PRRS and SI at the expected minimum prevalence of 5 %. The outcome of the calculations done on the second phase test results allows South Africa to conclude that the non-commercial pig sector is free from FMD, ASF, Aujeszky’s and TGE, at the expected minimum prevalence of 2 %. The sample sizes for Aujeszky’s, TGE, ASF and FMD tests in the commercial sector were too small to allow for a decision to be made and, as a result, it was not possible to declare this sector free of disease. However, the non-commercial sector is much larger and the risk of disease introduction higher, therefore, if the non-commercial sector tested negative for the disease, it is highly likely that the commercial sector will be free of the disease as well. It is recommended that passive surveillance be augmented and that a national pig survey be conducted every 3 years to provide proof of disease freedom. It is important to conduct a risk analysis to qualify and quantify the risk of <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> <b>PRRS</b> introduction. This could improve future surveys by providing a scientific basis for targeted surveillance. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

Both approaches clearly revealed compositional and quantitative differences between DRR <b>and</b> <b>PRR.</b> UPLC-MS data indicated stachyose, rehmaionoside A (or rehmaionoside B), acteoside (or forsythiaside, or isoacteoside), 6 -O-coumaroylajugol (or 6 -O-E-feruloylajugol, or 6 -O-Z-feruloylajugol) as important discriminators between DRR <b>and</b> <b>PRR</b> decoctions. HPLC-ELSD analysis showed that the content of fructose in the decoctions of PRR was about four times greater than that of DRR (P< 10 − 5), while sucrose content in the decoctions of PRR was only about one seventh of that in DRR (P< 0. 01). Our results suggest that some compounds, such as fructose, stachyose and rehmaionoside, may be responsible for the differing therapeutic effects of DRR <b>and</b> <b>PRR.</b> Furthermore, improvements in quality control for PRR, which is currently lacking in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, are recommended...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the limited white matter axonal injury evoked by catheter insertion by analyzing a panel of markers for tissue damage in <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum. METHODS: Lumbar <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum were collected before catheter insertion and at regular intervals during the follow-up period of 1 year. Levels of neurofilament light polypeptide (NF-L), glial fibrillary acidic protein, microtubule-associated protein tau, and S 100 calcium binding protein B were measured in the <b>CSF,</b> <b>and</b> NF-L was also quantified in serum at each time point. RESULTS: One month after neurosurgical trauma, there was a distinct peak in NF-L concentration in both <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum. In contrast, the biomarkers S 100 calcium binding protein B, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and microtubule-associated protein tau did not show any significant changes. NF-L levels in both <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum peaked at 1 month post surgery, returning to baseline after 6 to 9 months. A strong correlation was observed between the concentrations of NF-L in <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum. CONCLUSIONS: The NF-L level, in <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum, appears to be both a sensitive and specific marker for white matter axonal injury. This makes NF-L a valuable tool with which to evaluate acute white matter axonal damage in a clinical setting.

40|$|A {{majority}} of current disease-modifying therapeutic approaches for age-related neurodegenerative diseases target their characteristic proteopathic lesions (α-synuclein, Tau, Aβ). To monitor such treatments, fluid biomarkers reflecting the underlying disease process are crucial.

The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the potential clinical application of the genetic marker microRNA (miRNA) ‑ 210 in the cerebrospinal fluid (<b>CSF)</b> <b>and</b> serum of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The enrolled patients were divided into the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD groups. Healthy individuals were used as the controls. The mRNA and protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum samples was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reac-tion (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. The expression of miRNA‑ 210 in the <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum was detected by RT-qPCR. The results revealed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of VEGF in the <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum were decreased in the MCI and AD groups compared with those in the control group. The greater the severity of the dementia, the lower the mRNA and protein expression of VEGF. Similar to the trend observed for VEGF, the miRNA‑ 210 expression in the <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum decreased as the severity of the AD increased. miRNA- 210 is thus not only indicative of AD pathogenesis, but may also provide novel insights into the prevention and treatment of the disease...|$|R

Both <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum samples obtained from 12 patients with aneurysmal SAH and 8 patients with hydrocephalus (control group) without any other known central nervous system disease were assayed for E-selectin by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the results were compared between the two groups. Mean levels of soluble forms of E-selectin within the first 3 days and on the 5 th and 7 th days of SAH were 4. 0 ± 7. 9, 2. 8 ± 5. 2, and 3. 1 ± 4. 9 ng/ml in the patient's <b>CSF,</b> <b>and</b> 33. 7 ± 9. 2, 35. 1 ± 7. 0, and 35. 2 ± 8. 7 ng/ml in serum, respectively.

40|$|Listeriosis is {{a severe}} {{infectious}} disease occurring both in humans {{and in most}} other animal species caused by Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) {{that can lead to}} severe meningoencephalitis. Elevated ADA activities have been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in meningitis with different etiologies. However, data on ADA activities in <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum associated with listerial meningoencephalitis is limited. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate the changes in the <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum ADA activities and whether there is a correlation between <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum ADA in the experimental model of listeriosis. Twenty adult white New Zealand rabbits of both sexes were used in this study. Fourteen rabbits were infected by intracerebral inoculation of L. monocytogenes 1 / 2 a and 6 healthy rabbits were included in the study as the control group. CSF samples were obtained by puncture of the cisterna magna. Blood was sampled from the auricular vein of rabbits. ADA activity was determined using the colorimetric method. Mean±SD ADA activities in the <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum were 14. 98 ± 3. 26 U/L and 17. 71 ± 3. 41 U/L in infected rabbits, respectively, while 4. 72 ± 1. 86 U/L and 6. 89 ± 3. 00 U/L in healthy rabbits. <b>CSF</b> <b>and</b> serum ADA activities showed significant alteration in rabbits with experimental listeriosis compared to control rabbits (p< 0. 001).
