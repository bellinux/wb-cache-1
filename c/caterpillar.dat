50|$|The <b>caterpillars</b> {{lay down}} a {{pheromone}} trail {{from the tip}} of the abdomen as they advance over the branches of the host tree. Although the <b>caterpillars</b> also secrete silk and mark their pathways with the material, it plays little or no role in trail following. Most likely, silk helps the <b>caterpillars</b> grip on smooth plant surfaces. The <b>caterpillars</b> can distinguish old from new trails. <b>Caterpillars</b> preferentially follow trails marked by larger numbers of <b>caterpillars.</b> Trail marking enables the <b>caterpillars</b> to aggregate at feeding sites and allows them to find their way back to nest after feeding. When they move over the branches, <b>caterpillars</b> may travel head to tail in small groups or alone. In either case, they rely on the trail marker to find their way.|$|R

5000|$|Rock <b>Caterpillars</b> - The Rock <b>Caterpillars</b> are giant <b>caterpillars</b> {{that are}} larger than humans. They can shoot silk threads from their mouths.

After Mighty Ray's attempt to attack the Rock <b>Caterpillars</b> nearly endangered the people, the Zebra Brothers managed {{to get away with}} the Rock <b>Caterpillars.</b> HighRoller then combines the Rock <b>Caterpillar's</b> silk with a special ore which created a special liquid that can encase anyone in a hardened shell as HighRoller tests it on the Zebra Brothers. With this liquid, HighRoller plans to lure First Squad into a trap and trap them in the liquid. The Rock <b>Caterpillars</b> are then seen in Chameleon Queen where they are mass-producing the liquid for High Roller. When Lin Chung and Mighty Ray attack, High Roller has the Chameleon Tanks and the Rock <b>Caterpillars</b> attack.

5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the <b>caterpillar</b> is one of their own larvae. The <b>caterpillar</b> is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E

INTRODUCTION: Group living confers fitness benefits but also incurs costs (Despland & Huu 2007). Many lepidopterans spend their larval stages as colonies, which may speed up their development (Shiga 1976; Rothman 1997). Gregarious <b>caterpillars</b> often maintain group cohesion, as well as recruit others to food sources, via silk trails marked with pheromone...|$|R
50|$|The preeminent silk-spinners are the lepidopterous <b>caterpillars.</b> <b>Caterpillars</b> spin silk prolifically and in {{comparison}} to other non-eusocial insects build large and relatively complex structures from the material. Moreover, {{they are the only}} insects outside of the Hymenoptera and Isoptera to exhibit true collective building behavior involving colony-wide synchronization of activity and periodic shelter expansion. Some social <b>caterpillars</b> such as Brassolis isthmia and Archips cervasivoranus employ silk to draw the leaves of their host plants into tightly bound shelters in which they rest between foraging bouts. But the most impressive structures collectively built by <b>caterpillars,</b> such as the remarkable bolsa of the social pierid Eucheira socialis and the tents of the lasiocampid <b>caterpillars,</b> are made exclusively of silk. The communal shelters of <b>caterpillars</b> are multifunctional, serving to facilitate basking and thermoregulation, molting, and antipredator defense. They may also serve as communication centers where hungry <b>caterpillars</b> are recruited to food finds. Little is known of the behavioral mechanisms that give rise to the architecturally distinct, collectively built shelters of <b>caterpillars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most <b>caterpillars</b> are solely herbivorous. Many are {{restricted}} to one species of plant, while others are polyphagous. A few, including the clothes moth, feed on detritus. Most predatory <b>caterpillars</b> feed on eggs of other insects, aphids, scale insects, or ant larvae. Some are predatory, and others prey on <b>caterpillars</b> of other species (e.g. Hawaiian Eupithecia). A few are parasitic on cicadas or leaf hoppers. Some Hawaiian <b>caterpillars</b> (Hyposmocoma molluscivora) use silk traps to capture snails.|$|R
