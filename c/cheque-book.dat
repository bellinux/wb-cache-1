2500|$|Nibs– Nibs is {{described}} as [...] "gay and [...] ", probably the bravest Lost Boy. He says {{the only thing he}} remembers about his mother is she always wanted a cheque-book; he says he would love to give her one...if he knew what a <b>cheque-book</b> was. He's also the oldest and best looking Lost Boy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All I {{remember}} about my mother,' Nibs told them, 'is that she often said to father, [...] "Oh, how I wish I had a <b>cheque-book</b> of my own." [...] I don't {{know what a}} <b>cheque-book</b> is, but I should just love to give my mother one.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took his}} pocket <b>cheque-book</b> and {{fountain-pen}} from his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, if {{you want}} it right away." [...] To which, however, he added, {{clapping}} vainly a breast-pocket: [...] "But my <b>cheque-book's</b> down in my car." ...|$|R
60|$|All over-clothes {{here were}} worn {{as if they}} were an inconvenience, a hampering necessity. Some men were well dressed; but the {{majority}} were careless in that respect, appearing in suits which were historical records of their wearer's deeds, sun-scorchings, and daily struggles for many years past. Yet many carried ruffled <b>cheque-books</b> in their pockets which regulated at the bank hard by a balance of never less than four figures. In fact, what these gibbous human shapes specially represented was ready money--money insistently ready--not ready next year like a nobleman's--often not merely ready at the bank like a professional man's, but ready in their large plump hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's why {{our friend}} here didn't speak then," [...] Hugh {{said with a}} better light--"which, out of a dim {{consideration}} for her, I didn't do, either. But they've a leader this morning about Lady Lappington and her Longhi, and on Bender and his hauls, and on the certainty--if we don't do something energetic--of more and more Benders to come: such a conquering horde as invaded the old civilisation, only armed now with huge <b>cheque-books</b> instead of with spears and battle-axes. They refer to the rumour current--as too horrific to believe--of Lord Theign's putting up his Moretto; {{with the question of}} how properly to qualify any such sad purpose in him should the further report prove true of a new and momentous opinion about the picture entertained by several eminent authorities." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{looked down}} at the <b>cheque-book</b> which lay open before him.|$|E
60|$|JAMES. [Holding out the pass-book to his son] Three--five--one, no recent cheques. Just {{get me out}} the <b>cheque-book.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And while Rose obeyed, Lord Northmoor {{was able}} to extract his <b>cheque-book</b> from his pocket-book, and as Rose paused, to say-- ...|$|E
40|$|Monte Sant 2 ̆ 7 Angelo Mercy College, in North Sydney, {{needed a}} new general {{learning}} building, but the staff knew that the old model of school buildings based on 2 ̆ 7 classroom blocks 2 ̆ 7 would not be suitable or relevant. There were three factors to be considered: the project had to be appealing enough to reach the hearts and <b>cheque-books</b> of the school community for fund-raising; the new project had to be environmentally responsible; and, the idea of 2 ̆ 7 classrooms 2 ̆ 7 needed to be reconceptualised and thought of more broadly in terms of different learning spaces, and of course include information and communication technology. A fourth, more practical consideration was that the school site is land-locked. The author describes the planning process for the new learning precinct, and features of the completed building, which opened in late 2007. [Author abstract, ed...|$|R
6000|$|It {{appears that}} a certain romance is {{attached}} to the three years that are passed between the estate of the freshman and that of the Bachelor of Arts. These years are spent in a kind of fairyland, neither quite within nor quite outside of the world. College life is somewhat, as has so often been said, like the old Greek city life. For three years men are in the possession of what the world does not enjoy--leisure; and {{they are supposed to be}} using that leisure for the purposes of perfection. They are making themselves and their characters. We are all doing that, all the days of our lives; but at the Universities there is, or is expected to be, more deliberate and conscious effort. Men are in a position to [...] "try all things" [...] before committing themselves to any. Their new-found freedom does not merely consist in the right to poke their own fires, order their own breakfasts, and use their own <b>cheque-books.</b> These things, which make so much impression on the mind at first, are only the outward signs of freedom. The boy who has just left school, and the thoughtless life of routine in work and play, finds himself in the midst of books, of thought, and discussion. He has time to look at all the common problems of the hour, and yet he need not make up his mind hurriedly, nor pledge himself to anything. He can flirt with young opinions, which come to him with candid faces, fresh as Queen Entelechy in Rabelais, though, like her, they are as old as human thought. Here first he meets Metaphysics, and perhaps falls in love with that enchantress, [...] "who sifts time with a fine large blue silk sieve." [...] There is hardly a clever lad but fancies himself a metaphysician, and has designs on the Absolute. Most fall away very early from this, their first love; and they follow Science down one of her many paths, or concern themselves with politics, and take a side which, as a rule, is the opposite of that to which they afterwards adhere. Thus your Christian Socialist becomes a Court preacher, and puts his trust in princes; the young Tory of the old type will lapse into membership of a School Board. It is the time of liberty, and of intellectual attachments too fierce to last long.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are three}} {{in his private}} <b>cheque-book,</b> sir, the counterfoils of which are not filled in," [...] was the {{somewhat}} dreary admission.|$|E
60|$|The major made no remark, but {{he showed}} his white teeth again, and tapped Mr. Girdlestone's <b>cheque-book</b> with the silver {{head of his}} walking-stick.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it a large sum?' Mrs Ford {{took the}} {{slip of paper}} and gave a slight gasp. Then, coming to the bureau, she took out her <b>cheque-book.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Here {{he took a}} <b>cheque-book</b> {{from his}} letter-case and spread {{it out on the}} little table in the tent, on which there were ink and a pen, adding-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very strange," [...] said I. [...] "And now, Summers, if {{you will}} bring me my bills and a new <b>cheque-book,</b> we will begin to get things into order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't," [...] said Psmith. [...] "It's {{more or less}} of a minimum. I {{have made}} inquiries. So out with the good old <b>cheque-book,</b> and let's all be jolly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The ship's money?" [...] I repeated. [...] "That's {{the money}} Trent tramped and traded with? And there's his <b>cheque-book</b> {{to draw upon}} his owners? And he has left it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Her ladyship prided herself {{upon her}} bluntness and practicability. As she spoke {{she took her}} <b>cheque-book</b> out of her reticule, and, opening it, dipped her pen into the ink. I am {{inclined}} {{to think that the}} flutter of that <b>cheque-book</b> was her ladyship's mistake. The girl had common sense, and must have seen the difficulties {{in the way of a}} marriage between the heir to an earldom and a linen-draper's daughter; and had the old lady been a person of discernment, the interview might have ended more to her satisfaction. She made the error of judging the world by one standard, forgetting there are individualities. Mary Sewell came from a West of England stock that, in the days of Drake and Frobisher, had given more than one able-bodied pirate to the service of the country, and that insult of the <b>cheque-book</b> put the fight into her. Her lips closed with a little snap, and the fear fell from her.|$|E
6000|$|... "'My darling,' he {{will say}} tenderly, 'is there {{anything}} I can do?' To which your reply will be that there jolly well is--viz. reach for his <b>cheque-book</b> and start writing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is his <b>cheque-book,</b> I think," [...] he replied, in the oblique retort, {{picking it}} up and looking at it. He tore out a cheque, as if pensively and by accident.|$|E
6000|$|Gyp, who {{was sitting}} at her bureau, seemed to be adding up the counterfoils in her <b>cheque-book.</b> She did not turn round, and Fiorsen paused. How {{was she going to}} receive him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he said, {{turning to}} the others, [...] "I have lost my chance of conciliating a witness. My <b>cheque-book</b> remains locked up and she has gone over to your side." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{practically}} {{brought the}} scene to a close. The countess had sense enough {{to see that she}} was only losing ground by argument. She rose and replaced her <b>cheque-book</b> in her bag.|$|E
6000|$|... "Admitted, {{my young}} friend, your {{reasoning}} is just," [...] {{said the old}} gentleman, sitting down at a writing table and taking a <b>cheque-book</b> from a drawer; [...] "what shall I put down?" ...|$|E
60|$|DUKE. Then {{something}} like a pension or annuity for any widows you may--er--procure. [Gaily opening his <b>cheque-book</b> and talking slang to show there is no ill-feeling.] Come, let me call {{it a couple of}} thou.|$|E
60|$|JAMES. I can't {{forgive him}} for the sneaky way he went to work-- {{counting}} on our suspecting young Davis if the matter came to light. It was the merest accident the <b>cheque-book</b> stayed in your pocket.|$|E
60|$|The writing-table in Mrs. Gallilee's boudoir {{was covered}} with letters. Her banker's pass-book and her <b>cheque-book</b> were on the desk; Mr. Gallilee's affairs having been long since left as {{completely}} {{in the hands of}} his wife, as if Mr. Gallilee had been dead. A sheet of paper lay near the <b>cheque-book,</b> covered with calculations divided into two columns. The figures in the right-hand column were contained in one line {{at the top of the}} page. The figures in the left-hand column filled the page from top to bottom. With her fan in her hand, and her pen in the ink-bottle, Mrs. Gallilee waited, steadily thinking.|$|E
6000|$|THE JUDGE. The {{question}} is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion would light on himself, and not on Davis. [To FALDER sharply] Did you know that Mr. Walter How had the <b>cheque-book</b> till after Davis had sailed? ...|$|E
60|$|Billy and Tottie {{being of}} the same opinion, Gaff laid aside his pipe, got out the tea-caddy, from which he took his <b>cheque-book,</b> and made Tottie write out a cheque for 1000 pounds, payable to Miss Lizzie Gordon.|$|E
6000|$|JAMES. [Very grimly] Out, I'm afraid, Cokeson. The <b>cheque-book</b> {{remained}} in Mr. Walter's pocket till {{he came back}} from Trenton on Tuesday morning. In the face of this, Falder, do you still deny that you altered both cheque and counterfoil? ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Sandgate fairly {{jumped at}} it. [...] "Your blessed <b>cheque-book.</b> Lay {{it on my}} desk," [...] she said to Gotch, though waiting till he had {{departed}} again before she resumed to her visitor: [...] "Mightn't we conclude before he comes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The royal <b>cheque-book,</b> {{bound in}} red morocco, {{was brought in}} by eight pages, with ink and a pen. His majesty then filled up and signed the {{following}} satisfactory document--(Ah! my children, how I wish Mr. Arrowsmith would do as much for me!): ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have only}} just {{transferred}} my account {{to the bank}} here,' said De Stancy, as {{he took out his}} <b>cheque-book,</b> 'and it will be more convenient to me at present to draw but a small sum. I will make up the balance afterwards.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are. But {{this was}} for a tenner, and made out to the hotel. Hunt up your <b>cheque-book</b> and see how many cheques for ten pounds payable to the Ritz Hotel you wrote out between May the fifth and May the tenth." ...|$|E
60|$|Derek roused {{himself with}} an effort. His face was drawn and gloomy. He {{sat down at}} the writing-table, and took out his <b>cheque-book.</b> There was silence for a moment, broken only by the {{scratching}} of the pen. Barker took the cheque and left the room.|$|E
