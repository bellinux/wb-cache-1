2500|$|It {{was common}} {{for the young}} Mayweather to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> and find used heroin needles in his front yard. His mother was {{addicted}} to drugs, and he had an aunt who died from AIDS because of her drug use. [...] "People don't know the hell I've been through," [...] he says. The most time that his father spent with him was taking him to the gym to train and work on his boxing, according to Mayweather. [...] "I don't remember him ever taking me anywhere or doing anything that a father would do with a son, going to the park or to the movies or to get ice cream," [...] he says. [...] "I always thought that he liked his daughter (Floyd's older sister) better than he liked me because she never got whippings and I got whippings all the time." ...|$|E

60|$|Constance had <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> {{with the}} {{reputation}} of being much more accomplished than her elder sister, who had grown up while her father was a curate of very straitened means, and thus, though her junior, she was thought wonderfully superior in discernment and everything else.|$|E

6000|$|Little Time--for {{though he}} was {{formally}} turned into [...] "Jude," [...] the apt nickname stuck to him--would <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> in the evening, and repeat inquiries and remarks {{that had been made}} to him by the other boys; and cause Sue, and Jude when he heard them, a great deal of pain and sadness.|$|E
60|$|Grace, who sat opposite, had {{recently}} <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school,</b> and {{was marked by}} an independence somewhat unusual at Tarnside. She argued with Osborn and was firm when he got angry. Then she had a fresh enthusiasm for change and improvement and a generous faith in {{what she thought was}} good. Since Osborn was obstinately conventional, this sometimes led to jars.|$|E
6000|$|Anne had <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> the {{previous}} evening, to find Marilla away at an Aid meeting, Dora {{asleep on the}} kitchen sofa, and Davy {{in the sitting room}} closet, blissfully absorbing the contents of a jar of Marilla's famous yellow plum preserves [...] "company jam," [...] Davy called it [...] . which he had been forbidden to touch.

60|$|One sunny {{afternoon}} when I had <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> with my books and portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was gliding upstairs {{to my room}} as usual, my godmother looked out of the parlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was very unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking gentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold watch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon his little finger.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Pancks, who had snorted {{at the old}} man in his friendliest manner, {{replied in}} the affirmative, and casually asked whether that lively Altro chap had come in yet? Mrs Plornish {{answered}} no, not yet, though he had gone to the West-End with some work, and had said he should be back by tea-time. Mr Pancks was then hospitably pressed into Happy Cottage, where he encountered the elder Master Plornish just <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> Examining that young student, lightly, on the educational proceedings of the day, he found that the more advanced pupils who were in the large text and the letter M, had been set the copy 'Merdle, Millions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] replied her mother. [...] "So {{far it has}} {{all been}} put upon propriety, and so on. I told her, now she was grown up and <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> she must not run after her cousins as she used to do, and I have called her away {{sometimes}} when {{he has tried to}} get her alone. Last evening, she told me in a very simple way-—like the child she is—-that Robert would walk home with her in the moonlight, and hindered her when she tried to join the others, telling me she hoped I should not be angry with her. He seems to have talked to her about this London plan; but I told her on the spot it was impossible." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{opening scene}} where Sally <b>comes</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> and announces {{she will not}} be going back, then takes her brother for show-and-tell, (except for Snoopy {{preparing}} breakfast for himself and lunch for Charlie Brown and Sally) was removed entirely.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school,</b> {{to nurse}} my aunt. Ah, you {{remember}} now! Is it true--I ask you here, where your old mistress died--is {{it true that}} my aunt deceived me about my father's death? And that you knew it?" ...|$|R
60|$|If Mrs. Gaylord had dimly {{imagined}} {{that she should}} see something more of him, having him so near at hand, she really saw less: there was no weather, by day or night, in which he could not go to his office, now. He went no more than his wife into the village society; {{she might have been}} glad now and then of a little glimpse of the world, but she never said so, and her social life had ceased, like her religious life. Their house was richly furnished according to the local taste of the time; the parlor had a Brussels carpet, and heavy chairs of mahogany and hair-cloth; Marcia had a piano there, and since she had <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> they had made company, as Mrs. Gaylord called it, two or three times for her; but they had held aloof from the festivity, the Squire in his office, and Mrs. Gaylord in the family room where they now sat in unwonted companionship.|$|E

6000|$|They {{heard the}} children's {{knock on the}} door; they knocked when they <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> so that their mother might let them in. [...] "Shall we tell them at once?" [...] she asked, and ran to open for them before March could answer.|$|R
6000|$|Slowly {{enumerating}} {{the articles}} {{they came to}} the piano. Averil went up to it, leant fondly against it, and softly touched the keys. 'My own,' she said, 'bought for a surprise to me when I <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school!</b> And oh, how he loved it!' ...|$|R

5000|$|When a noun with {{conflicting}} {{natural and}} grammatical gender is the antecedent of a pronoun, {{it may not}} be clear which gender of pronoun to choose. There is a certain tendency to keep the grammatical gender when a close back-reference is made, but to switch to natural gender when the reference is further away. For example, in German, the sentences [...] "The girl has <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> She is now doing her homework" [...] can be translated in two ways: ...|$|E
50|$|On the February 26 at 9 o’clock, Ninel {{left for}} work.
