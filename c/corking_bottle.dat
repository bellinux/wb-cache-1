5000|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the crown <b>cork</b> <b>bottle</b> stopper, soda <b>bottles</b> had ordinary <b>cork</b> <b>bottle</b> stoppers and often had rounded bottoms so they could not be stored standing upright. The reason for this is corks have a tendency to dry out and shrink, which allows the gas pressure in the bottle to cause the cork to [...] "pop." [...] Storing bottles on their side prevents the corks from drying out and [...] "popping." [...] After {{the invention}} of the crown <b>cork</b> <b>bottle</b> stopper, this problem was eliminated, and soda bottles could be stored standing upright.|$|R

50|$|Charles G. Hutchinson invented and {{patented}} the Hutchinson Patent Stopper in 1879 as {{a replacement}} for <b>cork</b> <b>bottle</b> stoppers which were commonly being used as stoppers on soda water or pop bottles. His invention employed a wire spring attached to a rubber seal. Production of these stoppers was discontinued after 1912.|$|R
5000|$|Nalyvka (наливка): a {{homemade}} wine made from cherries, raspberries, gooseberries, bilberries, blackberries, plums, blackthorns and other berries. Berries {{were put into}} a sulija (a big glass bottle), some sugar was added. After the berries fermented, the liquid was separated from the berries, and put into <b>corked</b> <b>bottles.</b> The berries were used to make pyrozhky (baked or fried pastry). The wine has about 15% of alcohol.|$|R

In many respects it was, like Le dejeuner sur l'herbe, and Olympia, a defiant reworking of artistic tradition... the signatures of masculine bravery became cast-off props in a provincial dining-room, sharing the same dignity and distinction—no more, no less—as the potted plants, <b>corked</b> <b>bottles</b> and coffee urn." ...|$|R
50|$|For larger-scale cider production, ciders from vats {{produced}} from different varieties of apple {{may be blended}} to accord with market taste. If the cider is to be bottled, usually some extra sugar is added for sparkle. Higher quality ciders can be made using the champagne method, but this is expensive in time and money and requires special <b>corks,</b> <b>bottles,</b> and other equipment. Some home brewers use beer bottles, which work perfectly well, and are inexpensive. This allows the cider to become naturally carbonated.|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} offices began to use <b>cork</b> <b>bottle</b> {{stoppers}} dipped in ink. These worked well, but would tend to blot out the entire stamp {{making it difficult to}} check the denomination, and so clerks began to carve a groove across the middle of the cork, making two semicircles. Further enhancements included two grooves cut crosswise (the four-piece [...] "country pie"), and then two more, for the eight-segment [...] "city pie", and notches cut out of the outer edge to lighten the cancel further.|$|R

50|$|To inhale alcohol, it must {{be first}} {{converted}} from liquid into gaseous state (vapor) or aerosol (mist). For recreational use, {{a variety of methods}} have been invented. Alcohol can be vaporized by pouring it over dry ice in a narrow container and inhaling with a straw. Another method is to pour alcohol in a <b>corked</b> <b>bottle</b> with a pipe, and then use a bicycle pump to make a spray. Alcohol can be vaporized using a simple container and open-flame heater. Medical devices such as asthma nebulizers and inhalers were also reported as means of application.|$|R

2500|$|In 1892, the [...] "Crown <b>Cork</b> <b>Bottle</b> Seal" [...] was {{patented}} by William Painter, a Baltimore, Maryland machine shop operator. It {{was the first}} bottle top to successfully keep the bubbles in the bottle. In 1899, the first patent was issued for a glass-blowing machine for the automatic production of glass bottles. Earlier glass bottles had all been hand-blown. Four years later, the new bottle-blowing machine was in operation. It was first operated by the inventor, Michael Owens, an employee of Libby Glass Company. Within a few years, glass bottle production increased from 1,400 bottles a day to about 58,000 bottles a day.|$|R

5000|$|Bottle {{variation}} {{that increases}} over time typically {{comes from the}} packaging. Exposure to heat or light can cause a wine to mature more quickly or even make it taste [...] "cooked". Bottles aged in the chilly cellars of Sweden's alcohol monopoly are famous for tasting younger than the same wine stored at a more typical 13 °C (55 °F). Finally, not all corks seal equally well, and a faulty cork will allow air into the bottle, oxidizing it prematurely. However, a corked wine would {{be described as a}} simple fault rather than bottle variation, even though the <b>corked</b> <b>bottle</b> would be clearly different from a non-corked example.|$|R

Approximately 15,000 cases were released in North America in December 2010 at a suggested retail price of $20 per 750 mL bottle, Marketed towards drinkers who would rather toast with beer than Champagne on New Year's Eve, Infinium is described by the brewers as [...] "the first new beer style created under the Reinheitsgebot in over a hundred years." ...|$|R
