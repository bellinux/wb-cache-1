Two steps of performance optimization are adopted: reduction in ambipolar current and increase in on-off current ratio. The former objective is accomplished through introduction of gate-drain underlap, {{and the latter}} through gate-source overlap. The components of gate capacitance are analyzed and reported for the optimized structure. Furthermore, {{the behavior of the}} optimized device is observed in presence of noise sources and interface traps at two frequencies: 1 MHz and 10 GHz.

A microplate with a multielectrode array of 96 organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) {{based on the}} semiconductive polymer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythio-phene) :poly(styrene sulfonic acid) PEDOT:PSS was developed and fabricated by the screen printing method.

40|$|We are {{suggesting}} an electronic method for Cooper pair mass spectroscopy of thin superconducting films. The method can be applied, for example, for 100 nm thin high-T_c films grown on insulator substrate 10 mm X 10 mm. In Corbino geometry two Ohmic contacts {{have to be}} made on the film evaporating Ag or using silver paste: one circle with radius r_a (1) and a ring electrode with internal radius r_b (2). In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylar assures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and the metallized surface (3) of the mylar. In such a way we have an field effect transistor (FET) type structure with a <b>circular</b> <b>gate.</b> When at low enough temperatures T << T_c an AC current with frequency omega is applied between the circle source (1) and the ring-shaped drain (2) an AC Bernoulli voltage with double frequency 2 f appears between the gate (3) and the source (1). The 2 f signal depends on Cooper pair effective mass and its systematic investigation gives a Cooper pair mass spectroscopy. In the normal phase 2 f gives logarithmic derivative of the density of states (DOS) with respect of Fermi energy. Applying a gate voltage in the same structure gives the mobility of the normal phase.

40|$|Silicon carbide (SIC) {{is a wide}} bandgap {{semiconductor}} thathas {{been suggested}} {{as a replacement for}} silicon in applicationsusing high voltages, high frequencies, high temperatures orcombinations thereof. Several basic process steps need to bedeveloped for reliable manufacturing of long-term stableelectronic devices. One important process step is the formationof an insulator on the silicon carbide surface that may be usedas a) a gate dielectric, b) for device isolation or c) forpassivation of the surface. Silicon dioxide and aluminumnitride have been suggested for these purposes. This thesiscovers the investigation of some formation methods for boththese materials on 4 H and 6 H silicon carbide, and theelectrical characterisation of the resulting films. Commercially available n-type and p-type 4 H and 6 H SICwafers have been used, and both the silicon face and the carbonface have been investigated. Silicon dioxide has been formed byseveral methods: a) dry thermal oxidation with or without theaddition of TCA (trichloroethane), b) wet oxidation inpyrogenic steam or with awater bubbler, c) oxide deposition byPECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition) or LPCVD (lowpressure chemical vapor deposition) and d) oxidation of aevaporated or LPCVD deposited sacrificial layer of silicon. Theinfluence of various cleaning methods prior to oxidation hasbeen studied, as well as post-oxidation and post-metallisationannealing. The aluminum nitride films were grown by MOCVD(metal organic chemical vapor deposition) under various processconditions. Oxidation kinetics have been studied for dry thermaloxidation at 1200 0 C. The redistribution of aluminum (p-typedopant in SiC) during dry thermal oxidation has beeninvestigated using SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry). Themorphology of the aluminum nitride was determined using x-raydiffraction rocking curves, RHEED (reflection high energyelectron diffraction) and AFM (atomic force microscopy). Thequality of the silicon dioxide used as gate dielectric has beendetermined using breakdown field measurements. High frequencycapacitance-voltage measurements have been used on bothinsulators to a) verify thickness measurements made with othermethods, b) to determine fixed oxide charges by measuring theflatband voltage shifts and c) to quantitatively compare theamount of interface states. For electrical characterisation either aluminum, titanium ordoped polysilicon <b>circular</b> <b>gate</b> contacts of various sizes wereformed on the insulator surface. Flat MOS capacitors weremainly used for the electrical characterisation. U-grooved MOScapacitors, manufactured by RIE (reactive ion etching), wereused to test the quality of oxides grown on vertical surfaces.

Structural foams (SF) are a good solution, when the {{production of}} thicker parts with good properties is the specification.

40|$|We report {{systematic}} quantum Hall transport {{experiments on}} Fabry-Perot electron interferometers at ultra-low-temperatures. The GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure devices consist of two constrictions defined by etch trenches in 2 D electron layer, enclosing an approximately <b>circular</b> island. Front <b>gates</b> deposited in etch trenches allow to fine-tune the device for symmetry {{and to change}} the constriction filling, relative to the bulk. The low-field longitudinal and Hall magnetotransport shows Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and integer quantum Hall plateaus. A systematic variation of front-gate voltage affects the constriction and the island electron density, while the bulk density remains unaffected. This results in quantized plateaus in longitudinal resistance, while the Hall resistance {{is dominated by the}} low-density, low-filling constriction. At lower fields, when the quantum Hall plateaus fail to develop, we observe bulk Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in series corresponding to an integer filling of the magnetoelectric subbands in the constrictions.

40|$|Electron field {{emission}} is obtained using high enough (greater {{than or equal}} to 1 V/nm) electric fields. Such local fields are usually obtained using sharp emitters. An alternative approach is to cover the otherwise blunt emitter (BE) with a porous silicon (PS) layer. The PS is composed of many fibrils with dimensions of several nm which act as ''nano-emitters''. In this article such an emitter is considered as part of a vertical {{field emission}} microtriode (FEMT). The BE has spherical tip and conical body and protrudes through the <b>gate</b> <b>circular</b> opening, allowing the FEMT operation in the collector-assisted mode. An electric field multiplication approximation is studied using both an analytical and a numerical emitter model. The field multiplication means that the fibril increases the local electric field, which is already increased by the BE as compared with the uniform field at large distances from it. This approximation is valid as long as the fibril dimensions are much smaller than the BE ones. The fibrils mutual influence on the field is studied separately and taken into account for the FEMT case. The emission current is computed through integration of the Fowler-Nordheim J(E) current density-electric field relationship over the BE and fibrils area. Comparison is provided with the case of BE not covered with PS. The emission current is obtained as function of model parameters.

40|$|Separate {{sewerage}} {{systems are}} {{designed so that}} the wastewater and stormwater are carried separately. However, in practice, untreated wastewater discharges to receiving waters are not that rare, impairing {{the quality of the}} receiving waters and increasing the risks to public health and aquatic organisms. The two main causes for such discharges are wastewater that enters stormwater sewers as well as sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) from the separate wastewater sewers. The overall aim of this licentiate thesis is to review and improve the strategies used for detection of wastewater inputs to stormwater sewers and their location, and {{to address the issue of}} quantification of untreated wastewater discharges into the receiving waters by developing two methods: one for SSO discharges and one for the estimation of the wastewater amounts in stormwater sewers. A review of methods for detecting the entry of wastewater into stormwater sewers and the location of the entry points has been carried out by a critical literature review of the effectiveness of the current methods, their advantages, weaknesses and limitations in use. Additionally, an evaluation of the factors affecting the performance of a selected number of methods has been made from specially designed field studies, focusing on detectability of certain indicative pollution parameters and the effects of travel distance. The parameters selected based on those identified as being potentially the most useful in the literature review were E. coli, total coliform, Enterococci, conductivity, turbidity, TSS, and ammonium. The estimation of the volumes of untreated wastewater discharged into receiving waters was addressed by developing two methods: (1) volume estimation of SSO discharges based on already available infrastructure—backflow preventing flap gates—by performing full-scale studies to establish flow rating curves as a function of water head; and (2) estimation of wastewater ingress volumes into a stormwater system by using data from field studies as input to a Monte Carlo simulation to generate the probability distribution of possible fractions of wastewater in stormwater sewers. The reviewed indicator parameters and methods all demonstrated potential for detecting stormwater contamination by wastewater. However, there was no single method or strategy that would work under all conditions investigated. Human waste specific indicators—microbiological (adopted in microbial source tracking methods) and chemical markers (e. g., caffeine and carbamazepine) —as well as the Distributed Temperature Sensing method provided the best indication of wastewater pollution in the literature. However, these methods are currently beyond the capabilities of typical municipal expertise due to their costs and/or complexity and, therefore, combinations of methods that minimise the limitations of individual approaches have been identified in this thesis as the most effective provided these are tailored to specific cases. The travel distance from the point at which the wastewater entered the stormwater sewer is an important factor affecting the detectability of the investigated parameters, as the concentrations of the indicator parameters may change along the sewer length due to dilution, dispersion, physical, chemical, and microbiological processes. A Maximum Detection Distance (MDD) away from the origin of the input was determined which was in general shorter for the microbiological parameters than for the physicochemical parameters. Among the microorganisms analysed, Enterococci showed the shortest MDD of about 330 – 550 m, and E. coli — the longest of about 635 – 1245 m. Of the physicochemical parameters, the shortest MDD was for TSS (800 – 1130 m) and the longest for conductivity (1220 – 1560 m). MDD itself is not the main factor for selecting what parameters should be used, but rather how the sampling strategy for a particular parameter should be planned. The full-scale experiments on <b>circular</b> flap <b>gates</b> provided flow-rating curves for diameters of 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mm with high precision (R 2 > 0. 99). There are a large number of such gates installed in Sweden and the flow rating curves developed in this study could help practitioners to monitor SSO discharges with minimal onsite measurements (water head before and after the flap gate) in a reliable and inexpensive way. From the field study results, an equation was developed to estimate the volume of wastewater entering into the stormwater sewer. Monte Carlo simulation was selected as a means to increase the robustness of the outcome of the developed equation. The results of the simulation showed that the efficiency of the suggested method varied to a great extent depending on the selected combination of parameters: for example, for TSS and conductivity the percent error between the most probable and actual wastewater fractions in the sewer was less than 2 %, while TSS combined with microbiological parameters failed as a combination to estimate the wastewater fraction in sewer.
