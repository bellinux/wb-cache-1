This led to neglect of explicit discussion of the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes.</b> The context for such discussion is reviewed and the critique of the existence of a distinctive content for planning programmes is examined. It is proposed that there is a valuable and defensible 'heartland' of planning knowledge, skills, and values, and the author explores what this could mean {{in the development of a}} planning programme. It is argued that the key choices concern the languages within which knowledge and skills will be developed, rather than the subjects or practice fields of a programme. ...|$|E

Firstly we have a system in which every university is supposed to offer equivalent degrees and this means {{that more than half of}} the students disappear without getting a degree. We cannot offer the sort of courses which would be appropriate for different types of students. Secondly, the quality of teaching is not satisfactory and this can be seen by examining the text books which are not aimed at communicating a desire to learn about economic phenomena. Lastly, the contents of the courses do not reflect such modern concerns as the problems of contagion, psychological elements, out of equilibrium behaviour. All of these are important since students do not wish to hear about theories which seem to have little to do with the economic facts that they observe.

40|$|Little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} professional development of primary teachers in Ireland to support them in teaching physical education (PE) until 2004 when specific support was provided to help them implement the revised Primary Physical Education Curriculum. A significant National In-service Physical Education Programme was undertaken involving the preparation of a cohort of tutors who were to facilitate the programme to all primary teachers. This study focuses on the findings from a study of the effectiveness of the programme from the tutors’ and teachers’ perspectives beginning with the preparation of the tutors for facilitation of the programme. Elements of good practice emerged that can inform future policy with regard to support of primary teachers teaching PE within the constraints of funding. These include (1) the importance of quality preparation of tutors acknowledging the advantage of technology that may provide a new and cost effective way of supporting them, and (2) retaining the practical exploration of content by both tutors and teachers that prompts reflection on the nature and <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> of PE...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} reflect on the speech sound system of language, phonological awareness, has been shown to {{influence}} the acquisition of literacy. Previously published evidence {{of the nature of the}} linguistic and cognitive competencies underlying phonological awareness has involved primarily study of children older than 6 years. Within the United Kingdom, children enter school aged between 4 years 6 months and 5 years. There is therefore a need to investigate the variables which influence the emergence of metaphonological processing in this population of pre-school, pre-literate children. The current study involved 41 monolingual pre-literate children aged within a month of their fifth birthday. An exploratory regression analysis indicated that the most significant predictors of the metaphonological skills of 5 -year-old children were phonological memory, speech output processing and non-verbal cognitive skills. The results provided additional evidence that different children employed different combinations of processing competencies in order to perform metaphonological tasks. The findings of this study have implications for the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> designed to facilitate phonological awareness in pre-school children...|$|E

First, realist evaluation investigates what outcomes were achieved, {{and the extent to which}} each desired outcome was achieved. Next, the main mechanisms and contexts from the sample of service users are aggregated.

Finally, inferential statistics are used to identify the key mechanisms and content that were responsible for the outcomes and in what contexts. The statistical methods used include Chi-squares, significance tests, and multiple regression analysis. In this way, it is possible to determine what works, for whom and in what contexts. This new paradigm has been used in the evaluation of a number of social care programmes in England and in Finland, and the paper will outline experiences in the replication of realist evaluation methodologies in the two countries...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{increasing}} representation of sexual dissidence on contemporary Italian mainstream television from 1990 to 2012. It argues that TV programming and regulations have been historically influenced by notions {{of an ideal}} family audience assumed to be traditionally nuclear, patriarchal, heterosexual and normative. The visual representation of sexuality in the media {{has been the subject}} of considerable international debate which has problematised the historical invisibilisation and misrepresentation of sexual dissidents, particularly in film and with an almost exclusive methodological emphasis on Anglophone texts. Less attention has been given to more integrated and empirical approaches to the representation, circulation and reception of dissident sexualities on TV. This study combines historical examinations of sexual portrayals on Italian television with two online ethnographies targeting non-heterosexual and heterosexually-identified respondents, discursively analysing whether and how these samples of viewers have engaged with this increasing TV visibility. The majority of participants seem interested in these portrayals and disagree with restrictive decision-making by networks. Nonetheless, a considerable portion of respondents appears to be problematically influenced not so much by the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> as by perceptions of the views of others. The thesis demonstrates that audience research is an under-explored, yet very productive, field of enquiry in Sexuality Studies. Further research in this direction could have implications for network recommendations, transnational policy-making and new theoretical approaches...|$|E

40|$|M. A. (Social Work) In {{terms of}} {{recent changes in}} Government policy, the posts of social workers are {{currently}} being subsidised {{on the basis of}} the effectiveness of the service programmes conducted by welfare organisations. Consequently, programme evaluation has lately become the subject of increasing attention. An increased sense of responsibility and an awareness of a need for greater efficiency and cost effectiveness is emerging. This suggests a need for a scientifically based evaluation process i. e. programme evaluation with a view to improving existing programmes or developing new programmes. However uncertainty prevails in welfare organisations with regard to the nature and <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> and consequently where and when programme evaluation should be applied. In order to verify this impression, questionnaires were mailed to welfare organisations in Johannesburg who are members of the Family care Liason Committee. A sampling group of five directors, seven supervisors and ten social workers, based on nonprobability quota sampling, were identified. A response of three directors, four supervisors and seven social workers were received and after the results were analysed a verification of the impression, that uncertainty prevails in welfare organisations with regard to programme evaluation, could be noted. Programme evaluation would therefore be less likely utilised in social work as a method and model in rendering services unless the uncertainty is minimised and an atmosphere is created in which social workers will want to apply programme evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Livsstilsprogrammer har siden slutningen af 1990 ’erne domineret programfladen i den tidlige {{prime time}} på de danske public service-kanaler DR og TV 2.

Artiklen fokuserer på underholdningsdimensionen i tre kategorier af livsstilsprogrammer og undersøger elementer, der kan tænkes at fremme motivationen for at se dem.

40|$|Emotional Intelligence (EI) {{has been}} viewed as a {{critical}} factor influencing students' academic achievement, ability to work, and potential to succeed. Previous {{research has shown that}} students with high EI perform better academically than those with low EI, as well as being better equipped for their professional careers. However, despite the acknowledged importance of EI, little work has explored the construct within the context of built environment education and relatively little is known about how built environment curricula should be designed to enhance EI. This research explores the EI levels of built environment undergraduates and its relationship to their specific programmes, and investigates the types of pedagogic interventions which appear to influence EI in a positive way. This research adopts a multimethodological research design and a mixed methods approach, involving a combination of both quantitative and qualitative datasets to explore students' experiences and learning enhancements. These include a questionnaire survey of 420 respondents, a secondary examination of built environment programmes, interviews with construction professionals and 45 in-depth interviews with placement students and other undergraduates. The results reveal that the existing built environment education inhibits students' EI development, but that EI is shown to increase during industrial placements. The results also reveal that EI development differs by the types of programme taken, with students studying on Civil Engineering and Architectural Engineering & Design Management programmes showing a propensity for higher EI scores in comparison with those studying on a Commercial Management & Quantity Surveying programme. An analysis of the modular <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> together with the mode of teaching, learning and assessment used, reveals the types of pedagogic intervention which can enhance EI development. Group work and student-centred learning in particular were found to {{have a positive effect on}} EI development. These findings form the basis of recommendations for how current built environment education can be enhanced in a way to develop students' EI. It is suggested that a better understanding of students' EI levels and the ability of such programmes to influence students' EI may help to produce graduates better able to meet the future requirements of the construction industry.
