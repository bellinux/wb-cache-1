500|$|Green Hill Zone {{has also}} been {{recognized}} by critics as a classic, well-known video game level. It {{has been described as}} [...] "classic" [...] by Samit Sarkar of Polygon and by Jim Sterling and Chris Carter of Destructoid. Comparably, Joe Skrebels of Official Nintendo Magazine called it [...] "nostalgic", while Christopher Grant from Joystiq considered it to have a place [...] "in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> retro-gaming shrine". Kevin Wong of Complex stated that the game's and level's popularity were such that [...] "even if you didn't have a Genesis, this was the level you played at the department store while your parents went shopping." [...] Andy Kelly from Computer and Video Games called the Green Hill theme a [...] "monumental slice of Sega nostalgia", and GamesRadar writer Justin Towell also referred to it as classic. Anka has summarized that [...] "Green Hill Zone in the original game has gone down as an instantly recognisable piece of music in pop culture".|$|E

6000|$|... 24. Now {{the first}} {{question}} respecting it is: what place is your thick line to have {{with respect to the}} limit which it represents--outside of it, or inside, or over it? Theoretically, it is to be over it; the true limit falling all the way along the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> thick line. The contest of Apelles with Protogenes consisted in striking this true limit within each other's lines, more and more finely. And you may always consider your pen line as representing the first incision for sculpture, the true limit being the sharp center of the incision.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{side effect}} of her father's training, Cassandra's brain {{developed}} learning functions different from most. Having been brought up by Cain deliberately without speech, the communication <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> her brain learned body language instead of spoken or written language. Thus, she originally had as much trouble learning spoken and written language as a normal individual would have in learning body language. Although she was able to learn some very basic things ("no", [...] "yes", [...] "me") the same way a normal person can learn to recognize smiles and frowns, it took a telepath [...] "rewiring" [...] her brain to teach her to speak and understand English. Even then, she only spoke with extreme difficulty (very falteringly, short sentences with long pauses, frequently using the wrong words, etc.). In Batgirl #67 (October 2005), Oracle performed a number of tests on Cassandra, determining the severity of the problem: [...] "The language <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> brain are all over both hemispheres. Not centralized like with most people. When you try to read or write, your brain doesn't know how to keep it cohesive." ...|$|R

The deputies and all citizens of Serbia sincerely sympathize with you and share the grief with the families of victims".|$|R

60|$|The solar plexus, the {{greatest}} {{and most important}} center of our dynamic consciousness, is a sympathetic center. At this main <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> first-mind we know as we can never mentally know. Primarily we know, each man, each living creature knows, profoundly and satisfactorily and without question, that I am I. This root of all knowledge and being is established in the solar plexus; it is dynamic, pre-mental knowledge, such as cannot be transferred into thought. Do not ask me to transfer the pre-mental dynamic knowledge into thought. It cannot be done. The knowledge that I am I can never be thought: only known.|$|E

On the other hand, if it is struck at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> percussion it rotates smoothly about the support point.

50|$|The {{main part}} of the Anand Karaj (Sikh Marriage Ceremony) is the reading and then the singing of each laav in turn. When the Laav is sung, the couple, joined by a piece of cloth, circle the Guru Granth Sahib. This has {{relevance}} to the occasion and should not be considered a ritual without meaning. When the couple circle the Guru Granth Sahib each time they are making a commitment to God with the Guru as their spiritual witness and support. And as one circles the Sri Guru Granth Sahib you are reminded that the Guru should be the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life, from which springs your spiritual leadership and understanding that you require for your soul's long journey across this 'world ocean'.
