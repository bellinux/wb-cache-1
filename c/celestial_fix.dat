50|$|Celestial {{navigation}} {{systems are}} based on observation of {{the positions of the}} Sun, Moon, Planets and navigational stars. Such systems are in use as well for terrestrial navigating as for interstellar navigating. By knowing which point on the rotating earth a celestial object is above and measuring its height above the observer's horizon, the navigator can determine his distance from that subpoint. A nautical almanac and a marine chronometer are used to compute the subpoint on earth a celestial body is over, and a sextant is used to measure the body's angular height above the horizon. That height can then be used to compute distance from the subpoint to create a circular line of position. A navigator shoots a number of stars in succession to give a series of overlapping lines of position. Where they intersect is the <b>celestial</b> <b>fix.</b> The moon and sun may also be used. The sun can also be used by itself to shoot a succession of lines of position (best done around local noon) to determine a position.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} the mid-1960s, {{advanced}} electronic and computer systems had evolved enabling navigators to obtain automated <b>celestial</b> sight <b>fixes.</b> These systems were used aboard both ships and US Air Force aircraft, and were highly accurate, able to lock onto up to 11 stars (even in daytime) and resolve the craft's position to less than 300 ft. The SR-71 high-speed reconnaissance aircraft was one example of an aircraft that used a combination of automated celestial and inertial navigation. These rare systems were expensive, however, and the few that remain in use today are regarded as backups to more reliable satellite positioning systems.|$|R

Moreover, by introducing spatial data processing and display functions in a Geographical Information System, calculation results and chart work used in Circle of Position graphical positioning can both be integrated. As a result, in addition to avoiding tedious and complicated computational and graphical procedures, this work has more flexibility and is more robust when compared to other analytical approaches...|$|E

40|$|Abridged) We present WMAP seven-year {{observations}} of bright sources {{which are often}} used as calibrators at microwave frequencies. Ten objects are studied in five frequency bands (23 - 94 GHz) : the outer planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) and five <b>fixed</b> <b>celestial</b> sources (Cas A, Tau A, Cyg A, 3 C 274 and 3 C 58). The seven-year analysis of Jupiter provides temperatures which are within 1 -sigma of the previously published WMAP five-year values, with slightly tighter constraints on variability with orbital phase, and limits (but no detections) on linear polarization. Scaling factors are provided which, when multiplied by the Wright Mars thermal model predictions at 350 micron, reproduce WMAP seasonally averaged {{observations of}} Mars within ~ 2 %. An empirical model is described which fits brightness variations of Saturn due to geometrical effects {{and can be used}} to predict the WMAP observations to within 3 %. Seven-year mean temperatures for Uranus and Neptune are also tabulated. Uncertainties in Uranus temperatures are 3 %- 4 % in the 41, 61 and 94 GHz bands; the smallest uncertainty for Neptune is ~ 8 % for the 94 GHz band. Intriguingly, the spectrum of Uranus appears to show a dip at ~ 30 GHz of unidentified origin, although the feature is not of high statistical significance. Flux densities for the five selected <b>fixed</b> <b>celestial</b> sources are derived from the seven-year WMAP sky maps, and are tabulated for Stokes I, Q and U, along with polarization fraction and position angle. Fractional uncertainties for the Stokes I fluxes are typically 1 % to 3 %. Source variability over the seven-year baseline is also estimated. Significant secular decrease is seen for Cas A and Tau A: our results are consistent with a frequency independent decrease of about 0. 53 % per year for Cas A and 0. 22 % per year for Tau A.

40|$|Astrometry is {{the science}} of {{measuring}} the positions of astronomical objects in the sky, and as such forms a practical bedrock for astrophysics in general. This is because {{it is only when}} a source's position is unambiguously known, can it be observed while it transits across the sky or be detected at different wavelengths. One of the first discoveries as a result of astrometry was in differentiating between the planets in our Solar System and the stars in the Milky Way. Early astronomers would have noted the arcminute/day rate of proper motion of the nearby planets with respect to the distant <b>celestial</b> objects <b>fixed</b> in the sky with the passage of time. With the advancement of telescopes the arcsecond/year proper motions for the fastest moving nearby stars was resolved as well. In comparing comets or asteroid size objects of a few kilometres, to galaxies spanning hundreds of thousands of light-years, it becomes apparent that the absolute size of astronomical objects extends across dimensions spanning many orders of magnitude. Despite this, the distances to these objects render many of them regardless of size to be minuscule pinpoints, when viewed from the Earth. The accuracy with which an object's position can be known is governed by the diffraction limit θd ≈ λ/D of the observing system and improvements in astrometric resolution have led to astronomical discoveries including Earth's precession, stellar aberration, atmospheric refraction, particle jets from black holes, the rate of expansion of planetary nebulae, detailed structure of circumstellar disks and out outflows from protostars, high-energy jets from quasars and the orbits of exoplanets around distant stars. The focus of this thesis is on the impact of accurate astrometry to measure trigonometric stellar parallaxes (from now on parallax) towards masers in high-mass star formation regions (HMSFRs) in the Milky Way galaxy using the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{two-point}} {{angular correlation}} function {{is a traditional}} method used to search for deviations from expectations of isotropy. In this paper we develop and explore a statistically descriptive three-point method with the intended application being the search for deviations from isotropy in the highest energy cosmic rays. We compare the sensitivity of a two-point method and a "shape-strength" method {{for a variety of}} Monte-Carlo simulated anisotropic signals. Studies are done with anisotropic source signals diluted by an isotropic background. Type I and II errors for rejecting the hypothesis of isotropic cosmic ray arrival directions are evaluated for four different event sample sizes: 27, 40, 60 and 80 events, consistent with near term data expectations from the Pierre Auger Observatory. In all cases the ability to reject the isotropic hypothesis improves with event size and with the fraction of anisotropic signal. While ~ 40 event data sets should be sufficient for reliable identification of anisotropy in cases of rather extreme (highly anisotropic) data, much larger data sets are suggested for reliable identification of more subtle anisotropies. The shape-strength method consistently performs better than the two point method and can be easily adapted to an arbitrary experimental exposure on the <b>celestial</b> sphere.

40|$|The {{methods of}} <b>celestial</b> {{navigation}} to <b>fix</b> the ship position {{in line with}} the stars are only applied in the twilight time interval when both the celestial bodies and the horizon apppear simultaneously. This means that these methods cannot be used during the night even if the stars are visible. This paper proposes a novel approach which uses the azimuth of the celestial body in order to establish the great circle equation relating the observed body to the ship position when the celestial bodies appear. In addition, the proposed method does not demand the horizon and sextant equipment as with the previous methods. The key advantage which differentiates this method from previous ones is its ability to determine the ship position during the night when the horizon is invisible. Firstly, the vector calculus is applied to find the mathematical equation for the ship position through analyzing the relationship between the ship position and the great-circle azimuth of the observed body. Secondly, the equation system for the ship position is expanded into a standard system in which the input for the proposed mathematical system are the great-circle azimuth and the coordinates of the observed body. Finally, the numerical technique is also proposed to solve the nonlinear system for the ship position. To verify the validation of this proposed method, a numerical experiment is carried out and the results show that it can be applied well in practice...|$|R
