5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} Mongolian {{script was}} adapted from Uyghur script probably {{at the very beginning}} of the 13th century and from that time underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementations. Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state, and after a preparatory phase, the Mongolian Cyrillic script was declared mandatory by government decree. It has been argued that the 1941 introduction of the Cyrillic script, with its smaller discrepancy between written and spoken form, contributed to the success of the large-scale government literacy campaign, which increased the literacy rate from 17.3% to 73.5% between 1941 and 1950. Earlier government campaigns to eradicate illiteracy, employing the traditional script, had only managed to raise literacy from 3.0% to 17.3% between 1921 and 1940. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt at reintroducing the traditional alphabet failed in the face of popular resistance. In informal <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> electronic text production, the use of the Latin alphabet is common.|$|E
5|$|This {{concentration}} is offered {{in partnership with}} Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Pastoral Care Department (RWJUH). Students in the D.Min. concentration in Pastoral Care & Counseling / Pastoral Theology will benefit from advanced theological study and professional work specifically designed for those who desire to serve as chaplains, pastoral care specialists, pastoral counselors or congregational pastors. The program emphasizes the helping relationship, theological understandings of pastoral care, the multicultural <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> pastoral care, psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of pastoral care and counseling. A race, class, and gender analysis will be appropriated {{to the practice of}} care and counseling. Questions regarding the program may be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min. Concentration in Pastoral Care and Counseling.|$|E
30|$|Schlenker (2004) {{shows that}} the {{distinction}} he proposes can also account for another reporting style, the historical present. Whereas in FID the actual context is identified with the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance and the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought corresponds {{to that of the}} reported speech or thought, in the historical present the opposite applies: the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought is identified with the actual context whereas the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance is that of the reported speech or thought. The historical present is, Schlenker contends, one of the combinatorial possibilities expected once the distinction between <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought and <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance is made.|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, FID is also {{different}} from indirect discourse. Indirect discourse {{not only makes}} {{clear that there is}} a <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance distinct from the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the original thought, it also crucially shifts the interpretive mood proper to the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought into the interpretive mood proper to the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance. This means that though the reported propositional content is intended to reproduce the content of the utterance that took place at a given <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought, all the linguistic expressions that are used to convey this content are interpreted with respect to the actual <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance. This entails that what a protagonist said at a given <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought is now interpreted {{from the perspective of a}} different speaker.|$|R
5|$|Watson's basic working {{principle}} is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared with human Jeopardy! players. Watson has deficiencies in understanding the <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response. Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{validity}} of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings. Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is {{not as strong as}} suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts. Moreover, Joseph and Newman (2010) suggested that emotional perception and emotional regulation components of EI highly contribute to job performance under job <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> high emotional demands. Moon and Hur (2011) found that emotional exhaustion (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. Emotional exhaustion showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high emotional exhaustion contexts.|$|E
30|$|In a nutshell, we can {{say that}} direct {{discourse}} maintains <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought and <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance completely distinct, whereas indirect discourse conflates them into a single context. Maier’s insight is that FID is a form <b>of</b> mixed quotation: <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought and <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance are kept separated (as in direct discourse), but with a limited amount of pragmatically motivated exceptions. From this perspective, FID would amount to an ‘imperfect’ form of direct discourse. This would explain why virtually all linguistic and metalinguistic indicators point towards direct discourse.|$|R

30|$|As {{many readers}} {{seemed to find}} this analogy helpful, and took it up in {{education}} work (e.g. Derewianka 1990 : 19), I continued to use the terms <b>context</b> <b>of</b> culture and <b>context</b> <b>of</b> situation as glosses on genre and register {{in at least two}} publications (the relevant quotes are reproduced below from Martin 1992 a and Eggins & Martin 1997). By Martin 1997, thanks to Matthiessen’s 1993 clarifications, I came to appreciate the confusion that this analogy had created (which few other than Matthiessen seemed to find intriguing) – because of Halliday’s (e.g. 2002) use <b>of</b> the terms <b>context</b> <b>of</b> culture and <b>context</b> <b>of</b> situation for instantiation, not supervenience. The problem is discussed in the third quote below. Since the terms <b>context</b> <b>of</b> culture and <b>context</b> <b>of</b> situation had never been theoretical categories in my model, but simply intertextual glosses on genre and register, I tried to avoid them in subsequent publications.|$|R
