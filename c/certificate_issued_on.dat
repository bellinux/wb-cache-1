25|$|On 18 May 1945 Berlin's {{provisional}} city council, newly {{installed by}} the Soviet occupational power, had appointed Grüber as advisor for ecclesiastical affairs. This {{earned him a}} bilingual Russian-German <b>certificate,</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> 21 May, to spare him from the usual robbery of bikes by Soviet soldiers, {{so that he could}} move at all in the city, with all the transportation system having collapsed, and an exemption from the curfew valid for Germans, issued on 9 July. On 15 July 1945 Dibelius appointed Grüber as Provost of St. Mary's and St. Nicholas' Church in Berlin and invested him on 8 August in a ceremony in St. Mary's Church, only partially cleared from the debris. Thus his time as pastor in Kaulsdorf ended. In 1946 the congregation commissioned the construction of a simple tent roof, covering the tower stump. Grüber's organisation for the relief of the survivors, today named Evangelical Relief Centre for the formerly Racially Persecuted, found later new premises in West Berlin's locality of Zehlendorf, so the Grübers moved there in 1949.|$|E

40|$|The {{computerized}} records {{held by the}} Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice {{have been}} reviewed to determine the post-registration experience offered by doctors who were issued with a joint committee certificate during the years 1985 - 90, inclusive. The percentage of <b>certificates</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> the basis of experience prescribed in the vocational training regulations rose from 74. 4 % in 1985 to 89. 7 % in 1990. Since 1985 obstetrics/gynaecology has been the specialty in which {{the greatest number of}} successful applicants have offered experience, increasing from 86. 4 % in 1985 to 93. 8 % in 1990. The next most popular specialty was accident and emergency/general surgery (offered by 65. 5 % of successful applicants in 1985 and 73. 6 % in 1990) followed by paediatrics (56. 7 % in 1985 and 62. 2 % in 1990). The percentage of <b>certificates</b> <b>issued</b> <b>on</b> the basis of experience in geriatric medicine rose slowly from 35. 6 % in 1985 to 41. 7 % in 1990, for psychiatry the figures were similar (36. 4 % in 1985 and 40. 7 % in 1990), and for general medicine there was a slight decrease (46. 2 % in 1985 and 44. 7 % in 1990). There is a need for more doctors to acquire experience in general medicine, geriatric medicine and psychiatry. Since 1985, the trend has been for applicants to offer a more broadly based range of experience. In 1985, 48. 5 % of successful applicants offered experience in four hospital specialties and this rose to 63. 6 % in 1990. Although the vocational training regulations offer a degree of flexibility {{only a small number of}} successful applicants have taken advantage of this. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
