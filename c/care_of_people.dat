The theoretic part shows up the concept of illness, basic needs <b>of</b> ill <b>people</b> and the concept <b>of</b> pastoral <b>care</b> <b>of</b> ill <b>people</b> {{in the view of}} chosen authors. The practical part contains the comparison of two forms <b>of</b> pastoral <b>care</b> <b>of</b> ill <b>people.</b> It is the service of five pastoral assistants, who are exercising their service in hospitals, and the service of five priests, who are visiting hospitals within their service in parishes. The pastoral assistants work in hospital four up to eight hours a day during working days and they exercise the pastoral care in the form of accompanying <b>of</b> ill <b>people</b> { [...] } that means they are in a dialogue with ill people and they participate in their life situations. The priests visit hospitals mainly in order to sacrament dispense. By the confrontation of the service of both groups of persons involved in pastoral <b>care</b> <b>of</b> ill <b>people</b> with that, what chosen authors write about this service, appeared that only the pastoral assistants fulfil the intention <b>of</b> the pastoral <b>care</b> <b>of</b> ill <b>people,</b> that is the accompanying <b>of</b> ill <b>people</b> in their difficult situation of illness...|$|R

Besides the national censuses -which take place every ten years-, the Ministry of Economy carries out periodical regional censuses sampling urban areas collecting data on economic and social indexes, such as Encuesta Permanente de Hogares by INDEC. There are two principal hospitals in the city: a provincial one, Hospital Dr José Penna, and a municipal one, Hospital Municipal Dr Leónidas Lucero, both of them tertiary centres for assistance and referrals throughout the region. The health care system is free of charge to any legal resident of the Nation. Public Health is the responsibility of both the Province of Buenos Aires and the City, which have a network of public clinics throughout the city and the region taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> as primary health carers. There are also private health care institutions. There is one physician for every 266 inhabitants.

5000|$|Geriatrics or {{geriatric}} {{medicine is}} a specialty {{that focuses on}} health <b>care</b> <b>of</b> elderly <b>people.</b> It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be under the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> a geriatrician or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> elderly <b>people.</b> Rather, this decision {{is determined by the}} individual patient's needs, and the availability of a specialist. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> aged <b>people,</b> and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term geriatrics comes from the Greek γέρων geron meaning [...] "old man", and ιατρός iatros meaning [...] "healer". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology.|$|R

2500|$|Historian Carl Bridenbaugh {{examined}} in depth five key cities: Boston (population 16,000 in 1760), Newport Rhode Island (population 7500), New York City (population 18,000), Philadelphia (population 23,000), and Charles Town (Charlestown, South Carolina), (population 8000). He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating {{the ideas of}} the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. Furthermore, they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> meeting welfare. The cities were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive than corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure, and solve urban problems. They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid. Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as [...] "sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest," [...] public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to [...] "democratic yearnings" [...] for political power.|$|E
