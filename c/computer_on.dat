5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any <b>computer</b> <b>on</b> the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any <b>computer</b> <b>on</b> the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts and Bill Yates {{finished}} the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to Popular Electronics in New York via the Railway Express Agency. However, it never arrived {{due to a}} strike by the shipping company. Solomon already {{had a number of}} pictures of the machine and the article was based on them. Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The <b>computer</b> <b>on</b> the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.|$|E
5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the <b>computer</b> <b>on</b> 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall. The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that displayed {{the state of the}} game, with the actual computer taking up no more than two percent of the total volume of the machine. The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with a raised stand in front of it with buttons corresponding with the lights, which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E

5|$|Gimmick!, known outside Japan as Mr. Gimmick, is a {{platform}} video game developed {{and published by}} Sunsoft, and originally released in Japan for the Family <b>Computer</b> <b>on</b> 31 January 1992. The story follows a small green character named Yumetaro who was given to a young girl as a birthday present. One night, the girl's other toys become jealous of the attention he is receiving, and whisk the girl away to another dimension. Playing as Yumetaro, the player must maneuver {{through a variety of}} levels, using the protagonist's star-shooting power to defeat enemies and progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|On December 14, 1999, Hyperion Entertainment {{announced}} their {{acquisition of the}} license to port FreeSpace to the Amiga system. The publisher was changed to Haage & Partner <b>Computer</b> <b>on</b> October 18, 2001. Despite the game's official release being announced for December 2001, the approval to do so could only be gotten on January 7, 2002. The game was shipped without a printed manual, but had additional German and French language support. Hyperion had stated they would port over Silent Threat if the FreeSpace port sold well. To date, Silent Threat {{has yet to be}} ported over to the Amiga platform.|$|E
5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super <b>Computer.</b> <b>On</b> {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E

TMS allows delays to be minimised through a computer running algorithms and deciding how best to return traffic patterns to normal.|$|E
