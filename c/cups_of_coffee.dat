40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{correlation}} between different temperatures and one’s mood. The ultimate {{purpose of the study}} is to determine which temperature cold or warm is better for projecting a positive mood on humans. A major part {{of this study is to}} examine the affect that the human thermoreceptors play in determining ones mood. The behavioral mood is measured by using both warm and cold <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffees</b> which was held by the participant (each in its own respective time). The warm <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> has a temperature of 45 degree Celsius and the Cold <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> has a temperature of 10 degree Celsius. Participants showed different mood behaviors when holding the warm and cold <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffees,</b> this was influenced by a picture which was given to them (the picture being of a random person). While holding a warm or cold <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> participants had to state their views of the person being portrayed in the picture. Their response was then gathered and stored as data. The statistical data suggest when holding a warm <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> the participants had a positive reaction to the person being portrayed in the picture, but when holding the cold <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> they had a negative reaction towards the picture. This study validates that the human-feeling relates to the Physical nature of substances that is reflection of thermoreceptors...|$|R

30|$|Before {{discussing}} the marginal sense, I digress {{to explain how}} to judge whether an object has a gradable property in the semantics. For example, to judge whether a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> is expensive, one should see if the degrees of the property (i.e., being expensive) <b>of</b> the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> are {{higher than those of}} the standard of comparison in the context. If so, the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> is judged to have the property of being expensive. This intuition is formalized by the semantics of the positive morpheme (pos) (Kennedy 2007; also see Liu 2010 a).|$|R

25|$|The latest dietary {{guidelines}} {{from the}} U.S. suggest that moderate caffeine intake may {{not only be}} safe, but also healthy. Studies from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services show that daily consumption {{of the amount of}} caffeine contained in three to five <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> is not only safe, but also appears {{to reduce the risk of}} Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adults. Caffeine may even protect against Parkinson's disease, the evidence suggests.|$|E
25|$|The UK Food Standards Agency has {{recommended}} that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, {{to less than}} 200mg of caffeine a day– the equivalent of two cups of instant coffee, or {{one and a half}} to two cups of fresh coffee. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200mg per day in pregnant women. For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300mg, or a little over two 8oz (237mL) <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b>|$|E

50|$|Consider {{for example}} workers who take coffee beans, use a roaster to roast them, {{and then use}} a brewer to brew and {{dispense}} a fresh <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> In performing this labor, these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients <b>of</b> a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> The worker also transfers the value of constant capital—the value of the beans; some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer; {{and the value of}} the cup—to the value <b>of</b> the final <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> Again, on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labor previously possessed to the finished <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> So the value <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labor—this constant capital—and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work.|$|R
25|$|Massive {{overdose}} {{can result}} in death. The LD50 of caffeine in humans is dependent on individual sensitivity, but {{is estimated to be}} 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body mass (75–100 <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> for a 70 kilogram adult). A number of fatalities have been caused by overdoses of readily available powdered caffeine supplements, for which the estimated lethal amount is less than a tablespoon. The lethal dose is lower in individuals whose ability to metabolize caffeine is impaired due to genetics or chronic liver disease A death was reported in a man with liver cirrhosis who overdosed on caffeinated mints.|$|E
25|$|Doses of {{caffeine}} {{equivalent to the}} amount normally found in standard servings of tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no diuretic action. However, acute ingestion {{of caffeine}} in large doses (at least 250–300mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2–3 <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> or 5–8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine {{for a period of}} days or weeks. This increase is due to both a diuresis (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users of caffeine develop a tolerance to this effect, and experience no increase in urinary output.|$|E

25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} both {{positive}} and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience insomnia or sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit consumption to the equivalent of two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence– associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability– when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use).|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect {{that it has}} on people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 priming words that were displayed on a monitor {{for a short period}} of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight words that were phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated. Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the placebo group, suggesting better memory recall. However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not do as well as the placebo group in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose of caffeine (equivalent to two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee)</b> can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect of caffeine on attention can be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Four {{months after}} Poirot's death, Hastings {{receives}} a manuscript in which Poirot explains all. X was Norton, {{a man who}} had perfected the technique of which Iago in Othello (and a character in Ervine's play) is master: applying just such psychological pressure as is needed to provoke someone to commit murder, without his victim realising what is happening. Norton had demonstrated this ability, with Colonel Luttrell, with Hastings, and Mrs Franklin. Poirot intervened with sleeping pills in Hastings' hot chocolate that night, to avert a disastrous rash action. Ironically, Hastings had unwittingly intervened in Mrs. Franklin's plan to poison her husband, by turning a revolving bookcase table while seeking a book to solve a crossword clue (Othello again), thus swapping the <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> so Mrs Franklin poisoned herself. Poirot could not prove this. He sensed that Norton, who had been deliberately vague about whom he had seen through the binoculars, would hint that he had seen Franklin and Judith, to implicate them in the murder of Mrs Franklin, not inadvertent suicide as it was. This explains Poirot's testimony at her inquest, to ensure the police would stop their investigation.|$|E

25|$|Paul Bert Rahasimanana {{was born}} in 1960 to a working-class family. At the age of seven, he was given an {{accordion}} as a gift and began teaching himself to play. In the early 1970s, Rahasimanana {{and a group of}} friends formed an a capella group called Hazo Midoroboka and began singing traditional consolatory songs (mamonjy jaobany) for those grieving at wakes held in their neighborhood of Ampamarinana in the Mahamasina district of Antananarivo. Mourners paid the members of the group in the form of free <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and fritters. Like many other urban youth from working class and poor neighborhoods, Rossy also performed soava and vakisova, contemporary and typically a capella urban genres that expressed incisive social critique through slang-laden, rapped lyrics with complex hand-clapping accompaniment. While a high school student in 1981 he formed his first band, using African percussion rather than a Western drum kit to set the rhythm. In 1983, Rossy gave his first public performance of a song he had composed in the lively vakisôva genre. The performance occurred in the courtyard of the historic Ecole Sainte Famille located in Mahamasina and was attended by local television host Tsilavina Ralaindimby, who recognized the young man's talent. Ralaindimby brought him {{to the attention of the}} director of the Centre Germano-Malgache, who was sufficiently impressed to collaborate with WDR (the predecessor of Radio France Internationale) to organize a four-month series of performances for Rossy in Germany.|$|E
