5|$|Although not {{as active}} in routine business, Johnson still took an {{interest}} in political events. For example, he spearheaded the efforts of the booksellers of London and Westminster to appeal a new copyright law in 1808. Moreover, although Johnson did not publish controversial political works after his imprisonment, he still undertook important publishing ventures. For example, he administered the publication of a forty-five volume work entitled The British Essayists, edited by Alexander Chalmers; the complete works of Samuel Johnson; and a ten-volume set of Shakespeare. Johnson published in more <b>congers</b> during the last decade of his life than at any other time. He also occasionally published important new authors, such as the political economist Thomas Malthus, whose Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) sparked a long debate between idealists and pragmatists. His emphasis on educational books continued or even increased as his interest in publishing contentious political works diminished. He also continued to support his friends, as with Godwin, who needed financial rescue after his play, Faulkener, cost him £800.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Frémont, with Col. Gustave P. Cluseret's brigade in the lead, renewed his advance {{from the}} {{vicinity}} of Harrisonburg. After driving away the Confederate skirmishers, Cluseret reached and deployed his right flank along the Keezletown Road near Union Church. One by one, the Union brigades came into line: Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck on Cluseret's right, Brig. Gen. Robert H. Milroy on his left, and Brig. Gen. Julius H. Stahel on the far left, his left flank near <b>Congers</b> Creek. Brig. Gen. William H. C. Bohlen's and Col. John A. Koltes's brigades were held in reserve {{near the center of}} the line. A regiment of Union cavalry moved south on the road to secure the right flank. Batteries were brought to the front.|$|E
25|$|Early {{students}} wore a mortarboard or trencher, {{although this}} had been discontinued by 1871. In 1876, a straw boater with ribbon of broad diagonal stripes {{of black and white}} was introduced. The black and white stripes led to the boys being nicknamed magpies. A metal cap badge was being worn by 1883, and it was around this time that the black and gold colours were first associated with the college. Under the headmastership of R.H. Chambers (1881–1892) the chocolate and white colour scheme was introduced, along with differences in uniform between the junior and senior schools. Juniors wore a chocolate-coloured pillbox hat with a white Maltese cross on the front; seniors wore a chocolate-coloured cap with the coat of arms of Jersey in white. The tails on the heraldic leopards in this badge were so long that the boys were nicknamed College <b>congers</b> as a result. In 1893, black and gold replaced chocolate and white, and straw boaters were black and white with a ribbon of black-gold-black. The coat of arms of Jersey on the badge was depicted as black leopards on gold. These designs lasted until 1927, when chocolate and white made a return under headmaster A.H. Worrall in the form of caps with concentric rings of black, white and chocolate. At the same time, the four house colours appeared as backings to the badge on boys' caps according to their respective houses. Until the Second World War boarders had a maroon cap with blue ribbon. Under conditions of military occupation, clothing was scarce. In 1945 a navy blue cap was adopted as a temporary measure, and in 1947 a chocolate cap with radiating piping of black and white was chosen from a range of options; worn with a blazer of royal blue, gold and crimson. In 1952 black and gold made a definitive return: a black cap with radiating piping and a badge, both gold; a black blazer with gold badge on the pocket. Chocolate and white were retained as sports colours.|$|E

60|$|Strong brown lines they were, {{wound on}} little square wooden frames, {{each with a}} heavy leaden sinker {{and a couple of}} strong coarse hooks of whitened metal {{attached}} to the lines by stout whipcord; for the denizens of those western waters were not the poddlies, coddlings, and shrimps that one is apt to associate with summer resorts by the sea. They were those veritable inhabitants of the deep that figure on the slabs of Billingsgate and similar markets--plaice and skate of the largest dimensions, <b>congers</b> that might suggest the great sea serpent, and even sharks of considerable size.|$|E
6000|$|These water-goblins and water-monsters {{are common}} in Scottish folk- lore. We have them too, but take them much less dreadfully. Our tales turn all their doings to favour and to prettiness, or hopelessly humorize the creatures. A hole in the Sligo river is haunted by one of these monsters. He is ardently {{believed}} in by many, {{but that does not}} prevent the peasantry playing with the subject, and surrounding it with conscious fantasies. When I was a small boy I fished one day for <b>congers</b> in the monster hole. Returning home, a great eel on my shoulder, his head flapping down in front, his tail sweeping the ground behind, I met a fisherman of my acquaintance. I began a tale of an immense conger, three times larger than the one I carried, that had broken my line and escaped. [...] "That was him," [...] said the fisherman. [...] "Did you ever hear how he made my brother emigrate? My brother was a diver, you know, and grubbed stones for the Harbour Board. One day the beast comes up to him, and says, 'What are you after?' 'Stones, sur,' says he. 'Don't you think you had better be going?' 'Yes, sur,' says he. And that's why my brother emigrated. The people said it was because he got poor, but that's not true." ...|$|E

50|$|The silvery <b>conger</b> (Ariosoma anago) {{also known}} as the sea <b>conger,</b> the darkfin <b>conger,</b> the dark-finned conger-eel, or simply the <b>conger</b> eel, is an eel in the family Congridae (conger/garden eels).

60|$|Exactly the {{opposite}} fate {{has happened to}} the eels. The salmonoids as a family are freshwater fish, and by far the greater number of kinds--trout, char, whitefish, grayling, pollan, vendace, gwyniad, and so forth--are inhabitants of lakes, steams, ponds, and rivers, only a very small number having taken permanently or temporarily to a marine residence. But the eels, as a family, are a saltwater group, most of their allies, like the <b>congers</b> and murænas, being exclusively confined to the sea, and only {{a very small number of}} aberrant types having ever taken to invading inland waters. If the life-history of the salmon, however, has given rise to as much controversy as the Mar peerage, the life-history of the eel is a complete mystery. To begin with, nobody has ever so much as distinguished between male and female eels; except microscopically, eels have never been seen in the act of spawning, nor observed anywhere with mature eggs. The ova themselves are wholly unknown: the mode of their production is a dead secret. All we know is this: that eels never reproduce in fresh water; that a certain number of adults descend the rivers to the sea, irregularly, during the winter months; and that some of these must presumably spawn with the utmost circumspection in brackish water or in the deep sea, for in the course of the summer myriads of young eels, commonly called grigs, and proverbial for their merriment, ascend the rivers in enormous bodies, and enter every smaller or larger tributary.|$|E
