We used a reverse genetics approach to identify 11 DHR 3 mutants from a pool of lethal mutations in the 46 F region on the second chromosome. Two DHR 3 mutations result in amino acid substitutions within the conserved DNA binding domain. Analysis of DHR 3 mutants reveals that DHR 3 function is required to complete embryogenesis.

40|$|FTZ-F 1, {{a member}} of the steroid {{receptor}} superfamily, has been implicated in the activation of the homeobox segmentation gene fushi tarazu early in Drosophila embryogenesis. We have cloned a developmental isoform of FTZ-F 1 and found that it is expressed as a product of the previously identified, midprepupal <b>chromosome</b> <b>puff</b> at 75 CD. The 75 CD puff occurs {{in the midst of a}} period of intense puffing activity that is triggered in response to the steroid hormone ecdysone at the onset of metamorphosis. Indirect immunofluorescent staining for FTZ-F 1 on Drosophila polytene chromosomes reveals binding to over 150 chromosomal targets, which include 75 CD itself and prominent late prepupal puffs that are predicted to be regulated by midprepupal puff proteins. These results suggest a role for FTZ-F 1 as a regulator of insect metamorphosis and underscore the repeated utilization of a regulatory protein for widely separate developmental pathways...|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster 68 C {{chromosomal}} locus {{is the site}} of a prominent polytene <b>chromosome</b> <b>puff</b> that harbors the genes Sgs- 3, Sgs- 7 and Sgs- 8. These genes code for proteins {{that are part of the}} salivary glue that Drosophila larvae secrete as a means of fixing themselves to an external substrate for the duration of the pre-pupal and pupal period. The 68 C glue genes are regulated by the steroid hormone ecdysterone, with the hormone required for both initiation and cessation of gene expression during the third larval instar. Previous work has defined sequences sufficient for expression of abundant levels of Sgs- 3 mRNA at the correct time and in the correct tissue. We show here that sequences sufficient for normal tissue- and stage-specific accumulation of Sgs- 3 RNA, but adequate only for low levels of expression, lie within 130 bp of the 5 ' end of the gene, or within the gene...|$|E
40|$|The {{polytene}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>puff</b> at 68 C on the Drosophila melanogaster third chromosome {{is thought}} from genetic experiments {{to contain the}} structural gene {{for one of the}} secreted salivary gland glue polypeptides, sgs- 3. Previous work has demonstrated that the DNA included in this puff contains sequences that are transcribed to give three different polyadenylated RNAs that are abundant in third-larval-instar salivary glands. These have been called the group II, group III, and group IV RNAs. In the experiments reported here, we used the nucleotide sequence of the DNA coding for these RNAs to predict some of the physical and chemical properties expected of their protein products, including molecular weight, amino acid composition, and amino acid sequence. Salivary gland polypeptides with molecular weights similar to those expected for the 68 C RNA translation products, and with the expected degree of incorporation of different radioactive amino acids, were purified. These proteins were shown by amino acid sequencing to correspond to the protein products of the 68 C RNAs. It was further shown that each of these proteins {{is a part of the}} secreted salivary gland glue: the group IV RNA codes for the previously described sgs- 3, whereas the group II and III RNAs code for the newly identified glue polypeptides sgs- 8 and sgs- 7...|$|E
40|$|A {{polysome}} {{extract from}} salivary glands of C. tentans was sedimented in a 15 - 60 % sucrose gradient. Fractions from the heavy polysome region (1, 000 - 2, 000 S) and fractions {{from the light}} polysome region (200 - 1, 000 S) were pooled separately, and the long-term labeled RNA was released by Sarkosyl/pronase and analysed by in situ hybridization. The results showed that BR 1 and BR 2 sequences {{were present in the}} heavy and the light polysome regions of the sucrose gradient. From control experiments with EDTA-treated extracts, it was concluded that most of the recorded BR 1 and BR 2 sequences were in fact located in polysomes. The finding that BR products enter polysomes suggests that they act as messenger RNA molecules. This study therefore strongly supports the concept that <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffs</b> represent active genes...|$|R
40|$|The base {{composition}} of RNA from individually isolated giant <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>puffed</b> <b>chromosome</b> segments, nucleoli, and samples of cytoplasm from Chironomus salivary gland cells {{was determined by}} microelectrophoresis. Data on the adenine: guanine quotient of the chromosomal DNA were also obtained. The results show that: 1) Chromosomal, nucleolar, and cytoplasmic RNA's differ significantly {{from each other in}} base composition. 2) Nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA's, in spite of the difference, show great similarities with regard to the base composition and are both rich in adenine and uracil. 3) The RNA extracted from chromosome I differs significantly from the RNA's extracted from different segments of chromosome IV, and the latter differ significantly from each other. 4) The values for the RNA: DNA quotients of chromosome segments parallel the development of synthetically active genes, so-called Balbiani rings. 5) The chromosomal RNA does not show a base symmetry in any of the investigated cases, nor is the content of guanine + cytosine the same as that for DNA. The first of these two facts excludes the possibility that the chromosomal RNA is a complete copy of both strands of the chromosomal DNA. In spite of the difference in guanine + cytosine content between the two nucleic acids the RNA may still partly or completely be a single strand copy depending upon how representative the DNA values are for the synthetically active DNA...|$|R
50|$|Ecdysone is a steroidal prohormone of {{the major}} insect molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone, which is {{secreted}} from the prothoracic glands. Insect molting hormones (ecdysone and its homologues) are generally called ecdysteroids. Ecdysteroids act as moulting hormones of arthropods but also occur in other related phyla where they can play different roles. In Drosophila melanogaster, an increase in ecdysone concentration induces the expression of genes coding for proteins that the larva requires, and it causes <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffs</b> (sites of high expression) to form in polytene chromosomes. Recent findings in Chris Q. Doe lab have found a novel role of this hormone in regulating temporal gene transitions within neural stem cells. Ecdysone and other ecdysteroids also appear in many plants mostly as a protection agent (toxins or antifeedants) against herbivorous insects. These phytoecdysteroids have been reputed to have medicinal value and are part of herbal adaptogenic remedies like Cordyceps, yet an ecdysteroid precursor in plants {{has been shown to}} have cytotoxic properties. A pesticide sold with the name MIMIC has ecdysteroid activity, although its chemical structure has little resemblance to the ecdysteroids.|$|R
40|$|The {{steroid hormone}} 20 -OH {{ecdysone}} triggers a classic and well-defined program of <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffing</b> that {{is assumed to}} reflect changes in transcriptional activity in Drosophila salivary glands. Mutations in each of four Broad-Complex locus (BR-C) complementation groups were analyzed for their effects on the expression of other genes that reside in several major salivary gland puffs. RNA blot analysis showed that the rbp function of the BR-C {{is required for the}} transcription of six genes in the 71 E late puff and is the first demonstration that an ecdysone-induced early gene controls the transcription of late genes within the puffing cascade. In addition, the rbp function is required for the transcription of four intermolt genes (Sgs- 3, Sgs- 4, Sgs- 5 and 71 E gene VII). Mutations in the broad, l(1) 2 Bc and l(1) 2 Bd functions of the BR-C had no effect on the expression of the genes examined.

40|$|Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) {{proteins}} {{are responsible}} for the maintenance of stable transcription patterns of many developmental regulators, such as the homeotic genes. We have used ChIP-on-chip to compare the distribution of several PcG/TrxG proteins, as well as histone modifications in active and repressed genes across the two homeotic complexes ANT-C and BX-C. Our data indicate the colocalization of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC 1) with Trx and the DNA binding protein Pleiohomeotic (Pho) at discrete sequence elements as well as significant chromatin assembly differences in active and inactive regions. Trx binds to the promoters of active genes and noncoding transcripts. Most strikingly, in the active state, Pho covers extended chromatin domains over many kilobases. This feature of Pho, observed on many polytene <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffs,</b> reflects a previously undescribed function. At the hsp 70 gene, we demonstrate in mutants that Pho is required for transcriptional recovery after heat shock. Besides its presumptive function in recruiting PcG complexes to their site of action, our results now uncover that Pho plays an additional role in the repression of already induced genes...|$|R
40|$|We have {{generated}} {{a number of}} chromosomal aberrations that disrupt the early-late ecdysone-induced 78 C puff gene (Eip 78 C, ecdysone-induced protein, FlyBase name for the E 78 gene of STONE and THUMMEL 1993), which encodes the {{two members of the}} nuclear hormone receptor superfamily Eip 78 C-A and Eip 78 C-B. The aberrations include deletions of the ligand-binding/dimerization domain of both, inversions that split Eip 78 C-A but retain residual Eip 78 C-B expression, and a small deletion specific for Eip 78 C-B. We find that wild-type Eip 78 C functions are completely dispensable for normal development under laboratory conditions. However, we show that Eip 78 C-B is required for the maximal puffing activity of a subset of late puffs (63 E and 82 F) since these puffs are reduced in size in Eip 78 C-B mutant backgrounds. Paradoxically the same late puffs are reduced, as well as at least one other, when the Eip 78 C-B cDNA is overexpressed from a heat shock promoter. These data indicate either that Eip 78 C function is redundant or that it plays a subtle modulating role in the regulation of <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The SuUR (suppressor of underreplication) gene {{controls}} late replication and underreplication of DNA in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes: its mutation suppresses DNA underreplication whereas additional {{doses of}} the normal allele strongly enhances underreplication. The SuUR protein is localized in late replicating and underreplicating regions. The N-terminal part of the SuUR protein shares modest similarity with the ATPase/helicase domain of SWI 2 /SNF 2 chromatin remodeling factors, suggesting a role in modification of chromatin structure. Here we describe novel structural modifications of polytene chromosomes (swellings) and show that SuUR controls chromatin organization in polytene chromosomes. The swellings develop {{as the result of}} SuUR ectopic expression in the transgene system Sgs 3 -GAL 4; UAS-SuUR(+). They are reminiscent of <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffs</b> and appear in similar to 190 regions of intercalary, pericentric and telomeric heterochromatin; some of them attain tremendous size. The swellings are temperature sensitive: they are maximal at 29 C and are barely visible at 18 degreesC. Shifting from 29 degreesC to 18 degreesC results in the complete recovery of the normal structure of chromosomes. The swellings are transcriptionally inactive, since they do not incorporate [H- 3]uridine. The SuUR protein is not visualized in regions of maximally developed swellings.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{regression}} of experimentally induced <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffs</b> {{was investigated in}} explanted salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila hydei. It was observed that the regression of the puffs 2 - 32 A, 2 - 36 A, 2 - 48 C, and 4 - 81 B is accelerated if substrates for the respiratory metabolism are supplied to the cells. A similar effect can be produced by addition of KCN or oligomycin to medium in which intact salivary glands are incubated. The acceleration of puff regression by these substances occurs not only if the puff inducing stimulus is removed but as well under conditions in which the stimulus is maintained. Regression of the puffs 2 - 32 A, 2 - 36 A, and 4 - 81 B is inhibited if cycloheximide {{is present in the}} incubation medium. Chloramphenicol has no effect on puff regression. Measurements on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dehydrogenase activity in homogenates of salivary glands revealed an increase in enzyme activity of 41 %. Maximum increase is attained at 30 min after the induced puffs have reached their maximum size. The increase in enzyme activity does not occur if the glands are kept in a medium containing either actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Chloramphenicol does not inhibit the increase in enzyme activity. The possible relationship between puff activity and its control as a result of changes in the respiratory metabolism is discussed...|$|R

In radioautographs 70 % of the nuclei displayed a distribution of labeled RNA over the nuclear constituents similar to the distribution obtained after in vivo incorporation of radioactive precursor. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>puffs</b> and the nucleoli were specifically labeled. The remaining 30 % of the nuclei showed a weak to very weak incorporation of radioactive precursor. In these nuclei most of the radioautographic grains were concentrated over the nucleolus, and a few grains were randomly distributed over the chromosomes. Actinomycin D {{and the absence of}} ATP, GTP, and CTP in the medium inhibited incorporation of radioactive precursor. The radioactive product was sensitive to combined pronase and RNase digestion. Addition of E. coli RNA polymerase to the incubation medium enhanced the specific labeling over the puffed regions.

40|$|The Ashburner {{model for}} the {{hormonal}} control of polytene <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffing</b> has provided a strong foundation for understand-ing the basic mechanisms of steroid-regulated gene expression (Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 38 (1974) 655). According to this model, the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone (referred here as ecdysone) directly induces {{the expression of a}} small set of early regulatory genes. These genes, in turn, induce a much larger set of late target genes that play a more direct role in controlling the biological responses to the hormone. The recent characterization of two early puff genes, E 63 - 1 and E 23, and three late puff genes, D-spinophilin, L 63, and L 82, provide further confirmation of the Ashburner model. In addition, these studies provide exciting new directions for our understanding of ecdysone signaling. Overexpression studies of E 63 - 1 implicate this gene in directing calcium-dependent salivary gland glue secretion. In contrast, overexpression of E 23 indicates that this ABC transporter family member may negatively regulate ecdysone signaling by actively transporting the hormone out of target cells. Finally, genetic studies of the L 63 and L 82 late genes reveal unexpected possible functions for ecdysone in controlling developmental timing and growth. This review surveys the recent characterization of these ecdysone-inducible genes and provides an overview of how they expand our understanding of ecdysone functions during development. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster E 74 gene is induced {{directly}} by the steroid hormone ecdysone {{and is a member}} of a small set of ``early'' genes that appear to trigger the onset of metamorphosis. The gene consists of three overlapping transcription units encoding two proteins, E 74 A and E 74 B, which possess a common C terminus. According to the Ashburner model for ecdysone's action, an E 74 protein product potentially functions as a transcriptional activator of ``late'' genes as well as a repressor of early genes. We have taken an evolutionary approach to understand the function and regulation of E 74 by isolating the homologous genes from Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila virilis and comparing them to D. melanogaster E 74 sequences. Conserved characteristics of the E 74 genes include ecdysone inducibility, localization to ecdysone-induced polytene <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffs,</b> and gene size. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the E 74 A protein reveal a highly conserved C-terminal region that is rich in basic amino acid residues and which has been proposed to possess sequence-specific DNA binding activity. The moderately conserved N-terminal region has maintained its overall acidic character and is a potential transcriptional activator domain. The central region contains conserved glutamine and alanine homopolymeric repeats of variable lengths. Nucleotide sequence comparisons of the E 74 A promoter region fail to reveal ecdysone-response elements but do identify conserved sequences that may function in E 74 A regulation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{antibody}} {{was identified}} previously that recognizes sites of polymerase II transcription on lampbrush <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>puffs</b> on polytene <b>chromosomes,</b> and many small granules in the nucleoplasm of all cells tested. This antibody binds a conserved family of phosphorylated polypeptides in vertebrate and invertebrate cells. We developed {{a method for}} purifying these proteins that involves differential solubility in MgC 12. We isolated a Drosophila cDNA encoding one of the proteins using information obtained from microsequencing. In vivo expression studies show that this protein is concentrated on sites of polymerase II transcription {{and that it is}} highly phosphorylated. The protein shares a high degree of homology with proteins involved in alternative splicing of pre-mRNA suggesting the possibility that this protein plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing. NASCENT transcripts are bound by proteins, concomitant with synthesis by polymerase II. This was demonstrated in observations of ribonuclease treated amphibian lampbrush chromosomes (Gall and Callan, 1962) where it is possible to see nascent protein-bound transcripts by light microscopy, and was later confirmed by a number of studies in other systems (Malcolm and Sommerville, 1974; Lamb and Daneholt, 1979). Electron microscopic studies of transcription units using spreading techniques developed by Miller and colleagues confirmed this observation (Miller and Bakken, 1972). Because of their role in the elaboration ofgenetic information, there has been a major effort to identify transcriptbinding proteins. To date, two sets have been identified: hnRNP and snRNP proteins. The hnRNP proteins, which number at least 24, have been defined by biochemical cofractionation with radiolabeled hnRNA (Samarina et al., 1966; Beyer et al., 1977) and more recently by immunochemical analysis (Pifiol-Roma et al., 1988). Several genes encoding hnRNP proteins have been cloned and at least one protein has been shown to interact directly with RNA in vitro (Merrill et al., 1988). Twelve snRNP proteins were identified by co-immunoprecipitation with snRNAs using an antibody that recognized a common epitope found on these protein...|$|R
40|$|JIL- 1 is {{the major}} kinase {{controlling}} phosphorylation of histone H 3 S 10 and has been demonstrated to function to counteract heterochromatization and gene silencing. However, an alternative model has been proposed in which JIL- 1 is required for transcription to occur, additionally phosphorylates H 3 S 28, and recruits 14 - 3 - 3 to active genes. Since these findings are incompatible with our previous demonstration that there are robust levels of transcription in the complete absence of JIL- 1 and that JIL- 1 is not present at developmental or heat shock-induced polytene <b>chromosome</b> <b>puffs,</b> we have reexamined JIL- 1 ’s possible role in H 3 S 28 phosphorylation and 14 - 3 - 3 recruitment. Using two different H 3 S 28 ph antibodies we show by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting that in Drosophila the H 3 S 28 ph mark is not present at detectable levels above background on polytene chromosomes at interphase but only on chromosomes at pro-, meta-, and anaphase during cell division in S 2 cells and third instar larval neuroblasts. Moreover, this mitotic H 3 S 28 ph signal is also present in a JIL- 1 null mutant background at undiminished levels suggesting that JIL- 1 is not the mitotic H 3 S 28 ph kinase. We also demonstrate that H 3 S 28 ph is not enriched at heat shock puffs. Using two different pan-specific 14 - 3 - 3 antibodies {{as well as an}} enhancer trap 14 - 3 - 3 e-GFP line we show that 14 - 3 - 3, while present in salivary gland nuclei, does not localize to chromosomes but only to the nuclear matrix surrounding the chromosomes.

In UV cross-linking assays, PEP binds with even higher affinity to hsp 70 transcripts, but not to transcripts of a flanking region or of a nearby gene, aurora.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Chromosome maps {{were made}} of Drosophila gibberosa salivary gland and fat body <b>chromosomes,</b> and the <b>puffing</b> {{patterns}} were compared in the two tissues for selected times in development. The times were early third instar (E), late third instar (0, at pupariation (0 hr), at two hours (2 hr), four hours (4 hr), and ten hours (10 hr) after pupariation, and at pupation (18 hr). A comparison of the chromomeric patterns between the salivary gland and fat body tissues revealed one definite difference in banding pattern between the two tissues. Four bands {{were found in the}} fat body chromosome 2 at a site corresponding to a constriction in the salivary gland chromosome 2. Implications concerning the determination of the number of genes per band were discussed. A comparison of chromosomal puffing patterns between salivary gland and fat body tissues revealed more differences than similarities between the two tissues. More puffs with variable developmental patterns and fewer constant puffs were found in the salivary gland than in the fat body, suggesting that during development the salivary gland tends to vary its functions while the fat body tends to perform the same functions. Tissue specific puffs were found for both tissues and probably represent functions unique to a tissue. Puffing activity in the fat body was compared between feeding larvae (L) and metamorphosing prepupae (10 hr). Most chromosome regions showed the same activity pattern suggesting mostly the same functions were performed at both times. That a few regions differed in activity suggests there are processes found in the feeding larvae which are not found in the metamorphosing prepupae and vice versa. Generalized puffing occurs in the X chromosomes in both tissues. It is more extreme in the male, and may be attributable to dosage compensation. Puffing events in both tissues are discussed in relationship to what is known of ecdosyne as an effector of puffing sequence. The general types of developmental puffing patterns found in D. gibberosa are the same as those reported for D. hydei and D. melanogaster. For the larval and puparium formation sample times, the salivary gland and fat body chromosomes in D. gibberosa had fewer constant puffs in common than did the salivary gland, malpighian tubules and intestine in D. hydei (Berendes, 1966). Whether or not this means a greater diversity of function actually exists between the salivary gland and fat body tissues in D. gibberosa than exists among the salivary gland, malphigian tubules and intestine in D. hydei is questionable as the differences could be due to differences in experimental methods...|$|R
