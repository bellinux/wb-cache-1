5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses <b>came</b> <b>by</b> <b>to</b> collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E

But the Belgian Army, apparently, doesn't run to a band. It has nothing but this drum. It has not even a real drum--not what I call a drum. It is a little boy's drum, {{the sort of thing}} I used to play myself at one time, until people took it away from me, and threatened that if they heard it once again that day they would break it over my own head. It is cowardly going up and down, playing a drum of this sort, when there is nobody to stop you. The man would not dare to do it if his mother was about. He does not even play it. He walks along tapping it with a little stick. There's no tune, there's no sense in it. He does not even keep time. I used to think at first, hearing it in the distance, that it was the work of some young gamin who ought to be at school, or making himself useful taking the baby out in the perambulator: and I would draw back into dark doorways, determined, as he <b>came</b> <b>by,</b> <b>to</b> dart out and pull his ear for him.

60|$|And Boaz {{went up to}} {{the city}} gate, And after a short space, while there he sate, The kinsman of whom he had spoke, <b>came</b> <b>by,</b> <b>To</b> whom he said, Ho,[6] such a one, draw nigh, And sit down here. He came and sat him down. Then he took ten men, elders of the town, And caused them to sit down. Then to the man That was of kin, thus he his speech began, Naomi, said he, who not long since sojourn'd Among the Moabites, is now return'd; And doth intend to sell a piece of ground, The which Elimelech our brother own'd. And now to give thee notice, I thought fit, That if thou pleasest, thou may'st {{purchase}} it. In presence of these men assembled here. Then if thou wilt redeem it, now declare Thy mind, but if thou wilt not, then let me, For thou art next of kin, and I next thee. Then said the kinsman, I will it redeem. Boaz reply'd, if good to thee it seem, To buy it of the hand of Naomi, Thou also art obliged the same to buy Of Ruth the Moabitess, wife o' th' dead; On his inheritance to raise up seed. The kinsman said, I cannot do this thing Myself, lest I an inconvenience bring Upon mine own inheritance, what's mine By right, therefore I now to thee resign. Now this in Israel did a custom stand, Concerning changing and redeeming land; To put all controversy to an end, A man pluck'd off his shoe, and gave his friend; And this in Israel was an evidence, When e'er they changed an inheritance. Then said the kinsman unto Boaz, do Thou take my right. And off he pluck'd his shoe. Then Boaz to the elders thus did say And to the people, all of you this day Appear for me as witnesses, that I Have bought all of the land of Naomi, That was Elimelech's or did belong Either to Mahlon or to Chilion: And Ruth the Moabitess, who some time Was Mahlon's wife, I've purchas'd to be mine, Still to preserve alive the dead man's name On his inheritance, lest that the same Should in the gate where he inhabited, Or 'mongst his brethren be extinguished: Behold, this day, my witnesses you are. Then all the people that were present there, And elders said, We are thy witnesses: May God this woman thou hast taken bless, That she, like Rachel, and like Leah be, Which two did build up Israel's family: And thou in Ephratah exalt thy name, And through the town of Bethl'hem spread thy fame; And may the seed which God shall give to thee Of this young woman, full as prosperous be, As was the house of Pharez heretofore, (Pharez, whom Tamar unto Judah bore.) So he took Ruth, and as his wife he knew her, And God was pleased, when he went in to her To grant the blessing of conception, And she accordingly bare him a son. Then said the woman, Blessed be the Lord! Bless thou him Naomi, who doth afford To thee this day a kinsman, which shall be Famous in Israel; and shall be to thee As the restorer of thy life again, And in thy drooping age shall thee sustain: For that thy daughter-in-law, who loves thee well And in thy sight doth seven sons excel, Hath born this child. Then Naomi took the boy To nurse; and did him in her bosom lay. Her neighbours too, gave him a name, for why, This son, say they, is born to Naomi: They called him Obed, from whose loins did spring Jesse, the sire of David, Israel's king.|$|E

6000|$|Well, if it be {{my time to}} {{quit the}} stage, Adieu to all the follies of the age! I die in charity with fool and knave, Secure of peace at least beyond the grave. I've had my purgatory here betimes, And paid for all my satires, all my rhymes. The poet's hell, its tortures, fiends, and flames, To this were trifles, toys, and empty names. [...] With foolish pride my heart was never fired, Nor the vain itch to admire, or be admired; I hoped for no {{commission}} from his Grace; I bought no benefice, I begged no place; Had no new verses, nor new suit to show; Yet went to Court!--the Devil would have it so. But, as the fool that in reforming days Would go to Mass in jest (as story says) Could not but think, to pay his fine was odd, Since 'twas no formed design of serving God; So was I punished, as if full as proud As prone to ill, as negligent of good, As deep in debt, without a thought to pay, } As vain, as idle, and as false, as they } Who live at Court, for going once that way! } Scarce was I entered, when, behold! there came A thing which Adam had been posed to name; Noah had refused it lodging in his Ark, Where all the race of reptiles might embark: A verier monster, that on Afric's shore The sun e'er got, or slimy Nilus bore, Or Sloane or Woodward's wondrous shelves contain, Nay, all that lying travellers can feign. The watch would hardly let him pass at noon, At night, would swear him {{dropped out of the}} moon. One whom the mob, when next we find or make A Popish plot, shall for a Jesuit take, And the wise Justice starting from his chair Cry: [...] "By your priesthood tell me what you are?" [...] Such was the wight; the apparel on his back Though coarse, was reverend, and though bare, was black: The suit, if by the fashion one might guess, Was velvet in the youth of good Queen Bess, But mere tuff-taffety what now remained; So time, that changes all things, had ordained! Our sons shall see it leisurely decay, First turn plain rash, then vanish quite away. [...] This thing has travelled, speaks each language too, And know what's fit for very state to do; Of whose best phrase and courtly accent joined, He forms one tongue, exotic and refined, Talkers I've learned to bear; Motteux I knew, Henley himself I've heard, and Budgel too. The doctor's wormwood style, the hash of tongues A pedant makes, the storm of Gonson's lungs, The whole artillery of the terms of war, And (all those plagues in one) the bawling bar: These I could bear; but not a rogue so civil, Whose tongue will compliment you to the devil. A tongue that can cheat widows, cancel scores, Make Scots speak treason, cozen subtlest w***es, With royal favourites in flattery vie, And Oldmixon and Burnet both outlie. [...] He spies me out, I whisper: [...] "Gracious God! What sin of mine could merit such a rod? That all the shot of dulness now must be From this thy blunderbuss discharged on me!" [...] "Permit" [...] (he cries) [...] "no stranger to your fame To crave your sentiment, if ----'s your name. What speech esteem you most?" [...] "The King's," [...] said I [...] "But the best words?"--"O, sir, the dictionary." [...] "You miss my aim; I mean the most acute And perfect speaker?"--"Onslow, past dispute." [...] "But, sir, of writers?" [...] "Swift, for closer style, But Ho**y for a period of a mile." [...] "Why, yes, 'tis granted, these indeed may pass: Good common linguists, and so Panurge was; Nay troth the Apostles (though perhaps too rough) Had once a pretty gift of tongues enough: Yet these were all poor gentlemen! I dare Affirm, 'twas travel made them what they were." [...] Thus others' talents having nicely shown, He came by sure transition to his own: Till I cried out: [...] "You prove yourself so able, Pity! you was not Druggerman at Babel; For had they found a linguist half so good I make no question but the tower had stood." [...] "Obliging sir! for courts you sure were made: Why then for ever buried in the shade? Spirits like you should see and should be seen, The King would smile on you--at least the Queen." [...] "Ah, gentle sir! you courtiers so cajole us-- But Tully has it, Nunquam minus solus: And as for courts, forgive me, if I say No lessons now are taught the Spartan way: Though in his pictures lust be full displayed, Few are the converts Aretine has made; And though the Court show vice exceeding clear, None should, by my advice, learn virtue there." [...] At this entranced, he lifts his hands and eyes, Squeaks like a high-stretched lutestring, and replies: [...] "Oh, 'tis the sweetest of all earthly things To gaze on princes, and to talk of kings!" [...] "Then, happy man who shows the tombs!" [...] said I, [...] "He dwells amidst the Royal Family; He every day, from king to king can walk, Of all our Harries, all our Edwards talk, And get by speaking truth of monarchs dead, What few can of the living, ease and bread." [...] "Lord, sir, a mere mechanic! strangely low, And coarse of phrase--your English all are so. How elegant your Frenchmen?" [...] "Mine, d'ye mean? I have but one, I hope the fellow's clean." [...] "Oh! sir, politely so! nay, let me die, Your only wearing is your Paduasoy." [...] "Not, sir, my only, I have better still, And this you see is but my dishabille--." [...] Wild to get loose, his patience I provoke, Mistake, confound, object at all he spoke. But as coarse iron, sharpened, mangles more, And itch most hurts when angered to a sore; So when you plague a fool, 'tis still the curse, You only make the matter worse and worse. [...] He past it o'er; affects an easy smile At all my peevishness, and turns his style. He asks, [...] "What news?" [...] I tell him of new plays, New eunuchs, harlequins, and operas. He hears, and as a still with simples in it Between each drop it gives, stays half a minute, Loth to enrich me with too quick replies, By little and by little drops his lies. Mere household trash! of birth-nights, balls, and shows, More than ten Holinsheds, or Halls, or Stowes. When the Queen frowned, or smiled, he knows; and what A subtle minister may make of that; Who sins with whom: who got his pension rug, Or quickened a reversion by a drug; Whose place is quartered out, three parts in four, And whether to a bishop, or a w***e; Who having lost his credit, pawned his rent, Is therefore fit to have a Government; Who in the secret, deals in stocks secure, And cheats the unknowing widow and the poor; Who makes a trust or charity a job, And gets an Act of Parliament to rob; Why turnpikes rise, and now no cit nor clown Can gratis see the country, or the town; Shortly no lad shall chuck, or lady vole, But some excising courtier will have toll. He tells what strumpet places sells for life, What 'squire his lands, what citizen his wife: And last (which proves him wiser still than all) What lady's face is not a whited wall. [...] As one of Woodward's patients, sick, and sore, I puke, I nauseate--yet he thrusts in more: Trims Europe's balance, tops the statesman's part, And talks gazettes and post-boys o'er by heart. Like a big wife at sight of loathsome meat Ready to cast, I yawn, I sigh and sweat. Then as a licensed spy, whom nothing can Silence or hurt, he libels the great man; Swears every place entailed for years to come, In sure succession to the day of doom; He names the price for every office paid, And says our wars thrive ill, because delayed; Nay hints, 'tis by connivance of the Court, That Spain robs on, and Dunkirk's still a port. Not more amazement seized on Circe's guests, To see themselves fall endlong into beasts, Than mine, to find a subject staid and wise Already half turned traitor by surprise. I felt the infection slide from him to me, As in the ---- some give it to get free; And quick to swallow me, methought I saw One of our giant statutes ope its jaw. [...] In that nice moment, as another lie Stood just a-tilt, the minister <b>came</b> <b>by.</b> <b>To</b> him he flies, and bows, and bows again, Then, close as Umbra, joins the dirty train. Not Fannius' self more impudently near, When half his nose is in his Prince's ear. I quaked at heart; and still afraid, to see All the Court filled with stranger things than he, Ran out as fast as one that pays his bail And dreads more actions, hurries from a jail. [...] Bear me, some god! oh, quickly bear me hence To wholesome solitude, the nurse of sense: Where Contemplation plumes her ruffled wings, And the free soul looks down to pity kings! There sober thought pursued the amusing theme, Till fancy coloured it, and formed a dream. A vision hermits can to hell transport, And forced even me to see the damned at Court. Not Dante dreaming all the infernal state, Beheld such scenes of envy, sin, and hate. Base fear becomes the guilty, not the free; Suits tyrants, plunderers, but suits not me: Shall I, the terror of this sinful town, Care, if a liveried lord or smile or frown? Who cannot flatter, and detest who can, Tremble before a noble serving-man? O, my fair mistress, Truth! shall I quit thee For huffing, braggart, puffed nobility? Thou, who since yesterday hast rolled o'er all The busy, idle blockheads of the ball, Hast thou, oh, sun! beheld an emptier fort, Than such who swell this bladder of a Court? Now plague on those who show a Court in wax! It ought to bring all courtiers on their backs: Such painted puppets! such a varnished race Of hollow gewgaws, only dress and face! Such waxen noses, stately staring things-- No wonder some folks bow, and think them kings. [...] See! where the British youth, engaged no more At Fig's, at White's, with felons, or a bore, Pay their last duty to the Court and come All fresh and fragrant, to the drawing-room; In hues as gay, and odours as divine, As the fair fields they sold to look so fine. [...] "That's velvet for a king!" [...] the flatterer swears 'Tis true, for ten days hence 'twill be King Lear's. Our Court may justly to our stage give rules, That helps it both to fools-coats and to fools. And why not players strut in courtiers' clothes? For these are actors too, as well as those: Wants reach all states; they beg but better drest, And all is splended poverty at best. Painted for sight, and essenced for the smell, Like frigates fraught with spice and cochinel, Sail in the ladies: how each pirate eyes So weak a vessel, and so rich a prize! Top-gallant he, and she in all her trim, He boarding her, she striking sail to him: [...] "Dear Countess! you have charms all hearts to hit!" [...] And [...] "Sweet Sir Fopling! you have so much wit!" [...] Such wits and beauties are not praised for nought, For both the beauty and the wit are bought. 'Twould burst even Heraclitus with the spleen To see those antics, Fopling and Courtin: The presence seems, with things so richly odd, The mosque of Mahound, or some queer Pagod. See them survey their limbs by Durer's rules, Of all beau-kind the best proportioned fools! Adjust their clothes, and to confession draw Those venial sins, an atom, or a straw; But oh! what terrors must distract the soul Convicted of that mortal crime, a hole; Or should one pound of powder less bespread Those monkey tails that wag behind their head. Thus finished, and corrected to a hair, They march, to prate their hour before the fair. So first to preach a white-gloved chaplain goes, With band of lily, and with cheek of rose, Sweeter than Sharon, in immaculate trim, Neatness itself impertinent in him. Let but the ladies smile, and they are blest: Prodigious! how the things protest, protest: Peace, fools, or Gonson will for Papists seize you, If once he catch you at your Jesu! Jesu! [...] Nature made every fop to plague his brother, Just as one beauty mortifies another. But here's the captain that will plague them both, Whose air cries Arm! whose very look's an oath: The captain's honest, Sirs, and that's enough, Though his soul's bullet, and his body buff. He spits fore-right; his haughty chest before, Like battering rams, beats open every door: And with a face as red, and as awry, As Herod's hangdogs in old tapestry, Scarecrow to boys, the breeding woman's curse, Has yet a strange ambition to look worse; Confounds the civil, keeps the rude in awe, Jests like a licensed fool, commands like law. [...] Frighted, I quit the room, but leave it so As men from jails to execution go; For hung with deadly sins I see the wall, And lined with giants deadlier than 'em all: Each man an Askapart, of strength to toss For quoits, both Temple Bar and Charing Cross. Scared at the grizzly forms, I sweat, I fly, And shake all o'er, like a discovered spy. [...] Courts are too much for wits so weak as mine: Charge them with Heaven's artillery, bold divine! From such alone the great rebukes endure Whose satire's sacred, and whose rage secure: [...] 'Tis mine to wash a few light stains, but theirs To deluge sin, and drown a Court in tears. However, what's now Apocrypha, my wit, In time to come, may pass for holy writ.|$|E
