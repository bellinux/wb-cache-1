It’s {{necessary to}} find some substitute for asphalt because of the rising price and the tension supply of petroleum asphalt with the gradually decreasing of fossil oil. Indoor tests {{on the performance of}} binding material made of <b>crumbed</b> <b>rubber</b> particles, botanic asphalt and petroleum asphalt as well as the performance of its premix are carried out. The results show that botanic <b>crumbed</b> <b>rubber</b> asphalt pertables as well as asphalt rubber, which means botanic <b>crumbed</b> <b>rubber</b> asphalt can be used as binding material in road asphalt concrete. The study provides a theory basis for the possibility of partially replacing petroleum asphalt with botanic asphalt. Botanic asphalt has much higher comparative advantages than petroleum asphalt in the aspects of social benefit and economic benefit, so there must be a bright prospect for botanic asphalt...|$|R

In this study we have used polymer and <b>crumbed</b> <b>rubber</b> as a binder with respect to aggregate and bitumen. In bituminous roads, we use materials like aggregate (of various sizes), grit and bitumen.
