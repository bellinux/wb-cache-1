5000|$|Cost {{estimating}} for a design-build {{project is}} sometimes difficult because design documents are often preliminary and may {{change over the}} course of the project. As a result, design-build contracts are often written to allow for unexpected situations without penalizing either the design-builder or the owner. Several organizations (such as the Design/Build Institute of America) provide standardized form contracts for design-builders to use, but it is not unusual for the design-builder to provide its own <b>contractual</b> <b>documents.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Because the <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> in the Quanta {{case were}} insufficiently explicit, the Court applied the {{exhaustion}} doctrine, finding the sale [...] "authorized" [...] and unconditional, even though LGE attempted to impose some {{restrictions on use}} of the products. Therefore, purchasers of the patented product were free to use them without restrictions that the patentee sought to have imposed on them. The Court found that the licensing agreement did not impose any limitations on whom the licensee could sell to. The Quanta Court did not address, however, whether the restriction in the licensing agreement could be enforced by contract. In fact, the Court pointedly {{said it was not}} addressing that issue.|$|E

50|$|Lord Hope, Lord Walker, Lord Collins, Lord Clarke and Lord Wilson, on appeal, {{unanimously}} {{held that}} the car valeters were engaged under contracts of employment and this was not affected by the clauses which stated that they were self-employed, had no obligation to work, no right to receive work, and could substitute another worker. Lord Clarke, giving {{the judgment of the}} court, emphasised that a contract of employment was a specific kind of contract, not to be treated the same as commercial contracts, because there may be an element of inequality of bargaining power. The judgment of Rimer LJ, in Consistent Group Ltd v Kalwak, suggesting that <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> contained the expression of the true intentions of the parties unless there was a sham, intended to deceive third parties, was expressly doubted. Accordingly under the valeters were employees and 'workers' as defined and were entitled both to remuneration at the rate of the national minimum wage and to paid leave.|$|E
50|$|The Court in Hansen was not concerned, per se, with {{determining}} {{exactly the}} intention of the parties; its goal was {{to determine whether or not}} that intention was clearly reflected in the <b>contractual</b> <b>document,</b> from the literal and ordinary meaning of the language.|$|R

5000|$|The General Talking Pictures {{doctrine}} remains valid law, {{subject to}} possible antitrust exceptions (see below). The exhaustion doctrine does not operate to {{free from the}} patent monopoly product sales that a limited licensee makes to one who seeks to use the sold product outside the licensed field — at least when the buyer has notice of the limitation. Nonetheless, tension exists between the two doctrines — particularly when the field-of-use license is not as explicit as it might be. Then, {{as illustrated by the}} recent Supreme Court decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., [...] “default” rules take over. The default rules, which apply when a court interprets a license or other contract as ambiguous or not complete, are that the exhaustion doctrine governs over the General Talking Pictures doctrine in ambiguous cases. A use restriction in a license must be explicit to bind a seller, if it is to do so at all. Furthermore, the default rule for licenses to manufacture a patented product is that the license is unlimited, i.e., it covers all possible fields. Thus, a manufacturing license is unlimited unless its language explicitly provides otherwise. Because the <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> in the Quanta case were insufficiently explicit, or so the Supreme Court seemed to believe, the Court applied the exhaustion doctrine rather than the General Talking Pictures doctrine. Therefore, purchasers of the patented product were free to use them without restrictions that the patentee sought to have imposed on them.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{the terms}} of the {{contract}} are ambiguous or susceptible to more than one meaning, evidence of surrounding circumstances and context may be admissible to assist in its interpretation. The High Court has recently reiterated the Codelfa ruling regarding the use of existence evidence in the interpretation of contacts. [...] For example, this would commonly invite one to examine the commercial purpose of the transaction, its background and context, common practices etc. [...] Moreover, courts tend to favour an interpretation that produces a reasonable commercially accepted result and avoids unjust or inconvenient consequences to both parties. It is also {{important to note that the}} subjective intention of the parties is irrelevant. The construction of <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> is determined by what a reasonable person in the position of the party would have understood the words to mean. With regard to a recent judgment made by the High Court in Western Export Services Inc v Jireh International Pty Ltd, Justices Gummow, Heydon and Bell agree the position of the Australian courts: where a court is not justified in disregarding unambiguous language simply because the contract would have a more commercial and businesslike operation if an interpretation different to that dictated by the language were adopted. This High Court decision defends the original NSW Court of Appeal judgment and ultimately upholds the rule observed in Codelfa and Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{investigates the}} relationship between the usage of relational forms of governance and the completeness of <b>contractual</b> <b>documents.</b> It further examines howthis relationship is presided by the development of social norms between contracting parties. A case study was conducted within Company X, a top European company in the Energy Sector, where interviews to managers and <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> were inspected for aqualitative analysis of the aforementioned relationship. The results indicate that the employment of relational governance mechanisms does affect contractual completeness on one of its two dimensions: contingency ﻿adaptability. This aspect is enhanced as relational norms are interwoven in the exchange agreement. A clear connection with the second dimension, term specificity, could not be identified, and is instead attributed to contextual idiosyncrasies such as industry type andgovernance structure design. A theoretical model depicting this phenomenon was developed, including mediating effects by situational variables...|$|E

40|$|If {{technology}} means, “useful {{knowledge about}} how to produce things at low cost 2 ̆ 2, then contracts should qualify. Just as mechanical technologies are embodied in blueprints, technologies of contracting are embodied in <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> that serve as, “blueprints for collaboration 2 ̆ 2. This Article analyzes innovations in <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> using {{the same kind of}} framework that is used to analyze other kinds of technological innovation. The analysis begins by laying out an informal model of the demand for and supply of innovative <b>contractual</b> <b>documents.</b> The discussion of demand emphasizes the impact of innovations upon not only each party’s incentives to collaborate efficiently, but also upon reading costs and litigation costs. The analysis of supply considers both the generation and dissemination of innovations and emphasizes the importance of cumulative innovation, learning by-doing, economies of scale and scope, and trustworthiness. Recent literature has raised concerns {{about the extent to which}} law firms produce contractual innovations. In fact, a wide range of actors other than law firms supply contractual documents; including end users of contracts, specialized providers of legal documents, legal database firms, trade associations, and academic institutions. This article discusses the incentives and capabilities of each of these potential sources of innovation. It concludes by discussing potential interventions such as: (1) enhancing intellectual property rights, (2) relaxing rules concerning the unauthorized practice of law and, (3) creating or expanding publicly sponsored clearinghouses for contracts...|$|E

40|$|Economists often {{presume that}} the costs of {{drafting}} contracts are directly related to the ‘completeness’ of the contracts in question. This may be a reasonable presumption when <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> are drafted from scratch. But anyone who has drafted a contract knows that it is typically much easier to proceed by finding and copying an existing widely used document (“boilerplate”), even one that generates a very detailed contract, than to draft from scratch. This observation has important implications for debates about the optimal method of interpretation. This paper analyses the merits of alternative ways of interpreting <b>contractual</b> <b>documents</b> when parties use boilerplate. Legal practices such as gap-filling, the use of extrinsic evidence, uniform laws, and allowing parties to choose the method used to interpret their documents are examined. One notable finding {{is that it is not}} necessarily desirable to allow parties to choose the method of interpretation. The analysis highlights the potential importance of the stock of boilerplate available to contracting parties as a factor that determines the impact of contract law...|$|E

5000|$|The L'Estrange Rule [...] {{governs the}} effect of a {{signature}} in contracts law, which states that a party is bound by the terms of a <b>contractual</b> <b>document</b> once it is signed {{regardless of whether or not}} the party has read or understood the terms in a contract. Toll (FGCT) v Alphapharm Pty Ltd affirms this objective approach as it upholds that a person who signs either has read and approved the contents of the document or is willing to take the chance of being bound by the content. To undermine that assumption would cause serious mischief. This is on the basis that it provides an objective criteria as to whether a party has agreed to the terms of a contract. However, this rule is subject to exceptions. A signature will not be binding where the signature was obtained by a fraud or misrepresentation, or where document was not known to be a contract by the party signing it. The signature will not be binding if the document signed cannot be reasonably considered a <b>contractual</b> <b>document,</b> this includes receipts, vouchers, timesheet etc. The act of signature or executive enables third parties to assume the legal efficacy of the contract.|$|R
