50|$|A Steckel mill, {{also known}} as a {{reversible}} finishing mill, is similar to a reversing rolling mill except two <b>coilers</b> are used to feed the material through the mill. One coiler is on the entrance side and the other on the exit side. The <b>coilers</b> pull the material through the mill, therefore the process is more similar to drawing than rolling. The material is fed back and forth through the mill until the desired thickness is reached, much like a reversing rolling mill.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coiler</b> drums are {{integral}} {{components of the}} Steckel mill reversing hot strip rolling process. A Steckel mill produces hot rolled strip steel from cast slabs, which are heated before being converted, via roughing, to a transfer bar, of which the thickness is subsequently reduced to the desired gauge {{by means of a}} reverse rolling process performed by the Steckel mill. <b>Coiler</b> drums are located inside two Steckel furnaces, which are positioned {{on both sides of the}} mill stand. As the strip thickness is reduced during each pass, the length increases. In order to obtain high rolling speeds and retain temperature, the strip is successively coiled and uncoiled, under tension, onto and from the heated <b>coiler</b> drums during processing. As <b>coiler</b> drums have a high unit cost and a significant impact on the quality of the finished product, <b>coiler</b> drum performance is important to Steckel mill operators. The high cost is associated with the high alloy composition of the casting and the specialised manufacturing process required for the production of <b>coiler</b> drums. Deterioration of the <b>coiler</b> drum condition over its service lifespan can adversely affect the quality of the final product, namely coiled strip. This investigation was therefore undertaken to gain insight into <b>coiler</b> drum failure mechanisms, which will benefit Steckel mill operators, mill suppliers and <b>coiler</b> drum suppliers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} automated detection of complex (non-self-avoiding) postures of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and its application to analyses of locomotion defects. Our approach is based on progressively detailed statistical models that enable detection {{of the head and}} the body even in cases of severe <b>coilers,</b> where data from traditional trackers is limited. We restrict the input available to the algorithm to a single digitized frame, such that manual initialization is not required and the detection problem becomes embarrassingly parallel. Consequently, the proposed algorithm does not propagate detection errors and naturally integrates in a "big data" workflow used for large-scale analyses. Using this framework, we analyzed the dynamics of postures and locomotion of wild-type animals and mutants that exhibit severe coiling phenotypes. Our approach can readily be extended to additional automated tracking tasks such as tracking pairs of animals (e. g., for mating assays) or different species...|$|E

Nineteen sites were selected within the catchment, five on the mainstream Mersey River, three on the Dasher River, two each on the Minnow River, Redwater Creek and Lobster Rivulet, and one each on smaller tributaries downstream from Parangana Dam. Key findings from the survey: · The majority of the Mersey River appears to be in reasonable health. The macroinvertebrate community in lower the reaches indicates a slight impact, most likely a result of water quality, and just below Parangana Dam there is evidence that the river is slightly impaired, a result of flow and habitat alterations caused by the dam. · There is a general loss of taxa sensitive to water pollution {{down the length of the}} Mersey River. · Tributaries in the lower catchment are of a major concern. Kings and Parramatta Creeks were identified to be severely impaired and Bonneys Creek was identified to be impaired. Both water quality and habitat alterations are more than likely the primary causes. Other tributaries of concern include the lower Dasher River and <b>Coilers</b> Creek. · Habitat alteration is a potential cause of macroinvertebrate degradation on the Dasher River at Paradise Road, upper Minnow River in the pine plantation and the uppe...|$|E

40|$|For the {{new style}} hot rolling <b>coiler</b> which adopt AC {{asynchronous}} motor as {{the driving force}} and with using the algorithm based on differential geometry design nonlinear controller, precise coiling tension control in the rolling process of strip steel is achieved. In this paper, under the rotating orthogonal coordinate system, the fifth-order nonlinear motor model is selected as the controlled plant. By multi-input multioutput (MIMO) exact feedback linearization (EFL) algorithm, the nonlinear model is transformed to a linear one. In terms of small-gain theorem, {{it is the first}} to prove that the nonlinear <b>coiler</b> engine that contains the controller has characteristics of input-to-state stability. Experimental results show that the algorithm can be used for high order tracking control system with time-varying parameters. Even without the traditional flux orientation calculation, the output signals are decoupled. With this controller, the tension deviation is restricted to less than 3 % and average rotational speed bias was decreased from 0. 5 % to 0. 1 % that ensure high-quality plate cut and surface of strip products...|$|R

40|$|Hot strip rolling {{production}} is a high-speed process which requires high-speed control and communication system, {{but because of}} the long distance between the delivery stand of the finishing mill and the gauge meter, dead time occurs when strip is transported from the site of the actuator to another location where the gauge meter takes its reading, which seriously affects the thickness control effect.
