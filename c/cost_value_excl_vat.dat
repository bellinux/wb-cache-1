PDD drives and media became available in mid-2004. The BW-RS101 external SCSI-3 drive originally retailed in the UK at £2,344 (<b>excl.</b> <b>VAT)</b> directly from Sony, and 23 GB write-once and re-writeable media retailed for £30 each.

40|$|Background: Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is the leading}} cause of severe vision loss in the developed world. Through clinical trials, treatment with ranibizumab has proved to be more effective than photodynamic therapy with verteporfin for AMD. The high price of ranibizumab, however, has raised questions about its cost-effectiveness. Methods: Three treatment options were considered in a cost-utility analysis adopting a health care perspective. A decision analytic model was developed to assign patients to four different health states over a 2 -year time period. The model inputs were efficacy results of the treatment options in terms of probabilities, costs related to treatment options and vision loss. Costs were expressed in 2007 Norwegian Kroner (NOK), and the health outcome was measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Quality of life weights were taken from a study associating time trade-off utility values with visual acuity levels, while the use of health care was based on expert judgment Results: When indirect costs were disregarded, the two-year costs of verteporfin, 0. 3 mg and 0. 5 mg ranibizumab were NOK 198, 500, NOK 314, 500 and NOK 437, 000, respectively with corresponding QALYs of 1. 34, 1. 50 and 1. 51. The incremental costs of replacing verteporfin by 0. 3 mg and 0. 5 mg ranibizumab were NOK 116, 000 and NOK 122, 500 with incremental QALYs of 0. 16 and 0. 015. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were NOK 739, 500 and NOK 7, 976, 000, respectively. Interpretation/conclusion: The results of this study indicate that neither treatment with 0. 3 mg ranibizumab nor treatment with 0. 5 mg ranibizumab is cost-effective as replacement of the conventional PDT treatment when NOK 425, 000 is defined as the threshold for incremental costs per QALY. This conclusion may change if it were documented that two year treatment with ranibizumab has benefits beyond the treatment period. The treatment option with 0. 3 mg ranibizumab would be cost-effective if the drug costs per dose of ranibizumab were reduced from NOK 9, 190 to NOK 6, 900 (<b>excl.</b> <b>VAT)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} Samuelson's (1964) {{definition of}} "true economic depreciation" {{with the use}} of this term that has become standard in the more recent literature on neutral business taxes. Samuelson defined "economic depreciation" to be the change in the economic value of an asset, whilst the more recent literature is concerned with change in the replacement <b>cost</b> <b>value</b> of an asset. Economic values can be higher than replacement <b>cost</b> <b>values</b> where the owner of an asset can use it to earn monopoly profits or economic rents. We show that the properties of certain taxes on income from capital depend crucially on which definition of "true economic depreciation" is permitted as a deduction. In particular, Samuelson's comprehensive income tax has the property of invariant valuation - i. e. the economic value of an asset is the same for taxpayers subject to different tax rates - only when the depreciation deduction is the change in economic value, and not when this is the change in the replacement <b>cost</b> <b>value.</b> A class of business taxes are shown to be neutral - i. e equivalent to lump sum taxes - when either of these depreciation deductions are permitted. However, at the same statutory tax rate, the depreciation deduction based on the change in replacement <b>cost</b> <b>values</b> is shown to raise substantially more revenue for the government...|$|R
