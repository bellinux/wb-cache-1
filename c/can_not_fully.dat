Joseph Twichell, Mark's most {{intimate}} friend for over forty years, was {{pastor of the}} Asylum Hill Congregational Church of Hartford, which Mark facetiously called the [...] "Church of the Holy Speculators," [...] because of its wealthy parishioners. Here Mark had first met [...] "Joe" [...] at a social, and their meeting ripened into a glorious, life long friendship. Twichell {{was a man of}} about Mark's own age, a profound scholar, a devout Christian, [...] "yet a man with an exuberant sense of humor, and a profound understanding of the frailties of mankind." [...] The Rev. Mr. Twichell performed the marriage ceremony for Mark Twain and solemnized the births of his children; [...] "Joe," [...] his friend, counseled him on literary as well as personal matters for the remainder of Mark's life. It is important to catch this brief glimpse of the man for whom this masterpiece was written, for without it one <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> understand the spirit in which 1601 was written, or the keen enjoyment which Mark and [...] "Joe" [...] derived from it.|$|E

5000|$|A Pluralist Radical Feminist {{critique}} of the PDA notes that pregnancy {{should not be considered}} a disability at all. They argue that the PDA classifying pregnancy as a disability is too reflective of a phallocentric view of pregnancy, as it refuses to treat pregnancy with its own model and forces it into the same system that men use when [...] "disabled" [...] even though they cannot experience this. They would argue that a body with the potential to become pregnant does not only have a chance of experiencing pregnancy, but also the unique conditions and complications that may come along with it, and that forcing pregnancy into the guidelines of disability <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> provide pregnant workers with the protections they need.|$|E
5000|$|Misreading of the {{pathology}} slide. It {{is difficult to}} differentiate between a small island of basal cell carcinoma and a hair follicle structure. Many Mohs surgeons limit their tissue processing to include only 2 sections of tissue. This severely hampers their ability {{to determine if a}} structure is a hair follicle or a carcinoma. Two histologic sections <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> distinguish these two nearly identical structures, and can lead to either [...] "false negative" [...] or [...] "false positive" [...] errors by either calling a section clear of tumor, or calling a section positive for tumor, respectively. Serial sectioning of the tumor is preferred by other surgeons. Surgeons who perform serial sectioning through the block of tissue (usually 100 micrometres apart) are assured of the contiguous nature of his tumor and the distance of the tumor from the surgical margin, and are familiarized with the nature of the tumor. Serial sectioning also makes it easier to work with three-dimensional tumor with margins that are difficult to compress.|$|E

5000|$|Marty confesses {{her fears}} of having killed Spencer to her therapist, but <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> {{remember}} what her mind has blocked out from that fateful night. When the lovestruck Miles Laurence {{is determined to}} win Marty's heart, he takes extreme measures, stealing Marty's audiotaped [...] "confession" [...] from her therapist's office and blackmailing her with it, forcing Marty to marry him in order to retain custody of her son. Marty finally tells John McBain about her precarious situation, and John becomes determined to exonerate Marty, find Spencer's true murderer, and end Miles' sick game with Marty's life. Before John can learn the truth, however, the evidence against Marty becomes overwhelming, and she is arrested as the prime suspect in Truman's murder. John and Marty struggle to uncover the hazy details surrounding the night Spencer was killed, and eventually Marty remembers that she {{was never able to}} strike Spencer; instead, he assaulted her and left her in a vacant hospital room, leaving her with a head injury. Soon thereafter, John deduces that Lindsay Rappaport is the real murderer, and Marty is released from prison.|$|E
50|$|The {{interaction}} of dCas9 with target dsDNA is {{so tight that}} high molarity urea protein denaturant <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>fully</b> dissociate the dCas9 RNA-protein complex from dsDNA target. dCas9 has been targeted with engineered single guide RNAs to transcription initiation sites of any loci where dCas9 can compete with RNA polymerase at promoters to halt transcription. Also, dCas9 can be targeted to the coding region of loci such that inhibition of RNA Polymerase occurs during the elongation phase of transcription. In Eukaryotes, silencing of gene expression can be extented by targeting dCas9 to enhancer sequences, where dCas9 can block assembly of transcription factors leading to silencing of specific gene expression. Moreover, the guide RNAs provided to dCas9 can be designed to include specific mismatches to its complementary cognate sequence that will quantitatively weaken the {{interaction of}} dCas9 for its programed cognate sequence allowing a researcher to tune the extent of gene silencing applied to a gene of interest.This technology is similar in principle to RNAi such that gene expression is being modulated at the RNA level. However, the dCas9 approach has gained much traction as there exist less off-target effects and in general larger and more reproducible silencing effects {{through the use of}} dCas9 compared to RNAi screens. Furthermore, because the dCas9 approach to gene silencing can be quantitatively controlled, a researcher can now precisely control {{the extent to which a}} gene of interest is repressed allowing more questions about gene regulation and gene stoichiometry to be answered.|$|E
