50|$|Character matrix {{printers}} are {{a category}} of computer printers (typically impact printers) that place characters from a fixed character set anywhere onto a fixed grid of possible locations on the page. Examples of these are daisy wheel printers, golf ball printers, teleprinters, chain printers, and band printers. A <b>character</b> <b>printer</b> prints one character at a time.|$|E
40|$|Microprocessor-based {{system for}} {{document}} production work scheduling, and change control and management information aids in design, development, {{and control of}} software. Main components Z 80 microprocessor, floppydisk and hard-disk drives, and a <b>character</b> <b>printer.</b> System linked to large computer. Major software components are control program monitor (CP/M), text-editing and wordprocessing system, workbreakdown-schedule processor, and data-base management tool...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Character</b> <b>printers,</b> such as daisy wheel printers, {{can handle}} only plain text data or rather simple point plots.|$|R
50|$|ASA control <b>characters</b> are logical <b>printer</b> commands. They {{tell the}} printer {{how far to}} advance the paper before {{printing}} the current line of text. ASA control characters are all displayable <b>characters.</b> <b>Printers</b> do not understand these characters themselves, therefore the printer driver must translate them to the corresponding printer commands when sending the print data to the printer.|$|R

50|$|The {{speed of}} early {{printers}} {{was measured in}} units of characters per minute (cpm) for <b>character</b> <b>printers,</b> or lines per minute (lpm) for line printers. Modern printers are measured in pages per minute (ppm). These measures are used primarily as a marketing tool, and are not as well standardised as toner yields. Usually pages per minute refers to sparse monochrome office documents, rather than dense pictures which usually print much more slowly, especially colour images. PPM are {{most of the time}} referring to A4 paper in Europe and letter paper in the United States, resulting in a 5-10% difference.|$|R

50|$|<b>Printer</b> control <b>{{characters}}</b> and Carriage control {{characters are}} IBM mainframe terms that denote the special meaning {{which the first}} character on a line of printable text may have. The first character of each line of text is interpreted as a control <b>character</b> or <b>printer</b> command instead of a character to be printed if a corresponding attribute is set for the print data set (data set is mainframe speak for {{what is known as}} a file on other operating systems).|$|R
50|$|Amstrad {{launched}} the Amstrad DMP3000 printer, {{which was an}} 80 <b>character</b> dot matrix <b>printer</b> with both IBM and Epson compatibility and boasted NLQ (Near Letter Quality) and could handle both A4 and fanfold paper. It connected to the computer via a parallel port.|$|R
5000|$|In typography, {{overstrike}} is {{a method}} of printing characters that are missing from the <b>printer's</b> <b>character</b> set. The character was created by placing one character on another one — for example, overstriking [...] "L" [...] with [...] "-" [...] resulted in printing a [...] "Ł" [...] (L with stroke) character.|$|R
50|$|In typography, a dingbat (sometimes more {{formally}} {{known as}} a printer's ornament or <b>printer's</b> <b>character)</b> is an ornament, character, or spacer used in typesetting, often employed {{for the creation of}} box frames. The term continues {{to be used in the}} computer industry to describe fonts that have symbols and shapes in the positions designated for alphabetical or numeric characters.|$|R
50|$|The {{draft of}} the second {{standard}} {{was based on the}} consideration of factors such as the promulgation of the jōyō kanji, the enforcement of the jinmeiyō kanji, and the standardization of Japanese-language Teletex by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications; also, the next modification was performed to keep pace with JIS C 6234-1983 (24-pixel matrix <b>printer</b> <b>character</b> forms; presently JIS X 9052).|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} medium and {{high-speed}} drum printers could be supplied. Medium-speed printers printed at about 600 {{lines per minute}} using all available <b>characters.</b> The high-speed <b>printers</b> delivered 1080 lines per minute or 1000 lines per minute (depending on the model), printing all 64 characters per line with excellent print quality. A later model delivered up to 1150 lines per minute. When fitted with a drum having a 16-character set, the printing speed was 2,700 lines per minute.|$|R
50|$|One handy and {{somewhat}} innovative feature {{for the time}} was the ability to add custom control <b>characters</b> in the <b>printer</b> setup. This allowed the user {{to take advantage of}} new features in a printer that were not intrinsically supported by Scripsit, such as different fonts or colours, or printing extended ASCII characters to produce simple lines and boxes. This was possible as printer manuals of the day included a full list of supported control character sequences for such functionality.|$|R
50|$|The text-encoding {{situation}} {{became more}} and more complex, leading to efforts by ISO and by the Unicode Consortium to develop a single, unified character encoding that could cover all known (or at least all currently known) languages. After some conflict, these efforts were unified. Unicode currently allows for 1,114,112 code values, and assigns codes covering nearly all modern text writing systems, as well as many historical ones and for many non-linguistic <b>characters</b> such as <b>printer's</b> dingbats, mathematical symbols, etc.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Atkinson {{published}} a small volume of Poetical Essays, Leeds, 1786, 4to, which was sarcastically reviewed by a writer calling himself ‘Trim’ (Edward Baldwyn), in A Critique on the Poetical Essays of the Rev. William Atkinson, London, 1787. ‘Trim’ also {{published a}}nother pamphlet, abounding in the coarsest personalities, and entitled A Congratulatory Letter to the Rev. William Atkinson, M.A., Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, on his {{appearance in the}} <b>character</b> of a <b>printer,</b> with remarks on the several papers that have issued from his press, London, 1790.|$|R
50|$|IBM defined {{two sets}} of printer commands, and {{therefore}} {{two sets of}} <b>printer</b> control <b>characters</b> are available. The first set of commands did not send any data to be printed to the printer but only a paper movement instruction. These are called immediate commands. The second set of commands send data to be printed on the current line plus a paper movement instruction to the printer. Note that {{in contrast to the}} ASA control characters, the IBM machine print control <b>characters</b> ask the <b>printer</b> to firstly print the data on the current line, and then secondly advance the paper.|$|R
5000|$|A similar device, the 2770, {{announced}} in 1969, [...] "was said to surpass all other IBM terminals in {{the variety of}} available input-output devices." [...] The 2770 could attach the 2213 Printer, 2502 Card Reader, 545 Card Punch, 2265 Display Station, 1017 Paper Tape Reader, 1018 Paper Tape Punch, the 50 Magnetic Data Inscriber, and the 1255 Magnetic <b>Character</b> Reader. The <b>printer</b> and devices for any two other media could be attached to one 2772 Control Unit. [...] The 2770 {{was developed by the}} IBM General Products Division (GPD) in Rochester, MN. [...] An SNA successor, the 3770, a Data Processing Division (DPD) product, appeared in 1974.|$|R

And it's been going on like this for sixty years! Despite it all, our eternal optimist Diego Buñuel takes us on a behind-the-scenes journey through yet another region with a {{particularly}} bad reputation. We go from the Gaza Strip to Jerusalem. We meet a lively cast of <b>characters,</b> including: a <b>printer</b> of the Martyrs of Gaza; Nadim, a Christian brewer in Ramallah; Lucy, who rescues Palestinian donkeys and tries to rehabilitate them; and rappers at a Gazan bachelor party. Don't Tell My Mother.... {{the people of the}} Holy Land like you've never seen them before.|$|R
5000|$|The Centronics Model 101 printer, {{featuring}} this connector, {{was released}} in 1970. The host sent ASCII <b>characters</b> to the <b>printer</b> using 7 of 8 data pins, pulling them high to +5V to represent a 1. When the data was ready, the host pulled the STROBE pin low, to 0 V. The printer responded by pulling the BUSY line high, printing the character, and then returning BUSY to low again. The host could then send another character. Control characters in the data caused other actions, like the [...] or [...] The host could also have the printer automatically start a new line by pulling the AUTOFEED line high, and keeping it there. The host had to carefully watch the BUSY line to ensure it did not feed data to the printer too rapidly, especially given variable-time operations like a paper feed.|$|R
500|$|The episode's {{name is a}} play of {{the title}} of the NBC sitcom, I Dream of Jeannie. The scene in which Stewie and Brian destroy the record is nearly {{identical}} to a scene in the movie Office Space in which the <b>characters</b> destroy a <b>printer,</b> including use of the same song. Peter makes Jesus admit that he is the messiah by threatening to urinate over albums of Christian artist Amy Grant. Peter attempts to top Jesus' story about his crucifixion during a dinner conversation with a story about how he and his friends [...] "got wrecked on Southern Comfort" [...] before going to see The Chronicles of Riddick. George W. Bush explains to the American people that going to war was correct because he answers to Jesus Christ, then Peter and Jesus interrupt him to disagree with him, similar to a scene in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Jesus is invited to the Tonight Show, hosted by Jay Leno.|$|R
50|$|Heat maps {{originated}} in 2D displays {{of the values}} in a data matrix. Larger values were represented by small dark gray or black squares (pixels) and smaller values by lighter squares. Loua (1873) used a shading matrix to visualize social statistics across the districts of Paris. Sneath (1957) displayed {{the results of a}} cluster analysis by permuting the rows and the columns of a matrix to place similar values near each other according to the clustering. Jacques Bertin used a similar representation to display data that conformed to a Guttman scale. The idea for joining cluster trees to the rows and columns of the data matrix originated with Robert Ling in 1973. Ling used overstruck <b>printer</b> <b>characters</b> to represent different shades of gray, one character-width per pixel. Leland Wilkinson developed the first computer program in 1994 (SYSTAT) to produce cluster heat maps with high-resolution color graphics. The Eisen et al. display shown in the figure is a replication of the earlier SYSTAT design.|$|R

5000|$|Impact {{printers}} {{rely on a}} forcible {{impact to}} transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits {{the surface of the}} ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the IBM 1403 for example). All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the <b>characters</b> that the <b>printer</b> was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by [...] "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, daisywheel printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed. An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.|$|R
50|$|The printer was {{improvement}} over hobby printer CENTRUM T-85 and {{was designed to}} be very primitive and therefore cheap printer for 8-bit home computers. In BT100 ink ribbon was completely omitted. Instead single nail hit paper backed by carbon copy paper to print single dot on back side of paper. This arrangement was introduced to protect thin carbon copy paper from direct hit by nail.Also internal electronics was simple. Printer head was single nail with electromagnet driven by software on home computer. One direction motor for paper movement and two directions motor to move printer head were also controlled directly from computer. To give necessary feedback, motor axes were connected to plastic disc with cutouts on perimeter. LED and photoresistor were placed against disc cutouts and as the disc rotated light beam would reach photoresitor only when facing a cutout. This way distance travelled by motors could be measured, again directly from software.With provided drivers the printer would print 480 points across A4 (58 DPI) with 560 lines on page (48 DPI). That is 70 lines with 60 to 80 <b>characters</b> on line. <b>Printer</b> could print one A4 page in 10 minutes in low quality. Higher quality was available at cost of doubling the time. It was even possible to print on same paper several times using carbon copy papers of different colors to produce low quality color print.|$|R
