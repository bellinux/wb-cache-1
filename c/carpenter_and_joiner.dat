5|$|The Mint building, {{which was}} {{constructed}} in red brick, was designed by architect William Strickland in the Greek Revival style, like most 19th-century public buildings in the United States. Strickland was {{a student of the}} architect Benjamin Latrobe, a disciple of Neoclassicism who had helped design the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Strickland himself, based in Philadelphia, had already designed the Philadelphia Mint building and the Second Bank of the United States, and would design the Charlotte and Dahlonega facilities, making him the architect of the first four U.S. mint buildings. Martin Gordon supervised the building's construction, which was undertaken by Benjamin F. Fox, the master <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner,</b> and John Mitchell, the master stonemason and builder.|$|E
5|$|Shout {{decided to}} remain in South Africa after his {{discharge}} and, in 1903, enlisted in the Cape Colonial Forces. He was made a sergeant in Prince Alfred's Own Cape Field Artillery, with which he served until 1907. While living in Cape Town, Shout married Rose Alice Howe, an Australian from Sydney, in 1905; the couple had a daughter named Florence in June that year. In 1907, the Shout family immigrated to Australia, settling in the Sydney suburb of Darlington. Here, Shout gained employment as a <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner</b> at Resch's Brewery. He also joined the 29th Infantry Regiment of the part-time Citizens' Forces shortly after arriving in Sydney, was a foundation member of the 29th Infantry Club, and a regular visitor at the Randwick rifle range, where he gained a reputation as an excellent shot. Shout was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Citizens' Forces on 16 June 1914.|$|E

5|$|Born in the Victorian town of Bendigo, Ingram was apprenticed as a <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner</b> upon leaving school. Joining {{the militia}} {{at the age}} of fourteen, he later settled in Melbourne where he worked as a {{building}} contractor. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Ingram enlisted in the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force and served on New Guinea before receiving his discharge in early 1916. Enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on the same day, he embarked for the Western Front. He was decorated with the Military Medal following his actions {{as a member of a}} bombing section during an attack on Bapaume. Commissioned as a second lieutenant in June 1918, Ingram returned to Australia in 1919 where he was discharged soon after. Re-settling in Melbourne, he was employed as a foreman for a building contractor company. Enlisting for service in the Second World War, he was allotted to the Royal Australian Engineers and achieved the rank of captain before being placed on the Retired List in 1944. Ingram died in 1961 {{at the age of}} 72.|$|E
5|$|Born in Wellington, Shout {{had served}} in the Second Boer War as a teenager. He rose to {{sergeant}} and was mentioned in despatches for saving a wounded man before being discharged in 1902. He remained in South Africa for the next five years, serving as an artilleryman in the Cape Colonial Forces from 1903. With his Australian-born wife and their daughter, Shout immigrated to Sydney in 1907. The family settled in Darlington, where Shout worked for Resch's Brewery as a <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner.</b> He was also active in the part-time Citizens' Forces, being commissioned just prior to the outbreak of the First World War. In August 1914, he joined in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for active service overseas and was appointed a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion. After training in Egypt, he took part in the Anzac landings at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. For his leadership during the invasion and its immediate aftermath, Shout was awarded the Military Cross and later mentioned in despatches. Shout's three gallantry awards at Gallipoli made him the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.|$|E

25|$|At this time, John Willmore, a <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner,</b> {{constructed}} {{a house and}} workshop for himself. By 1809, the undeveloped remainder of the plot consisted of two nailer's workshops and a cooper's workshop with a knacker's yard behind. The Hurst Street frontage was filled with sheds.

25|$|Jennings was a <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner</b> {{by trade}} who {{modelled}} his medium-paced bowling on that of Tom Cartwright {{and was one}} of Cartwright's successors as the defensive bowling heart of Somerset's successful one-day cricket side of the late 1970s. He made his first-class and List A debuts in 1975 and the following year was a regular member of Somerset's one-day team. Initially, his batting showed promise, and against the West Indies in 1976 he made 49 of an 82-run eighth wicket partnership with his captain, Brian Close, whose own watchful innings of 88 earned him a recall to the England team at the age of 45. Later that year, his 51 not out took Somerset from a parlous 116 for seven to a three-wicket victory with three balls to spare against Nottinghamshire at Nottingham. But his batting declined markedly and in 1979, when he played in 19 of Somerset's first-class matches, he made only 19 runs all season.|$|E

[...] Pippard {{was the son}} of a <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner</b> and spent much of his early life helping his father on construction sites. [...] Initially supposed to follow his father into the family business, Pippard instead decided to study for a bachelor's degree in {{civil engineer}}ing at the University of Bristol, supporting himself with an Exhibition award.

2500|$|On {{his return}} home {{he found his}} little cabin and {{clearing}} gone, and so began again, building a new cabin. In 1829, the Gardners moved to St. Clair County, Illinois. In the [...] fall [...] of 1831, having married the woman who would be his wife {{for the rest of}} his life, Gardner, despite working long hard hours as a teamster driving his own ox team, was deeply in debt. He disposed of the oxen and traded a two-year-old colt he owned for some carpenter's tools, and went to Alton, Illinois where he worked as a <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner,</b> returning home to visit with his wife and mother. By 1835, he had not only paid the debt (with interest), but was able to move his family to Alton, building up a profitable house-building business.|$|E
2500|$|The mason was James Simpson of Harrogate, who {{constructed}} {{several local}} buildings of stone from Killinghall quarry, including the adjacent Methodist Chapel (1869).

James Simpson was the father of David Simpson, who was mayor of Harrogate four times, who built Harrogate's Grand Hotel (1903), and who developed Harrogate's Duchy Estate for the Duchy of Lancaster. The <b>carpenter</b> <b>and</b> <b>joiner</b> was William Bellerby of York. Mr Baynes of Ripon was the slater, and Mr Fortune of Harrogate was the plasterer.

60|$|We {{have seen}} that in {{composition}} the mind can only take cognizance of likeness or dissimilarity, or of abstract beauty among the ideas it brings together. But neither likeness nor dissimilarity secures harmony. We saw in the chapter on unity that likeness destroyed harmony or unity of membership, and that difference did not necessarily secure it, but only that particular imperfection {{in each of the}} harmonizing parts which can only be supplied by its fellow part. If, therefore, the combination made is to be harmonious, the artist must induce in each of its component parts (suppose two only, for simplicity's sake,) such imperfection as that the other shall put it right. If one of them be perfect by itself, the other will be an excrescence. Both must be faulty when separate, and each corrected by the presence of the other. If he can accomplish this, the result will be beautiful; it will be a whole, an organized body with dependent members;--he is an inventor. If not, let his separate features be as beautiful, as apposite, or as resemblant as they may, they form no whole. They are two members glued together.
