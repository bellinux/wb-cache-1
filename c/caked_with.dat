500|$|Nests are {{generally}} large and untidy, {{consisting of a}} bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses, barks, and feathers that can be up to [...] thick. As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks, which are [...] long and [...] thick, into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are {{used to make the}} bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. Both birds build the nest, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasites—nests become <b>caked</b> <b>with</b> faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations. The female develops a brood patch—a patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid. The skin itself is oedematous and wrinkled, and does not get re-feathered until December after the breeding season has finished.|$|E
2500|$|Only one {{infantry}} division could be supplied and maintained {{at a distance}} of [...] from railhead, with the camels and wheeled transport allotted to the EEF infantry corps. During the attack on Beersheba the transport of the XXI Corps had been assigned to supply the XX Corps, which marched back to near railhead at Karm after the victory. Here minimal transport was needed so the transport was sent back to the XXI Corps. Many thousands of camels in long lines slowly converged on their allotted areas, before being loaded up for the advance. Motor lorries <b>caked</b> <b>with</b> dust, also drove westwards across the sand and powdered earth. The sleepless drivers' vehicles were then load up before driving off to supply their infantry units.|$|E
2500|$|Urine {{spraying}} is {{a variable}} behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling {{a few drops}} of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis. [...] A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be [...] sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow. [...] When urine spraying, the bull lowers his head towards the ground. [...] In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs. Once the wallow has been created, the male elk lowers himself into the area, rolls on his side and rub his mane on the soaked area of the wallow. He rubs the side of his face, his chest, stomach, legs, and flanks, which all become <b>caked</b> <b>with</b> mud. During wallowing, the elk's penis may remain erect and he may continue to spray urine.|$|E

60|$|He {{walked in}} step with the plowman by his side, but without any of the laborer's {{mechanical}} plod--with a spring in his footsteps, indeed, as if his life and thoughts were full of joyous things. He was wearing black-and-white tweed clothes, a little shabby but well-fitting; breeches and gaiters; thick boots, plentifully <b>caked</b> now <b>with</b> mud. He was pointing with his stick along the furrow, so absorbed in the instructions he was giving that he was almost opposite the gate before he was aware of her presence. He promptly abandoned his task and approached her.|$|R

50|$|While new-production M1918A2 {{guns were}} almost universally praised for faultless {{performance}} in combat, {{a number of}} malfunctions in combat were reported with armory-reconditioned M1918A2s, particularly weapons that had been reconditioned by Ordnance in Japan, which did not replace operating (recoil) springs as a requirement of the reconditioning program. After decades of complaints Ordnance addressed the problem of maintaining the problematic gas piston on the BAR by issuing disposable nylon gas valves. When the nylon valve became <b>caked</b> over <b>with</b> carbon, it could be discarded and replaced with a fresh unit, eliminating the tedious task of cleaning and polishing the valve with wire brush and G.I. solvent (frequently in short supply to line units).|$|R
60|$|The mist had {{dissolved}} under {{a rising}} sun when Duane {{made his first}} halt some {{miles north of the}} scene where he had waited for the hounds. A barrier to further progress, in shape of a precipitous rocky bluff, rose sheer from the willow brake. He skirted the base of the cliff, where walking was comparatively easy, around {{in the direction of the}} river. He reached the end finally to see there was absolutely no chance to escape from the brake at that corner. It took extreme labor, attended by some hazard and considerable pain to his arm, to get down where he could fill his sombrero with water. After quenching his thirst he had a look at his wound. It was <b>caked</b> over <b>with</b> blood and dirt. When washed off the arm was seen to be inflamed and swollen around the bullet-hole. He bathed it, experiencing a soothing relief in the cool water. Then he bandaged it as best he could and arranged a sling round his neck. This mitigated the pain of the injured member and held it in a quiet and restful position, where it had a chance to begin mending.|$|R
500|$|Gleeson further {{distinguished}} himself {{later that}} year by assisting in the defence of a trench against enemy attack. [...] He had {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of freeing Belgium from German occupation but was known to be critical of what he considered anti-clerical views held by the French authorities. [...] Gleeson was familiar with the realities of war and, in December 1914, wrote that [...] "if ... advocates of war were made to be soaked and <b>caked</b> and crusted <b>with</b> cold, wet trench mud, like these poor soldiers, and to wear those mud-weighted coats they would not be so glib with their treatises on the art of war.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} using the in situ bioremediation of gravelly/sandy soils {{has been conducted}} at the centre of contamination of a former gasworks site for 3 years. The maximum contamination zone was located {{at a depth of}} 5 to 7 m. The maximum concentration found in the field was 55 g organics and 14 g PAK per kg soil respectively. The test area was isolated from its surroundings by sealing walls. To enhance the aerobic degradation of hydrocarbons, the water table was lowered to the limits of contamination within the confined area. The required input of oxygen was achieved through a system of suction and pressure lances. The emphasis of this investigation was to determine the efficiency of the in situ remediation. A comparison of highly contaminated soil samples showed a qualitative alteration. In the course of the bioremediation liquid tar oil <b>caked</b> together <b>with</b> grains of soil to form larger aggregates. The analyses of pollutant composition revealed a significant decrease of low molecular weight PAHs up to anthracene. Subsequently the remediation was stopped, the natural groundwater flow through the field has been simulated to assess the long-term behaviour of the residuals in the treated soil for about 500 days.

40|$|Cleaning the {{surfaces}} of cultural artefacts on paper is a vaguely defined procedure in conservation. In general, however, the term refers to removing from paper surfaces contaminants that are not attached to the paper. A machine-assisted treatment method has been recently developed to remove dust and biological contaminants from paper, photographic materials and textiles. It {{can be used to}} clean large stocks efficiently and without mechanical impact on the object surfaces. Contaminant removal is performed by frictionless application of an electrostatic foil. The method is limited to the removal of particles from surfaces and/or from indentations in the surface textures of papers and textiles. However, It is not suitable for removing any discolouration that has penetrated into the depth of the material, contaminants that are <b>caked</b> together <b>with</b> the surface, or in-grown biological contaminants. Hence, improvement of the visual aesthetic appearance of objects will be achieved only to a limited extent. The technology allows removal of dust contaminants from both sides, even from very delicate surfaces, while entirely keeping existing drawing and writing materials or pigment layers intact. Approximately 80 objects per hour can be processed, each having a width of one meter and a length of 1. 50 meters. The system is a device which is expandable by modules, and two digitization units have been recently added to its technical equipment, digitizing both sides of each object in one cycle combined with the cleaning process. The advantages and limits of this technology will be shown by means of examples, as will be the methodology of quality management and control of the cleaning process, which has also been newly developed...|$|R

50|$|Chimneys {{started to}} appear in Britain around 1200, when they {{replaced}} the open fire burning {{in the middle of}} the one room house. At first there would be one heated room in the building and chimneys would be large. Over the next four hundred years, rooms became specialized and smaller and many were heated. Sea coal started to replace wood, and it deposited a layer of flammable creosote in the inside surface of the flue, and <b>caked</b> it <b>with</b> soot. Whereas before, the chimney was a vent for the smoke, now the plume of hot gas was used to suck air into the fire, and this required narrower flues Even so, boys rarely climbed chimneys before the Great Fire of London, when building regulations were put in place and the design of chimneys was altered, The new chimneys were often angular and narrow, and the usual dimension of the flue in domestic properties was 9 in by 14 in. The master sweep was unable to climb into such small spaces himself and employed climbing boys to go up the chimneys to dislodge the soot. The boys often 'buffed it', that is, climbed in the nude, propelling themselves by their knees and elbows which were scraped raw. They were often put up hot chimneys, and sometimes up chimneys that were alight in order to extinguish the fire. Chimneys with sharp angles posed a particular hazard. These boys were apprenticed to the sweep, and from 1778 until 1875 a series of laws attempted to regulate their working conditions, and many first hand accounts were documented and published in parliamentary reports. From about 1803, there was an alternative method of brushing chimneys, but sweeps and their clients resisted the change preferring climbing boys to the new Humane Sweeping Machines. Compulsory education was established in 1870 by the Education Act 1870 but it was a further five years before legislation was put in place to license Chimney Sweeps and finally prevent boys being sent up chimneys.|$|R
6000|$|Half an hour later, the {{inhabitants}} of Bush Street observe the same slender gentleman armed, like George Washington, with his little hatchet, splitting, kindling, and breaking coal for his fire. He does this quasi-publicly upon the window-sill; {{but this is not}} to be attributed to any love of notoriety, though he is indeed vain of his prowess with the hatchet (which he persists in calling an axe), and daily surprised at the perpetuation of his fingers. The reason is this: that the sill is a strong, supporting beam, and that blows of the same emphasis in other parts of his room might knock the entire shanty into hell. Thenceforth, for from three to four hours, he is engaged darkly with an ink bottle. Yet he is not blacking his boots, for the only pair that he possesses are innocent of lustre and wear the natural hue of the material turned up <b>with</b> <b>caked</b> and venerable slush. The youngest child of his landlady remarks several times a day, as this strange occupant enters or quits the house, [...] "Dere's de author."

60|$|From {{the lofty}} ramparts {{one has a}} fine view of the sacred rivers. They join at that point--the pale blue Jumna, {{apparently}} clean and clear, and the muddy Ganges, dull yellow and not clean. On a long curved spit between the rivers, towns of tents were visible, with a multitude of fluttering pennons, and a mighty swarm of pilgrims. It was a troublesome place to get down to, and not a quiet place when you arrived; but it was interesting. There was a world of activity and turmoil and noise, partly religious, partly commercial; for the Mohammedans were there to curse and sell, and the Hindoos to buy and pray. It is a fair {{as well as a}} religious festival. Crowds were bathing, praying, and drinking the purifying waters, and many sick pilgrims had come long journeys in palanquins to be healed of their maladies by a bath; or if that might not be, then to die on the blessed banks and so make sure of heaven. There were fakeers in plenty, with their bodies dusted over with ashes and their long hair <b>caked</b> together <b>with</b> cow-dung; for the cow is holy and so is the rest of it; so holy that the good Hindoo peasant frescoes the walls of his hut with this refuse, and also constructs ornamental figures out of it for the gracing of his dirt floor. There were seated families, fearfully and wonderfully painted, who by attitude and grouping represented the families of certain great gods. There was a holy man who sat naked by the day and by the week on a cluster of iron spikes, and did not seem to mind it; and another holy man, who stood all day holding his withered arms motionless aloft, and was said to have been doing it for years. All of these performers have a cloth on the ground beside them for the reception of contributions, and even the poorest of the people give a trifle and hope that the sacrifice will be blessed to him. At last came a procession of naked holy people marching by and chanting, and I wrenched myself away.|$|R

His long boots were <b>caked</b> <b>with</b> mire and the fur was coming off the battered cap he held in one hand; his blue duck trousers were rent at one knee and a very old jacket hung over his coarse blue shirt.

Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh, that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.|$|R
