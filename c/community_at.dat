5|$|As of a 2010 {{report by}} the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, there were 2.8 million Canadian {{citizens}} abroad. This represents about 8% of the total Canadian population.

Canadians in the United States constitute the greatest single expatriate <b>community</b> <b>at</b> over 1 million in 2009, representing 35.8% of all Canadians abroad.

5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E

5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E

5|$|Later medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, {{gave some}} {{information}} about East Anglian events, but Yorke suggests that the annalistic format used forced these writers to guess the dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The Anglian collection, which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Rædwald is however {{referred to in the}} 8th century Vita of St Gregory the Great, written {{by a member of the}} religious <b>community</b> <b>at</b> Whitby.
