2500|$|Non-degenerate {{singular}} values {{always have}} unique left- and right-singular vectors, up to multiplication by a unit-phase factor eiφ (for the real case up to a sign). [...] Consequently, if all singular {{values of a}} square matrix [...] are non-degenerate and non-zero, then its singular value decomposition is unique, up to multiplication of a column of [...] by a unit-phase factor and simultaneous multiplication of the <b>corresponding</b> <b>column</b> of [...] by the same unit-phase factor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{combustion}} flue gases {{inside the}} chimneys or stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes {{the bottom of}} the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure {{at the bottom of a}} <b>corresponding</b> <b>column</b> of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney. That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called [...] "natural draught/draft", [...] "natural ventilation", [...] "chimney effect", or [...] "stack effect". The taller the stack, the more draught or draft is created. There can be cases of diminishing returns: if a stack is overly tall in relation to the heat being sent out of the stack, the flue gases may cool before reaching the top of the chimney. [...] This condition can result in poor drafting, and in the case of wood burning appliances, the cooling of the gases before emission can cause creosote to condense near the top of the chimney. The creosote can restrict the exit of flue gases and may pose a fire hazard.|$|E
