Steinholt opposed this, {{saying that if}} the wages of the mayor and several other high-ranking politicians had been cut, the municipality <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> NOK 487,000. In the 2009 parliamentary election Steinholt received 1,829 votes, again as Red Nordland's leading candidate.|$|E

Monk enters the dealership and stops Ruskin but is emotionally shaken when Ruskin says he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> Trudy. At the end, he talks with Dr. Kroger and cancels his trip.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E

Rather than go to jail, and ignoring Jared's screams of protest, he jumps to his death. In the weeks that follow, Jared's life collapses. Despite learning of Diane's illness, he moves out of her house, choosing instead to be homeless. Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings; after arguing with Diane, he confesses that he witnessed Tracy's rape and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards.

Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and {{they look at the}} strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that this would have been an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E

25|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Marcia Clark {{published a}} book about the case titled Without a Doubt (1998). Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation.

In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} was {{met with}} worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss {{of life and the}} regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> many more passengers.|$|E

Roddenberry later claimed that around $257,000 was spent on the episode, and said that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> a further $20,000 if he had not insisted on high quality casting and sets.

25|$|There {{has been}} sharp {{criticism}} about the U.S. {{response to the}} Holocaust: That it failed to admit Jews fleeing persecution from Europe {{at the beginning of}} World War II, and that it did not act decisively enough to prevent or stop the Holocaust. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the President at the time, was well-informed about the Hitler regime and its anti-Jewish policies, but the U.S. State Department policies made it very difficult for Jewish refugees to obtain entry visas. Roosevelt similarly took no action on the Wagner-Rogers Bill, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>saved</b> 20,000 Jewish refugee children, following the arrival of 936 Jewish refugees on the MS St. Louis, who were denied asylum and were not allowed into the United States because of strict laws passed by Congress.|$|E

However, in American Samoa, where quarantine precaution measures had been adequately taken, there were no deaths. Upon learning of the current situation in Western Samoa, the American Governor offered help to Colonel Logan who was in charge; Logan was British born and hated Americans.
