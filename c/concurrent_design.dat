50|$|Multiple {{baseline}} {{studies are}} often categorized as either concurrent or nonconcurrent. <b>Concurrent</b> <b>designs</b> are {{the traditional approach}} to multiple baseline studies, where all participants undergo treatment simultaneously. This strategy is advantageous because it moderates several threats to validity, and history effects in particular. <b>Concurrent</b> multiple baseline <b>designs</b> are also useful for saving time, since all participants are processed at once. The ability to retrieve complete data sets within well defined time constraints is a valuable asset while planning research.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Concurrent</b> <b>design</b> {{comes with}} a series of challenges, such as {{implementation}} of early design reviews, dependency on efficient communication between engineers and teams, software compatibility, and opening up the design process.

If such issues are not addressed properly, <b>concurrent</b> <b>design</b> may not work effectively. [...] It {{is important to note that}} although the nature of some project activities project imposes a degree of linearity—completion of software code, prototype development and testing, for example—organizing and managing project teams to facilitate <b>concurrent</b> <b>design</b> can still yield significant benefits that come from the improved sharing of information.|$|E

50|$|Concurrent and Sequential {{engineering}} {{cover the}} same stages {{of design and}} manufacturing, however, the two approaches vary widely in terms of productivity, cost, development and efficiency. The 'Sequential Engineering vs <b>Concurrent</b> <b>Design</b> and Manufacturing' figure shows sequential engineering {{on the left and}} <b>concurrent</b> <b>design</b> and manufacturing on the right. As seen in the figure, sequential engineering begins with customer requirements and then progresses to design, implementation, verification and maintenance. The approach for sequential engineering results in large amounts of time devoted to product development. Due to large amounts of time allocated towards all stages of product development, sequential engineering is associated with high cost and is less efficient as products can not be made quickly. Concurrent engineering, on the other hand, allows for all stages of product development to occur essentially at the same time. As seen in the 'Sequential Engineering vs <b>Concurrent</b> <b>Design</b> and Manufacturing' figure, initial planning is the only requirement before the process can occur including planning design, implementation, testing and evaluation. The <b>concurrent</b> <b>design</b> and manufacturing approach allows for shortening of product development time, higher efficiency in developing and producing parts earlier and lower production costs.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of concurrent applications is challenging {{because of the}} complexity of <b>concurrent</b> <b>designs</b> and the hazards of concurrent programming. Architectural modeling using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) can support the development process, but the problem of mapping the model to a concurrent implementation remains. This paper addresses this problem by defining a scheme to map <b>concurrent</b> UML <b>designs</b> to a con-current object-oriented program. Using the COMET method for the architectural <b>design</b> of <b>concurrent</b> object-oriented systems, each component and connector is annotated with a stereotype indicating its behavioral design pattern. For each of these patterns, a reference implementation is provided using SCOOP, a concurrent object-oriented programming model. We evaluate this development process using a case study of an ATM system, obtaining a fully functional implementation based on the systematic mapping of the individual patterns. Given the strong execution guarantees of the SCOOP model, which is free of data races by construction, this development method eliminates a source of intricate concurrent program-ming errors. ...|$|R
