In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized. Hydrogenation processes are the Bergius process, the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes, the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process and several other single-stage and two-stage processes. In the process of low-temperature carbonization, coal is <b>coked</b> at temperatures between 360 and 750°C (680 and 1,380°F).

6000|$|It was now Martin's turn to watch. The {{household}} cock {{had given}} his first summons, and the night was well-nigh spent. Upon examining {{the state of the}} furnace in which the wood was deposited in order to its being <b>coked</b> or charred, he {{was surprised to find that}} the fire had not been sufficiently maintained; for in his excursion and its consequences, George had forgot the principal object of his watch. Martin's first thought was to call up the slumberers; but observing that both his brothers slept unwontedly deep and heavily, he respected their repose, and set himself to supply the furnace with fuel without requiring their aid. What he heaped upon it was apparently damp and unfit for the purpose, for the fire seemed rather to decay than revive. Martin next went to collect some boughs from a stack which had been carefully cut and dried for this purpose; but, when he returned, he found the fire totally extinguished. This was a serious evil, and threatened them with loss of their trade for more than one day. The vexed and mortified watchman set about to strike a light in order to rekindle the fire but the tinder was moist, and his labour proved in this respect also ineffectual. He was now about to call up his brothers, for circumstances seemed to be pressing, when flashes of light glimmered not only through the window, but through every crevice of the rudely built hut, and summoned him to behold the same apparition which had before alarmed the successive watches of his brethren. His first idea was, that the Muhllerhaussers, their rivals in trade, and with whom they had had many quarrels, might have encroached upon their bounds for the purpose of pirating their wood; and he resolved to awake his brothers, and be revenged on them for their audacity. But a short reflection and observation on the gestures and manner of those who seemed to [...] "work in the fire," [...] induced him to dismiss this belief, and although rather sceptical in such matters, to conclude that what he saw was a supernatural phenomenon. [...] "But be they men or fiends," [...] said the undaunted forester, [...] "that busy themselves yonder with such fantastical rites and gestures, I will go and demand a light to rekindle our furnace." [...] He, relinquished at the same time the idea of awaking his brethren. There was a belief that such adventures as he was about to undertake were accessible only to one person at a time; he feared also that his brothers, in their scrupulous timidity, might interfere to prevent his pursuing the investigation he had resolved to commence; and, therefore, snatching his boar-spear from the wall, the undaunted Martin Waldeck set forth on the adventure alone.|$|E

In this study, <b>coke</b> samples excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) at MEFOS in Luleå, Sweden were collected. The centreline quenched <b>coke</b> samples from different zones of this EBF were used to observe the influence of in-furnace reactions {{on the evolution of}} <b>coke</b> properties and their associations with CO 2 reactivity. Carbon structure of <b>coke</b> was found to increasingly ordered, silicon and iron concentration in the <b>coke</b> samples decreased, while alkali concentration particularly potassium and sodium were found to increase as the <b>coke</b> descended towards lower part of the EBF. Both isothermal and non-isothermal reactivity based on TGA measurements showed that <b>coke</b> reactivity towards CO 2 is increased as <b>coke</b> descends towards cohesive zone despite increasing order of carbon structures. Increased reactivity of <b>cokes</b> at lower parts of EBF was related to alkali enrichments of <b>cokes.</b> The study further shows that increased alkali components in <b>cokes</b> have a strong impact on CO 2 gasification in EBF such that influence of <b>coke</b> graphitisation could be compensated by catalytic influence of alkalis.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} price and economic pressures, {{there is a}} need to minimise <b>coke</b> consumption. The lesser amount of <b>coke</b> used has indirectly set higher standards for <b>coke</b> quality and led to a wish for even more knowledge about its function in the blast furnace. Over the last 20 years, <b>coke</b> quality has been strongly dictated by the so- called CSR value because it was believed that a higher CSR leads to improvement in productivity and more stable operation. Due to lack of suitable coals, often <b>cokes</b> are made from coals with relatively inferior coals leading to <b>coke</b> with lower values of the so-called CRI indicia. Because of this, there was an indirect focus on <b>cokes</b> with lower CRI values. Therefore, this thesis will address some of the important issues of <b>coke</b> strength and focus on changes occurring with <b>coke</b> when it passes through a blast furnace. The main aim of this study is to understand the degradation mechanisms and reactivity changes of <b>coke</b> in order to investigate the factors that affect <b>coke</b> quality. <b>Cokes</b> excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) are used as a basis for the research. Two campaigns with similar <b>coke</b> (low CRI/high CSR) but different blast furnace injection material have been studied. The <b>coke</b> is supplied from SSAB Tunnplåt Luleå AB. Physical and chemical properties of <b>cokes</b> samples from the EBF were measured. Evolution of <b>coke</b> properties particularly carbon structure and alkali uptake were related to CO 2 reactivity as well as <b>coke</b> behaviour (e. g. CSR/abrasion). In addition to this, a trial with very high CRI <b>coke</b> was studied. On the basis of this study, following conclusions were made. The order of carbon structure and concentration of alkali species were increased and these were the most notable changes in the <b>coke</b> properties as it passed through shaft to the cohesive zone of the EBF. The degree of graphitisation was increased while amorphous carbon content was decreased in the hotter zones of the EBF. A linear correlation between the height of the carbon crystallite (Lc) values and the <b>coke</b> bed temperature was established to demonstrate the strong effect of temperature on the carbon crystallite value (Lc) of <b>coke</b> in the EBF. The alkali concentration of <b>coke</b> increased with increasing temperature of the <b>coke</b> bed such that most of the alkali content was evenly distributed in the bulk of the <b>coke</b> rather than in the periphery of the <b>coke</b> matrix. The CO 2 reactivity of <b>coke</b> was found to increase during progressive movement of the <b>coke</b> from shaft to cohesive zone of the EBF, and was related to the catalytic effect of increased alkali concentration in <b>coke.</b> The deterioration of <b>coke</b> quality in the EBF, particularly <b>coke</b> strength (CSR) and abrasion propensity (I drum test), was related to <b>coke</b> graphitisation, alkalization and reactivity to demonstrate the strong effect of the <b>coke</b> graphitisation on the propensity of <b>coke</b> degradation. Differential Thermal Analysis indicated that reactions with CO 2 are enhanced as <b>coke</b> descends through the EBF. In addition, a trial period with poor <b>coke</b> quality was studied by extensive sampling. The results from this study gave the following additional conclusions: Comparison between high and poor quality <b>coke</b> indicate structure to be connected with alkali uptake, reaction with CO 2 and degradation. Isotropic <b>coke</b> carbon components are more resistant than anisotropic components when passing through the EBF.
