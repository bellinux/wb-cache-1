40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the chlorinated ethylenes may {{be explained}} by the formation of <b>chloroethylene</b> epoxides as the first intermediate products. The evidence indicates that these epoxides rearrange with migration of chlorine to form chloroacetaldehydes and chloroacetyl chlorides. Thus, monochloroacetic acid, chloral hydrate, and trichloroacetic acid have been found in reaction mixtures of 1, 1 -dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene, respectively, with rat liver microsomal systems. Rearrangements of the <b>chloroethylene</b> glycols formed from the epoxides by hydration may also take place, but would appear, at least in the case of 1, 1 -dichloroethylene, to be quantitatively less important.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of mutagenicity of <b>chloroethylene</b> oxide (CEO), an ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of vinyl chloride, {{was investigated in}} 3 Escherichia coli strains (E. coli "multitest"). In this system, the mutagenicity of CEO {{was found to be}} mainly SOS-independent. CEO did not induce recombinational events at a detection level of about 10 - 2 recombinants/survivor.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} reactivity or {{stability of}} the <b>chloroethylene</b> molecules affects their hepatotoxic potential. Extent and symmetry of the chlorine substitution, which alters electron delocalization, charge polarization, and solubility, affect biologic response. The most nonsymmetrically depolarized <b>chloroethylene,</b> 1, 1 -dichloroethylene (1, 1 -DCE) is the most hepatotoxic and causes a unique pattern of hepatoceliular injury involving mitochondria, plasma membranes, and chromatin. The injury caused by the other chloroethylenes examined appears to profoundly affect the structural integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum with toxic potential in the order: trichloroethylene (TRI) > vinyl chloride (VCM) > perchloroethylene (PER). Pretreatments which increased cytochrome P 450 contents, thus presumably augmenting metabolic activation to a reactive intermediate such as an epoxide, enhanced or were synergistic to the hepatotoxic potential of TRI, VCM and PER but were protective or antagonistic to 1, 1 -DCE hepatotoxicity. Biologic response to 1, 1 -DCE may be expressed by a different metabolic pathway. Glutathione appears {{to be involved in}} the biologic response to alH nonsymmetric chloroethylenes and to act as an antagonist against injury. Marked differences in the patterns of injury and the biologic responses suggest that more than one mechanism is involved in the production of injury by chloroethylenes...|$|E
40|$|After a {{historical}} {{survey of the}} kinetics of gaseous dehydrochlorination reactions, a critical account of developments {{in the theory of}} unimolecular reactions is given. This latter has considerable bearing on the choice of compounds examined here. The construction and operation of both static and dynamic apparatus are described. The preparation and purification of the materials are detailed, and their physical constants are compared with previous determinations. Full details of the kinetics of the thermal decomposition of allyl chloride, trichloro-ethylene, and the 1 : 2 -dichloroethylenes, in a static apparatus with carbon coated walls, are reported. In all cases the effects of changes in the surface/volume ratio of the reactor and the addition of inhibitors such as propylene and n-hexane have been carefully investigated. In addition, the effects of the "inert" gases, n-pentane and diethyl ether, on the unimolecular decompositions of the <b>chloroethylenes</b> have been studied. A series of flow experiments, primarily for the large scale collection and analysis of reaction products has also been performed. It is deduced that the pyrolysisof allyl chloride is predominantly a non-chain, but partially heterogeneous reaction, while the decompositions of all the <b>chloroethylenes</b> are homogeneous, simultaneous chain and molecular processes. Having shown that the results justify the assumption that the second elimination of hydrogen chloride from a polychlorohydrocarbon is slow compared with the first, a mechanistic interpretation of the kinetics is given. A possible explanation of the unexpected heterogeneity, detectable chain component, and low efficiency of the unimolecular process found in the pyrolysis of allyl chloride is given. A reasonable chain mechanism which explains the kinetics of the free radical decomposition of trichloroethylene is postulated, and the finer points of the mechanism confirmed by a quantitative treatment of the observed induction periods. Finally, the unimolecular decompositions of ail the <b>chloroethylenes</b> are discussed in connection with Slater's treatment of unimolecular reactions. <p...|$|R

40|$|A {{consortium}} of methanotrophs cultured from the St. Joseph’s aquifer in Schoolcraft, MI, {{was found to}} exhibit similar methane consumption rates as pure cultures of methanotrophs. The methanotrophic consortium resides within {{a portion of the}} aquifer contaminated with a mixed waste plume of per-chloroethylene (PCE) and its reductive dechlorination products from natural attenuation, trichloroeth-ylene (TCE), cis-dichloroethylene (c-DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC). Oxidation kinetics for TCE, c-DCE, and VC were measured for the mixed methanotroph consortium and compared to reported rate parameters for degradation of these <b>chloroethylene</b> compounds by pure methanotrophic cultures. The results demonstrate that the kinetics of <b>chloroethylene</b> oxidation by the Schoolcraft methanotroph population mimic the degradation rates of pure methanotrophic cultures that primarily express par-ticulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). Molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed that sMMO was not being expressed by these cells.

Except in a few instances, mean concentrations are typically between 0 and 5 ppb. Significant variabilities in atmospheric concentrations associated with intense sources and adverse meteorological conditions are shown to exist.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of aryl reductive dehalogenation reactions by sulfur oxyanions {{has been demonstrated}} in environmental samples, dehalogenating enrichments, and the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfomonile tiedjei; however, this phenomenon is not well understood. We {{examined the effects of}} sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate on reductive dehalogenation in the model microorganism D. tiedjei and found separate mechanisms of inhibition due to these oxyanions under growth versus nongrowth conditions. Dehalogenation activity was greatly reduced in extracts of cells grown in the presence of both 3 -chlorobenzoate, the substrate or inducer for the aryl dehalogenation activity, and either sulfate, sulfite, or thiosulfate, indicating that sulfur oxyanions repress the requisite enzymes. In extracts of fully induced cells, thiosulfate and sulfite, but not sulfate, were potent inhibitors of aryl dehalogenation activity even in membrane fractions lacking the cytoplasmically located sulfur oxyanion reductase. These results suggest that under growth conditions, sulfur oxyanions serve as preferred electron acceptors and negatively influence dehalogenation activity in D. tiedjei by regulating the amount of active aryl dehalogenase in cells. Additionally, in vitro inhibition by sulfur oxyanions is due to the interaction of the reactive species with enzymes involved in dehalogenation and need not involve competition between two respiratory processes for reducing equivalents. Sulfur oxyanions also inhibited tetrachloroethylene dehalogenation by the same mechanisms, further indicating that <b>chloroethylenes</b> are fortuitously dehalogenated by the aryl dehalogenase. The commonly observed {{inhibition of}} reductive dehalogenation reactions under sulfate-reducing conditions may be due to similar regulation mechanisms in other dehalogenating microorganisms that contain multiple respiratory activities...|$|R
40|$|Gas phase {{kinetics}} of {{the reactions}} involving hydroxyl radical and hydrogen atom were studied using experimental and ab initio theoretical techniques. The rate constant for the H + H 2 S reaction has been measured from 298 to 598 K by the laser photolysis/resonance fluorescence (LP-RF) technique. The transition state theory (TST) analysis {{coupled with the}} measurements support {{the suggestion that the}} reaction shows significant curvature in the Arrhenius plot. The LP-RF technique was also used to measure the rate constant of the H + CH 3 Br reaction over the temperature range 400 - 813 K. TST and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the dominant reaction channel is Br-abstraction. The reaction H + CF 2 =CF-CF=CF 2 was first studied by flash photolysis/resonance fluorescence (FP-RF) method. The experiments of this work revealed distinctly non-Arrhenius behavior, which was interpreted in terms of a change in mechanism. DFT calculations suggest that the adduct is CF 2 H-CF•-CF=CF 2. At lower temperatures a mixture of this molecule and CF 2 •-CFH-CF=CF 2 is likely. The theoretical calculations show that H atom migrates in the fluoroethyl radicals through a bridging intermediate, and the barrier height for this process is lower in the less fluorinated ethyl radical. High level computations were also employed in studies of the rate constants of OH + <b>chloroethylenes</b> reactions. VTST calculations indicate that, except the reaction of OH + C 2 Cl 4, these reactions present a complex behavior.

40|$|This report {{describes}} ecotoxicological {{environmental risk}} limits derived {{for a number}} of volatile aliphatic hydrocarbons. On the basis of evaluated literature, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) proposes ecotoxicological environmental risk limits for these compounds for water, soil, sediment and air. The proposed environmental risk limits are the scientific basis for Environmental Quality Standards set by the interdepartmental Steering Group 'Substances'. Three levels have been distinguished: Negligible Concentrations (NC); Maximum Permissible Concentrations (MPC), a level at which no harmful effects are to be expected, and Serious Risk Concentrations (SRCeco), a level at which possible serious effects are to be expected. The environmental risk limits play an important role for the implementation of the national policy concerning substances. The substances evaluated in this report are: acrylonitrile, ethylene, ethylene oxide, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, 1, 1 -dichloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane, pentachloroethane, hexachloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloropropane, 1, 3 -dichloropropane, <b>chloroethylene,</b> 1, 1 -dichloroethylene, 1, 2 -dichloroethylene (trans- and cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene), trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 3 -chloropropene, 1, 3 -dichloropropene (trans- and cis- 1, 3 -dichloropropene), 2, 3 -dichloropropene, 2 -chlorobutadiene and hexachlorobutadiene. For eight substances, the risk limits were derived based on European Documents, drafted in the framework of the Existing Substance Regulation or the European Water Framework Directive (acrylonitrile, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and hexachlorobutadiene). For four substances (ethylene, 1, 1 -dichloroethane, <b>chloroethylene</b> and 2, 3 -dichloropropene), too few reliable toxicity data were available to derive an environmental risk limit.

40|$|Since the Offensive Odor Control Law became effective, the {{evaluation}} of volatile organic pollutants in water has come into question. As a technique to solve this, "Vacuum Exposure Method" was employed.

After it's left in water bath at 70 ℃ for 3 hours, the sample gas, volatiled into the second bottle, is condensed and analyzed by GC. In this process, the Henry,s Law is recognized to be valid from 0. 1 to 1000 ppb or more of sample concentration in water. According to this principle, the micro analysis of environmental sample, such as water supply, sewage and waste water, became possible.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of chloroacetaldehyde, a reactive metabolite of the carcinogen vinyl chloride, with DNA produces {{in addition to}} the hitherto known adducts, l,N 6 -ethenoadenine and 3,N 4 -ethenocytosine, an ethenoguanine adduct, namely N 2, 3 -ethenoguanine. This adduct is formed in the {{reaction of}} chloroacetaldehyde with the free base as well. After DNA hydrolysis followed by isolation of this new adduct by h. p. l. c, its mass spectrum and fluorescence spectrum are identical with those published in the literature for the chemi-cally synthesized N 2, 3 -ethenoguanine. The formation of only this guanine derivative out of several theoretically possible reaction products allows the formulation of a reaction scheme.

Due to their toxicity and persistence under natural conditions "denser-than-water" non aqueous phase liquids are substantial threats to the subsurface environment as well as the surface ecosystems including human beings. During the last two decades a number of technical solutions has been presented to enhance the situation of contaminated areas. One of the more recently established concepts are permeable reactive barriers. Permeable reactive barriers are passive in situ treatment zones containing a reactive material suitable to remove the contamination from the groundwater. They are installed downgradient from the pollution source perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction to immobilise or degrade the dissolved pollutants in the groundwater as it flows through. This project was organised in two main parts. The first part assessed seven different iron powders in batch experiments to determine the most efficient powder in terms of degradation velocity. The second part of the study employed this powder in a column experiment using different mixing ratios with sand to evaluate its performance under simulated subsurface conditions in a permeable reactive barrier. The aim of this experiment was to obtain a more detailed description of the behaviour and performance of the selected material. In the batch experiment the most promissing iron powder produced a half-life of tetrachloroethylene of 2. 36 h. The column study demonstrated that cis-dichloroethylene has the longest half-life compared to tetrachlorethylene and trichloroethylene with 1. 65 h. Having the longest half-life of all <b>chloroethylenes</b> included in this investigation the cis-dichloroethylene concentration will determine the dimensioning of a permeable barrier for remediation purposes...|$|R
40|$|Pyrogenic carbon {{particles}} such as carbon black, soot and charcoal et al., collectively termed black carbon (BC), {{have been reported}} to exhibit an extremely strong sorption of organic compounds in the environment. The sorption process dominated the fate and transport of organic contaminants in the soil and sediment environments. This study aims to analyse the characterization of black carbon and study the sorption behaviors and sorption mechanisms of several organic compounds in these black carbons in an aqueous phase. The results demonstrate that produced process and starting material are potential factors that can explain the sorptive variability of black carbons. Sorption kinetics of organic contaminants into black carbons revealed that around several hours were enough to reach sorption equilibrium. Sorption isotherms of organic compounds can be described by sorion models including linear equation, Freundlich equation, and Langmuir equation. The results showed that use Freundlich equation can describe the sorption of organic compounds on black carbon form aqueous solutions well. The surface properties of black carbons controlled by their production conditions and depend on their starting material. Because of the surface area of BC 1 is more than BC 3 and BC 4, the sorption coefficients of aromatic compounds without functional groups on BC 1 were larger than those on BC 3 and BC 4. Sorption behaviors of black carbons were affected by functional groups, so sorption capacity of aromatic compounds with functional groups on BC 4 is more than BC 3 due to more functional groups observed on BC 3. The surface properties of these pyrogenic {{carbon particles}} such as surface area and functional groups affected the sorption behaviors of these compounds. The sorption coefficients of organic compounds including polar and non-polar chemicals on black carbons have been obtained via a reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) method. Because of the surface area of BC 1 is more than the other black carbons, the sorption coefficients of organic chemicals on BC 1 were larger than those on the other four black carbons. The effect of sorption behaviors on black carbons also depended suface functional groups, so sorption of aromatic compounds with functional groups on BC 3 is larger than that of BC 4. Five black carbons have mostly non-polar surface, the observed sorption coefficients of organic compounds on black carbons increased with their octanol-water partition coefficient values (Kow). The results obtained that sorption coefficients of <b>chloroethylenes</b> and chlorophenols on the black carbons became larger with more chloro atoms on the molecular structures of <b>chloroethylenes</b> and chlorophenols and larger with more carbon atoms on the benzene compounds. By the regression of the sorption coefficients of organic compounds on these black carbons with the properties of organic compounds, several linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) equations were built. The analysis of the interactions based on these LSERs indicated that the London dispersion force and interaction through π- and n- elactrons were the major adsorption interaction in the sorption process on black carbons. The effects of the dipolarity / polarisability, the hydrogen bond acidity, and the hydrogen bond basicity were less. For selected organic chemicals, some specific interactions occur during the sorption process. Several LSERs equations were developed to facilitate the prediction of different organic chemicals on black carbons. The better understanding of the sorption behaviors of organic chemicals into pyrogenic carbon particles can facilitate the fate transport and risk assessment processes of contaminants in the environment. 經由不完成燃燒所生成之碳微粒，包括黑碳、soot及charcoal等，總稱為黑碳(black carbon 或 BC) ，許多文獻指出當黑碳存在於環境中時，對於有機化合物具高吸附能力，而黑碳之吸附能力將對於有機化合物之宿命扮演重要之角色。本研究之目的為分析黑碳之基本性質及探討水溶液中黑碳對於有機化合物之吸附行為，並說明黑碳對於有機化合物之吸附機制。由分析資料得知，由於生成黑碳之起始物質及生成條件，所生成之黑碳基本性質也有所不同，而對於有機化合物之吸附造成重要之影響。 黑碳吸附有機化合物之等溫吸附曲線可用等溫吸附模式加以描述之，所使用之吸附模式包括線性模式，Freundlich模式，及Langmuir模式，而使用Freundlich模式對於黑碳吸附有機化合物有較佳之描述。由於BC 1 之比表面積較大，可吸附較多之有機化合物，故所求得之BC 1 吸附未含官能基之苯環化合物之吸附平衡常數較BC 3 及BC 4 大，而吸附行為也受官能基影響，使得BC 3 對於含官能基有機化合物之吸附能力大於BC 4 。經由不完全燃燒之碳微粒所生成之表面特性如比表面積及官能基等會影響黑碳吸附有機化合物之能力。 利用逆相液相層析法求得黑碳對於極性及非極性有機化合物之吸附平衡常數。由研究得知，BC 1 吸附有機化合物之吸附平衡常數較其他四種黑碳之吸附平衡常數大；這是由於黑碳之比表面積較大，故黑碳表面可吸附較多之有機化合物。而由於BC 3 對於含官能基有機化合物之吸附能力大於BC 4 ，說明官能基也會對於黑碳在低濃度範圍下之吸附行為造成影響。而由於黑碳具有非極性表面，求得之吸附平衡常數隨著辛醇-水系數(Kow) 增加而增加，顯示黑碳對於氯烯類及氯酚類有機化合物之吸附平衡常數皆有隨著含氯數增加而增加的趨勢。 而利用所得之吸附平衡常數與LSER參數將建立線性溶合能量關係式(LSER；linear solvation energy relationship) ，結果得知黑碳與有機化合物之間的主要作用力為倫敦分散力及π電子或未共用電子對之吸附作用力，而偶極-偶極或偶極-誘導偶極作用力及氫鍵作用力則對於吸附影響較小。而由於有機化合物之不同，黑碳所提供之吸附能力也有所不同。經由不完全燃燒所產生之碳微粒吸附有機化合物之了解，將可加以說明當含碳物質存在於自然界時，環境中有機汙染物之宿命及傳輸分布情形。摘要 i Abstract	ii 目錄 iv 圖目錄	vi 表目錄	vii 第一章 前言	 1 一、經由不完全燃燒所生成之碳微粒	 1 二、環境中有機化合物之來源及分布	 1 三、含碳物質吸附有機化合物	 2 四、研究動機與目的	 2 五、研究流程	 3 第二章 理論背景與文獻回顧	 5 一、黑碳之簡介及來源	 5 二、有機化合物之特性及分布	 6 三、界面吸附現象	 11 (一) 吸附理論	 11 (二) 恆溫吸附型態	 12 (三) 等溫吸附模式	 14 四、逆相液相層析儀測定法之原理	 17 (一) 吸附動力學上之研究	 17 (二) 利用層析技術研究吸附動力學	 17 五、線性媒合能量關係方程式	 20 六、環境中含碳物質影響有機化合物之傳輸及研究	 21 (一) 含碳物質吸附有機化合物之研究	 21 (二) 環境中碳微粒吸附有機污染物之研究	 23 第三章 試驗材料與實驗方法	 28 一、吸附劑	 28 二、吸附質	 29 三、儀器設備	 32 四、實驗步驟及分析	 32 (一) 吸附劑特性分析	 32 (二) 黑碳吸附有機化合物之試驗	 36 (三) 逆相液相層析儀測定方法	 38 第四章 結果與討論	 42 一、吸附劑之基本特性分析	 42 (一) 表面型態分析	 42 (二) 元素組成分析	 51 (三) 光譜分析	 53 二、吸附行為	 69 (一) 水溶液中黑碳吸附有機化合物之等溫吸附曲線	 69 (二) 利用逆相液相層析法求得吸附平衡常數	 86 (三) 利用吸附平衡常數建立線性溶合能量關係方程式	 92 第五章 結論	 110 第六章 參考文獻	 112 附錄	 11...|$|R

Halogenated chemicals represent {{a large and}} toxic class of environmental pollutants. Although regulation of certain halogenated organics resulted in decreasing production of these chemicals in the United States since the 1970 s, others were yet unknown when the regulations were written and production is increasing. In many cases, halogenated organics are persistent in the environment, bioaccumulative, and bioactive, causing toxicological concerns. As such, environmental scientists have studied the processes by which these chemicals can be broken down, and the products that form in these breakdown reactions. In some cases, the toxic effects associated with halogenated organic pollutants can be ameliorated by complete dehalogenation, while incomplete dehalogenation or other transformations can result {{in the production of}} harmful compounds. The mechanisms of these transformations are in most cases not yet well understood, but a fundamental understanding of these reactions helps in the development of effective remediation strategies, and informs the fundamental chemistry inherent to these reactions. Concern about halogenated environmental pollutants has led to investigations of a number of means of dehalogenation including biological attenuation. Microbially mediated dehalogenation represents a major transformation pathway for halogenated pollutants in the environment. Metal-containing cofactors have been implicated in these processes including cobalamin (vitamin B 12), factor F 430, and hemitin. These cofactors are responsible for the reductive dehalogenation of environmental pollutants. These reactions can proceed by a various intermediates, but one of particular interest is the formation of radicals. Radicals have at least one unpaired electron, and as such are highly reactive and transient intermediates. These features can make them difficult to study but their powerful reactivity underscores their importance in environmental transformations. Radical intermediates are often proposed but rarely fully understood in a range of environmental systems. In this thesis, the role of radicals in dehalogenation reactions is explored with particular attention to cobalamin-mediated and nickel-mediated reactions. The mechanism of cobalamin-mediated dechlorination has been studied extensively and evidence for both outer-sphere (radical based) and inner sphere (nonradical based) mechanisms has been presented. In this thesis the literature concerning cobalamin-mediated dehalogenation is reviewed in detail (Chapter 1) and a mechanistic study on the role of radicals in cobalamin-mediated dechlorination of <b>chloroethylenes</b> reconciles previously seemingly contradictory data (Chapter 2). Similarly, both radical and nonradical pathways have been invoked in nickel-mediated dehalogenation of a variety of substrates. Nickel-mediated dehalogenation has not been studied as extensively as cobalt-mediated reactions and the understanding is complicated by the fundamental chemistry of nickel complexes. In order to better understand the chemistry of reduced nickel complexes, particularly their reaction with halogenated organics, a series of nickel complexes was synthesized and characterized (Chapter 3). The relationship between reduced transition metal complexes and their ligands is inextricably linked to whether and how radical intermediates are formed in these systems. The reactivity of two reduced nickel complexes precursors show that these complexes are highly sensitive to slight changes in ligand structure (Chapter 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE) is a {{suspected}} carcinogen {{and a common}} groundwater contaminant. Although PCE is highly resistant to aerobic biodegradation, it is subject to reductive dechlorination reactions {{in a variety of}} anaerobic habitats. The data presented here clearly establish that axenic cultures of Methanosarcina sp. strain DCM dechlorinate PCE to trichloroethylene and that this is a biological reaction. Growth on methanol, acetate, methylamine, and trimethylamine resulted in PCE dechlorination. The reductive dechlorination of PCE occurred only during methanogenesis, and no dechlorination was noted when CH 4 production ceased. There was a clear dependence of the extent of PCE dechlorination on the amount of methanogenic substrate (methanol) consumed. The amount of trichloroethylene formed per millimole of CH 4 formed remained essentially constant for a 20 -fold range of methanol concentrations and for growth on acetate, methylamine, and trimethylamine. These results suggest that the reducing equivalents for PCE dechlorination are derived from CH 4 biosynthesis and that the extent of <b>chloroethylene</b> dechlorination can be enhanced by stimulating methanogenesis. It is proposed that electrons transferred during methanogenesis are diverted to PCE by a reduced electron carrier involved in methane formation...|$|E

Many chemical carcinogens have been shown to exert a carcinogenic effect following their metabolic activation into elctrophilic metabolites which react readily with cellular macromolecules (3).

40|$|Background: Recent {{epidemiologic}} {{evidence suggests}} that the common polymorphism at amino acid residue 399 of the x-ray cross complementing- 1 (XRCC 1) protein, a key component of the base excision repair (BER) pathway for DNA damage, plays {{a significant role in the}} genetic variability of individuals in terms of the mutagenic damage they experience following exposure to the carcinogen vinyl chloride (VC). The aim of this study was to provide support for the biological plausibility of these epidemiologic observations with experimental data derived from cell lines in culture from individuals who were either homozygous wild-type or homozygous variant for this XRCC 1 polymorphism following exposure to <b>chloroethylene</b> oxide (CEO), the active metabolite of VC, with measurement of the induced etheno-DNA adducts before and after repair. Materials and Methods: Immortalized lymphoblast cell lines from seven VC workers (four homozygous wild-type and three homozygous variant for the 399 XRCC 1 polymorphism) were exposed to CEO, and etheno-adenosine (&# 949;A) adduct levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) pre-exposure and at 0, 4, 8 and 24 h following exposure. Results: The average &# 949;A adduct levels were statistically significantly higher in the variant cells compared to the wild-type cells at 8 and 24 h following exposure (P &# 60; 0. 05) with an overall average repair efficiency of 32 &#x 0025; in the variant cells compared to 82 &#x 0025; in the wild-type cells. Conclusion: These results are consistent with the epidemiologic findings of the types of VC-induced biomarkers observed in exposed individuals and the mutational spectra found in the resultant tumors as well as the key role that BER, especially XRCC 1, plays in this carcinogenic pathway...|$|E
40|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} (VC) {{is both a}} known carcinogen and a regulated chemical, and {{its production}} capacity has almost doubled over the last 20 years, currently 27 million tons/year worldwide. According to recent reports {{it is still a}} cause for concern. VC has been found as a degradation product of <b>chloroethylene</b> solvents (perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene) and in landfill gas and groundwater at concentrations up to 200 mg/m 3 and 10 mg/L, respectively. Worldwide occupational exposure to VC still seems to be high in some countries (e. g., averages of approximately 1, 300 mg/m 3 until 1987 in one factory), and exposure may also be high in others where VC is not regulated. By combining the most relevant epidemiologic studies from several countries, we observed a 5 -fold excess of liver cancer, primarily because of a 45 -fold excess risk from angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL). The number of ASL cases reported up to the end of 1998 was 197 worldwide. The average latency for ASL is 22 years. Some studies show a small excess risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, and others suggest a possible risk of brain tumors among highly exposed workers. Lung cancer, lymphomas, or leukemia {{do not seem to be}} related to VC exposure according to recent results. The mutation spectra observed in rat and human liver tumors (ASL and/or hepatocellular carcinoma) that are associated with exposure to VC are dearly distinct from those observed in sporadic liver tumors or hepatic tumors that are associated with other exposures. In rats, the substitution mutations found at A:T base pairs in the ras and p 53 genes are consistent with the promutagenic properties of the DNA adduct 10 -ethenoadenine formed from VC metabolites. Risk assessments derived from animal studies seem to overestimate the actual risk of cancer when comparing estimated and reported cases of ASL...|$|E
40|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} (VCM) is not carcinogenic by itself. it is bioactivated to {{the highly}} reactive alkylating oxirane <b>chloroethylene</b> oxide. Further metabolism, apparently, leads via an {{interaction of the}} primary alkylating metabolites with glutathion to S-(2 -carboxymethyl) -cysteine and thiodiacetic acid which are eliminated with the urine. Up to now, {{it has not been}} ascertained whether the oxirane alone is the essential carcinogenic factor or whether other metabolites are also involved in carcinogenicity. Likewise, it is still unknown whether the metabolites excreted in the urine might be used as biological criteria for exposure to VCM, because these metabolites probably can originate from a series of substances other than VCM. This problem could stimulate investigations on the possible carcinogenic activity of these substances. Studies on the pathway of the carcinogenic and mutagenic activity of vinyl chloride (VC) are not only of interest in relation to this special substance. Such studies also allow further insight into the possibly carcinogenic and mutagenic mechanism of chemically related substances which are suspected to be dangerous in occupational exposure. Furthermore, the knowledge of carcinogenic metabolites may furnish us with biochemical criteria to judge the dimension of risk in exposure to potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic substances. Moreover, research into the carcinogenic activity of VC becomes more and more interesting when we just learn that also tobacco smoke contains about 30 ppb of VC, a concentration which may not be important per se, but which could assume increased importance in connection with the other carcinogenic substances contained in the smoke (1). I want to report briefly some investigations which were performed in our country quite recently by Norpoth and co-workers in a working group in Munster in the Department of Occupational Medicine and the hypothesis derived from the results of these experiments. In 1966 Grigorescu and Toba (2) had found chloroacetic acid as a metabolite of VC. This was confirmed in 1974 by Hefner and co-work...|$|E
40|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} (VC) is a know {{animal and}} human carcinogen associated with liver angiosarcomas (LAS) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In VC-associated LAS mutations of the K- ras - 2 gene have been reported; however, no {{data about the}} prevalence of such mutations in VC associated HCCs are available. Recent data indicate K- ras - 2 mutations induce P 16 methylation accompanied by inactivation of the p 16 gene. The presence of K- ras - 2 mutations was analysed in tissue from 18 patients with VC associated HCCs. As a control group, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma due to hepatitis B (n =  7), hepatitis C (n =  5) and alcoholic liver cirrhosis (n =  8) was used. The specific mutations were determined by direct sequencing of codon 12 and 13 of the K- ras - 2 gene in carcinomatous and adjacent non-neoplastic liver tissue after microdissection. The status of p 16 was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), microsatellite analysis, DNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining. All patients had a documented chronic quantitated exposure to VC (average 8883 ppmy, average duration: 245 months). K- ras - 2 mutations were found in 6 of 18 (33 %) examined VC-associated HCCs and in 3 cases of adjacent non-neoplastic liver tissue. There were 3 G → A point mutations in the tumour tissue. All 3 mutations found in non-neoplastic liver from VC-exposed patients were also G → A point mutations (codon 12 - and codon 13 -aspartate mutations). Hypermethylation of the 5 ′ CpG island of the p 16 gene was found in 13 of 18 examined carcinomas (72 %). Of 6 cancers with K- ras - 2 mutations, 5 specimens also showed methylated p 16. Within the control group, K- ras - 2 mutation were found in 3 of 20 (15 %) examined HCC. p 16 methylation occurred in 11 out of 20 (55 %) patients. K- ras - 2 mutations and p 16 methylation are frequent events in VC associated HCCs. We observed a K- ras - 2 mutation pattern characteristic of <b>chloroethylene</b> oxide, a carcinogenic metabolite of VC. Our results strongly suggest that K- ras - 2 mutations {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of VC-associated HCC. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign[URL]...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been made of some aspects of prototype potential energy surfaces for some simple organic reactions. Addition of prototype electrophiles to simple alkenes has been investigated by means of non-empirical and semi-empirical calculations, within the Hartree-Fock formalism, and the resulting carbonium ions studied. The systems under investigation may be formally considered as being derived from electrophilic addition of H(^+) to ethylene, fluoroethylene and <b>chloroethylene,</b> or of X(^+) (X=F,Cl) to ethylene, and may thus be represented as (C(_ 2) H(_ 4) X) (^+), X=H,F and Cl. For the simplest system, C(_ 2) H(_ 5) (^+), two basic structures have been considered, the classical ethylcation and the bridge-protonated ethylene. The energies of these species have been minimised with respect to the C-C bond lengths and also, {{in the case of the}} latter ion, with respect to the distance of the bridging H from the CC bond centre. Examination of conformational processes in the classical ion has shown a virtual absence of any barrier to rigid rotation about the cc bond. The calculated relative energies of the species has indicated, subject to limitations imposed by the basis set size and partial geometry optimisation, that in the gas phase the classical ion should be ~ 5. 2 k cal mole(^- 1) more stable than the bridge protonated ethylene. Furthermore calculations along an idealised reaction coordinate representing trans-formation between the two species have indicated the absence of an activation barrier thus suggesting the bridged ion to be the transition state for the scrambling of the hydrogen atoms of the ethyl cation. These results have been compared with mass spectrometric data. The approach of a prototype nucleophile (H(^-)) to ethyl cation has been examined, results suggesting a preferential cis attack. Conformational processes in the 1 - and 2 - fluoroethyl chlorethyl cations have been examined. The rotational barrier in the 2 - fluoroethyl cation has been shown to be very large (10. 5 k cal mole) and, with the exception of the 2 - chloroethyl cation, all the barriers for the substituted ethyl cations have been shown to be dominated by attractive terms. In both the fluoro and chloroethyl systems, predicted ordering of stabilities of cations has been 1 - haloethyl > bridge-protonated haloethylene > 2 - haloethyl, and idealised reaction coordinates have been constructed relating the ions in the fluoro case, the results predict the total absence of any activation barrier in trans-forming 2 - to 1 - fluoroethyl cation, whilst, in the analogous chloro case, a small barrier (4. 3 k cal mole(^- 1)) is predicted. Relative thermochemical stabilities of the ions have been computed, and the stabilising/destabilising effects of halogen substitution in these carbonium ions investigated and compared with experimental data. The halogen bridged 'halonium' ions have been studied, and their total energies minimised with respect to the distance of the halogen atom from the CC bond centre. The calculations have indicated that the fluoronium ion should be of marginally greater stability than the 2 - fluoroethyl cation (3. 6 k cal mole(^- 1)) and this has been discussed in the light of published nmr studies of the ionisation of 2 -halo- 3 fluoro 2, 3 -dimethyl butanes in SO(_ 2) /SbF(_ 5). Results for the chloronium ion have indicated that this ion should be considerably more stable (15. 8 k cal mole(^- 1)) than the corresponding 2 - chloroethyl cation. Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Applications (ESCA) has been employed for the measurement of core binding energies in three series of closely related molecules (i) a series of acetyl compounds of general formula CH(_ 3) COX, X=H, CH(_ 3), OH, OCH(_ 3), NH(_ 2), NHCH(_ 3), COCH(_ 3), CO(_ 2) H, CN and OCOCH(_ 3). (ii) a series of five membered ring heterocycles. (iii) a series of pyrimidine bases and related compounds. Assignment of core levels has been accomplished in two ways, (i) Direct correlation of measured binding energies with orbital energies derived from SCF calculations, i. e. assuming Koopmans' theorem, (ii) Correlation of shifts in core binding energies with computed electron distributions within the molecule using the charge potential model. In general, assignments based upon the different methods have been found to be in agreement. Furthermore in the case of some members of the pyrimidine series comparison has been possible between charge potential assignments using both ab initio and CNDO/II populations. Agreement between the two sets has been complete...|$|E
