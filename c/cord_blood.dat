40|$|Background/PurposeInsulin-like {{growth factors}} (IGFs) and their binding {{proteins}} (IGFBPs) {{are known to}} modulate fetal growth but their role in intrauterine growth of monochorionic twins (MCT) has not been studied. MethodsCord venous blood was collected directly after birth. IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 3 in the <b>cord</b> venous <b>blood</b> were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Birth weights (BWs) were obtained electronically. Placentas were examined for chorionicity. ResultsCord blood was collected in 37 pairs of MCT (15 pairs were males). BWs ranged from 564 to 3240 g, and gestational ages (GAs) were between 24 weeks and 39 weeks. There was a correlation between BW and <b>cord</b> venous <b>blood</b> IGFBP- 3 concentration (r =  0. 28, p =  0. 015), but not between BW and <b>cord</b> venous <b>blood</b> IGF- 1 level. There {{was no difference in}} IGF- 1 between the heavier twins (30. 8  ±  61. 8  ng/mL) and lighter twins (33. 2  ±  63. 7  ng/mL), but a trend (p =  0. 096) of higher IGFBP- 3 level was demonstrated in heavier twins (3. 14  ±  1. 23  μg/mL) than in lighter twins (2. 71  ±  1. 19  μg/mL). The IGFBP- 3 levels were higher (p =  0. 042) in female twins (3. 20  ±  1. 33  μg/mL) than in male twins (2. 64  ±  1. 04  μg/mL). The IGF- 1 level of the heavier twins correlated significantly to their lighter co-twin (r =  0. 73, p <  0. 001). ConclusionOur data showed that <b>cord</b> venous <b>blood</b> IGF- 1 level might be controlled mainly by genetic factors. IGFBP- 3 might {{play an important role in}} fetal growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{causal link}} between {{psychological}} stress and cancer, if any, remains unclear (1 - 4).

On the other hand, studies in monozygotic twins, in archived neonatal blood spots of patients, and in normal newborn <b>cord</b> <b>bloods</b> suggest that most pediatric leukemias are initiated in utero.

40|$|Maternal {{exposure}} to tobacco smoke {{is known to}} have deleterious effects on the developing fetus, but it has only recently been shown that there may be life-long consequences due to genotoxic damage. Analysis of newborn <b>cord</b> <b>bloods</b> with the GPA somatic mutation assay demonstrates a significant effect of maternal active smoking and suggests that similar mutational induction occurs in mothers who experience only secondary {{exposure to}} environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Moreover, in both cases, mutational induction occurs by the same molecular mechanism, likely chromosome missegregation, resulting in an effective loss of one parental chromosome 4 and duplication of the other. These data also suggest that quitting smoking during pregnancy without actively avoiding secondary ETS exposure is not effective at protecting the unborn child from the genotoxic effects of tobacco smoke...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hematocrit {{levels were}} {{determined}} in 36 mothers living at high altitudes (3, 750 meters) and their infant <b>cord</b> <b>bloods</b> {{to determine the}} effect of maternal anemia on the infant. The arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) and respiratory rate of the infants were also followed during the first four months of life. There was a negative correlation between maternal hematocrit and infant hematocrit (rs - 0. 57). Nineteen babies born to anemic women (hematocrit < 41 %) had a significantly higher mean hematocrit (59. 9 %) than those born to non-anemic mothers (55. 8 %; P 0. 003). The SaO 2 levels and respiratory rates of infants were not different between infants born to non-anemic and anemic mothers. At high altitudes, infants from mothers with anemia have higher hematocrits than those born to non-anemic mothers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{long-term}} effects and pain relief mechanism of acupotomy by observing changes in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and beta-endorphin (β-EP) in the hypothalamus, spinal <b>cord,</b> and peripheral <b>blood</b> of rats with third lumbar vertebrae (L 3) transverse process syndrome. MethodsTwenty-eight SD rats {{were randomly assigned to}} normal, model, electroacupuncture (EA), and acupotomy group. The last three groups were put through an operation to emulate L 3 transverse process syndrome. Fourteen days after the simulation operation, EA and acupotomy treatments were applied to the respective groups. Fifty-six days after the simulation operation, biochemistry tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to measure NOS and β-EP in the hypothalamus, spinal <b>cord,</b> and peripheral <b>blood.</b> ResultsRats with the simulation operation showed significantly higher levels of NOS and β-EP in the hypothalamus, spinal <b>cord,</b> and peripheral <b>blood</b> than those in the normal group. The EA and acupotomy groups had significantly lower levels of NOS and β-EP than those in the model group. There was no statistical difference between the EA and acupotomy groups.

Allogeneic <b>cord</b> <b>blood</b> is stored frozen at a <b>cord</b> <b>blood</b> bank because it is only obtainable at the time of childbirth.

The effective sampling rate of the analysis is 30 /h, and less than 0. 05 ml of whole blood is required. Interference of haemoglobin with absorption by potassium ferricyanide at 420 nm is effectively exculded by dialysis.

40|$|Analysis of DNA from 852 Island Melanesians has {{revealed}} a high frequency of single- and triple-gamma-globin genes in this population. Homozygotes for triple- and single-gamma genes have normal hematologic findings, normal hemoglobin F (HbF) levels, {{and when there}} is coexisting alpha thalassemia, appropriate levels of Bart's Hb (gamma 4) at birth. In addition, we have identified an individual with a quadruple-gamma gene chromosome who also has a normal HbF level. All single-gamma genes were A gamma, all triple-gamma genes G gamma G gamma A gamma, and the quadruple-gamma gene G gamma G gamma G gamma A gamma. Analysis of G gamma:A gamma ratios in <b>cord</b> <b>bloods</b> and HbF levels in adults showed that these additional gamma genes are expressed and are down regulated appropriately by the fetal to adult Hb switch.

40|$|Three studies {{examined}} seasonal or circadian {{variations in}} selected responses to influenza infection or vaccination. The first, a seroepidemiologic study, evaluated temporal patterns of antibody titers to influenza A/Texas. Human umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>bloods</b> were sampled over {{a two-year period}} when the virus was not present in the community. No endogenous seasonal pattern was detected. The second study included three experiments on circadian rhythms in mice. Neither susceptibility nor protection from inactivated or attenuated vaccine varied significantly according to time of administration. A slight effect, however, was suggested with inactivated vaccine. Three human vaccine trials comprised the third study. Outcome variables included rise in antibody titer, final antibody titer, incidence of adverse reactions, and protection from community infection. Patterns in antibody response and protection variables were inconsistent, and generally not clinically significant. Local reactions to inactivated vaccine were more frequent if injections were received in the afternoon as compared to morning. This was true to adults that had been previously vaccinated. ...|$|R
