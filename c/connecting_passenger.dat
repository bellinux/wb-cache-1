5|$|The {{passenger}} transport to Mæl {{was performed by}} <b>connecting</b> <b>passenger</b> wagons to the freight trains. Up to ten trains were operated each direction each day, and up to five would correspond with the ferry; at Tinnoset trains would operate to Skien, and connection at Hjuksebø allowed for transport to Oslo Vestbanestasjon. In 1928 Norsk Transport and NSB agreed to operate a weekly night train service from Rjukan to Oslo; the service lasted until 1933. During the 1930s NSB and Norsk Hydro initiated an attempt to attract tourists to Rjukan, through discounted direct trains from Oslo, Drammen and Skien. They were taken up again after the war, and remained until 1969.|$|E

25|$|Cross Border Xpress (CBX), also {{referred}} to as the Tijuana Cross-border Terminal and the Puerta de las Californias, is an airport terminal located in San Diego, California, United States, with an access bridge connecting it to the Tijuana International Airport in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. It opened on December 9, 2015. It is the world's first true binational airport passenger terminal. Unlike the EuroAirport Basel–Mulhouse–Freiburg – which is entirely in France, despite being jointly administered with Switzerland – the CBX terminal is physically located in the United States but serves the Tijuana airport. A pedestrian bridge spans the United States–Mexico border, <b>connecting</b> <b>passenger</b> terminals between the two countries. It was the creation of Ralph Nieders, who introduced the concept and infrastructure design in Mexico City in 1989 and San Diego in 1990. The structural scheme is intended to allow greater access to flights out of Tijuana Airport for both domestic and international air carriers.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{commuter}} airlines in the United States got their start by operating Twin Otters in scheduled passenger operations. Houston Metro Airlines (which later {{changed its name}} to Metro Airlines) constructed their own STOLport airstrip with a passenger terminal and maintenance hangar in Clear Lake City, Texas, near the NASA Johnson Space Center. The Clear Lake City STOLport was specifically designed for Twin Otter operations. According to the February 1976 edition of the Official Airline Guide, Houston Metro operated 22 round-trip flights every weekday at this time between Clear Lake City (CLC) and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH, now Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport) in a scheduled passenger airline shuttle operation. Houston Metro had agreements in place for <b>connecting</b> <b>passenger</b> feed services with Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines at Houston Intercontinental, with this major airport having a dedicated STOL landing area at the time specifically for Twin Otter flight operations.
