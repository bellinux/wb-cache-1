5|$|Research {{has shown}} igneous {{rock from the}} Devonian period (around 400 million years ago) intrudes into the {{surrounding}} metamorphic schists; the intrusions {{take the form of}} a series of <b>concentric</b> <b>ring</b> dikes. The innermost of these, known as the Inner Granite, constitutes the southern bulk of the mountain above Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, and also the neighbouring ridge of Càrn Mòr Dearg; Meall an t-Suidhe forms part of the Outer Granite, which is redder in colour. The summit dome itself, together with the steep northern cliffs, is composed of andesite and basaltic lavas.|$|E

25|$|The more {{numerous}} B-24 groups used a standardized scheme for its four bomb wings. On outer tail fins, {{above and below}} the aircraft serial, two white circles were painted. In the upper circle was painted a geometric symbol in black denoting the wing, with a triangle for the 47th Bomb Wing, a square for the 55th, a diamond for the 304th, and a circle for the 49th. In practice that of the 49th, because of the type of stencil used, resembled the <b>concentric</b> <b>ring</b> bull's-eye of a target. The lower circle contained one of the numerals 1 through 4, painted in black, denoting the group.|$|E

This design of steerable <b>concentric</b> <b>rings</b> arrays considers the optimization of the amplitude and phase excitations across the antenna elements by using genetic algorithms. Some results obtained by simulation for a steerable <b>concentric</b> <b>rings</b> array are presented. The results shown in this paper present a good performance in the array factor response for the optimized design with evolutionary optimization...|$|R

25|$|The largest known crater is the {{enormous}} Caloris Basin, with {{a diameter of}} 1550km, A basin of comparable size, tentatively named Skinakas Basin had been postulated from low resolution Earth-based observations of the non-Mariner-imaged hemisphere, but has not been observed in MESSENGER imagery of the corresponding terrain. The impact which created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that its effects are seen on a global scale. It caused lava eruptions and left a <b>concentric</b> <b>ring</b> over 2km tall surrounding the impact crater. At the antipode of the Caloris Basin lies a large region of unusual, hilly and furrowed terrain, sometimes called “Weird Terrain”. The favoured hypothesis for {{the origin of this}} geomorphologic unit is that shock waves generated during the impact traveled around the planet, and when they converged at the basin’s antipode (180 degrees away) the high stresses were capable of fracturing the surface. A much less favoured idea was that this terrain formed {{as a result of the}} convergence of ejecta at this basin’s antipode. Furthermore, the formation of the Caloris Basin appears to have produced a shallow depression concentric around the basin, which was later filled by the smooth plains (see below).|$|E
25|$|Exposed {{within the}} {{interior}} of the Richat Structure are a variety of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites. The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and hydrothermally altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars. According to field mapping and aeromagnetic data, the gabbroic rocks form two <b>concentric</b> <b>ring</b> dikes. The inner ring dike is about 20m in width and lies about 3km from the center of Richat Structure. The outer ring dike is about 50m in width and lies about 7 to 8km from the center of this structure. Thirty-two carbonatite dikes and sills have been mapped within the Richat Structure. The dikes are generally about 300m long and typically 1 to 4m wide. They consist of massive carbonatites that are mostly devoid of vesicles. The carbonatite rocks have been dated as having cooled between 94 and 104million years ago. A kimberlitic plug and several sills have been found within {{the northern part of the}} Richat Structure. The kimberlite plug has been dated to around 99million years old. These intrusive igneous rocks are interpreted as indicating the presence of a large alkaline igneous intrusion that currently underlies the Richat Structure and created it by uplifting the overlying rock.|$|E
