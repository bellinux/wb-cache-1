40|$|Presented here is {{the second}} set of testing {{conducted}} by the Technology Validation Laboratory for Photonics at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on the 12 optical fiber ribbon cable with MTP array connector for space flight environments. In the first set of testing the commercial 62. 5 / 125 <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> was characterized using space flight parameters (published in SPIE Vol. 3440). [1] The testing showed that the <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> would survive a typical space flight mission {{with the exception of a}} vacuum environment. Two enhancements were conducted to the existing technology to better suit the vacuum environment as well as the existing optoelectronics and increase the reliability of the assembly during vibration. The MTP assembly characterized here has a 100 / 140 optical commercial fiber and non outgassing connector and cable components. The characterization for this enhanced fiber optic <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> involved vibration, thermal and radiation testing.

The study takes place in a manufacturing company specializing in fall protection equipment that has <b>cable</b> <b>assembly</b> operation as one of the major activities in the production of its finished goods. D. F. T. is a new business strategy based on Demand Flow Manufacturing techniques that help manufacturers to optimize the production system working in all the departments of the company.
