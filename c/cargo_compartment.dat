5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one for the driver and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the upper body was adapted for the vehicle's intended role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment,</b> one on each side, that opened to the outside. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the {{delivery}} of Australia's first C-17s, RAAF personnel received training on the aircraft in the United States. From May 2006 a group of pilots and loadmasters led by Wing Commander Linda Corbould, the commanding officer designate of No. 36 Squadron, undertook conversion training with the USAF's C-17 units at Altus Air Force Base and Charleston Air Force Base. A group of 48 technical personnel also received training at Charleston and McChord Air Force Base from September that year. No. 36 Squadron began a period of intensive training once Corbould delivered A41-206 to Amberley on 7 December 2006, and the unit achieved initial operating capability status in September 2007. Also in 2007, the RAAF's No. 1 Air Operations Support Squadron was expanded by 80 personnel to provide air load teams to support the Globemasters. A project to acquire the equipment needed to allow the RAAF's C-17s {{to be used in}} the aeromedical evacuation role and develop associated crew procedures began in late 2007. The first Globemaster aeromedical evacuation sortie was flown on 5 September 2008, the day after the type was certified to operate in this role. On 8 December 2008, Corbould led the RAAF's first all-female aircrew during a training flight over South East Queensland to mark the second anniversary of the entry of the Globemaster into service. A team of USAF trainers was posted to Amberley until the RAAF had sufficient C-17 pilots who were qualified to instruct others. The RAAF began training new C-17 pilots in early 2010 after the flight simulator was delivered, and the first Australian-trained pilots graduated in early May that year. No. 36 Squadron achieved final operating capability status in December 2011. The components for a simulated C-17 <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> were delivered to Amberley in early 2013, and this facility was commissioned in November that year. The simulator is used to train air movements and medical staff as well as to develop and trial new cargo carrying techniques for the C-17s. The first Australian-trained Globemaster loadmasters graduated in mid-2014. The final element of C-17 aircrew training to be routinely conducted in the United States was the course to qualify co-pilots as aircraft captains. This course was relocated to Australia in mid-2017.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the C-82, the cockpit was moved forward to fit flush with the nose rather than its previous location over the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment.</b> This resulted in more usable cargo space and larger loads than the C-82 could accommodate. The C-119 also featured more powerful engines, and a wider and stronger airframe. The first C-119 prototype (called the XC-82B) first flew in November 1947, with deliveries of C-119Bs from Fairchild's Hagerstown, Maryland factory beginning in December 1949.|$|E
25|$|Asiana Airlines Cargo Flight 991 (OZ991, AAR991) was a cargo flight which {{crashed into}} the Korea Strait on 28 July 2011. The two crew members aboard died. The {{aircraft}} involved, a Boeing 747-400F freighter, was operating Asiana Airlines' scheduled international cargo service from Incheon International Airport, South Korea to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, China. The crash occurred {{off the coast of}} Jeju Island after the crew reported a fire in the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> and had been attempting to divert to Jeju International Airport.|$|E
25|$|As of September 8, 2010, the GCAA and UPS had not {{commented on}} the {{progress}} of the investigation, but according to Associated Press sources, people familiar with the investigation were saying the fire may have started in the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> and that the investigators were checking the cargo to determine what was loaded on the aircraft. On September 8, 2010 the head of the GCAA, director general Saif al Suwaidi, said that it was still too early to determine exactly what the cause of the crash was.|$|E
5000|$|For {{narrow body}} {{aircraft}} (e.g. Boeing 737, 757), every checked bag is required to be manually transferred to the airplane <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> by carrier baggage handlers. Bags weigh an average of 32 lbs (14 kg) each, but many checked bags exceed the airline allowable weight of 50 lbs (23 kg). Manual lifting and handling of these bags is considered the main risk factor for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among baggage handlers. Other factors may {{increase the risk of}} WMSDs, including time pressure, and awkward and restricted postures in small <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments.</b> ~In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) studied the effectiveness of lifting assist devices and other control methods {{to reduce the risk of}} WMSDs ...|$|R
50|$|Extra axles {{may also}} be {{provided}} on shorter buses and coaches to accommodate extra equipment loads, such as passenger lifts, or comforts such as toilets, televisions, climate controls.

25|$|The Caravan {{interior}} can be {{outfitted with}} seats or as a <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment.</b> The standard high-density airline configuration has four rows of 1-2 seating behind the two {{seats in the}} cockpit. This variant is capable of holding up to thirteen passengers, although it is marketed as {{being able to make}} a profit carrying just four. The cabin can be configured in a low density passenger configuration, with 1-1 seating, as a combination of passengers and cargo, or as a strictly cargo aircraft. Many variants include an underbelly cargo pod, which can be used for additional freight capacity, or for passenger baggage. A number of Caravans are operated as skydiving aircraft with the left-side cargo hatch converted to a roll-up door.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, the Fairchild Aircraft Company {{undertook}} {{a study of}} new designs based on their Model 71. A decision to mount a parasol wing above the fuselage coupled with a rear cockpit position, clearly distinguished this model {{from the rest of}} the Fairchild 71 series, although the company designation maintained the family lineage. The choice of the unusual cockpit was predicated on the need to have a large front <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> as well as considering the load distribution in normal operation. In use, pilots found that forward vision was compromised to such an extent that few operators favoured the installation and when the Royal Canadian Air Force ordered the type, the specifications included a new cockpit position directly behind the engine.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, Alenia and Lockheed Martin began discussions {{to improve}} Alenia's G.222 using C-130J's glass cockpit {{and a more}} {{powerful}} version of the G.222's T64G engine and four-blade propellers. In 1996, a program began on an improved G.222, named C-27J; it used a U.S. military type designation based on the G.222's C-27A designation. In 1997, Alenia and Lockheed Martin formed Lockheed Martin Alenia Tactical Transport Systems (LMATTS) to develop the C-27J. The design changed to use the C-130J Super Hercules's Rolls-Royce AE 2100 engine and six-blade propeller. Other changes include a fully digital MIL-STD-1553 systems and avionics architecture, and an updated <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> for increased commonality.

The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen and a plate of armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.|$|E
