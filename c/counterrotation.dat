5000|$|The {{first to}} observe the wagon-wheel effect under truly {{continuous}} illumination (such as from the sun) was Schouten (1967). He distinguished three forms of subjective stroboscopy which he called alpha, beta, and gamma: Alpha stroboscopy occurs at 8-12 cycles per second; the wheel appears to become stationary, although [...] "some sectors spokes {{look as though they}} are performing a hurdle race over the standing ones" [...] (p. 48). Beta stroboscopy occurs at 30-35 cycles per second: [...] "The distinctness of the pattern has all but disappeared. At times a definite <b>counterrotation</b> is seen of a grayish striped pattern" [...] (pp. 48-49). Gamma stroboscopy occurs at 40-100 cycles per second: [...] "The disk appears almost uniform except that at all sector frequencies a standing grayish pattern is seen ... in a quivery sort of standstill" [...] (pp. 49-50). Schouten interpreted beta stroboscopy, reversed rotation, as consistent with there being Reichardt detectors in the human visual system for encoding motion. Because the spoked wheel patterns he used (radial gratings) are regular, they can strongly stimulate detectors for the true rotation, but also weakly stimulate detectors for the reverse rotation.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>counterrotation</b> is observed when two galaxy components have their angular momenta projected antiparallel onto the sky. It follows {{that if the}} two components rotate around the same axis, the <b>counterrotation</b> is intrinsic. On the contrary the <b>counterrotation</b> is only apparent if the rotation axes are misaligned and the line-of-sight lies in between the two vectors or their antivectors. In the case of intrinsic <b>counterrotation</b> the two components can be superimposed or radially separated. As far as the two components are concerned, stars are observed to counterrotate with respect to other stars or gas. The <b>counterrotation</b> of gas versus gas has been also detected. Up to now, the number of galaxies exhibiting these phenomena are ∼ 60, the morphological type of which ranges from ellipticals to S 0 's and to spirals. When a second event occurs in a galaxy, such as the acquisition of material from outside, {{it is likely that}} the resulting angular momentum of the acquired material is decoupled from the angular momentum of the preexisting galaxy. <b>Counterrotation</b> is therefore a general signature of material acquired from outside the main confines of the galaxy. Good examples of such cases are ellipticals with a dust lane or gaseous disk along the minor axis and polar ring galaxies, where the angular momenta are perpendicular. It should be noted that recently attempts have been made to explain special cases of stars versus stars <b>counterrotation</b> in disk galaxies as due to a self induced phenomenon in non-axisymmetric potentials.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} is an {{extension}} of the cooperative kinematics (CK) approach (Bahar, I.; Erman, B.; Monnerie, L. Macromolecules 1992, 25, 6309), which has been demonstrated to give an efficient and realistic account of the mechanism of local relaxational processes in polyethylene (PE). In the present work, the effects of (i) departure from tetrahedral backbone geometry and (ii) differences in torsional potentials of backbone bonds are addressed by considering cis- and trans-polybutadiene (PBD) chains. The method is based on the minimization of the atomic displacements of chain units and the torsional energy changes, succeeding the isomerization of a given bond. In contrast to the highly localized response of PE to bond rotational jumps, in which the strongest coupling between rotational motions was observed between second neighboring bonds, the coupling in PBD is shown to involve longer chain segments, embodying the strongly correlated torsions of third or fourth neighboring bonds along the chain. The mechanism of motion is unique for each type of rotating bond for cis and trans structures: In trans-PBD, strong <b>counterrotations</b> are encountered at the second neighboring bonds separated by a double bond, whereas in cis-PBD, the same pair of bonds undergoes coupled corotations. Orientational and translational motions of chain units located between successive double bonds are significantly affected by nonbonded intramolecular interactions in cis-PBD, while this effect is not seen in the trans structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mathematical}} formulation {{developed in}} the preceding paper is used to study the kinematics of polymer chains in a restrictive environment. Conformational and orientational correlations along the chain are analyzed. Calculations are performed by generating an initial configuration for a 25 -bond freely rotating chain, changing the dihedral angle for the middle bond, and studying the resulting changes {{in all of the}} degrees of freedom, internal and external. Results from Monte Carlo chains generated in this manner are averaged over a sufficient number of initial configurations. The following conclusions are reached (i) A change in the dihedral angle of a given internal bond in small steps up to f 120 ° is accommodated by the spatial readjustments of about three neighboring bonds on each of ita sides. Spatial configurations of more distant neighbors are negligibly affected. Thus, the conformational correlation length along the freely rotating chain extends over 6 - 8 bonds. (ii) In general, the rotational motion of a given bond is accompanied by <b>counterrotations</b> of ita first neighbors. (iii) The response of second neighbors is lightly stronger than that of the first neighbors on the average, though occurring randomly in the positive or negative sense. (iv) The kinematics of motion imply the potential occurrence of transitions of the form g*tt- ttg * and ttt- g*tgr, in agreement with previous predictions of Helfand.

The flowfield is {{compared with that of}} a reference aft-swept <b>counterrotation</b> geometry and Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) measurements.

The predicted radial distribution of the circumferentially averaged axial velocity at the measurement station agreed very closely with LDV data, while crossflow velocities showed poor agreement.

Experiments were conducted in the Langley 14 - by 22 -Foot Subsonic Tunnel with a sting-mounted, <b>counterrotation,</b> scale-model propeller and nacelle. Configurations had two rows of blades with combinations of 4 and 8 blades per hub. The solidity was varied by changing the number of blades on both rows. Tests were conducted for blade pitch settings of 31. 34 ffi, 36. 34 ffi, and 41. 34 ffi over a range of angle of attack from Γ 10 ffi to 90 ffi {{and a range of}} advance ratio from 0. 8 to 1. 4. The increase in propeller normal force with angle of attack is greater for propellers with higher solidity. 14. SUBJECT TERMS 15.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{determine}} head and trunk movement responses that occur in healthy 7 -year-old children during induced and self-induced lateral tilt. Twenty subjects, while tailor sitting on a tiltboard, participated in three trials of both induced and self-induced left and right lateral displacements. Measure-ments of neck and trunk lateral flexion; trunk counterrotation; and neck, trunk, and body anterior-posterior movement were obtained from slide transparencies made at three stages of tilt (original position, initial tilt, and full tilt). For each subject in the two test conditions, changes in these measurements between the stages of tilt were determined and compared. Based on the results of multivariate analysis of variance procedures, we concluded that 1) a significant difference in trunk <b>counterrotation</b> existed between the two types of tilt, with the greatest degree of <b>counterrotation</b> occurring with induced displacement; 2) no significant difference existed in neck or trunk lateral flexion; and 3) no significant differences existed in neck, trunk, or body anterior-posterior movement between tilts. We also found that a wide variability of response existed among the children ove...|$|E
40|$|Resent {{results of}} {{aerodynamic}} and acoustic research on both single and counter-rotation propellers are reviewed. Data and analytical {{results are presented}} for three propellers: SR- 7 A, the single rotation design used in the NASA Propfan Test Assessment (PTA); and F 7 -A 7, the 8 + 8 counterrotating design used in the proof-of-concept Unducted Fan (UDF) engine. In addition to propeller efficiencies, cruise and takeoff noise, and blade pressure data, off-design phenomena involving formation of leading edge vortices are described. Aerodynamic and acoustic computational results derived from three-dimensional Euler and acoustic radiation codes are presented. Research on unsteady flows, which are particularly important for understanding <b>counterrotation</b> interaction noise, unsteady loading effects on acoustics, and flutter or forced response is described. The first results of three-dimensional unsteady Euler solutions are illustrated for a single rotation propeller at an angle of attack and for a <b>counterrotation</b> propeller. Basic experimental and theoretical results from studies of the unsteady aerodynamics of oscillating cascades are outlined. Finally, advanced concepts involving swirl recovery vanes and ultra bypass ducted propellers are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} three-integral axisymmetric models for NGC 4649 and NGC 7097, addressing {{the question of}} the presence of dark matter in these elliptical galaxies. The data for NGC 7097 can be modeled without a dark matter halo. The central region of NGC 4649 could be hosting a black hole. The kinematical data of NGC 4649 are not inconsistent with a constant mass-to-light ratio model, but a dynamical model with a moderate amount of dark matter better reproduces the observed anisotropy on the major axis. In addition, we look more closely at the issue of the classification of elliptical galaxies. Both galaxies can be placed in different families of elliptical galaxies based on the isophote shape. In this paper we set out to investigate whether the kinematic information can be used to specify a second classification parameter. We propose the use of normalized distribution functions, which are the three-integral distribution functions divided by the two-integral model (constructed from photometry alone), and argue why this is an efficient way of presenting the dynamics of elliptical galaxies. We show that they can be used to characterize the rotational state of a galaxy in a more specific way than merely indicating the amount of rotation or <b>counterrotation.</b> Furthermore, the distribution function for NGC 7097 suggests that the <b>counterrotation</b> is caused by stars spread over large radii in the galaxy, implying that this phenomenon is not related to a compact group of stars. Hence, the origin of the <b>counterrotation</b> should not be found in a recent merger in the first place. This shows {{that it is important to}} construct dynamic models with a distribution function. The distribution function is the tool used to visualize structure in phase space, which is the only stellar dynamic remnant of galaxy formation...|$|E
