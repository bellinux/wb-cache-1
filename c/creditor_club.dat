40|$|In 1981 Poland lost {{ability of}} {{servicing}} its debt. Restructuring {{of the debt}} {{seemed to be the}} most important proposal of solution this problem. Restructuring of the debt is an instrument which was used to lessen the burden of the servicing of the debt. It consists in postponing of the payment due in a given year (or after several years - overdue payments) to a new period, with a new schedule being agreed upon. During the years 1981 - 1990 Poland signed five debt restructuring agreements with official <b>creditors</b> (Paris <b>Club)</b> and six agreements with commercial banks. Restructuring did not prove to be successful way of solution to our debt problem. It was only a rescheduling in time of the debt.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2016 season, AFL Victoria {{terminated}} the licence of the Frankston Football Club due to {{its financial}} position, which was no longer considered viable. The club had suffered a severe downturn in the profitability of its pokies licence over the previous few years, and by 2016 the machines were generating a loss for the club. The club terminated the pokies licence in May 2016, but by that time owed more than $1,500,000, both to the state gaming regulators and other <b>creditors.</b> The <b>club</b> went into voluntary administration in August, and the club's VFL licence was terminated the following month, in the week after the VFL Grand Final. The club's immediate existence was saved when creditors, including the gaming regulators, agreed to waive more than 90% of the club's debt, and it came out of administration in late November 2016, but was still excluded from the 2017 season. The club then embarked on a campaign to assure its long-term viability, which included signing up 1200 members and working to improve its relationship with the local leagues as a pathway for Mornington Peninsula footballers into state football. The club applied for and was re-granted its VFL licence for the 2018 season, meaning it will miss only one season of football.|$|R

Between April and May of that year, seven offers were received and considered for the purchase of the shares. The final vote of the 22 patrons of the VCF Foundation took place on May 17, 2014. After months of tough negotiations, the shares were sold on October 24, 2014 to Peter Lim, through his company, Meriton Holdings, which presently manages and directs Valencia CF.|$|R
40|$|Chapter 2 {{analyzes}} {{the political economy}} of delayed agreements over fiscal reforms, in a setting where two interest groups can bargain over the allocation {{of the cost of the}} stabilization, using an alternating offers model. This contrasts with Alesina and Drazen (1991), where the group that concedes earlier bears a fixed disproportionate share of the burden. This allows a systematic comparison of expected delay in the bargaining game, i. e., "the coalition government" and in the concession game, i. e., "the divided government". When interest groups are sufficiently patient, or when shares in the concession game are highly unequal, agreement is reached more quickly on average under bargaining. Both games have the common feature that delay signals the "toughness" of interest groups. Chapter 3 compares default incentives in competitive sovereign debt markets when leaders can be either democratically elected or dictators. When leaders can be replaced, the incentives for repayment are mainly the ego rents from office. In a dictatorship, the cost of defaulting is the permanent loss of reputation and the loss of future access to credit. There is a trade off between repayment and risk sharing under the state-contingent optimal contracts. We show that when ego rents are high and value of reputation to dictators is low, democracies have an incentive to repay more in good states and repay less in bad states. Thus the democratic leader defaults more often, improving risk-sharing. Chapter 4 examines {{the political economy of}} sovereign debt crises, using newly established data from 81 countries between 1975 and 2010. The empirical results validate that political factors matter for debt sustainability. I find that in a democracy, the parliamentary system is less likely to reschedule their external debt than a presidency, while rescheduling propensity of a country is increased by political instability. Also results show that public <b>creditors</b> (The Paris <b>Club)</b> tend to give a "democratic advantage" as a foreign assistance to democratic countries, in contrast with private <b>creditors</b> (The London <b>Club)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut Nigeria struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its Paris <b>Club</b> <b>creditors</b> reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{uncertainty}} and debt crisis on {{the dynamics of the}} Mozambican economy over the last two decades. Investment boom and accelerated growth did not take place until peace and economic reforms were assured, helped by the role of the Paris <b>Club</b> <b>creditors</b> as senior lenders, which averted the adverse impact of a debt overhang. Innovations to private consumption and to income are positively and strongly correlated. Current account has shown persistent deterioration while private consumption is not strongly correlated with uncertainty. These facts suggest that neither the permanent-income and life-cycle theories, nor the precautionary-saving and liquidity-constraint hypotheses can fully explain macroeconomic dynamics displayed by data. In light of this evidence, a simple dynamic model with stochastic income is presented. The model predicts that at low levels of wealth, uncertainty becomes unimportant in consumption decisions; and that when consumption is close to survival requirements, uncertainty drives the economy to wealth depletion...|$|R
