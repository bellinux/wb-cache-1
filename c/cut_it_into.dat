500|$|Wildebeest provide several {{useful animal}} products. The hide makes good quality leather and the flesh is coarse, dry and rather hard. Wildebeest are killed for food, {{especially}} to make biltong in Southern Africa. This dried game meat is a delicacy {{and an important}} food item in Africa. The meat of females is more tender than that of males, and is the most tender during the autumn season. Wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunters because their numbers make them easy to find. Cooks preparing the wildebeest carcass usually <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> 11 pieces. The estimated price for wildebeest meat was about US$0.47 per kilogram around 2008. The silky, flowing tail of the black wildebeest is used to make fly-whisks or [...] "chowries".|$|E

2500|$|November–December: Unidentified. The last {{victim to}} be killed by Nilsen in 1980 was an English [...] "long-haired hippy", aged between 25 and 30, whom he had met in the West End after the pubs had closed in November or December 1980. This victim's body was {{retained}} beneath the floorboards of the flat until Nilsen removed the corpse, <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> three pieces, then replaced the dissected remains beneath the floorboards. He burned the corpse one year later. Nilsen was to later claim to have fabricated this victim.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Greg Theakston {{started a}} fanzine called The Betty Pages and recounted tales of her life, {{particularly}} the camera club days. For {{the next seven}} years, the magazine sparked a worldwide interest in Page. Women dyed their hair and <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> bangs {{in an attempt to}} emulate the [...] "Dark Angel". The media caught wind of the phenomenon and wrote numerous articles about her, more often than not with Theakston's help. Since almost all of her photos were in the public domain, opportunists launched related products and cashed in on the burgeoning craze.|$|E
2500|$|On August 28, 1958, Kilby {{assembled}} the first prototype of an IC using discrete components and received approval for implementing it on one chip. He {{had access to}} technologies that could form mesa transistors, mesa diodes and capacitors based on p-n junctions on a germanium (but not silicon) chip, and the bulk material of the chip {{could be used for}} resistors. The standard Texas Instruments chip for the production of 25 (5×5) mesa transistors was 10×10mm in size. Kilby <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> five-transistor 10×1.6mm strips, but later used not more than two of them. On September 12, he presented the first IC prototype, which was a single-transistor oscillator with a distributed RC feedback, repeating the idea and the circuit in the 1953 patent by Johnson. On September 19, he made the second prototype, a two-transistor trigger. He described these ICs, referencing the Johnson's patent, in his [...]|$|E

2500|$|At {{about the}} same time as he was {{attending}} the Cambridge British Association meeting in 1862, instalments of Charles Kingsley's story for children The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby were being published in Macmillan's Magazine as a serial. Kingsley incorporated material modified from his skit about Dundreary's speech On the Great Hippocampus Question, as well as other references to the protagonists, the British Association, and notable scientists of the day. When the protagonist Tom is turned into a water-baby by the fairies, the question is raised that if there were water-babies, surely someone would have caught one and [...] "put it into spirits, or into the Illustrated News, or perhaps <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> two halves, poor dear little thing, and sent one to Professor Owen, and one to Professor Huxley, to see what they would each say about it."

2500|$|In {{order to}} adapt Pettibon's artwork {{to meet the}} layout {{requirements}} of their albums and flyers, the members of Black Flag would alter it by cutting and pasting and adding their name, logo, and gig details to it. They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls {{going out on a}} flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of paste onto a telephone pole, stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste so that it would last for up to a year. The band members and their crew would do this for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance. Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band's treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free. [...] "To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would come back to me scrawled upon and taped over or whited out, and I'd always ask nicely, 'Could you please make a copy of this first and then do that?' Their master tapes were deemed sacrosanct, while my work was seen as completely disposable, but I'm not venting or complaining, just stating fact." [...] Pettibon also felt pigeonholed by his association with the band, and had a falling out with them in 1985 over artwork used {{on the cover of the}} Loose Nut album, which had been used for a flyer several years earlier. Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer Bill Stevenson to do the layout, who <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, though his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band's career.|$|E
