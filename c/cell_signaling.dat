However, {{it is becoming increasingly}} apparent that mitochondria are intimately involved in <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> pathways. Mitochondria perform various signalling functions, serving as platforms to initiate <b>cell</b> <b>signalling,</b> as well as acting as transducers and effectors in multiple processes. Here, we discuss the active roles that mitochondria have in <b>cell</b> death <b>signalling,</b> innate immunity and autophagy. Common themes of mitochondrial regulation emerge from these diverse but interconnected processes. These include: the outer mitochondrial membrane serving as a major signalling platform, and regulation of <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> through mitochondrial dynamics and by mitochondrial metabolites, including ATP and reactive oxygen species.

Using automated sample preparation, fluorescent cellular barcoding and flow cytometry the platform is capable of detecting 21, 840 parallel <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> responses in each PBMC sample. We apply this platform to characterize the effects of neuropsychiatric treatments and CNS ligands on the T <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> repertoire. We apply it to define <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> network abnormalities in PBMCs from drug-naïve first-onset schizophrenia patients (n= 12) relative to healthy controls (n= 12) which are subsequently normalized in PBMCs from the same patients (n= 10) after a six week course of clinical treatment with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. We then validate the abnormal <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> responses in PBMCs from an independent cohort of drug-naïve first-onset schizophrenia patients (n= 25) relative to controls (n= 25) and investigate the specificity of the abnormal PBMC responses in schizophrenia as compared to major depression (n= 25), bipolar disorder (n= 25) and autism spectrum disorder (n= 25). Subsequently we conduct a phenotypic drug screen using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved compound library, in addition to experimental neuropsychiatric drug candidates and nutraceuticals, to identify compounds which selectively normalize the schizophrenia-associated <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> response.

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in the process of <b>cell</b> <b>signaling</b> and signal transduction. Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{a complex}} mixture of {{substances}} dissolved in water. Although water forms {{the large majority of}} the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as osmoregulation, <b>cell</b> <b>signaling,</b> and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of macromolecules, which can alter how molecules behave, through macromolecular crowding.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the polar}} lipids, the outer layer of MFGM {{contains}} {{a number of}} glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins. Proteomic analysis has revealed at least 191 different known proteins in human MFGM, and comparable numbers in bovine milk protein concentrates. While quantitatively these only represent 1% to 2% of total milk protein content, MFGM proteins are of significant interest because many {{are known to have}} bioactive and potentially beneficial properties; almost half of identified proteins have membrane/protein trafficking or <b>cell</b> <b>signaling</b> functions. The glycosylated proteins, including mucins (MUC-1, MUC-4, MUC-15), butyrophilin, lactadherin, and CD36, have been suggested to enhance triacylglyceride digestion efficiency.

5|$|The membrane-bound {{form of an}} {{antibody}} may {{be called}} a surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg). It {{is part of the}} B cell receptor (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation. The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimers, which are capable of signal transduction. A typical human B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface. Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other <b>cell</b> <b>signaling</b> receptors.|$|E
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} <b>cell</b> <b>signaling,</b> particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} has emerged showing that lipid signaling {{is a vital}} part of the <b>cell</b> <b>signaling.</b> Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.|$|E

5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD is also {{consumed in}} ADP-ribose transfer reactions. For example, enzymes called ADP-ribosyltransferases add the ADP-ribose moiety of this molecule to proteins, in a posttranslational modification called ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation involves either {{the addition of}} a single ADP-ribose moiety, in mono-ADP-ribosylation, or the transferral of ADP-ribose to proteins in long branched chains, which is called poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Mono-ADP-ribosylation was first identified as the mechanism of a group of bacterial toxins, notably cholera toxin, but it is also involved in normal <b>cell</b> <b>signaling.</b> Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is carried out by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. | journal = FEBS J. | volume = 272 | issue = 18 | pages = 4576–89 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16156780 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04864.x }} The poly(ADP-ribose) structure is involved in the regulation of several cellular events and is most important in the cell nucleus, in processes such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance. In addition to these functions within the cell, a group of extracellular ADP-ribosyltransferases has recently been discovered, but their functions remain obscure.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, <b>cell</b> <b>signaling,</b> and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are an {{essential}} component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including <b>cell</b> <b>signaling,</b> molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act {{as a type of}} skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.|$|E

This article suggests that the performance of <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> pathways taken as a whole has similarities to that of the parallel distributed process networks (PDP networks) used in computer-based pattern recognition. Using the response of hepatocytes to glucagon as an example, a procedure is described by which a PDP network could simulate a <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> pathway. This procedure involves the following steps: (a) a bounded set of molecules is defined that carry the signals of interest; (b) each of these molecules is represented by a PDP-type of unit, with input and output functions and connection weights corresponding to specific biochemical parameters; (c) a "learning algorithm " is applied in which small random changes are made in the parameters of the <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> units and the new network is then tested by a selection procedure in favour of a specific input-output relationship. The analogy with PDP networks shows how living cells can recognize combinations of environmental influences, how cell responses can be stabilized and made resistant to damage, and how novel <b>cell</b> <b>signalling</b> pathways might appear during evolution...|$|R
