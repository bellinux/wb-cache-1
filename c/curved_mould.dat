40|$|Crystallisation of NH 4 Cl from aqueous {{solutions}} {{has been}} used to examine grain formation in a configuration similar to that existing in the <b>curved</b> <b>mould</b> of a continuous, steel casting machine. The observations show how falling equiaxed crystals accumulate at the lower (outer) columnar front earlier than at the upper (inner) front and, thus, lead to an asymmetric grain structure. The usefulness of the aqueous system as a realistic model for steel casting is discussed in terms of relative temperature profiles, materials properties, and observed columnar and eutectic growth rates...|$|E
40|$|The draping {{process of}} {{non-crimp}} fabrics (NCF) on a doubly <b>curved</b> <b>mould</b> determines the fibre distribution {{and hence the}} processing and performance of the NCF product. A composite Finite Element (FE) model is developed to simulate the draping process of NCFs on arbitrary geometries. Tool-part interaction is taken into account. Problem regions with possible fibre buckling can be indicated and the fibre distribution in the final NCF is predicted. The model contains a novel modelling approach to simulate the slip of the individual fibre layers. Additional layers and degrees of freedom were added to a membrane element to simulate the slipping layers with one element through the thickness. This enables efficient FE simulations of the draping process. Several experiments were performed: measurement of the thickness change during shear deformation, fibre pull-out experiments and a drape experiment. The latter is compared with FE simulations...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the results of the numerical calculations concerning the influence of the placing of the developing gaseous gap in a mould based on the thickness of the forming shell, and the temperature distribution on the strand length. A cast slab with dimensions of 1100 mm x 220 mm was analysed. The calculations were performed on various heights of the formation of the gap in the mould. Other process parameters, i. e. the casting speed, melt temperature, and the cooling intensity in the secondary cooling zone, were maintained at a constant level. Design/methodology/approach: The numerical model of the steel continuous casting process, developed with the ProCAST software was used. In the study the effect of the height of the air gap development was examined for five variants. In the heat transfer in the gap model, two basic heat transfer mechanisms were assumed: by radiation and by conductivity. Findings: The numerical model of the steel continuous casting process with influence of the placing of the developing gaseous gap in a mould was developed. The verification of the calculation results obtained, after conducting a number or mathematical simulations, concerned the shell thickness and its dependence on the height of the air gap. The simulation of the temperature distribution was made for the whole strand. Research limitations/implications: The numerical model of the steel continuous casting process, with the <b>curved</b> <b>mould</b> should be used to determine the influence of the placing of the developing gaseous gap. Practical implications: The results of the numerical calculations with heat transfer model, concerning the influence of the placing of the developing gaseous gap in a mould based on the thickness of the forming shell, and the temperature distribution on the strand length. Originality/value: The calculations were performed on various heights of the formation of the gap in the mould using ProCAST software. The calculated temperature distribution was verified on the basis of an industrial database...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of free form building stagnated, {{due to the}} high construction cost of it. Double curved surfaces are only applied at projects with a high profile and projects above average budget during years. The problem with double curved surfaces is mainly the formwork. The present days used techniques to construct these formworks are statically. For example: wooden, steel or milled EPS formwork could only be used for one shaped elements. The lack of repetition and so the reusability of the formwork, which means that for a free form surface for every element a unique formwork is needed, makes the construction very expensive. A feasible way for mass production of unique shaped double curved elements could be achieved by a flexible formwork: a formwork that can be adjusted in every desired shape. It consists of a flexible layer that can be deformed into the desired curved surface by adjusting for example pistons, actuators or pins. Recently K. Huyghe and A. Schoofs have executed a series of experiments with a flexible formwork, build earlier by D. Rietbergen and Dr. Ir. K. Vollers. The purpose of this master thesis was to solve more aspects of the flexible formwork, {{and to make it}} a feasibly system. The main focus was the behavior of the flexible layer, at some places the flexible layer did not though the actuators. Predicting the behavior of the deformed flexible layer makes an accurate production possible. To be able to determine the behavior of the flexible layer some models are proposed. With these models the reaction forces at the supports could be determined, compression forces means that the flexible layer though the supports. The first model that is proposed, is for a single curved element. For the double <b>curved</b> <b>mould</b> surface two models are proposed, a plate model and a strip model. With tests at the Stevin Laboratory these models are verified, and some other aspects are tested, for example the flexible border of the formwork. Tests indicate that a plate is not suitable for the flexible layer, it buckles due to the plate stresses. The strip mould consists of two layers of strips, perpendicular to each other. The top layer of the strips is the mould surface. Tests showed {{that it is possible to}} produce double curved elements with the strip mould. Conclusions and recommendations. The models that are proposed in this thesis describe the behavior of the flexible layer well. A plate does not fulfil the function of a flexible layer. Tests have shown that it is possible to produce double curved elements with the strip mould as flexible layer. To cover the strips an additional layer is needed. In these tests polyether is used, as well for the borders. The protection of the polyether with sealant made the concrete element very rough. Another material has to be found as elastic layer, or to protect the polyether. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Curved glass can {{be applied}} in an {{interesting}} way in e. g. facades and canopies. Traditionally, curved glass is manufactured from float glass that is heated above the weakening point and formed in a heavy <b>curving</b> <b>mould.</b> Since this technique is time- and energy consuming and consequently relatively expensive. For this reason, a more affordable alternative has been developed. The technique is called a “cold bending process ” because {{it is used to}} bend glass plates on the building site at room temperature. The process implies that toughened float glass laminates are gradually bent on a curved frame. Finally, the newly curved panel is mechanically fixed to the frame, which implies that the glass is continuously subjected to bending stresses during its lifetime. In this contribution, time dependent loading-deformation interaction during the bending process as well as relaxation after the bending process are closely examined. An experimental and a numerical research method have been used in a complementary way...|$|R

During the material solidification, mechanical vibration, {{in the range}} of 0 - 41 times the gravity acceleration, g, has been applied to a steel die. It has been observed that vibrations can promote a quite homogeneous SiC dispersion on macroscopic scale. On the other hand, by using too high vibrations’ intensity, segregation phenomena have been pointed out in the castings. Furthermore, it has been evidenced that the reinforcement distribution is influenced by mechanical entrapment of the particles at grain boundaries and in the interdendritic channel. The metallographic analysis has emphasized a finer microstructure with increasing vibrations’ intensity.

40|$|Materials {{that are}} stored or used in damp {{conditions}} {{may be subject}} to mould growth. However, all materials are not equally susceptible; for each specific material, there is a critical moisture level for mould growth. If this is exceeded, there is a risk that mould fungi will develop on the material. This level can be determined in accelerated laboratory tests, at constant temperatures and relative humidity (RH) favourable to mould growth. Within a building however, these parameters are expected to vary from one part of the construction to another, and are seldom constant; there is fluctuation in temperature and RH due to seasonal or shorter-term variations. In this study, test pieces of the same materials tested in a laboratory environment were placed in three outdoor ventilated crawl spaces and three outdoor ventilated attics, where the temperature and RH varied, and mould growth on the test pieces was studied over 2. 5 years. Material-specific <b>mould</b> growth <b>curves</b> were produced based on critical moisture levels, as determined in laboratory experiments under constant temperature and RH.
