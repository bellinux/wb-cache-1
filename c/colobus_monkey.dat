25|$|The {{success of}} Life on Earth {{prompted}} the BBC {{to consider a}} follow-up, and five years later, The Living Planet was screened. This time, Attenborough built his series around the theme of ecology, the adaptations of living things to their environment. It was another critical and commercial success, generating huge international sales for the BBC. In 1990 The Trials of Life completed the original Life trilogy, looking at animal behaviour through the different stages of life. The series drew strong reactions from the viewing public for its sequences of killer whales hunting sea lions on a Patagonian beach and chimpanzees hunting and violently killing a <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as colobus monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a <b>colobus</b> <b>monkey</b> high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing {{with other members of}} the troop in response to begging behaviours. The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year. This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.|$|E

On May 15, 2008, a baby gorilla was born to Zuri. Zookeepers looked through more than 1,400 entries for the baby's name, and on July 2, 2008, she was given the name Yewande (Yu-wan-day), a Nigerian name that would be given to a girl {{after the death of}} an elder in the family.

60|$|And what {{a figure}} he {{presented}} {{as he stood}} there in his savage war-gear! Accustomed as I have been to savages all my life, I {{do not think that}} I have ever before seen anything quite so ferocious or awe-inspiring. To begin with, the man was enormously tall, quite as tall as Umslopogaas, I should say, and beautifully, though somewhat slightly, shaped; but with the face of a devil. In his right hand he held a spear about five and a half feet long, the blade being two and a half feet in length, by nearly three inches in width, and having an iron spike {{at the end of the}} handle that measured more than a foot. On his left arm was a large and well-made elliptical shield of buffalo hide, on which were painted strange heraldic-looking devices. On his shoulders was a huge cape of hawk's feathers, and round his neck was a 'naibere', or strip of cotton, about seventeen feet long, by one and a half broad, with a stripe of colour running down the middle of it. The tanned goatskin robe, which formed his ordinary attire in times of peace, was tied lightly round his waist, so as to serve the purposes of a belt, and through it were stuck, on the right and left sides respectively, his short pear-shaped sime, or sword, which is made of a single piece of steel, and carried in a wooden sheath, and an enormous knobkerrie. But perhaps the most remarkable feature of his attire consisted of a headdress of ostrich-feathers, which was fixed on the chin, and passed in front of the ears to the forehead, and, being shaped like an ellipse, completely framed the face, so that the diabolical countenance appeared to project from a sort of feather fire-screen. Round the ankles he wore black fringes of hair, and, projecting from the upper portion of the calves, to which they were attached, were long spurs like spikes, from which flowed down tufts of the beautiful black and waving hair of the <b>Colobus</b> <b>monkey.</b> Such was the elaborate array of the Masai Elmoran who stood watching the approach of our two canoes, but it is one which, to be appreciated, must be seen; only those who see it do not often live to describe it. Of course I could not make out all these details of his full dress on the occasion of this my first introduction, being, indeed, amply taken up with the consideration of the general effect, but I had plenty of subsequent opportunities of becoming acquainted with the items that went to make it up.|$|E
40|$|The prime aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the welfare of Abyssinian <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> (<b>Colobus</b> guereza kikuyuensis) held in captivity, by behavioural, endocrinological and parasitological approaches. Five groups of <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> were studied, in the UK at Port Lympne Zoo, Banham Zoo and Paignton Zoo (separate male and female groups) and in France at La BoissiÃƒÂ¨re du DorÃƒÂ© Zoo. Overall, the patterns of behavioural activity for captive <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> agree with observations of wild <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys,</b> suggesting that there was generally good welfare at all zoos. However, local differences in group composition (i. e. age and gender) or management practices were shown to affect activity budgets. At Banham Zoo, where <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> had access to a large paddock and food was offered only twice a day, animals spent significantly more time foraging/feeding than other groups which received three meals a day. At Paignton Zoo (adult male only group) animals spent more time resting alone and less time resting socially or being social than other zoos. Generally, across zoos, older, higher ranking animals spent less time moving and more time feeding than younger, more subordinate ones. Social dominance rank and linearity of the hierarchy in the five groups of colobus was determined. Large mixed groups of <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> including both males and females displayed strong linear dominance hierarchies, but in single sex groups, the strength of the hierarchy was found to depend on local events and group composition. Generally, male <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> displayed most of the dominance behaviour, however, females were an integral part of the dominance hierarchy with unidirectional dominant behaviour between both genders in large mixed groups. Factors such as life history, which may influence social dominance ranking, were investigated. Index of success (another measurement of dominance rank) was mainly explained by age and gender. Social behaviours such as play behaviour and grooming were also associated with ranking. Older, more dominant animals were more often the recipient of grooming behaviour whereas younger more subordinate animals spent more time playing [...] Faecal egg counts of the intestinal nematode parasite, Trichuris trichiura, were investigated in relation to individual index of success, age, gender, and husbandry practices at each zoo. No significant differences in egg count were observed between genders. Egg count was explained by the index of success and anti-helmintic practices at zoos. The highest count of eggs were observed at La BoissiÃƒÂ¨re du DorÃƒÂ© Zoo, probably due to the fact animals were locked in for several months in the winter, therefore favouring re-infection of infective larvae. The lowest count of Trichuris egg was at Paignton Zoo female group, who had the largest enclosure, with very low animal density. Counts of eggs were at their lowest in the winter compared to other season of the year. Differences between zoos seem to result from anti-helmintic practices coupled with the influence of enclosure size and husbandry regimes. Faecal glucocorticoids and their metabolites, in <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> held in the five groups, were measured by radioimmunoassay and investigated in relation to index of success, levels of aggression, gender, age and reproductive status of females. The overall dominant animals in various groups had higher levels of faecal glucocorticoids. Males had significantly lower faecal glucocorticoid than females, and pregnant females had higher levels than others. The older, higher ranking <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> initiated significantly more acts of aggression than younger, lower ranking animals. Seasonal variation in faecal cortisol equivalents were observed in the autumn where higher levels were recorded compared to other seasons. Comparison of faecal content of cortisol equivalents of the different groups showed the lowest levels at Port Lympne Zoo and Banham Zoo while the highest levels were at Paignton Zoo (female groups). This suggests that the large multi-male, multi-female groups had the lowest levels of stress and associated high levels of welfare. These studies lead to the recommendation that single sex groups of captive Abyssinian <b>colobus</b> <b>monkeys</b> should be avoided, particularly when this involves breaking down the social structure of established groups. n/...|$|R
