40|$|The {{notion that}} global {{agricultural}} output needs to double by 2050 is oft repeated. Using a new International Agricultural Prospects (iAP) Model, to project global agricultural consumption and production, {{we find in}} favour of a future where aggregate agricultural <b>consumption</b> (<b>in</b> <b>tonnes)</b> increases more modestly, by around 69 per cent (1. 3 per cent per year) from 2010 to 2050. The principal driver of this result is a deceleration in population growth in the decades ahead. Per capita income growth and changing demographics (generally ageing population) have significant but secondary roles in spurring growth in agricultural consumption, as does our projected growth {{in the use of}} agricultural feedstocks to meet the growth we envisage in biofuel demand. Worldwide (but not equally everywhere), crop yield growth has generally slowed over the past decade or so. Notwithstanding a projected continuance of this slowdown, the prospective improvements in crop productivity are still sufficient to reduce per capita cropland use, such that land devoted to crops would need to increase by less than 10 per cent. Even in our upper-bound (highconsumption) scenario, we estimate that there remains sufficient productive agricultural land to more than meet the demand without ploughing-in additional forestdominated lands.

30|$|In 2003, {{fuel and}} {{emission}} efficiency were 0.031 – 0.044  kg of oil equivalent per tonne kilometer and 91.1 – 127.5  g of CO 2 equivalent per tonne kilometer respectively. Compare to 1997 data, {{there was a}} small improvement of impact of transport operations on the environment during the studied period (Table 3). The improvement was due to technological development of new vehicles. Fuel and emission efficiency indicators were obtained relating the absolute indicators, fuel <b>consumption</b> <b>in</b> <b>tonnes</b> oil equivalent (toe) and tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (tCO 2 e), to transport work expressed as tonne kilometers [29]. The fuel consumption is estimated from the running kilometers considering: an average consumption value of 0.25 – 0.35  l/km in 2003 and 1997 [26, 29, 30], and using the equivalences of 41.87 petajoules per mtoe and 38.66 megajoules per liter of diesel [31]. The tCO 2 e are directly estimated from the toe using the equivalence of 0.345 toe per tCO 2 e [31]. With the range of values, uncertainties of fuel and emission efficiencies were bounded and sensitivity analysis of the estimates could be calculated. Conversion equivalences are kept constant. Therefore, the fuel and emission efficiency values given in this paper are representative of mean conditions and must be used exclusively as reference values.|$|E

5000|$|The German {{government}} target {{under the}} National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency is specified {{in terms of}} energy productivity relative to gross domestic product (GDP). Under the plan, the German government offers an average annual increase of 2.1% in macroeconomic energy productivity from 2008 to 2020. Assuming an annual increase in GDP of 1.1%, this represents {{a reduction in the}} energy-related share of primaryenergy <b>consumption</b> (<b>in</b> million <b>tonnes</b> crude oil equivalent) from [...] in 2008 to [...] in 2020.

40|$|We {{compute the}} {{fertilizer}} use in corn, cotton, soybeans, and rapeseed {{in the period}} from 1990 to 2010 {{for a set of}} selected countries.

The resulting allocation of fertilizer among crops {{is a function of the}} country’s nutrients total use, the country’s cropped areas, crop world prices, and crop- and country-specific fertilizer application rates for some years. In this report we show results on fertilizer consumption by crop for the top fertilizer consuming countries, and a downloadable MS Excel file “FertilizerDemandByCropData. xls” shows the complete set of results...|$|R
40|$|Global warming {{has become}} a {{worldwide}} concern {{over the past few}} decades. This study aims to identify whether the use of natural fibres as reinforcement for composites is truly environmentally beneficial when judged against manmade fibres with respect to energy consumption (leading to carbon emissions). Energy used by agricultural equipment in ploughing, sowing, applying fertiliser, pesticides, desiccation and harvesting and is used to produce fertiliser, pesticides and desiccant. Energy is also used in fibre processing stages of rippling, retting, decortication, carding and spinning. These processes are carried out using heavy machinery. The aim is to determine the total energy <b>consumption</b> <b>in</b> obtaining 1 <b>tonne</b> of flax <b>in</b> a form that can be used as reinforcement for composites and to establish best practice in each stage of the agricultural process. If alternative minimum impact methods were to be adopted, how great a reduction could be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The International Energy Agency (IEA) datasets published by the Energy Statistics Division (ESD) contain annual and quarterly time series data from 1960 onwards on energy production, trade, stocks, transformation, consumption, prices and taxes {{as well as on}} greenhouse gas emissions for the 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Member countries and over 100 non-OECD countries worldwide. In OECD Member countries the data are collected by official bodies (most often the national statistics office in each country) from firms, government agencies and industry organisations and are then reported to the IEA using questionnaires to ensure international comparability. In non-OECD countries the data are collected directly from government and industry contacts and from national publications. Projections: Energy Policies of IEA Countries: This dataset contains projections for 28 IEA countries that are collected directly from the Member countries for the series on Energy Policies of IEA Countries. The assumptions used to compile these forecasts vary depending on the country and are not documented centrally by the IEA. These forecasts {{are not part of the}} World Energy Outlook model. Energy balances are provided for supply and <b>consumption</b> <b>in</b> million <b>tonnes</b> of oil equivalent (Mtoe). Definitions of products and flows, explanatory notes on the individual country data, indicators (including GDP and population) are included. Where available, data are given for 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030, 2035 and 2040. This database was first made available by the UK Data Service in 2012 and is updated annually. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on its IEA Projections: Energy Policies of IEA Countries database, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates.
