50|$|When an H.323 <b>call</b> is <b>connected,</b> <b>signaling</b> {{defined in}} H.245 {{is used to}} {{establish}} the set of capabilities for all connected endpoints and MCUs. When the set of capabilities includes an indication that H.239 presentations are supported, a connected endpoint can choose to open an additional video channel. First the endpoint has to request a token from the MCU. The MCU then will check if there is another endpoint currently sending an additional video channel. The MCU will use token messages to make this endpoint stop sending the additional video channel. Then the MCU will acknowledge the token request from the first endpoint which then can begin to send the additional video channel which e.g. contains encoded video from a computer's video output at XGA resolution.|$|R
