5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, <b>Canada</b> <b>jay,</b> or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A fairly large songbird, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E

50|$|The Wheeler Peak Wilderness {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of birds and mammals. Marmots, pikas, bighorn sheep, and golden eagles are year-round residents. Rocky Mountain elk, mule deer dwell in the area during the summer season, feeding on grasses and new aspen growth in the higher elevations. Although bighorn sheep are native to the area, the local {{population}} was re-introduced to the area in 1993. Other local avian fauna include many common rocky mountain species such magpies, <b>Canada</b> <b>jays,</b> chickadees and woodpeckers.|$|R
50|$|Jays (Perisoreus) are {{believed}} to be the first birds in which mycophagy was recorded. <b>Canada</b> <b>jays</b> (P. canadensis), Siberian jays (P. infaustus) and Oregon jays (P. obscurus) have all been recorded to eat mushrooms, with the stomachs of Siberian jays containing mostly fungi in the early winter. The ascomycete, Phaeangium lefebvrei found in north Africa and the Middle East is eaten by migrating birds in winter and early spring, mainly be species of lark (Alaudidae). Bedouin hunters have been reported to use P. lefebvrei as bait in traps to attract birds.|$|R
6000|$|CLASS IV. When {{the adult}} male {{resemble}}s the adult female, the young {{of both sexes}} in their first plumage resemble the adults.—In this class {{the young and the}} adults of both sexes, whether brilliantly or obscurely coloured, resemble each other. Such cases are, I think, more common than those in the last class. We have in England instances in the kingfisher, some woodpeckers, the jay, magpie, crow, and many small dull-coloured birds, such as the hedge-warbler or kitty-wren. But the similarity in plumage between the young and the old is never absolutely complete, and graduates away into dissimilarity. Thus the young of some members of the kingfisher family are not only less vividly coloured than the adults, but many of the feathers on the lower surface are edged with brown,[255]—a vestige probably of a former state of the plumage. Frequently in the same group of birds, even within the same genus, for instance in an Australian genus of parrokeets (Platycercus), the young of some species closely resemble, whilst the young of other species differ considerably from their parents of both sexes, which are alike.[256] Both sexes and the young of the common jay are closely similar; but in the <b>Canada</b> <b>jay</b> (Perisoreus canadensis) the young differ so much from their parents that they were formerly described as distinct species.[257] ...|$|E

About 99. 8 % of these spores carried the nutritional markers of either {{one or the other}} of the two parents.

40|$|Gregory, Kenneth F. (Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph, Ontario, <b>Canada),</b> and <b>Jay</b> C. C. Huang. Tyrosinase {{inheritance}} in Streptomyces scabies. II. Induction of tyrosinase deficiency by acridine dyes. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 1287 – 1294. 1964. —Growth in minimal medium containing 1 μg of acriflavine per ml {{resulted in}} a large increase (up to 62 %) {{in the frequency of}} tyrosinase-deficient (tye−) mutants in all of ten strains of Streptomyces scabies and eight unidentified streptomycetes studied. This increased frequency did not result from the selection of preformed mutants, since tye− clones were usually inhibited by lower concentrations of acriflavine than were tyrosinase-producing (tye+) clones, and no significant difference in mycelial yields occurred between the two types growing in a 1 μg/ml concentration of the dye. The mutations induced by X rays and acriflavine were either allelic or closely linked. This tye− phenotype was not caused by the production of an enzyme inhibitor, lack of a cofactor, or defect in the conversion of a protyrosinase to tyrosinase. Tye− mutants formed no detectable tyrosinase under a variety of conditions, including the presence of possible inducers. Mutants were able to oxidize glucose and succinate. The S. scabies tyrosinase was heat-labile (half-life at 59 C = 1. 6 min) and not particle-bound. We conclude that acriflavine induces the loss of, or alteration in, a structural gene for tyrosinase production present as an extrachromosomal factor...|$|R
