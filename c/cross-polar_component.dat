Starting from an initial set of possible positions, the proposed algorithm iteratively solves a sequence of convex optimization problems. At each iteration a suitable objective function is minimized, which allows {{to reduce the number of}} radiating elements, among those of the initial set, in presence of constraints on the far-field co-polar and cross-polar patterns. The adopted formulation leads to a second order cone problem (SOCP), which is iteratively solved with CVX, a Matlab-based modeling system developed at the Stanford University and available on the Internet...|$|E
40|$|This {{communication}} aims {{to demonstrate}} both theoretically and experimentally that chipless tags can be efficiently detected on metallic platforms by exploiting cross-polar reflection. The employed tag {{consists of a}} frequency selective surface (FSS) comprising concentric square loop resonators printed on a grounded dielectric slab. The co-polar reflection amplitude of the proposed structure is characterized by deep minima in correspondence of every resonance, whereas the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>component</b> of the reflection coefficient exhibits well defined frequency selective maxima. Since each resonance is determined by a specific concentric loop, the presence or {{the absence of a}} loop is used to apply an amplitude modulation on the reflected signal. Measurements on realized prototypes are also provided to assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of fast methods aimed {{to generate a}} far-field amplitude pattern having prescribed characteristics and able to operate on conformal arrays is a fundamental topic in antenna array synthesis. In fact, in many practical applications the array has to be mounted on surfaces of various shapes, {{such as those of}} terrestrial vehicles, aircrafts, satellites and others. For such arrays, the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>component</b> of the far-field may be comparable with the co-polar one also when linearly polarized elements are used in the array. Thus, some synthesis methods have been proposed to reduce the cross-polarization. This paper presents a fast iterative method for 3 D pattern synthesis of conformal arrays that is able to generate a desired co-polar pattern simultaneously reducing the cross-polar one...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} and capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels {{are limited by}} the spatial fading correlation between antenna elements. This limitation {{is due to the}} use of mono polarized antennas at receiver and transmitter sides. In this paper, {{in order to reduce the}} antenna correlation, the polarization diversity technique is employed. Although the spatial antenna correlation is attenuated for multi-polarization configurations, the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>components</b> appear. This paper highlights the impact of depolarization effect on the MIMO channel capacity for a 4 &amp;amp;# 215; 4 uniform linear antenna array. We assume that the channel is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver so that equal power is distributed to each of the transmit antennas. The numerical results illustrate that for low depolarization and spatial correlation, the capacity of single-polarization configuration behaves better than that of multi-polarization configuration...|$|R
40|$|A small {{truncated}} waveguide fed by a microstrip {{line through}} a transverse coupling slot is proposed and assessed as a high-performance antenna and array {{element in the}} K band and above. This antenna allows to obtain a high radiated power, with a very low <b>cross-polar</b> <b>component</b> in the radiated field. It is therefore particularly suitable for application in automotive anticollision radars. The proposed radiating element has been analyzed by a numerical code based on an in-house method of moments, and the microstrip feeding line has been modeled by its equivalent magnetic-wall waveguide. A linear array of such elements has been designed and matched with a BPF-inspired matching network allowing an in-band behavior suitable for anti-collision radar use, with an out-of-band rejection large enough to avoid the first receiving BPF...|$|E

The {{analysis of the}} presented antenna has been performed by replacing the feeding microstrip line with its equivalent Magnetic-Wall Waveguide (MWW) model and using an in-house Method of Moments (MoM) to analyze the structure. The use of entire-domain basis functions both on the slot and on the truncated waveguide apertures allows to obtain a very efficient analysis by exploiting the waveguide modes orthogonality. The proposed radiating element allows to obtain a high radiated power, with a very low <b>cross-polar</b> <b>component</b> in the radiated field, with a - 10 dB bandwidth that covers the required frequencies for multi-band WLAN applications (5. 2 / 5. 4 / 5. 8 GHz) ...|$|E

First, the half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) and magnetic wall {{are introduced to}} realize the miniaturization of Yagi antenna. Simulated results shows that the total area of the Yagi antenna is 1. 82 λ× 0. 57 λ and the peak gain is about 6. 0 ~ 7. 9 dBi in the 10. 5 % relative bandwidth.

40|$|Abstract A time-domain {{electromagnetics}} code is used {{to evaluate}} the transient and radiation performances of three printed-circuit antennas for super-wideband (SWB) monitoring applications. For two antennas, one in microstrip and one in coplanar technologies, operating between 3 and 30 GHz with a return loss of 10 dB, it is demonstrated that the vertically polarized omnidirectional radiation characteristics in the lower frequency band change to a more directional pattern at higher frequencies and that the <b>cross-polar</b> field <b>component</b> increases with fre-quency and gives rise to possible dual-polarized applications for the microstrip antenna. In comparison, the coplanar antenna shows slightly better performance, especially with respect to its transient response. Its group-delay variation is only 180 ps compared to 250 ps of the microstrip antenna, and its amplitude response provides better polarization purity. The evaluation of the coplanar concept is extended to cover a bandwidth between 3 and 60 GHz. The time-domain evalu-ation, as validated by a frequency-domain technique, demonstrates that band-widths in extent of decade bandwidths are possible with simple printed-circuit antennas. Characteristics and performances are presented for possible applications in future SWB monitoring systems, radar technology, through-wall imaging sys-tems, and other future wireless services. Antenna dimensions are provided for future comparisons with improved and/or multi-level electromagnetics codes...|$|R
40|$|Usually common polarimetric {{weather radar}} DSP-products (e. g. : reflectivity, {{differential}} reflectivity, linear depolarisation ratio - for both - co-polar and <b>cross-polar</b> signal <b>components)</b> {{are based on}} the logarithmic receiver output, because of the large dynamic range provided by the logarithmic receiver. In this paper {{for the first time we}} also use the linear receiver output to calculate common weather radar DSP-Products. Using the raw time series radar data recorded with the coherent polarimetric C-band weather radar of the DLR (''Poldirad'', Wessling, Germany) it is possible to do a comparison between processed weather radar echoes from the linear receiver and the logarithmic receiver. After the comparison showed very good results, we continued the work with the linear receiver data, especially on the topic named temporal decorrelation properties of the linear receiver data. This paper includes the first results obtained from two observables that belong to our working topic. The first observable is the ''Time Decorrelation Factor-TDF'' and the second one is the ''Decorrelation Time DTτ''The results have been summarised in the form of empirical relationships, plots and the least mean square (LMS) method of curve fitting was used to give the mathematical relationship for the observables TDF and DTτ. Generally, the paper will also reflect on the statistical properties of radar echoes measured with linear receivers. The usage of the linear receiver data opens a wide field of new applications and products for the work with polarimetric weather radar data, because the linear receiver data also provides phase information which a logarithmic receiver does not...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{hemispherical}} dielectric resonator antenna (HDRA) with complementary split {{rings and}} slots is proposed and investigated. The complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) are etched {{from the ground}} plane, which are pierced though slots extending from the ground plane up to the HDRA. The dielectric material used is Rogers TMM 10, which has a dielectric constant of epsilon(r) = 9. 2. The CSRR-shaped slot on HDRA lowers down the quality factor (Q-factor) of the antenna, thus enhancing the bandwidth. Furthermore, the current distribution across the CSRR slots on the ground plane is out of phase, which results in current cancelation along the CSRR and hence reduces the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>component</b> of the radiation pattern significantly. The measured value of bandwidth of the proposed structure is 30 % centered at 1. 9 GHz, offering a gain of 6 dBi. The cross-polar level is more than 40 dB, which is {{much lower than the}} copolar pattern. The first two modes of the HDRA are preserved...|$|E
40|$|Magíster en Ciencias de la Ingeniería, Mención Eléctrica. Ingeniera Civil EléctricaThe new {{generation}} of telescopes that will be installed {{in the world and}} particularly in Chile is focused on the search of high-impact scientific objectives. For this, the technology used must be cutting edge, in order to achieve a better performance than currently achieved. This challenge falls into the hands of engineering and this thesis is developed in that context. The general objective is to develop intermediate optical systems to allow the existence of heterodyne cameras in the range of 85 - 115 GHz (extended W band). For this, two sub-projects are developed. In the first one, we work with the original design of the 1. 2 -m SMWT telescope that is currently in the National Astronomical Observatory in Cerro Calán. We study the feasibility of having a heterodyne camera without the need to add extra optical elements. For the second project, the parameters of the 12 -m ALMA antenna are used. An intermediate optical system consisting of a Gaussian Beam Telescope is designed. We seek to adapt the optics of the antenna with a heterodyne receiver of 7 pixels. This design is applicable to a future ALMA upgrade or to the LLAMA project, which is under development. In both projects, we work with mathematical models developed in Matlab and based on the quasi-optical model. Subsequently, fine-tuning the models is performed with simulation software. Performance parameters such as aperture efficiency, noise temperature, beam truncation, <b>cross-polar</b> <b>component</b> and surface accuracy are taken into account for the design. We find an appropriate beam position and waist for the SMWT 7 -pixel heterodyne receiver. The normalized efficiency of the lateral beams is 92. 9 % with respect to the central beam. A 23. 6 -mm spacing between beams with a 6. 8 -mm waist in the Cassegrain focal plane is required. No additional optics are necessary. For the design in a 12 -m antenna, a 58. 6 -mm spacing is obtained in the Cassegrain focal plane, a beam waist of 16. 8 mm and a normalized efficiency of 96. 9 % for the central frequency (100 GHz). The design for both, ALMA and LLAMA, consists of a Gaussian Beam Telescope using two ellipsoidal mirrors and compacted by the use of flat mirrors. The magnification in each case is different due to the space constraints particular to each. This implies that the waist of the beam in the vacuum window is different.

40|$|Weather Radars are a {{fundamental}} tool for National Weather Services. Planned operational systems {{are likely to}} include Doppler and dual polarization, whose usefulness has been widely demonstrated in the last twenty years. Such radars will probably implement hybrid polarization, a mode that involves transmitting slant 45 ° and receiving the horizontal and vertical components of the backscattered signal. The reasons for such a choice are both theoretical and practical. The theoretical assumption is that weather targets most often appear to satisfy mirror reflection symmetry about the vertical axis. Practical considerations that make this choice operationally attractive is that, besides being more expensive, switched systems are characterized by increased feed complexity and more difficult calibration procedures. Further, hybrid polarization was conceived to effectively measure ZDR, KDP and ρHV, which have been perceived operationally to be useful qualitative and quantitative parameters. A variable available to dual polarization coherent radar systems is the degree of polarization, obtainable from Wolf’s coherency matrix. However, for a given incoherent target, the degree of polarization of the backscattered wave {{is dependent on the}} transmit polarization state. To investigate this dependence, we resorted to process fully polarimetric weather radar signatures and compute, from the same dataset, the degree of polarization for different transmit states. A way to measure the degree of polarization capability to capture information from an incoherent target is a confrontation with entropy, a scalar quantity relating to the heterogeneity of statistically independent degrees of freedom existing in the scattering population. As Entropy is designed to capture the whole polarimetric heterogeneity of the scattering population, the minimal degree of polarization (the degree of polarization obtained from the transmit states that minimize its value) is expected to mirror entropy behavior rather faithfully. A fully polarimetric radar is able to transmit pulses whose polarization state is switched every pulse repetition period (polarization agility) and is set to simultaneously receive the co- and cross- polar components of the backscattered signal (dual receiver). Such a set up allows quasi-simultaneous measurements of the complete scattering matrix. The first meteorological radar designed to measure complete scattering matrices of weather targets was developed at DLR about twenty years ago and is known to the weather radar community as POLDIRAD, acronym for polarization diversity radar. The term polarization diversity refers to its capability of being able to fast-switch on transmit between any pair of orthogonal polarization states. For a detailed technical description of the system, we refer to. To collect the data presented in this work, POLDIRAD was operated to switch between horizontal and vertical polarization states on transmit, and was set to receive the copolar and <b>cross-polar</b> <b>components</b> of the backscattered signal. This operation mode is called VHVH, but, as pointed out above, other modes are also possible like RLRL using right and left circularly polarized transmissions, as well as hybrid polarization. Ideally, all elements of a scattering matrix should be measured simultaneously. However, since (unless some coding scheme can be used) the transmit polarizations must be emitted sequentially, the scattering matrix measured by a fully polarimetric weather radar is affected by both mean motion of the target and decorrelation due to random displacements of the single scatterers. Mean motion results in a phase offset {{between the first and second}} column of the scattering matrix while random motion manifests itself in amplitude and phase fluctuations of the backscattered signal as well as some depolarization. If the second effect cannot be corrected, special signal processing procedures must be applied to correct for the Doppler phase shift...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to radar imaging that exploits sparsity in the matched filter domain to enable high resolution imaging of targets in delay and Doppler. We show that the vector of radar cross-ambiguity values at any fixed test delay cell has a sparse representation in a Vandermonde frame that is obtained by discretizing the Doppler axis. The expansion coefficients are given by the auto-correlation functions of the transmitted waveforms. We show that the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm can then be easily used to identify the locations of the radar targets in delay and Doppler. Unambiguous imaging in delay is enabled by alternating between a Golay pair of phase coded waveforms at the transmission to eliminate delay sidelobe effects. We then extend our work to multi-channel radar, by developing a sparse recovery approach for dually-polarimetric radar. We exploit sparsity in a bank of matched filters, each of which is matched to an entry of an Alamouti matrix of Golay waveforms to recover a co-polar or <b>cross-polar</b> polarization scattering <b>component.</b> Index Terms—Golay complementary waveforms, sparse representations, Vandermonde frame, orthogonal matching pursuit, delay-Doppler imaging.

40|$|In this digital era, {{the usage}} of smart phones and mobile devices is {{becoming}} a norm in society with mobile communication quickly transitioned from voice oriented transmission to picture transmission to a more complex live video streaming. This latest development has demanded more capacity and higher bandwidth in communication links. Static links, which {{are the focus of}} this thesis, {{are an integral part of}} this mobile system in delivering high capacity data transmission using backhauls or nomadic links. Multi polarised antennas with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing can be employed to greatly enhance the capacity of a mobile system, especially at frequencies lower than 6 GHz, using their compact size. A practical antenna inherently exhibits elliptical polarisation though it may be designed to form linear or circular polarisation. Little attention has been given to this aspect of polarised waves as they have always been deemed as unwanted polarisation, although in practice, any antenna is elliptically polarised as it can never be perfectly circularly or linearly polarised. This work therefore aims to deliberately exploit this opportunity by forming antennas with elliptical polarisation to identify the advantages of doing so in order to improve orthogonality in comparison with linear polarisation. It was found that in order to achieve perfect orthogonality, it was more practical to set the magnitudes and phases of the co-polar and <b>cross-polar</b> linear <b>components,</b> which resulted in an improved co to cross polar ratio more than 20 dB better than linear polarisation in free space. A dual elliptically polarised antenna prototype was designed and evaluated in this work, which was evaluated both in free space and within an indoor measurement campaign. Results concluded that at short distances with low scattering in the channel and directional antennas, elliptically polarised antennas provide improved multiplexing gain over dual linear polarisations.
