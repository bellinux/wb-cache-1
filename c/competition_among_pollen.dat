40|$|Post-pollination <b>competition</b> <b>among</b> <b>pollen</b> grains for the {{fertilization}} of ovules {{can potentially}} filter out inferior male gametophytes from the reproductive process. It has been assumed that, in relatively long styles, competition among genetically diverse pollen grains {{will be more}} intense than in relatively short styles. However, very few empirical {{studies have examined the}} influence of style length on differences among pollen donors in siring success. We developed a model of pollen tube growth based on measures of in vivo pollen performance and style length of an annual herb (Clarkia unguiculata) {{to examine the relationship between}} style length and the percentage of seeds sired by two competing donors with differing pollen performance param-eters. We found that there is no increase in the siring success of a superior donor as style length increases under a range of conditions. Moreover, there was a positive relationship between style length and style filtering ability only in styles shorter than those found in wild populations of C. unguiculata, suggesting that variation in style length has little influence on filtering ability in natural populations of this species. We conclude that both male and female reproductive success can be influenced by style length, but under a restricted set of conditions...|$|E
40|$|That sexual {{selection}} {{can be an}} active force in plant evolution is still under debate. When the number of pollen grains deposited onto a stigma exceeds the number of available ovules, <b>competition</b> <b>among</b> <b>pollen</b> grains for fertilizations will result in selection on traits that increase siring ability (e. g. pollen tube growth rate). The pistil {{can be regarded as}} an arena for pollen competition, where pistil size and shape have the potential to intensify competition and thereby increase the possibility of sorting among pollen donors. Pollen tube growth rate can function as a cue for female choice if there is a positive relationship between pollen tube growth rate and sporophytic quality of individual donors when this quality is reflected in the offspring. In hermaphroditic violets, Viola tricolor, we found that pollen tube growth rate in vitro is an indicator of donor sporophytic quality expressed as seed production. In two-donor crosses, pollen tube growth rate had a strong influence on siring ability, which, in turn, was positively related to offspring seed production. Artificial selection of offspring shed by superior pollen donors also resulted in reduced variation in seed production and pollen tube growth rate. A father-offspring regression further indicated that pollen tube growth rate is heritable to a certain degree. There is thus a potential for selection on traits that increase the probability that ovules are fertilized by fast-growing pollen...|$|E
40|$|Mating {{with more}} than one pollen donor, or polyandry, is common in land plants. In {{flowering}} plants, polyandry occurs when the pollen from different potential sires is distributed among the fruits of a single individual, or when pollen from more than one donor is deposited on the same stigma. Because polyandry typically leads to multiple paternity among or within fruits, it can be indirectly inferred on the basis of paternity analysis using molecular markers. A review of the literature indicates that polyandry is probably ubiquitous in plants except those that habitually self-fertilize, or that disperse their pollen in pollen packages, such as polyads or pollinia. Multiple mating may increase plants' female component by alleviating pollen limitation or by promoting <b>competition</b> <b>among</b> <b>pollen</b> grains from different potential sires. Accordingly, a number of traits have evolved that should promote polyandry at the flower level from the female's point of view, e. g. the prolongation of stigma receptivity or increases in stigma size. However, many floral traits, such as attractiveness, the physical manipulation of pollinators and pollen-dispensing mechanisms that lead to polyandrous pollination, have probably evolved in response to selection to promote male siring success in general, so that polyandry might often best be seen as a by-product of selection to enhance outcross siring success. In this sense, polyandry in plants is similar to geitonogamy (selfing caused by pollen transfer among flowers of the same plant), because both polyandry and geitonogamy probably result from selection to promote outcross siring success, although geitonogamy is almost always deleterious while polyandry in plants will seldom be so...|$|E
40|$|The {{styles of}} flowers may {{represent}} an arena for pollen {{competition in the}} race to fertilize ovules. Accordingly, selection should favour a longer 'race' to better discriminate <b>among</b> variable <b>pollen</b> by increasing style length. Sampling across a taxonomically diverse range of wild and outcrossed species, we found that the distribution of style lengths within plants were skewed towards longer styles, as predicted. In self-pollinated domesticated species, where discrimination <b>among</b> <b>pollen</b> is less important, we found no such pattern. We conclude that style length is under directional selection towards longer styles as a mechanism for mate choice <b>among</b> <b>pollen</b> of variable quality...|$|R

Here I investigate the effect of <b>competition</b> <b>among</b> resources.

30|$|High-throughput {{microarray}} data {{provide a}} powerful tool for identifying genes at the genome scale that control pollen development. Genome-wide investigations have already been performed with the male gametophytic transcriptomes in Arabidopsis and rice (Becker et al. 2003; Honys and Twell 2003; Honys and Twell 2004; Suwabe et al. 2008; Fujita et al. 2010; Wei et al. 2010; Aya et al. 2011). Those studies have revealed that mature pollen grains have a unique transcriptome profile with a higher proportion of selectively expressed genes than in any other tissues (Becker et al. 2003; Wei et al. 2010). This unique transcriptome represents the biological processes required for pollen development, i.e., cell wall metabolism, signalling, and cytoskeleton dynamics. Honys and Twell (2004) and Wei et al. (2010) have reported dynamic changes in the transcriptomes of Arabidopsis and rice, based on their sequential stages of pollen development. Patterns of changes in their transcripts are conserved between those two species. The diversity of these transcripts is greatly decreased as the pollen progresses from uni-cellular microspores to mature grains (Wei et al. 2010). The transition from bi-cellular to tri-cellular pollen was also observed by an increase in the proportion of male gametophyte-specific transcripts (Wei et al. 2010). <b>Competition</b> <b>among</b> <b>pollen</b> grains for an egg cell to produce a diploid zygote is a common phenomenon. Because rice pollen begins to germinate within 2 Â min after pollination (Chen et al. 2008), most of the required components for this are already present in the mature grains. Analysis by Wei et al. (2010) has revealed that the gene expression profiles of mature grains and germinated grains are significantly and positively correlated (r[*]=[*] 0.99), suggesting that the former stores a set of transcripts for germination. Moreover, inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D does not interrupt germination, indicating that the RNAs necessary for germination are already present in mature grains (Mascarenhas 1993; Hao et al. 2005).|$|E
