500|$|Although filmed {{to create}} the {{illusion}} that events occurred in real time, the episode employed several camera tricks and effects. For the opening shot, a [...] "surreptitious cut" [...] helped to replace actor Judson Mills with a stunt person when the <b>cop</b> <b>car</b> is overturned by the monster. Usually, an episode of the series required 800 to 1,200 film cuts, but [...] "X-Cops" [...] only required 45. During post-production, a minor argument broke out between Vince Gilligan and the network. Originally, Gilligan did not want the X-Files logo to appear {{at any time during the}} episode. He stressed that he wanted [...] "X-Cops" [...] to feel like an [...] "episode of Cops that happened to involve Mulder and Scully." [...] The network, fearing that people would not understand that [...] "X-Cops" [...] was actually an episode of The X-Files, vetoed this idea. A compromise was reached wherein the episode would open with the Cops theme song, but the normal X-Files credits would scroll after an opening scene. In addition, the commercial bumpers would feature red and blue lights flashing across The X-Files logo while dialogue is heard in the background, in a similar fashion to the Cops logo. The episode also features a disclaimer at the beginning informing viewers that the episode is a special installment of The X-Files to prevent watchers from thinking that the show [...] "has been preempted this week by Cops".|$|E

2500|$|A {{police car}} (also called a police cruiser, <b>cop</b> <b>car,</b> prowler, squad car, radio car or radio mobile patrol (RMP) [...] ) is a ground vehicle used by police for {{transportation}} during patrols and {{to enable them}} to respond to incidents. Typical uses of a police car include transporting officers so they can reach the scene of an incident quickly, transporting and temporarily detaining suspects in the back seats, as a location to use their police radio or laptop or to patrol an area, all while providing a visible deterrent to crime. Some police cars are specially adapted for certain locations (e.g. traffic duty on busy roads) or for certain operations (e.g. to transport police dogs or bomb squads). Police cars typically have rooftop flashing lights, a siren, and emblems or markings indicating that the vehicle is a police car. Some police cars may have reinforced bumpers and alley lights, for illuminating darkened alleys.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, the Valiant was {{available}} as a Code A38 police package car and offered in three basic engine sizes: E24 (California emission standards) and E25 (Federal) [...] single-barrel Slant-6; E44 , twin-barrel V-8; E58 , four-barrel V-8 with single (California) or dual (Federal) exhaust. It was the E58 that Chrysler recommended for police service {{as it was the}} only one with [...] "added endurance features to improve durability." [...] The E58 produced 175 net hp in California trim and 220 net hp in Federal form. The E58 dual exhaust engine (sans catalytic converters) made for a very fast Valiant squad car. So equipped, this compact Chrysler <b>cop</b> <b>car</b> tripped the quarter-mile lights in 16.4 seconds with trap speeds of [...] and could catch nearly all the so-called [...] "performance cars" [...] of the day. The Seattle Police Department using the Valiant A38 reported a 46 percent drop in the preventable accident rate among police officers, and according to a Motor Trend police survey, the A38 Valiant had much better evasive capabilities, better overall visibility, and was generally easier to drive than the full-size squad cars. A special handling package applied to the A38 Valiant included front and rear antisway bars. Unfortunately, the Valiant wasn't physically durable enough; it lacked additional frame welds and rear cross-member reinforcements standard on all other Mopar A38 packages. More importantly, the front K-frame of the Valiant was prone to failure under severe police use.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, rapper M.I.A. posted several {{videos on}} her Instagram account during which a remix of [...] "Flawless" [...] was played. Two months later, on May 13, she {{released}} an officially commissioned remix {{of the song}} titled [...] "Baddygirl 2". M.I.A.'s version was produced by Party Squad, contained modified lyrics and samples of Beyoncé's [...] "Diva" [...] and [...] "Run the World (Girls)". It explored elements of trap and EDM music. Some of the reworked lines contained feminist messages and elements of the original song were completely altered. John Walker, writing for MTV News remarked that except the opening lines [...] "I woke up like this/ I went to bed like this/ We do everything just like this", the remix doesn't contain [...] "any easily recognizable bits" [...] of the original. Similarly, a writer of Fact magazine noted that Beyoncé {{did not want to}} release the remix as it only contained the same feminist elements of the original. Zach Frydenlund of Complex felt that the reworked version contained M.I.A.'s [...] "intense energy" [...] while Sharan Shetty found a [...] "manic", high-energy sound similar to the rapper's diverse influences. However the latter concluded that the remix [...] "doesn't quite measure up to the original, but... regardless, it's an interesting and head-bopping take". The Guardian editor Alexandra Khan-Anselmo felt that the remix is [...] "good enough to make you want to smash the window of a <b>cop</b> <b>car,</b> pull a Wynona or sneak on to the underground".|$|E

50|$|Each {{level in}} Bank Heist is a maze-like city (similar to Pac-Man). The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to rob as many banks as possible while avoiding the police.
