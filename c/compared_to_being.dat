25|$|Employment status {{effects are}} not {{confined}} to the individual. Being unemployed can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective well-being, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> employed or not working (and not looking for work). Partner life satisfaction is inversely related to the number of hours their partner is underemployed. When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women. However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective well-being of an individual. On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective well-being of the employed.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have since}} remarked that Bannon's books are {{remarkable}} for portraying homosexual relationships relatively accurately. The continuity of {{characters in the}} series also gave her books a unique quality, especially when most lesbian characters during this time were one-dimensional stereotypes who met punishment for their desires. Bannon's characters have been called [...] "accessibly human", and still engrossing by contemporary standards <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> [...] "revolutionary" [...] when first released. LGBT historian Susan Stryker describes the relationships between Bannon's characters as mostly positive, satisfactory, and at times complex depictions of lesbian and gay relationships, which Bannon attributed to not {{letting go of the}} hope that she could [...] "salvage (her) own life." [...] One retrospective of lesbian pulp fiction remarked on the reasons why Bannon's books in particular were popular is because they were so different from anything else being published at the time: [...] "Bannon was implicitly challenging the prevailing belief that homosexual life was brief, episodic, and more often than not resulted in death... Bannon insisted on the continuity of lesbian love, while everything in her culture was speaking of its quick and ugly demise." ...|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. According to John Ortved's book , Simon resented {{the media attention}} Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, {{and that he should}} have been the one receiving credit for the show. As well as Groening, Simon was often at odds with Brooks and production company Gracie Films and left the show in 1993. Before leaving, he negotiated a deal that saw him receive a share of the show's profits every year, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as showrunners for the third season. <b>Compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> an executive producer, the showrunner position is more involved with the show and acts as head writer and manages the show's production for an entire season. As well as a turnover in the staff, The Simpsons moved the production of the animation from Klasky Csupo to Film Roman in season four.|$|E

2500|$|On the entropy {{scale of}} {{information}} gain {{there is very}} little difference between near certainty and absolute certainty—coding according to a near certainty requires hardly any more bits than coding according to an absolute certainty. On the other hand, on the logit scale implied by weight of evidence, {{the difference between the two}} is enormous – infinite perhaps; this might reflect the difference between being almost sure (on a probabilistic level) that, say, the Riemann hypothesis is correct, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> certain that it is correct because one has a mathematical proof. [...] These two different scales of loss function for uncertainty are both useful, according to how well each reflects the particular circumstances of the problem in question.|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{argued that}} the [...] "surge" [...] of 2007 had largely won the Iraq War by the {{beginning}} of 2009, and that rise of the Islamic State terrorist group which seized control of much of Iraq in mid-2014 was the result of what Hanson sees as the unwise withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq in December 2011, which he blames on the Obama administration. Hanson argued that if only American troops had stayed in Iraq after December 2011, then the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki would have been less sectarian and the Islamic State group would have never emerged. Hanson {{argued that the}} December 2011 withdrawal from Iraq was motivated to help improve Obama's chances of reelection in 2012, an act that he <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> equivalent to the United States pulling its troops out of South Korea in 1955, arguing if only the Americans had stayed in Iraq, then that nation would have evolved into a Near Eastern version of South Korea.|$|E
2500|$|At {{an unknown}} {{time in the}} 1960 or '70s the ward {{numbering}} scheme was replaced, the earlier system was a letter defining the sex followed by a number: F23 - the 23rd Female ward for instance or M4 a male ward. The new system consisted of giving each block a letter of the alphabet and then attaching a number to it: D2 or E1, each block containing between one and eight wards depending on location. It is presumed that the naming system attempted to reduce the perceived size of the hospital to visitors and new patients, being admitted to say the 23rd female ward {{gave the impression of}} an awful lot of female patients, <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> admitted to say K2 ward. Later (perhaps in the 1970s) these designations allowed for names to be used using that first letter 'D2' the middle floor ward of 'D' block, the fourth block from the left became 'Dean Ward' with whilst 'E1' became 'Elgar' with 'E2' 'Eliot', and 'E3' 'Emerson' on the top floor.|$|E

40|$|Social {{psychological}} and developmental research revealed that imitation serves a fundamental social function.

In the current fMRI study we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of the positive consequences of being imitated by means of an observation paradigm. Our results indicate that <b>being</b> imitated <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> not <b>being</b> imitated activates brain areas that have been associated with emotion and reward processing, namely medial orbitofrontal cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mOFC/vmPFC, GLM whole-brain contrast).
