5|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of the maps and photographs from the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extent of glacier retreat.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> main {{limitation}} <b>of</b> {{this study}} is <b>the</b> small number <b>of</b> cases in each group.

50|$|However, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{greatest}} apparent <b>confirmations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caloric {{theory was}} Pierre-Simon Laplace's theoretical correction of Sir Isaac Newton’s calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> sound. Newton had assumed an isothermal process, while Laplace, a calorist, treated it as adiabatic. This addition not only substantially corrected <b>the</b> theoretical prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> sound, but also {{continued to make}} even more accurate predictions for almost a century afterward, even as measurements became more precise.|$|R

5|$|The {{observations}} {{made with}} the sundial provided essential <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to reform the Julian calendar. The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which {{was used to measure}} the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have been the source for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|While most planets with orbital {{periods of}} less than 10 days have almost {{circular}} orbits, HD 217107 b has a somewhat eccentric orbit, and its discoverers hypothesized {{that this could be}} due to the gravitational influence of a second planet in the system at a distance of several astronomical units (AU). <b>Confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence of a second planet, HD 217107 c, followed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> E. M. L. Pryce and John Clive Ward's calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating in opposite directions. This was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results relevant {{to a pair of}} entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E
40|$|We {{suggest an}} {{alternating}} proposals protocol with a confirmation stage {{as a way}} of solving a Prisoner’s Dilemma game. We interpret players’ proposals and (no) <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game as a tacit communication device. The protocol leads to unprecedented high levels <b>of</b> cooperation in <b>the</b> laboratory. Assigning <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two players alone, rather than alternating <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> a leader significantly increases <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> cooperation in <b>the</b> first bargaining period.

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>confirmations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> an era of greater tolerance was the expulsion from <b>the</b> communist party <b>of</b> several prominent [...] "Marxist revisionists" [...] in the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} derive the polarization-resolved {{intensity distribution}} of a TM-polarized fundamental Gaussian beam reflected by an air-glass plane interface at Brewster incidence. The reflected beam has both a dominant (TM) and a cross-polarized (TE) component, carried by a TEM 10 and a TEM 01 Hermite-Gaussian spatial mode, respectively. Remarkably, {{we find that}} the TE-mode power scales quadratically with <b>the</b> angular spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident beam and it is comparable to the TM-mode power. Experimental <b>confirmations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theoretical results are also presented...|$|R
5|$|Franck {{became the}} Head of the Physics Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became {{professor}} ordinarius of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Göttingen. While there {{he worked on}} quantum physics with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bohr model of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.|$|E
5|$|In 1092, {{he helped}} with the consecration of Old Sarum Cathedral, {{although}} its roof was almost immediately damaged by a storm and required decades of repair. In 1094, he performed the same service for Battle Abbey. After the accession of King Henry I of England, John received a <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grant {{of the city of}} Bath, paying 500 pounds of silver for the verification. In 1102, John secured from King Henry the right to hold fairs at Bath on the feast day of the cathedral's patron saint, Saint Peter. He gave an extensive library to the cathedral at Bath, and eventually the monks there became reconciled to him. John, however, continued to hold most of the old abbey's manors himself, rather than using them for the support of the monks.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal {{in the microwave}} band. Their discovery provided substantial <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation {{was found to be}} approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
40|$|Fatigue tests {{conducted}} {{with and without}} internal pressure {{have been found to}} possess approximately the same fatigue life as (+/- 45) s graphite/epoxy tubes for zero-to-tension axial load-controlled conditions on an axial torsion servohydraulic apparatus.
