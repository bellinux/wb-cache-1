30|$|Competitive {{operating}} environment: Markets {{need to be}} competitive. Ideally, shippers {{should have}} options among service providers. Any restrictions on transport services, for e.g., <b>cargo</b> <b>reservation</b> regimes which tend to restrict trucking operations or cabotage in shipping, will negatively affect maritime connectivity.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to integrate data from <b>Cargo</b> <b>Reservation</b> System with Garuda Website that customer can track their cargo position from the internet. So it can deliver service level standard for customer. In general implementation of this system produce internal benefit and external benefits. The methodology of this development are System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Prototyping. The stage that used for developing this system are Investigation System and Prototyping System. Investigation System is used for identify all requirement to implement this system. Prototyping {{is a model of}} the system. The conclusion of this thesis is the system can be implemented in Garuda. There are several key success factor, and the system has a restriction. The integration from Commercial Directorate and the Operation Directorate can reduce the restriction of this system...|$|E

5000|$|A {{few hours}} later, the plane touches down and Strobl and the PFC's casket wait to change flights in Minneapolis. After the casket is unloaded, Strobl {{requests}} {{to stay with}} the casket overnight in the airport's <b>cargo</b> area. Despite <b>reservations</b> from the foreman, his request is granted; one of the workers offers him a sleeping bag from his jeep. During this time, Strobl meets a U.S. Army Sergeant of the 1st Cavalry Division who he recognized from the Dover Port Mortuary. The sergeant tells Strobl that he is escorting his deceased brother home. The following morning, the PFC's casket is loaded onto a Northwest Airlines flight as the baggage handlers and even the flight captain pay their respects. On this flight, Lt. Col. Strobl sits next to a young woman who cheerily offers him a magazine to read, and also texts someone that she is sitting next to a [...] "HOT soldier," [...] which Lt. Col. Strobl happens {{to catch a glimpse of}} and corrects her that he is actually a Marine. Upon landing, the airliner captain, a retired U.S. Air Force officer and former A-10 attack jet pilot in the first Persian Gulf War, makes a special announcement, asking for the other passengers to remain seated so that Lt. Col. Strobl has a chance to deplane first and render honors for PFC Phelps as his casket is unloaded. The woman sitting next to the Lt. Col, who had no idea he was on an escort mission for a fallen Marine, is visibly touched, and apologizes for potentially being insensitive with her earlier actions; Lt. Col. Strobl instead warmly thanks her for her company.|$|R
40|$|From the mid- 1950 s to 1990, sub-Saharan Africa's {{share of}} global exports fell from 3. 1 to under 1. 2 percent, a decline that implies {{associated}} export earning losses of about $ 65 billion annually. Previous {{studies show that}} foreign trade barriers do not account for this poor performance. Indeed, African exports enjoy OECD tariff preferences. In the sub-Saharan African countries, too high a proportion of foreign exchange earnings is paying for Africa's high export transport costs. The authors demonstrate that relatively high transportation costs - especially for processed products - often place African exporters at a serious competitive disadvantage. African countries must use a far larger share of their foreign exchange earnings to pay for international transport services than other developing countries do - and {{the relative importance of}} those payments has been increasing. Why are Africa's transport costs so high? Ill-advised policies {{on the part of some}} African governments seem to have played a role, as their <b>cargo</b> <b>reservation</b> policies produced high"rents"for lines that have been shielded from the effects of competition. The failure to maintain or improve port and transport infrastructure has also played a role.

40|$|It is {{imperative}} to explore avenues that exert impact on the citizenry of Nigeria Vis-à-vis an improvement material per capita income, hence, improved material income and standard of living. Shipping as a capital and/or Inland water trade has tremendous impact on the nation’s economy of which the study is aimed at exploring through <b>cargo</b> <b>reservation,</b> transportation and haulage of wet and dry cargo {{within and outside the}} Nigerian waterways. The study will invariably invoke, recreate and set in motion the impact and economic opportunities of the Nigerian shipping sector for possible investment by public or private sector, or a combination. The investment climate in Nigerian Shipping Industry is guided by the current National economic development policy which is aimed at promoting strong private sector driven industry with government as the enabler. Nigeria looses a lot of revenue due largely to lack of cargo carrying capacity of Nigerian fleet. Example, the liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), iron ore, and other bulk cargo is mostly carried by foreign ships. Nigeria cannot afford to toy with the maritime sector due to the linkages between shipping activities and economic development as it is a primary logistic provider. There are opportunities for investment in dry bulk, tankers, liner/container, coastal cruise services, and offshore services if properly harnessed. With Nigeria as a flag state, proper funding and good management will attract foreign ships for registration. Nigerian oil and gas is useless and valueless without shipping. Oil and gas are like Siamese twins. Shipping facilitates movement of oil and gas from point of production to point of need locally and internationally...|$|E
