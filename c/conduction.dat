5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve <b>conduction</b> studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve <b>conduction</b> studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E
5|$|The {{process by}} which {{electric}} current passes through a material is termed electrical <b>conduction,</b> and its nature varies {{with that of the}} charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic <b>conduction,</b> where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal, and electrolysis, where ions (charged atoms) flow through liquids, or through plasmas such as electrical sparks. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second, the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light, enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.|$|E

5|$|Current {{limitations}} to p-doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n-type and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; {{as well as}} copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p-type <b>conduction</b> at room temperature.|$|E
30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of wind power generation and power electronics, the PMSG {{has become the}} current trend based on specific characteristics, such as its gearless drive train, high LVRT capability, {{and its ability to}} decouple the generator from the grid fault. At present, the study of multiple-machine representation for PMSG-based WPPs only takes into account diversity in wind speeds (Abbes et al. 2015; Conroy and Watson 2009). Furthermore, since the speed changes in both the wind turbine and generator are negligible during the voltage dip, the simplified equivalent PMSG-based WPP models are recommended, in which the drive train, the generator and the machine side converter (MSC) are omitted (Conroy and Watson 2009; Neumann et al. 2015). Although the chopper circuit is taken into account, these simplified models with single-machine representation or multiple-machine representation cannot accurately reflect the diversity in chopper circuit <b>conductions</b> within the WPP. As for DFIG-based WPPs, the traditional equivalent WPP model built based on wind speeds experiences large discrepancies due to its failure to represent the diversity in crowbar circuit <b>conductions</b> (Brochu et al. 2011). Similarly, the PMSGs are equipped with the chopper circuits, and the diversity in chopper circuit <b>conductions</b> should also be abstracted while clustering the PMSGs.|$|R

Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the <b>conduction</b> system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{variation}} in the rate and extent of recovery. The prognosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age (those over 40 may have a poorer outcome), and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks. Furthermore, those who experienced diarrhea before the onset of disease have a worse prognosis. On the nerve <b>conduction</b> study, the presence of <b>conduction</b> block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months. In those who have received intravenous immunoglobulins, a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially. If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks, or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity (more than two in eight weeks), the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which is treated differently.|$|E

The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is employed to simulate the heat <b>conductions</b> of hotspots appeared in a SOI transistor. The results show that a thermal wave effect is appeared in micro-region, and it can not be found in Fourier prediction. Comparing the results obtained by the Fourier law and LBM, we find that the LBM solution shows approximately 22 % higher energy density than the Fourier prediction.
