The poliovirus synthesis caught global attention, high praise, ridicule and fierce condemnation. Several years later, Wimmer published an essay in EMBO Reports reflecting on hotly debated issues that this new kind of research generated (ethical matters, questions about the global eradication of poliovirus, concerns of “dual use research”). Apart from providing a ‘proof of principle,’ the experiment heralded the total synthesis of organisms with computers as parents, a strategy that allows investigating the structure and function of an organism’s biology to an extent hitherto impossible. Meanwhile, synthetic biology has led to a new kind of RNA virus genetics and has been used to develop rapid methods for computer-aided chemical synthesis of viral recoded genomes. This strategy allows for the generation of new vaccines in a very short time.|$|E

Results for the individual oligonucleotides were consistent in a cell free model and in cell culture using two different uptake promoters.
