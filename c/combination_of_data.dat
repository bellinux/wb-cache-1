25|$|The mtDNA haplogroups of Europeans are {{surveyed}} {{by using a}} <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from RFLP analysis of the coding region and sequencing of the hypervariable segment I. About 99% of European mtDNAs {{fall into one of}} ten haplogroups: H, I, J, K, M, T, U, V, W or X (Torroni et al. 1996a). Each of these is defined by certain relatively ancient and stable polymorphic sites located in the coding region (Torroni et al. 1996a)... Haplogroup H, which is defined by the absence of an AluI site at bp 7025, is the most prevalent, comprising half of all Europeans (Torroni et al. 1996a, Richards et al. 1998)... Six of the European haplogroups (H, I, J, K, T and W) are essentially confined to European populations (Torroni et al. 1994, 1996a), and probably originated after the ancestral Caucasoids became genetically separated from the ancestors of the modern Africans and Asians. Genetic studies suggest some maternal gene flow to eastern Europe from eastern Asia or southern Siberia 13,000 – 6,600 years BP. Analysis of Neolithic skeletons in the Great Hungarian Plain found a high frequency of eastern Asian mtDNA haplogroups, some of which survive in modern eastern European populations. Maternal gene flow to Europe from sub-Saharan Africa began as early as 11,000 years BP, although the majority of lineages, approximately 65%, are estimated to have arrived more recently, including during the Romanization period, the Arab conquests of southern Europe, and during the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E
2500|$|Clinical {{assessment}} can {{be characterized}} as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are {{made on the basis of}} what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., psychological test results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, X-ray, etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, diagnosis, or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an algorithmic, or [...] "mechanical" [...] fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., treatment response). Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm. The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% reliable. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the decision-making processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.|$|E

2500|$|On September 29, 2010, astronomers {{using the}} Keck Observatory {{proposed}} two additional planets, Gliese 581f and Gliese 581g, both in nearly circular orbits based on {{analysis of a}} <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> sets from the HARPS and HIRES instruments. The proposed planet Gliese 581f {{was thought to be}} a 7 Earth-mass planet in a 433-day orbit and too cold to support liquid water. The candidate planet Gliese 581g attracted more attention: nicknamed Zarmina by one of its discoverers, the predicted mass of Gliese 581g was between 3 and 4 Earth-masses, with an orbital period of 37 days. The orbital distance was calculated to be well within the star's habitable zone, though the planet was expected to be tidally locked with one side of the planet always facing the star. In an interview with Lisa-Joy Zgorski of the National Science Foundation, Steven Vogt was asked what he thought about the chances of life existing on Gliese 581g. Vogt was optimistic: [...] "I'm not a biologist, nor do I want to play one on TV. Personally, given the ubiquity and propensity of life to flourish wherever it can, I would say that ... the chances of life on this planet are 100%. I have almost no doubt about it." ...|$|E

This could mean that some observational error bars are under-estimated. Discarding the most discrepant about 5 % of the measurements generally alleviates but does not completely resolve this problem. While the results derived from the different <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> are not identical, they are mostly consistent, and a reasonable summary of the median statistics analyses is 0. 2 <= Omega_m 0 <= 0. 35 at two standard deviations.
