The Geneva-based oversight mechanism will be an independent non-profit association under Swiss law. The overarching purpose of this Association is to promote the responsible provision of private security services and {{respect for human rights}} and national and international law by exercising independent governance and oversight of the ICoC.The main organs of the oversight association are a General Assembly and a Board of Directors. While all members - private security companies, civil society organizations, and states (the three ‘pillars’) - form part of the General Assembly, the Board of Directors consists of twelve elected members. The Board of Directors is the executive decision-making body of the Association. Members of each ‘pillar’ are equally represented in the Board of Directors. The main tasks and competencies of the Association are (a) <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> under the Code attesting that a company’s systems and policies meet the Code’s principles and the standards derived from the Code, (b) human-rights-oriented monitoring of company performance and of the impact of security operations, and(c) maintaining a process to support member companies in discharging their commitments to address claims alleging violations of the Code by establishing fair and accessible grievance procedures that offer effective remedies.|$|E

The <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> according to the standard ISO 50001 : 2011 (“Energy management systems - Requirements and guidelines for use”), can represent {{a key element in}} the achievement of objectives set in the 20 - 20 - 20 Climate-Energy Package. This paper illustrates the state of implementation of ISO 50001 certifications in Italy, reporting on the results of a questionnaire carried out {{as a part of a}} master's thesis project at Sapienza, University of Rome in collaboration with FIRE (Italian Federation for the Rational Use of Energy) that included the major certification bodies, certified companies and consultants. The purpose is to outline the current situation, identify the perspectives and highlight the pros and cons related to the implementation of an Energy Management System (EnMS). The big picture shows that Italy, one of the leading countries in energy efficiency policies, suffers from a significant delay in the implementation of the EnMS in industry with respect to Germany. The results of the survey also show that the definition of energy performance indicators, as well as the individuations of an energy baseline and a monitoring plan constitute the requirements most critical to comply with for companies than for consultants. It also appears that more than 35 % of companies already ISO 50001 certified have received benefits in terms of cumulative energy saving above 5 %, and that the main reason why they have implemented an EnMS is related to the potential impact on increasing the competitiveness of the core business...|$|E

40|$|Business {{excellence}} {{has become}} the strongest means of achieving competitive advantage <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> while total management of quality {{has become the}} road that ensures support of excellent results recognized by many world companies. Despite many differences, we can conclude that models have many common elements. By the audit in 2005, the DP and MBNQA moved the focus from excellence of product, i. e service, onto the excellence of quality of the entire organization process. Thus, the quality got strategic dimension instead of technical one and the accent passed from the technical quality on the total excellence of all organization processes. The joint movement goes to the direction of good management and appreciation of systems thinking. The very structure of EFOM model criteria itself is adjusted to strategic dimension of quality {{and that is why}} the model underwent only short audits within the criteria themselves. Essentially, the model remained unchanged. In all models, the accent is on the satisfaction of buyers, employees and community. National rewards for quality have an important role in promotion and giving a prize to excellence in organization performances. Moreover, they raise quality standards <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> and the country profile as a whole.
