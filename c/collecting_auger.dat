40|$|Besides {{magnetism}} is {{a largely}} investigated eld, atomic level origin of magnetic properties in condensed matter still remain not completely understood. In recent {{years it has}} been claimed that macroscopic magnetic manifestations are strongly dictated by the atomic scale behaviour, hence {{the study of the}} local properties seems to be the key for understanding magnetism. Unfortunately several and controversial experimental results, obtained using different techniques which rely on the exsistance of the long-range order, have contributed in preventing to obtain a unique vision of local magnetic properties. Among all, a still largely debated issue is understanding whether or not the magnetic order, existing at long-range below the transition temperature, is lost crossing the critical point even at short-range, that means on the atomic scale. This thesis work has been devoted to the investigation of the local properties of mag- netic thin lms, examinating the nal state spin multiplet contributions exploiting the unique capability of the Auger Photo-Electron Coincidence Spectroscopy (APECS) of access the multiplet spin con guration in a spin-selective fashion once performed in an angle-resolved (AR-APECS) mode. Because of its local sensitivity, which extends on the scale of the atomic wavefunction, APECS is a suitable tool to investigate magnetism from a local viewpoint. By using linearly polarised synchrotron radiation and the unique experimental cham- ber of the ALOISA beamline, AR-APECS has been performed to investigate the M 23 V V Auger transition both on ferromgnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems. The attention has been focused on 3 d transition metals and their oxides. For such systems the valence 3 d levels are responsible for their magnetic properties, hence valence electron correlation contains also information on magnetic behaviour. The M 23 V V Auger partial yield in coincidence with 3 p photoelectrons from NiO/Ag(001) has been collected both below and above the N eel temperature of the lm. Combining the dipole and Auger selection rules with the angular distribution of the emitted electrons AR-APECS gives the possibility to access the local spin con guration of the Auger nal state spin coupling. Electron-pairs have been collected upon changing kinematics conditions allowing to probe different nal spin states and achieving the so called high-spin (triplet) versus low-spin (singlet) selectivity. Two different geometries have been took into account, the AN in which the photoelectron is collected aligned and the Auger electron not aligned (at an angle larger than 20 â—¦) with respect to the light polarisation vector and the NN in which both the electrons are collected in directions not aligned with it. Such geometries have led to a magnetic dichroism when the sample was probed at a temperature lower than the N eel value, but this asymmetry has collapsed once the critical point has been exceeded. The presence of magnetic moments affects the AR- APECS dichroic effect (DEAR-APECS) via matrix elements. AR-APECS cross-section for spin-polarised atomic targets contains three relevant kinematic vectors, the momenta of the two emitted electrons and the magnetisation. Changes in one of these vectors is responsible for changes in the AR-APECS spectra. Because the only difference affecting the measurements below and above the N eel point is the temperature of the sample, which in turns involves only the magnetisation, the observed collapse of the dichroism in AR-APECS is an evidence for the loss of local magnetic order. An analogous behaviour, i. e. a strongly reduction of the asymmetry in AR-APECS spectra crossing the transition temperature, has been observed also in the case of FM systems. The M 23 V V Auger electrons in coincidence with 3 p photoelectrons have been collected both for Fe/Ag and Ni/Cu, probing their ferromagnetic phase. For Ni the coincidence spectra have been collected for two different lm thicknesses and also above the Curie point. In this case the occurrance of DEAR-APECS <b>collecting</b> <b>Auger</b> electrons emitted in the decay of the M 23 core-hole, in the same two AN and NN geometries, results different with respect to the case of AFM, revealing a different degree of electron correlation. For these metals DEAR-APECS shows itself as an asymmetry in the main line, but more relevantly, as a feature which could be associated to a high-binding energy resonance. The spectrum of FM systems requires both the self-convolution of the density of states and the Cini-Sawatzky theory to be fully interpreted, thus revealing the nature of both the band-like main line transition and the presence of an atomic-like localised state in the valence band which is characterised by a large correlation. TheM 23 V V Auger transition of Fe has been collected also with the FM layer in contact with an AFM phase, namely CoO, showing differences with respect to what observed {{in the case of a}} non magnetic substrate. Changes in the band structure imply changes in magnetic and transport properties. In the proposed experiments AR-APECS has shown itself as a suitable tool to monitor the magnetic phase transition from a local viewpoint without rely on crystal periodicity or thermodynamics arguments. The results reported just above are an hint for the collapse of the local magnetisation and constitute a valuable contribute in solving the issue about the collapse of the magnetic order crossing the transition temperature. The different degree in electron correlation affecting both FM and AFM systems has been revealed, particularly showing the presence of a localised state in the valence band of metals samples, which existance have to be included in the theories about FM systems. Supported by a dedicated theory these experiments should be able to unravel the nature of the M 23 V V Auger transition for both FM and AFM systems, but unfortunately, a uni ed theory describing AR-APECS in magnetic systems has not been developed yet, but these experimental results are very encouraging to a theoretical challenge...|$|E
5000|$|Surface {{sensitivity}} in AES {{arises from}} the fact that emitted electrons usually have energies ranging from 50 eV to 3 keV and at these values, electrons have a short mean free path in a solid. The escape depth of electrons is therefore localized to within a few nanometers of the target surface, giving AES an extreme sensitivity to surface species. Because of the low energy of Auger electrons, most AES setups are run under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Such measures prevent electron scattering off of residual gas atoms as well as the formation of a thin [...] "gas (adsorbate) layer" [...] {{on the surface of the}} specimen, which degrades analytical performance. A typical AES setup is shown schematically in figure 2. In this configuration, focused electrons are incident on a sample and emitted electrons are deflected into a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA). In the detection unit, Auger electrons are multiplied and the signal sent to data processing electronics. <b>Collected</b> <b>Auger</b> electrons are plotted as a function of energy against the broad secondary electron background spectrum.|$|R

The process was being developed to replace one that used vapor degreasing with trichlorotrifluoroethane, an ozone-depleting substance. A Box-Behnken experimental design was used to generate data from which the oxygen plasma cleaning process could be characterized. Auger electron spectrophotometry was used to measure the contamination thickness on the dice after cleaning. An empirical equation correlating the contamination thickness on the die surface with the operating parameters of the plasma system was developed from the <b>collected</b> <b>Auger</b> data, and optimum settings for cleaning semiconductor devices were determined. Devices were also tested for undesirable changes in electrical parameters resulting from cleaning in the plasma system. An increase in leakage current occurred for bipolar transistors and diodes after exposure to the oxygen plasma. Although an increase in leakage current occurred, each device`s parameter remained well below the acceptable specification limit. Based upon the experimental results, the optimum settings for the plasma cleaning process were determined to be 200 watts of power applied for five minutes in an enclosure maintained at 0. 7 torr. At these settings, all measurable contamination was removed without compromising the reliability of the devices...|$|R

5000|$|Most of {{the actual}} {{resurfacing}} components are contained in a heavy device {{at the rear of}} the machine, known as the [...] "conditioner". The conditioner is hydraulically lowered to the ice surface, its weight providing the friction necessary for a large, sharp blade (similar to those used in industrial paper cutters) to shave off the top layer of ice. A horizontal <b>auger</b> <b>collects</b> these ice shavings, or snow, and funnels them to a vertical auger at the center of the conditioner. The shavings are then carried upward and sprayed into a large snow container, which takes up most of the volume of the resurfacer. In early models, a paddle-and-chain conveyor was used instead of a second, vertical auger. The height of the blade can be adjusted by the driver, allowing deeper or shallower cuts. This is useful for keeping the ice sheet level, improving the quality of the cut, and preventing the snow container from overflowing.|$|R

To assess the fresh solid waste composition, a total of 60 fresh solid waste samples (three samples from each zone per day) from the four different zones of Trichy city were collected for 5 Â days from the truck discharge point to the dumping site. For composition of {{municipal solid}} waste in the old dumping area (greater than 3 Â years), samples were <b>collected</b> using <b>auger</b> boring. For representative sample collection, the entire old dumping area was divided into number of grids and boreholes were drilled with a 15 -cm manual auger up to 3 Â m. Solid waste samples were collected at every 1.5 Â m interval (top surface, 1.5 Â m and 3 Â m depth from top surface). Samples were properly labeled and brought to the laboratory for analysis. A total of 30 samples were collected from the dumping site from ten locations. The solid waste sampling locations in old dumping area are also shown in Fig.Â  1. The collected fresh solid waste and waste from old dumping area were segregated into different categories viz. paper, plastics, metals, glass, debris, vegetables, textiles, etc. The segregated samples were weighed individually. The mean of the solid waste composition was calculated using the results of the composition of each of the sorting samples (Gidarakos et al. 2005). The solid waste was characterized with regard to its constitutive moisture content by oven drying (at 105 Â Â°C during 24 Â h). The moisture content was expressed as the ratio of the mass of constitutive water to the mass of solid particles (Laurent et al. 2005).|$|R

The objective {{of the study was to}} assess the potential impact on downstream groundwater quality. The tailings dam footprint overlies dolomite and quartzite aquifers. The footprint is also located over the watersheds of three separate catchments. For the purposes of predictive modelling the footprint was subdivided into three sections and separately modelled.

A transect of 125 m was studied in the late Pleistocene sedimentary lobe of the fluvial fan, where four landform elements were identified (paleo-channel, paleo-levee, paleo-floodplain and mound) and described to show the soil horizon boundaries along the landform unit. Samples were <b>collected</b> from trenches, <b>auger</b> holes, and boreholes, and were analyzed for soil description and characterization. Soil analyses carried out were: macro- and micromorphological, physical, chemical, mineralogical, C isotope fractionation, and OSL dating analyses. The set of evidence shows that the studied transect originated from Pleistocene sediments due to the activity of the SÃ£o LourenÃ§o fluvial fan. The following soil-landform element relationships developed: Quartzipsamments in the paleo-channel; Plinthaquults in the paleo-levee and paleo-floodplain and; Natrustalfs in the mound.

40|$|In the {{subtropical}} {{regions of}} southern Brazil, rainfall distribution is uneven, {{which results in}} temporal variability of soil water storage. For grapes, water is generally available in excess and water deficiency occurs only occasionally. Furthermore, on the Southern Plateau of Santa Catarina, {{there are differences in}} soil properties, which results in high spatial variability. These two factors affect the composition of wine grapes. Spatio-temporal analyses are therefore useful in the selection of cultural practices as well as of adequate soils for vineyards. In this way, well-suited areas can produce grapes with a more appropriate composition for the production of quality wines. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the spatio-temporal variability of water storage in a Cambisol during the growth cycle of a Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard and its relation to selected soil properties. The experimental area consisted of a commercial 8 -year-old vineyard in SÃ£o Joaquim, Santa Catarina, Brazil. A sampling grid with five rows and seven points per row, spaced 12 m apart, was outlined on an area of 3, 456 mÂ². Soil samples were <b>collected</b> with an <b>auger</b> at these points, 0. 30 m away from the grapevines, in the 0. 00 - 0. 30 m layer, to determine gravimetric soil moisture. Measurements were taken once a week from December 2008 to April 2009, and every two weeks from December 2009 to March 2010. In December 2008, undisturbed soil samples were collected to determine bulk density, macro- and microporosity, and disturbed samples were used to quantify particle size distribution and organic carbon content. Results were subjected to descriptive analysis and semivariogram analysis, calculating the mean relative difference and the Pearson correlation. The average water storage in a Cambisol under grapevine on ridges had variable spatial dependence, i. e., the lower the average water storage, the higher the range of spatial dependence. Water storage had a stable spatial pattern during the trial period, indicating that the points with lower water storage or points with higher water storage during a certain period maintain these conditions throughout the experimental period.

The present work aimed at optimizing the acquisition procedure of visible and near {{infrared reflectance}} (VNIR) spectra of topsoils (0 - 20 cm) in the field, in order to predict usual soil properties. The studied set included 201 samples originating from six fields in different regions of large-scale crop cultivation in France. Spectra were acquired using a portable spectrophotometer. Spectrum acquisition procedures included scanning on the soil surface, on raw or smoothed (cut) cores <b>collected</b> using an <b>auger,</b> and on clods resulting from core crumbling. In addition, spectra were also acquired on air-dried clods, either 2 -mm sieved or not (laboratory conditions). Furthermore, 42 mathematic pretreatments were compared (including derivatives, standard normal variate SNV, multiplicative scatter correction MSC, etc.). Identifying the most appropriate scanning and pretreatment procedures was done through four-group cross-validation. Using the most appropriate pretreatment calcium carbonate content was very well predicted whatever the scanning procedure used (RPD = 6. 9 - 9. 1; RPD is the ratio of standard deviation to standard error of crossvalidation; for soil properties RPD > 2 denotes accurate predictions); good predictions were achieved for total nitrogen (RPD = 2. 5 - 3. 0), organic matter (RPD = 2. 1 - 2. 8) and exchangeable potassium (RPD = 2. 9 - 3. 2); but available phosphorus was poorly predicted (RPD = 1. 6 - 1. 8). Except for available phosphorus, accurate predictions of these properties could therefore be achieved whatever the scanning procedure used, thus in the field. Best predictions were often obtained using spectra acquired on 2 -mm sieved air-dried samples (i. e. in laboratory conditions), otherwise using spectra acquired on raw cores. Acquiring spectra on cores, on raw cores especially, was the most appropriate field procedure; it led to predictions comparably accurate to those achieved in the laboratory with 2 -mm sieved air-dried samples. Similar prediction accuracy for field and laboratory VNIRS is counterintuitive due to variable field conditions (moisture, temperature, stoniness, etc.). It might result from higher number of replicates in the field than in the laboratory (often inherent to field vs. lab conditions) and/or higher sample density and cohesion, which would improve reflectance signal. For spectra acquired on cores, best calibrations were achieved with MSC and first derivatives for calcium carbonate, total nitrogen and organic matter, but without pretreatment for exchangeable potassium and available phosphorus. Second derivatives always yielded poor results...|$|R
