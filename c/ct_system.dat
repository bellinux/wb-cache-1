40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} dose reduction in combination with iterative reconstruction (IR) on coronary calcium scores (CCS) in a dynamic phantom on state-of-the-art <b>CT</b> <b>systems</b> from different manufacturers. Calcified inserts in an anthropomorphic chest phantom were translated at 20 mm/s corresponding to heart rates between 60 and 75 bpm. The inserts were scanned five times with routinely used CCS protocols at reference dose and 40 and 80 % dose reduction on four high-end <b>CT</b> <b>systems.</b> Filtered back projection (FBP) and increasing levels of IR were applied. Noise levels were determined. CCS, quantified as Agatston and mass scores, were compared to physical mass and scores at FBP reference dose. For the reference dose in combination with FBP, noise level variation between <b>CT</b> <b>systems</b> was less than 18 %. Decreasing dose almost always resulted in increased CCS, while at increased levels of IR, CCS decreased again. The influence of IR on CCS was smaller than the influence of dose reduction. At reference dose, physical mass was underestimated 3 - 30 %. All <b>CT</b> <b>systems</b> showed similar CCS at 40 % dose reduction in combinations with specific reconstructions. For some <b>CT</b> <b>systems</b> CCS was not affected at 80 % dose reduction, in combination with IR. This multivendor study showed that radiation dose reductions of 40 % did not influence CCS in a dynamic phantom using state-of-the-art <b>CT</b> <b>systems</b> in combination with specific reconstruction settings.

40|$|Recently X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) has {{successfully}} entered {{the field of}} industrial quality control, with interesting applications also for metal casting industry, including non-destructive testing and dimensional metrology. In particular, CT benefits of several advantages with respect to traditional dimensional measuring systems, as for example: simultaneous dimensional quality control and material quality control, non-destructive inspection of internal as well as external geometries, and reconstruction of complete and high-density point-clouds in relatively short time. Due to these advantages, CT is increasingly recognised as a very promising non-contact measuring technique and, therefore, several manufacturers and research centres are now investing in the further development of metrological <b>CT</b> <b>systems</b> and in widening their application in industry. This paper investigates accuracy and traceability of dimensional measurements carried out by state of-the- art industrial <b>CT</b> <b>systems,</b> by examining selected results obtained from the “CT Audit” project, {{which is the first}} international interlaboratory comparison of <b>CT</b> <b>systems</b> for dimensional metrology.

Final plant emergence and growth and yield parameters were measured. The final plant emergence was higher with the <b>CT</b> <b>systems</b> compared to CN at Arlington, while the final plant emergence of the NT system was lower than other tillage systems at Hancock. Plant height, leaf area, and dry matter per plant early in the growing season, for both locations ranked: CN > TP ^ CH > NT, and in most cases were significantly different. However, {{at the end of the}} growing season, these growth parameters were not significantly different. Days from planting to 50 % silking for the NT system were significantly delayed by 2 to 3 and 4 days at Arlington and Hancock, respectively. No-till had the highest grain moisture content.

40|$|Centrifugal training, {{based on}} the {{extinction}} procedure, is an innovative type of apple tree training recently used in French apple orchards. The thinning cut of fruiting spurs along the trunk and on the proximal and underside parts of the fruiting branches modifies the within-tree leaf density and light environment, {{which is likely to}} affect the development of some apple pests and pathogens. In this study, the development of the most serious foliar pests (aphids, mites) and disease (apple scab) was assessed over 3 years in an organic apple orchard with two training systems: the centrifugal training (<b>CT)</b> <b>system,</b> and the original Solaxe (OS) system, using a bent axis with no removal of fruiting spurs, as a control. Infestation levels were significantly lower in 2002 and 2004 in the <b>CT</b> <b>system</b> than in the OS system for the most prevalent pest, the rosy aphid, Dysaphis plantaginea, and in 2003 for the red spider mite, Panonychus ulmi. Infestation by the green apple aphid, Aphis pomi, was higher in June 2002 and June 2004 and lower in 2003 in the <b>CT</b> <b>system,</b> compared to the control. The incidence of leaf scab was lower in the <b>CT</b> <b>system</b> than in the control in Spring 2002 and Spring 2004; but, later in the Summer, it increased more in CT trees, resulting in no difference between training systems in the level of fruit infection at harvest.
