5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It {{depended}} on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German <b>capitalized</b> all nouns, while others <b>capitalized</b> more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are <b>capitalized</b> owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often antiqua).|$|E

5000|$|Many European {{languages}} traditionally <b>capitalize</b> nouns and pronouns used {{to refer}} to God, including references to Jesus Christ (reverential capitals): hallowed be Thy name, look what He has done. Some English authors <b>capitalize</b> any word referring to God: the Lamb, the Almighty; some <b>capitalize</b> [...] "Thy Name". These practices have become much less common in English in the 20th and 21st centuries.|$|R
30|$|Deviating {{from the}} case of {{voluntary}} adoption of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act, companies regularly {{make the decision to}} <b>capitalize</b> these costs or not on a yearly basis for periods after the German Accounting Law Modernization Act. However, we only checked financial statements in the adoption year since there was no possibility to <b>capitalize</b> R&D costs before, and it is highly probable that companies that plan to <b>capitalize</b> R&D costs will <b>capitalize</b> such costs in the adoption year. Additionally, {{it is important to consider}} that only companies with R&D activities have the option to <b>capitalize.</b> Therefore, we restrict our subsample to companies with R&D activities in the adoption year, and we employ our probit regression approach for this sample of voluntary and mandatory adopters in the adoption year, based on Eq. (9). Then, we estimate propensity scores, which reflect the probability of <b>capitalizing</b> R&D costs. Consistent with our previous approach, we include all firm-year observations of those companies that are either in the treatment or control group.|$|R

[...] AMA style <b>capitalizes</b> [...] "Internet", and so does The Chicago Manual of Style. The Modern Language Association's MLA Handbook does not specifically mention capitalization of Internet, but its consistent practice is to <b>capitalize</b> it.|$|R
5|$|Kent State went three-and-out {{on their}} first drive of the second quarter. Northern Illinois' ensuing drive <b>capitalized</b> on their strong field {{position}} (their own 41-yard line) by executing a 6-play, 59-yard drive that culminated in a 14-yard pass from Jordan Lynch to Martel Moore that tied the game at 10. Kent State committed another miscue on their next drive, throwing an interception to Dechane Durante. Northern Illinois again <b>capitalized,</b> {{this time with a}} 12-play, 58-yard drive culminating with a 1-yard rush by Akeem Daniels. That drive would be the final scoring drive of the half, at which the score was Northern Illinois Huskies 17, Kent State Golden Flashes 10.|$|E
5|$|When {{referring}} to the language, the name is normally <b>capitalized</b> (Perl) as a proper noun. When {{referring to}} the interpreter program itself, the name is often uncapitalized (perl) because most Unix-like file systems are case-sensitive. Before {{the release of the}} first edition of Programming Perl, it was common to refer to the language as perl; Randal L. Schwartz, however, <b>capitalized</b> the language's name in the book to make it stand out better when typeset. This case distinction was subsequently documented as canonical.|$|E
5|$|A 19-yard {{punt return}} by Mikey Henderson put Georgia into good field position. Stafford <b>capitalized</b> on the opportunity, {{completing}} a 26-yard pass to put Georgia into field-goal range.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} managers' {{decisions}} to <b>capitalize</b> or expense R&D expenditures convey {{information about the}} future performance of the firm. Focusing on a French setting where managers can choose to <b>capitalize</b> R&D expenditures under certain circumstances, we find that, after controlling for industry effects, firms that <b>capitalize</b> R&D expenditures spend less on R&D, have more volatile R&D efforts, and are smaller and more leveraged than firms that expense R&D expenditures. We also find that capitalizers <b>capitalize</b> R&D outlays {{when they need to}} meet or beat thresholds. Finally, we show that the decision to <b>capitalize</b> R&D is generally associated with a negative or neutral impact on future performance, even after controlling for self-selection. Our results also show that when firms both <b>capitalize</b> and expense R&D expenditures, the expensed portion exhibits a stronger (and negative) relationship with future performance. Market-based tests corroborate these findings. While we cannot unambiguously establish whether our findings imply that management uses R&D capitalization to manage earnings or because it is unable to estimate the earning power of R&D projects, our results suggest that management is unable to truthfully convey information about future performance through its decision to <b>capitalize</b> R&D. Our findings, based on real data as opposed to simulated data, therefore contrast with previous supportive evidence in favor of capitalization in the literature. ...|$|R

50|$|In past centuries, orthographic {{practices}} in English varied widely. Capitalization {{was much less}} standardized than today.

40|$|<b>Capitalizing</b> on the company's crucial {{knowledge}} {{is an important}} operation for company's success. The first step in knowledge <b>capitalizing</b> is to identify the crucial knowledge for which <b>capitalizing</b> operation is required. The crucial knowledge identification is an ill-structured and multi-criteria problem. In this paper, the crucial knowledge identification problem is structured according to the well-known Simon's decision making process. Then, a decision support system (DSS), called K-DSS, is developed to support this decision process. The main objectives of this paper are to introduce the crucial knowledge identification decision process, to present the conceptual and functional architectures of K-DSS and to illustrate its utility through a real-world case study conducted in an automobile company.

5|$|During {{his primary}} victories, McGovern used an {{approach}} that stressed grassroots-level organization while bypassing conventional campaign techniques and traditional party power centers. He <b>capitalized</b> on support from anti-war activists and reform liberals; thousands of students engaged in door-to-door campaigning for him. He benefited by the eight primaries he won being those the press focused on the most; he showed electoral weakness in the South and industrial Midwest, and actually received fewer primary votes overall than Humphrey and had only a modest edge over Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Enron <b>capitalized</b> the Raptors, and, in {{a manner}} similar to the {{accounting}} employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not <b>capitalized</b> as much as it could have been.|$|E

5|$|McCarty {{originally}} {{committed to}} Boise State University and {{played for the}} Broncos. In 2003, he was given redshirt status and did not play. McCarty played a limited role the following year, but <b>capitalized</b> on the opportunities he was given, rushing for 104 yards on only 10 carries. His only touchdown came on a 7-yard carry in the October 24 game against the Fresno State Bulldogs. The Bulldogs finished with an 11–1 season in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Storage Equities {{was founded}} by Public Storage in 1980 to {{purchase}} self-storage facilities. It was one of 17 self-storage REITs that Public Storage held an interest in. Between 1992 and 1995, Storage Equities paid Public Storage $31 million in management and consulting fees. In 1995, Public Storage and its subsidiaries were merged with its self-storage REIT, Storage Equities Inc., and re-structured as a single REIT called Public Storage Inc. One analyst said the acquisition <b>capitalized</b> on conflict of interest concerns, while Hughes said the merger {{was set up to}} alleviate them.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} {{brought the}} score to 41–26 with 11:29 {{remaining in the}} game. Florida State received the post-touchdown kickoff, then benefited from a 10-yard holding penalty against Virginia Tech. Three subsequent plays failed to gain another first down, however, and on fourth down, a pass by Manuel was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Davon Morgan {{and returned to the}} Florida State 34-yard line. With 9:29 remaining, Virginia Tech's offense entered the game. The Hokies went three-and-out, but <b>capitalized</b> on the good starting field position by kicking a 43-yard field goal that increased their lead to 44–26.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the vins de pays, a classification produced under less stringent regulations than those of an AOC, opened up the Languedoc wine industry to the labeling of varietal wines and the blending of international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Chardonnay. Examples include Vin de pays d'Oc, Vin de pays d'Aude, Vin de pays de l'Hérault, and Vin de Pays du Gard. Winemakers such as Guy Anderson, Thierry Boudinaud and E. & J. Gallo Winery <b>capitalized</b> on this new horizon, producing wines like FAT bastard and Red Bicyclette.|$|E
5|$|Game six was a Canadian 3–2 victory. There was no scoring {{during the}} first period. Lyapkin scored the first goal at 1:12 of the second period, but the Canadians' {{confidence}} did not waver. The Canadians caught the Soviets in a lapse and scored three goals in a one-and-a-half-minute span to take a 3–1 lead. Hull flipped a rebound over Tretiak to tie the score after Gilbert had <b>capitalized</b> on a Soviet giveaway. Cournoyer scored on a set-up from behind the net by Berenson.
