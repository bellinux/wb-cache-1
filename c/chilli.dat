5000|$|Sheikh <b>Chilli's</b> Tomb: This {{monument}} {{is maintained}} by the Archaeological Survey of India. It was built during the Mughal era in remembrance of Sufi Saint Sheikh Chehli, {{believed to be the}} spiritual teacher of Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh.

There is another theory that the site of the supposed 'makbara' or tomb was one of the meditative 'Chillas' or sites of Hazrat Mian Mir Sahib, who might have visited the area during his wanderings. It is possible that a later caretaker, some disciple of the Hazrat/Sheikh lies buried here, at the place sanctified by his 'Chilla'.|$|R
