40|$|ABSTRACT: The triboelectric {{effect is}} known for many centuries {{and it is the}} cause of many {{charging}} phenomena. However, it has not been utilized for energy harvesting until very recently. 1 − 5 Here we developed a new principle of triboelectric generator (TEG) based on a fully contacted, sliding electrification process, which lays a fundamentally new mechanism for designing universal, high-performance TEGs to harvest diverse forms of mechanical energy in our daily life. Relative displacement between two sliding surfaces of opposite triboelectric polarities generates uncompensated surface triboelectric charges; the corresponding polarization created a voltage drop that results in a flow of induced electrons between electrodes. Grating of linear rows on the sliding surfaces enables substantial enhancements of total <b>charges,</b> <b>output</b> current, and current frequency. The TEG was demonstrated to be an efficient power source for simultaneously driving a number of small electronics. The principle established in this work can be applied to TEGs of different configurations that accommodate the needs of harvesting energy and/or sensing from diverse mechanical motions, such as contacted sliding, lateral translation, and rotation/rolling...|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} {{is used for}} controlling the internal node in the pre charging path in a sequential element. It has been seen to reduce the system power.

The clk input to the PMOS will <b>charge</b> the <b>output</b> node to high when clk is low. If D input is already high, {{there is no need to}} <b>charge</b> the <b>output</b> to high again. Thus, if one can control this behaviour there can be a power reduction in the flop. To control the internal node in the precharge path, a control switch is used as shown in Fig 1.

As one of the input to flops is the clock, considering the clock (Clock signal) is the element that makes the most transition in a system, a technique such as conditional precharging can significantly help reduce power.|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{report is}} based on the changing available charge capacity (electron count) of a battery by the average current demand, by using Peukert's Law. The battery capacity written on packaging wasn't found to be constant, as Peukert's Law states that high current demand from a battery decreases the number of electrons that the battery can provide. Thus, <b>charge</b> <b>output</b> and runtime aren't linearly correlated - current demands decrease the <b>charge</b> <b>output</b> in a curved fashion. The power that this curve is raised to is called the Peukert constant. This paper found the Peukert constant for GP 2700 Series Rechargable battery to be 1. 174. The greater this constant is, the greater the electron losses. Results are directly applicable to battery performance. Increasing currents are found to drain the battery exponentially (eg. doubling the current empties the battery not twice, but more than twice as fast). Thus, making energy-e�cient mobile devices will not only save energy, but will make more potential energy available to the device. Most importantly, expecting to obtain the rated (advertised) battery capacity regardless of current is ungrounded, while capacity is a function of current draft abiding by Peukert's Law. This report analyzes 10 trials of collected current and runtime data by changing current drafts (through varying resistances) to utilize the mathematical model leading to the calculation of the Peukert constant...|$|E
