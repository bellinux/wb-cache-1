40|$|This paper re-examines {{a problem}} of {{congested}} inputs in the Chinese automobile and textile industries, which was identified by Cooper et al. [5]. Since these authors employed a single approach in measuring congestion, it is worth exploring whether alternative procedures would yield very different outcomes. Indeed, the measurement of congestion {{is an area where}} there has been much theoretical debate but relatively little empirical work. After examining the theoretical properties of the two main approaches currently available, those of Färe et al. [18] and Cooper et al., we use the data set assembled by Cooper et al. for the period 1981  1997 to compare and contrast the measurements of congestion generated by these alternative approaches. We find that the results are strikingly different, especially in terms of the amount of congestion identified. Finally, we discuss the new approach to measuring <b>congestion</b> proposed by <b>Tone</b> and Sahoo [29]...|$|R
