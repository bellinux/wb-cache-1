40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{as a result of}} {{increasing}} concern for water resource availability, the complexity of aquatic sensing applications has increased as a result of demands for: 1) broad spatial coverage and high spatial resolution monitoring, 2) capability for resolving fine scale spatiotemporal dynamics and 3) the need for rapid system deployment with automatic operations. Current research is aimed at the implementation of a four cabled Aquatic Networked InfoMechanical Systems (NIMS-AQ) in a kinematically redundant configuration. This configuration requires active cable tension control, which is accomplished by means of a <b>cantilevered</b> <b>load</b> cell and a PID controller. System positioning is controlled by adjusting the tension levels {{in each of the four}} cables to generate the desired net force on the end-effector. Tension configurations are not unique (due to kinematic redundancy) and the optimal configuration is found by means of a novel approach that reduces the problem to a two-dimensional linear programming optimization (in real-time). Real-time, three-dimensional control coupled with underwater sonar enables NIMS-AQ to perform precise, autonomous calibration and environmental characterization (spatial and semantic mapping). Dedicated on-board sonar ensures high fidelity monitoring of the underwater environment, greatly expediting experimental design and system setup. Efficient, accurate system control and environmental characterization help realize an Autonomous Iterative experimental Design for Environmental Applications (A-IDEA) conjunctive network. IDEA provides a methodology for in-field adaptation of experimental design to perform detailed characterization of the spatiotemporal distribution of the observed environment. This involves an in-field adaptation in the experiment design to capture phenomena dynamics exploiting observations from prior models, iteratively executed experiments and the behavior of the underlying control processes (if known) ...|$|E
30|$|Honed by {{continuous}} {{trial and}} error and juxtaposing the experiences of past events, vernacular technology has appreciably contributed in terms of resilience and sustainable construction in suburban and rural Nepal. Use of local materials, manpower and technology has brought a unique trend of construction in Nepal in terms of vernacular technology. Each physiographic unit has own tradition of vernacular dwellings. In Terai, people seek some dimensions of construction with regard to flood resilience primarily, so they have been constructing houses with raised platform. Such houses with raised platform are usually of one to two storied and having less weight. Thermal comfort is also ensured through use of locally casted partitioning materials. Relatively durable timber like Shorea robusta (“Agrakh”) is used for such construction. The housing technology also incorporates many aspects of earthquake resistant features like symmetrical construction, high ductility, proper binding of housing units, among others. Such features were developed from continuous {{trial and error}} efforts after several past disaster events. In the case of hills, people have developed a tradition of one to two storied constructions with proper use of symmetrical rounded configuration. Earthquake resilient technology is proven through implementation of elements like struts, timber bands, low storey height and smaller openings, mainstreamed <b>cantilevered</b> <b>load</b> on structural walls, subsequent load reduction in upper stories, proper connection of roof with other structural system, among others. Leveled foundation is also a characteristic practice in hills even if the terrain is not leveled. Nepal, being an underdeveloped country, has weak framework of disaster resilient construction and execution in rural setups and suburbs. Even in the urban areas, the NBC is surpassed by the Indian Standard codes of practice due to high dependence of NBC into IS code. Thus, it is obvious that, there is lack of proper mechanism to govern the local construction technology. People have developed themselves some unique features of construction which are proven to be earthquake resilient against prevalent disasters of small to medium scales. There are still several things lagging in vernacular construction technology, beside this the remarkable features from vernacular practice might be instrumental in governing and assuring disaster resilient construction technology economically and locally in greater extent. People, if devised {{with regard to the}} remarkable features of such construction and provided with some additional low cost features like lateral supports (buttresses), improved local binding materials, configuration, site selection, among others; resilience could be remarkably enhanced. Such construction framework would be surely cost-effective due to use of local materials and also culturally sound through reflection of local customs replicated in households. Many of the global paradigms have shown remarkable performance of vernacular houses during past disaster events, so replication, modification, blending with modern concepts, incorporating in building codes and construction guidelines could be pivotal in assuring disaster resilience in suburbs and rural setups. As most of the people are not able to pay for modern sophisticated engineered constructions, they will continue to construct similar types of structures hence their performance evaluation and strengthening frameworks are needed for assuring safety, patrimony and resilience.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the biomechanical behavior of immediately loaded implants in an edentulous mandible according to the "All-on-Four" concept. METHODS: A 3 D-finite element model of an edentulous mandible was constructed. Four implants were placed between the bilateral mental foramen according to "All-on-Four" concept. A framework made of titanium or acrylic resin between the bilateral first molars was modeled. Immediate loading and a delayed loading protocol were simulated. A vertical load of 200 N was applied at the cantilever or on the abutments region of the distal implants, simulating the absence of a cantilever. RESULTS: The peak principal compressive strains in the immediate loading models resulted in 24. 0 - 35. 8 % and 26. 4 - 39. 0 % increases compared with the delayed loading models under non-cantilever <b>loading</b> and <b>cantilever</b> <b>loading,</b> respectively. The loading position greatly affected the principal compressive and tensile strain values. The peak principal compressive strains in non-cantilever loading resulted in a 45. 3 - 52. 6 % reduction compared with those in <b>cantilever</b> <b>loading.</b> The framework material did not influence the peak compressive and tensile strain. The maximum micromotion at the bone-implant interface in the immediate loading models was 7. 5 - 14. 4 μm. CONCLUSIONS: Mandibular fixed full-arch prostheses without cantilevers may result in a favorable reduction of the peri-implant bone strain during the healing period, compared with cantilevers. The maximum micromotion was within the acceptable limits for uneventful implant osseointegration in the immediate loading models. Framework material did not play an important role in reducing the peri-implant bone strain and micromotion at the bone-implant interface. 博士（医学）・乙第 1398 号・平成 29 年 3 月 15 日Copyright © 2016 Japan Prosthodontic Society.

50|$|The most {{important}} {{limit on the}} design of the wrapping machinery is the total combined weight of the equipment and the payload of cable. This weight is applied to the overhead line during the wrapping installation and so the host conductor and its supports must be capable of sustaining the extra load during the installation process. A typical limit is that the tension in the host conductor must not increase to more than 50% of its rated breaking strength during the wrapping installation. Other limits can apply as well, such as the bending loads on a cross-arm or <b>cantilever</b> <b>load</b> on a post insulator.

Two simplified computational methods, relying on standard modelling tools and regular finite elementsare explored and compared with the outcome of theoretical solutions retrieved from the literature andwith the results of full, computationally intensive, finite element analyses.
