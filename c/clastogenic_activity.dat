40|$|Clastogenic factors (CF) are diffusible {{molecules}} that damage DNA. They are generated within biological media {{by a variety}} of physical and chemical stimuli. Their nature and mechanism of action remain largely unknown. <b>Clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> can be experimentally generated by pulsed ultrasound treatment of human serum. To investigate whether oxygen radicals are involved in the <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> induced by sonication of human serum, we examined the effects on such <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of different oxygen radical scavengers added to human serum before and after sonication. Human serum was sonicated for 50 min at 24 microW/cm 2 by pulsed ultrasound. The <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of sonicated human serum was examined in {{the presence or absence of}} oxygen radical scavengers by measuring the amount of DNA damage induced in autologous human lymphocytes, assessed with the fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU). Sonication of human serum generated significant DNA damage in autologous lymphocytes (DNA unwinding averaged 31. 79 % +/- 2. 1 after sonication vs. 12. 82 % +/- 2. 6 in the controls, p < 0. 005). Superoxide dismutase (SOD; 500 I. U. /ml), catalase (500 I. U. /ml), mannitol (50 mM), and glutathione (50 mM) completely prevented DNA damage when added before serum sonication, whereas only mannitol (86 %) and glutathione (90 %) almost completely inhibited DNA damage when added after sonication. SOD and catalase had only a partial inhibitory effect when added after sonication (49 % and 63 %, respectively). The prevention of DNA damage was also obtained by an association of subliminal amounts of glutathione (20 mM) and vitamin E (1 I. U. /ml). These results suggest that the <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> generated by sonication of human serum is mediated by oxygen radicals...|$|E

40|$|Media from {{cultures}} of fibroblasts of six {{patients with the}} autosomal recessive disease Bloom syndrome (BS) and from four normal fibroblast strains were analyzed for <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> towards phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human blood lymphocytes from healthy donors. <b>Clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> was detected in concentrated ultrafiltrates of media from all six BS strains {{but none of the}} normal fibroblast strains. The frequencies of chromosomal aberrations that were induced depended on the concentration of the ultrafiltrates. Addition of bovine superoxide dismutase to the blood lymphocyte cultures strongly suppressed the clastogenic potency of the ultrafiltrates. Unconcentrated conditioned BS media were inactive. From the pore size of the ultrafilters and Sephadex G- 10 chromatography it is concluded that the clastogenic material is in the molecular weight range of 1000 to 10, 000. The concentrated ultrafiltrates of BS culture media also possessed the capacity to induce sister chromatid exchanges in normal human blood lymphocytes, but with relatively low efficiency. On the basis of these results and by analogy to certain collagen diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, we speculate that BS cells are deficient in the detoxification of active oxygen species...|$|E

40|$|Ferritin from horse spleen {{was found}} to cause severe chro mosome aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Ferritin at 15 to 170 jiÂ¿g/mlwas clastogenic and at higher doses was cytotoxic. At {{comparable}} concentrations of protein or iron, neither apoferritin nor complexed iron was clastogenic. Sulfhydryl compounds glutathione and cysteine reduced the cytotoxic and <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activities</b> of ferritin. Physiological concentrations of glutathione may normally be sufficient to protect cells from damage. The reducing agent ascorbate had little protective effect. Chelating agents varied in their inhibitory activity: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (hexadentate) > nitri-lotriacetic acid (tetradentate) > salicylate (bidentate). 2, 2 '-Bi-pyridyl enhanced the chromosome-damaging action of ferritin while histidine did not markedly alter the frequencies of aber rations.

This {{study examined the}} cytotoxic and <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activities</b> of glaucolide B in human cultured lymphocytes and in bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice. The mitotic index (MI) and chromosomal aberrations were analyzed in both of the above systems, whereas sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and the proliferation index (PI) were determined only in vitro. In human cultured lymphocytes, glaucolide B concentrations greater than 15 µg/ml of culture medium completely inhibited cell growth. At 4 µg/ml and 8 µg/ml of culture medium, glaucolide B significantly increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and was also cytotoxic at concentrations ³ 8 µg/ml; there was no increase {{in the frequency of}} SCE. Glaucolide B (160 - 640 mg/kg) did not significantly increase the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in mouse bone marrow cells nor did it affect cell division.

The present study searched for these factors in the plasma of 32 civil workers from Armenia, who had been engaged as ''liquidators'' around the Chernobyl atomic power station in 1986. It also included 15 liquidators who had emigrated from the ex-Soviet Union to Israel. Reference plasma samples were obtained from 41 blood donors from the Armenian Blood Center in Yerevan. The samples were tested for their <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> in blood cultures from healthy donors. The majority of results from the liquidators exceeded those from the unexposed reference samples. The samples from the first Armenian group, with the higher average irradiation dose (0. 6 +/- 0. 6 Gy), were more clastogenic than those from the second group exposed to 0. 2 +/- 0. 2 Gy. The number of aberrations in the test cultures was 17. 9 +/- 2. 9 % and 10. 5 +/- 3. 8 % respectively, compared to 5. 7 +/- 3. 2 % in the cultures exposed to the reference ultrafiltrates from Armenian blood donors. The samples from the Israeli liquidators also induced significantly increased aberration rates (14. 0 +/- 3. 9 % aberrant cells).

In order to assess the possible compounds responsible for the activities observed, we fractionated the ethanolic fruit extract of S. paniculatum, characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra, and evaluated two fractions containing steroidal alkaloids against mitomycin C (MMC) using the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. Swiss mice were orally treated with different concentrations (25, 50, or 100 mg. kg− 1) of each fraction simultaneously with a single intraperitonial dose of MMC (4 mg. kg− 1). Antigenotoxicity was evaluated by using the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE), whereas anticytotoxicity was assessed by the polychromatic and normochromatic erythrocytes ratio (PCE/NCE).

Furthermore, the observations on survival rate, tumour weight, its volume and body weight of EAT-bearing mice were made. The EAT-bearing paws were also evaluated for histopathological changes. Additional studies were undertaken on the cytological effects of anethole {{in order to}} establish its <b>clastogenic</b> and mitodepressive <b>activity</b> in normal mice. The results obtained in the present study revealed anethole to increase the survival time, reduce the tumour weight and volume and body weight of the EAT-bearing mice. It caused a significant cytotoxic effect in EAT cells in the paw, reduced the levels of nucleic acids and MDA, and increased NP-SH concentrations. The histopathological changes observed after treatment with anethole were comparable to the standard cytotoxic drug cyclophosphamide. The results on the frequency of micronuclei and the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to normochromatic erythrocytes showed anethole to be mitodepressive and non-clastogenic in the femoral cells of mice.

It was found that the extract has no <b>clastogenic</b> or mutagenic <b>activities,</b> mitotic index decreased mildly compared with the control. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations showed no significance in all concentrations at time of exposure. Most aberrations of the dividing cells were disturbance of chromosomes. The RAPD results demonstrated monomorphic numbers of genetic bands mostly, which were the electrophoretic products of PCR for all treatments compared with the control. Also the results exhibited the ability of C. speciosus as antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic potential against EMS induced DNA damage, cytotoxic and clastogenic effects in Allium cepa cells.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that aneuploidy during mitosis {{may be a}} factor in the etiology of somatic malignancy. The analysis of alterations in anaphase-telophase of mitosis is a useful test for evaluating the aneuploidogenic and clastogenic ability of chemicals. Several metals {{have been found to be}} carcinogenic to humans and animals. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study the aneugenic and clastogenic abilities of cadmium sulfate, potassium dichromate and nickel chloride were analyzed using the anaphase-telophase test. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells cultured for two cycles were treated with the desired compound for 8 h before cell harvesting. The frequency of cells with chromatin bridges, lagging chromosomes and lagging chromosomal fragments was scored. The mitotic index was determined by counting the number of mitotic cells per 1, 000 cells on each coverslip and was expressed as a percentage of the number of mitotic plates. Statistical comparisons were done using the "G" method. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to evaluate variations of the mitotic index. Chromium and cadmium were clastogenic and aneugenic and increased the frequencies of the three types of aberrations scored; nickel had only aneugenic activity because it increased the frequency of lagging chromosomes. These results indicate that the anaphase-telophase test is sufficiently sensitive to detect dose-response relationships that can distinguish <b>clastogenic</b> and/or aneugenic <b>activities</b> and that the results obtained using the anaphase-telophase test were similar to those obtained by chromosome counting...|$|R

The mice {{were exposed to}} domestic gas for twenty-one days at doses of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg respectively. The positive control group of mice were given sodium arsenite intraperitoneously at a dose of 2. 5 mg/kg body weight. While the negative control group had only distilled water, sodium arsenite significantly (p < 0. 05) induced the formation of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (mPCEs), serum and liver gamma glutamyl transferase (ÃŽÂ³GT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities respectively {{as compared with the}} observations made in the negative control group. Similarly, the domestic gas significantly (p< 0. 05) induced mPCEs formation, serum and liver, ÃŽÂ³GT and AP activities. The degree of induction was in the order of 100 mg/kg < 200 mg/kg < 300 mg/kg. However, when compared with the positive control group, the domestic cooking gas at the tested doses was not as potent as sodium arsenite in its ability to induce enzyme activity and mPCEs formation. Limited histopathological analysis of liver samples from treated and untreated mice showed distended blood vessels, necrosis and hepatocellular degeneration in the groups treated with high doses of domestic gas or sodium arsenite as compared with the untreated group. Our findings suggest that the domestic cooking gas has some degree of <b>clastogenic</b> and hepatotoxic <b>activities</b> in mice.

40|$|HIV- 1 -infected {{patients}} are in chronic oxidative stress and clastogenic factors (CFs) {{are present in}} their plasma. CFs from patients with HIV are formed via superoxide anion radical and stimulate further superoxide production. The pathophysiolgic significance and the exact composition of the circulating clastogenic material in patients with HIV is unknown. Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are increased in the plasma of patients with HIV and TNF-alpha shows <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> in vitro. The aim of this clinical study was to compare levels of CF in HIV- 1 -positive patients with asymptomatic disease, opportunistic infections, and malignancies with those in HIV- 1 -negative control groups and to correlate CF activity with CD 4 + T cell numbers, the cytokines (TNF-alpha, interleukin- 2 [IL- 2], IL- 6), and the inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], neopterin, granulocyte elastase). CFs were significantly increased in all HIV- 1 -positive patients and in HIV- 1 -negative patients with malignant tumors. HIV- 1 -positive patients with Kaposi's sarcoma showed the highest CF activity in their plasma (p < 0. 08). CFs appear very early in HIV infection, and they correlate negatively with CD 4 + T cells, which are an indicator of disease activity. The presence of CF in the plasma of HIV-infected patients is not a general response to a viral infection because these factors are not increased in HIV- 1 -negative patients with viral infection (zoster). CFs are not specific for the HIV- 1 infection; they also occur in HIV- 1 -negative patients with malignant tumors. There was a tendency towards a positive correlation (p < 0. 14) between CF and TNF-alpha {{but there was no}} positive correlation of CF with IL- 2, IL- 6, CRP, elastase, and neopterin levels. This indicates that TNF-alpha may be among the components of CF in HIV- 1 -infected patients. In addition, other unidentified components may contribute to the <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of the plasma or the composition of CF may vary from patient to patient. Further clinical studies with larger sample populations are necessary to analyze the composition of CF in HIV- 1 -positive patients...|$|E

Alternatively, cytogenetic analyses evidenced significant increases in endoreduplicated cells and highly condensed metaphases with separated chromatids. This implies that OTA or its possible metabolites do not covalently bind DNA through the formation of adducts since structural chromosome aberrations are a very sensitive end points to detect chemical carcinogens with electrophilic substituents. Alternatively, induction of endoreduplication and chromatid separation provides strong evidence for a DNA nonreactive mechanism of OTA carcinogenicity involving the disruption of mitosis by interfering with key regulators of chromosome separation and progression of mitosis. This causes a temporary arrest of mitoses and premature exit from it (mitotic slippage) to generate endoreduplication and polyploidy accompanied by increased risk of aneuploidy and subsequent tumor formation.

The present study was carried out to assess the possible mutagenic potential and acute oral toxicity of polysaccharide extract of turmeric rhizome (NR-INF- 02) using standard tests. The standard battery of in vitro genotoxicity tests, bacterial reverse mutation test (BRMT), chromosome aberration (CA), and micronucleus (MN) tests were employed to assess the possible mutagenic activity of NR-INF- 02 (Turmacin). The results showed no mutagenic effect with NR-INF- 02 up to a dose of 5000 [*]µg/mL in BRMT. The results on CA and MN tests revealed the non <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of NR-INF- 02 in a dose range of 250. 36 to 2500 [*]µg/mL with and without metabolic activation (S 9). In acute oral toxicity study, NR-INF- 02 {{was found to be}} safe up to 5 [*]g/kg body weight in Wistar rats. Overall, results indicated that polysaccharide extract of C. longa was found to be genotoxically safe and also exhibited maximum tolerable dose of more than 5 [*]g/kg rat body weight...|$|E
40|$|Concentrated {{drinking}} water extracts prepared by adsorption onto XAD- 2 resin {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} induce chromosome damage in mammalian cells. Extracts prepared from {{drinking water}}s derived from upland and lowland sources have been found to induce chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and human lymphocytes in vitro. Although the identity of the compounds responsible for this activity is unknown, they are generated when the water is chlorinated and appear to bind readily to exogenous protein. When groups of mice were dosed orally with a concentrated water extract, however, no evidence of <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> in bone marrow cells was apparent. The absence of an in vivo effect may indicate that the mutagenic compounds failed to reach the bone marrow. The possibility that genetic damage could be induced in the cells first encountered in the body after ingestion (i. e., cells in the esophagus, stomach, and intestinal tract) is not precluded by this result. The relevance of these findings in evaluating the potential health hazard of mutagenic compounds in drinking water is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo rodent {{micronucleus}} test {{is widely used}} as a genotoxic assay to detect the <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of chemicals. In this research the genotoxic effects of herbal drops of garlic and pasipy were evaluated using the {{micronucleus test}}. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was determined by a dose-response test. For each medicine three treatment groups were considered with doses of MTD, 1 / 2 MTD and 1 / 4 MTD according to the CSGMT protocol (1995 Japan). Drugs were administered orally to mice (test groups). Mitomicin C {{was used as a}} known genotoxic agent in positive control group. The peripheral blood samples before treatment (zero time samples) were considered as negative control. The appearance of a micronucleus is used as an index for genotoxic potential. The results obtained indicated that the herbal drops showed genotoxicity effect and it was dose-dependent compared to the negative control group. This genotoxicity was significant (p 0. 05). Therefore our results if compared to thenegative control group is significant and it is worthy of consideration...|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} in our companion paper the {{strong correlation between}} elevated sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) frequencies and the initiation step of rat hepatocarcinogenesis. We have also shown that SCEs return to normal values during the promotion and the progression stages. In the present study, we evaluated the <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) during initiation, promotion and progression of rat hepatocarcinogenesis. We measured, at various times after DEN administration, the number of micronuclei (MN) produced by the mitotic response to partial hepatectomy. The results established that the DEN treatment induces {{a great number of}} preclastogenic lesions. In subcarcinogenic conditions (initiation alone), the number of MN expressed after partial hepatectomy remains high regardless of the time interval between the end of the DEN treatment and the operation. In this condition, the preclastogenic lesions persist for up to 1 year after the DEN administration is discontinued. Conversely, in carcinogenic conditions (initiation + promotion + progression), the number of MN expressed after partial hepatectomy decreases during the promotion and progression stages. These observations indicate that promotion and progression but not initiation are associated with the expression of persistent preclastogenic lesions, resulting in the production of chromosomally abnormal hepatocytes.

40|$|The {{results of}} studies {{on the effect of}} pineal indole hormone {{melatonin}} on the life span of mice, rats, fruit flies, and worms are critically reviewed. In mice, long-term administration of melatonin was followed by an increase in their life span in 12 experiments and had no effect in 8 of 20 different experiments. In D. melanogaster, the supplementation of melatonin to the nutrient medium during developmental stages gave contradictory results, but when melatonin was added to food throughout the life span, an increase in the longevity of fruit flies has been observed. Melatonin decreased the survival of C. elegans but increased the clonal life span of planaria Paramecium tertaurelia. Available data suggest antioxidant and atherogenic effects of melatonin. Melatonin alone turned out to be neither toxic nor mutagenic in the Ames test and revealed <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> in high concentration in the COMET assay. Melatonin inhibits mutagenesis induced by irradiation and by indirect chemical mutagens and inhibits the development of spontaneous and chemical-induced tumors in mice and rats. Further studies and clinical trials are needed to verify that melatonin is both safe and has geroprotector efficacy for humans...|$|E
40|$|Ten Cr(III) compounds, used in {{the leather}} tanning industry, and a Cr(III) compound, {{containing}} chromite and used as a pigment, were tested for cytotoxicity (inhibition of growth and survival of cultured hamster cells), mutagenicity (point mutations in S. typhimurium) and <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> (chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in hamster cells). Reference Cr compounds were potassium dichromate as Cr(VI), and chromium chloride and two different preparations of chromium nitrate as Cr(III). A contamination with Cr(VI) was detected {{in some of the}} Cr(III) tannins, chromite and one chromium nitrate. Cr(III) compounds were cytotoxic at concentrations of Cr(III) 100 - 500 times higher than Cr(VI), but contaminated Cr(III) compounds showed a significant cytotoxicity. Reference Cr(VI) but not Cr(III) was mutagenic: of the contaminated compounds only chromite and chromium nitrate, which contained higher levels of Cr(VI), were found to be mutagenic. The frequency of sister chromatid exchanges was significantly increased only by Cr(VI) and the more contaminated Cr(III) compounds. However, an increase of chromosomal aberrations was produced also by reference Cr(III) salts and the weakly contaminated industrial Cr(III) compounds. These results confirm the view that the active mutagenic agent in intact cell systems is Cr(VI), but indicate that industrial Cr(III) compounds cannot be considered genetically inert, as they can be contaminated by Cr(VI) and induce chromosomal aberrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between etoposide (VP- 16) cytotoxicity and the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) {{suggested that the}} promotion of DNA recombination events may be crucial for the activity of antitopoisomerase drugs. To further evaluate this hypothesis, we investigated the {{correlation between}} VP- 16 induction of SCEs, chromosomal aberrations and cell cycle alterations in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients affected by ataxia telangiectasia(AT), whose cells are known as hypersensitive to the cytotoxic and <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors. Our present study has shown that AT homozygous and heterozygous cell lines exposed to low VP- 16 concentrations, although hypersensitive to the induction of chromosomal aberrations, exhibit an induction of SCEs comparable to that found in normal cell lines. Moreover, while the clastogenic effect of the drug was directly correlated to {{the reduction of the}} mitotic index, the enhancement of SCE frequencies, obtained over the same range of VP- 16 concentrations, was not paralleled by a modification of proliferation index. Thus, these results suggest that etoposide retains in AT cells a strong clastogenic and cytostatic activity which is independent from DNA recombination events and which may be important for the induction of cell death by this kind of drug.

40|$|Plant-derived isoflavones are {{currently}} receiving much attention {{because of their}} phyto-estrogenic, antioxidant, anti- mutagenic, and anti-tumor activities. In this study we have evaluated the clastogenic and anti-clastogenic activities in human lymphocytes of two structurally related pterocarpans, iso-flavonoid derivatives, termed erybraedin C and bitucarpin A, recently purified from Bituminaria bituminosa and chemically characterized. Mitomycin C (MMC) and the radio-mimetic bleomycin (BL) were used as reference clastogens. The end point studied was micronucleus formation. The results obtained in {{this study indicate that}} erybraedin C and bitucarpin A, when assayed alone, do not affect either the mitotic index or the cell-proliferation index of human lymphocytes. Interestingly, both compounds appear to be non-clastogenic in the range of concentrations used. In contrast, both substances seem to affect significantly the clastogenic effects induced by BL and MMC. A 1 -h pre-exposition of the cell culture to erybraedin C was necessary to display its anti-clastogenic potential against BL, whereas bitucarpin A was inactive in this respect, with a structure-activity relationship. In contrast, the <b>clastogenic</b> <b>activity</b> of MMC was significantly reduced by both erybraedin C and bitucarpin A, using either a pre-incubation schedule or simultaneous treatment. These results suggest that the protective effects displayed by the two anti-clastogenic compounds against MMC could be due to the induction or inhibition of cellular reductive metabolic enzymes...|$|E
