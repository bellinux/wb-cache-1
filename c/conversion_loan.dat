In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was approached by senior UAP figures and Lyons himself to return to Australia and assume the leadership of the government, which was struggling under the ailing Lyons, but he either flatly declined or set conditions for his return (such as an all-party government behind him) that were impossible to meet.|$|R

The Green Revolution in India was initially hailed as a success, but has recently been 'downgraded' to a 'qualified success'— not {{because of a lack of}} increased food production, but because the increase in food production has slowed down and has not been able to keep pace with population growth.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} growth in {{agriculture}} and rainfall has been studied along with droughts {{in the past and}} the role of the credit institutions in managing droughts. There has been no significant breakthrough in research on dryland farming. Two major negative features of agricultural growth presently affecting agriculture are: (i) instability in year-to-year production, and (ii) inter-regional and inter-crop disparities in production performance. It has been pointed that the decline in foodgrains production during the drought years (13. 2 % in 2002 - 03 over 2001 - 02) has incapacitated our contingency production programmes. The reduction in farm income as a result of drought forces the small and marginal farmers to borrow from other sources to meet their consumption requirements. The debt repayment capacity of the borrowers gets impaired heavily and they find it extremely difficult to repay their loan installments as per schedule. To mitigate the problems of the borrowers and credit institutions during the period of drought, NABARD sanctions <b>conversion</b> of short-term <b>loans</b> into medium-term loans (MTC loans) for 3 years and reschedulement of earlier converted loans for a period of 5 - 7 years in the event of natural calamities. A quick study on MTC loans in Andhra Pradesh has revealed that 23 per cent of the sample farmers have faced problems of one or other type as associated with MTC crop loans. Farmers have reported that temporary relief from repayment of bank loan, lower repayment installment are certain merits associated with MTC loans. About 71 per cent have reported temporary relief from repayment as the major advantage of MTC crop loan. Besides credit, drought has its implications for both food- and water-security. Appropriate strategies have to be evolved in terms of appropriate crop planning, thrust on irrigation, watershed development, thrust on rural nonfarm sector for employment creation, etc. depending on the resource endowment of the arid and semi-arid regions.

40|$|According to the Polish Banking Supervision (KNF) statistics, banking {{mortgage}} loans total 22. 4 % {{of the overall}} assets of the Polish banking credit portfolio as of January 2015 data. Around 15 % of those loans might have Loan To Property Value proportion (LTV) exceeding 100 %. Rapid growth of {{mortgage loans}} in Poland {{was the result of}} growth of foreign currency mortgage loans. That was the typical situation for Central and Eastern European Countries. In the Polish banking sector, collective provisions typical for retail segment including IBNR (Identified but nor Reported Loss Provisions) provision applied under current IAS 39 seems to be too low to cover credit risk. Assuming conservative credit risk parameters in determining collective provisions might affect adversely the financial situation of the Polish banks. The financial results of the Polish banks might go down considerably. In addition, borrowers having loans denominated in foreign currency have won certain legal cases in Europe and in Poland. Therefore, the presence of the foreign currency denominated mortgage loans (FCML) in the Polish banking sector represents an element of the systemic risk and has to be solved. Growth of FCML weakens the abilities of central banks to control over credit creation and to steer monetary policy. On the other hand, compulsory conversion of the mortgage loans hitherto denominated in foreign currency into mortgage loans in Polish zloty by special law, might create considerable losses in the Polish banking sector and reduction of Capital Adequacy Ratio of the Polish banks. Therefore, direct replication of the Hungarian style legal solution of the foreign currency banking (compulsory <b>loan</b> currency <b>conversion</b> into PLN) <b>loans</b> might create problems in the Polish banking sector. Moreover, potential state aid devoted to some borrowers in Poland that have saved significant amount of money having cheaper foreign currency mortgage loans is controversial from the social justice point of view. Law should not treat favourable one group of borrowers {{at the expense of the}} another one. Any legal solutions to sort out the problem of foreign currency loans have to take these facts into consideration.

Complex solution how to tackle FCML problem in the Polish banking sector is needed. Any realistic solution is going to be is linked with extra provisioning after thorough investigation of real nature of FCML borrowers in Poland (households) and their financial standing.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays that evaluate possible vehicles for financing either retirement consumption or bequests. Chapter 1 compares the use of Roth and tax-deferred retirement accounts for retirement consumption {{with the use of}} taxable accounts. Previously, economists have often assumed that retirement savings should be done in a tax-deferred account. However, the advent of Roth-style tax-favored accounts and concerns about the tax implications of increasing retirement income through distributions from tax-deferred accounts warrant revisiting this question. I use data on married couples in the HRS and NBER's TAXSIM model to measure the probability of a household facing a higher tax rate at ages 62, 65, and 69 than the household faced at age 57. When the marginal tax rate is higher, the household could decrease their lifetime tax burden by choosing a Roth-style account over a tax-deferred account. I also measure the probability of facing a marginal tax rate that is sufficiently high that the household minimizes tax payments by using a taxable account rather than a tax-deferred account, when a Roth option is not available. I find that for distributions beginning at age 69, between 10 and 35 % of households with taxable income at age 57 should prefer a Roth account to a tax-deferred account, but very few households prefer a taxable account. Chapter 2 models the tax-savings available through the use of tax-favored retirement accounts for bequests. Past research on tax-favored retirement accounts has focused on the incentives and effects of these accounts {{within the framework of the}} life-cycle model. (cont.) However, tax-favored accounts also offer substantial tax savings for bequeathed assets. This chapter examines the incentives tax-favored accounts provide for bequests and simulates models of the available tax savings. The benchmark model calculates that the tax savings associated with a tax-deferred account (TDA) that is used to optimally bequeath assets exceeds the tax savings of a TDA used to produce a steady stream of retirement income by by 27. 2 %. Use of a Roth account for a bequest increases tax savings by an additional 32 % over a bequeathed TDA. Chapter 3, joint work with Hui Shan, considers reverse mortgages as a method of financing retirement consumption. Housing wealth is the most important non-pension wealth component for many elderly homeowners in the United States. Reverse mortgages allow elderly homeowners to consume housing wealth without having to sell or move out of their homes. Though the U. S. reverse mortgage market has grown substantially, very few eligible homeowners use reverse mortgages to achieve consumption smoothing. This chapter examines all Home Equity <b>Conversion</b> Mortgage (HECM) <b>loans</b> originated between 1989 and 2007 and insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). It shows how characteristics of HECM loans and HECM borrowers have evolved over time, compares borrowers with non-borrowers, and analyzes loan outcomes using a hazard model. (cont.) In addition, it conducts numerical simulations of HECM loans originated in 2007 to illustrate how the profitability of the FHA insurance program depends on factors such as termination rates, housing price appreciation, and the schedule of payments. This analysis serves as a starting point in understanding the implications of recent growth in the reverse mortgage market. Our results also suggest caution in predicting the profitability of the current HECM program. by Tonja L. Bowen Bishop. Thesis (Ph. D.)
