50|$|In dentistry, the <b>configuration</b> <b>factor</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Davidson CL,1986, and later quantitavly extended Feilzer et al. in 1987 and refers {{to the number of}} bonded surfaces to the number of un-bonded surfaces in a dental restoration. For example, for a class I preparation there would be 5 bonded surfaces and only 1 un-bonded surface; the net result would be a c-factor of 5. With an increasing C factor the developing curing contraction stresses of bonded restorations (resin composites) increases too (Feilzer et al. 1987). The developing curing contraction in a bonded restoration generate stress on the bonded interface that are in competition with the developing bond strength of the setting restorative to the cavity surfaces, which may result in (partial) debonding, marginal leakage and post-operative pain (Davidson et al. 1984).|$|E
40|$|The <b>configuration</b> <b>factor</b> of {{adhesive}} cavities {{is defined}} as the ratio of the restoration's bonded to unbonded (free) surfaces. Such a <b>configuration</b> <b>factor</b> was described, on ideal cavities, as having a potential value in predicting the behaviour of the restoration, because it is related to the restoration's capacity for relieving stress by flow.

The cases studied are: (i) view factor between two cylindrical rods/tubes of different diameter and equal finite length, (ii) view factor between two cylindrical rods with interference from a third rod and (iii) view factor between a cylindrical rod and a concentric cylindrical enclosure, of equal finite lengths. In the literature, contour integral technique has been stated to appreciably be the more precise method than the area integration method. Present <b>configuration</b> <b>factor</b> results of finite length geometries have been compared with that of exact algebraic expressions available in the literature for infinite length. It was observed that the length of the geometry influences the <b>configuration</b> <b>factor</b> results considerably and use of infinite length approximations in finite length cases can lead to significant errors.

40|$|Abstract—one of the {{significant}} factors for improving the accuracy of Land Surface Temperature (LST) retrieval is the correct understanding of the directional anisotropy for thermal radiance. In this paper, the multiple scattering effect between heterogeneous non-isothermal surfaces is described rigorously according {{to the concept of}} <b>configuration</b> <b>factor,</b> based on which a directional thermal radiance model is built, and the directional radiant character for urban canopy is analyzed. The model is applied to a simple urban canopy with row structure to simulate the change of Directional Brightness Temperature (DBT). The results show that the DBT is aggrandized because of the multiple scattering effects, whereas the change range of DBT is smoothed. The temperature difference, spatial distribution, emissivity of the components can all lead to the change of DBT. The “hot spot ” phenomenon occurs when the proportion of high temperature component in the vision field came to a head. On the other hand, the “cool spot ” phenomena occur when low temperature proportion came to the head. The “spot ” effect disappears only when the proportion of every component keeps invariability. The model built in this paper can be used for the study of directional effect on emissivity, the LST retrieval over urban areas and the adjacency effect of thermal remote sensing pixels.
