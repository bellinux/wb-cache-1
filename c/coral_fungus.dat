In Alloclavaria purpurea, the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple. The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger, but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt processes that are the same color {{as the rest of the}} fruit body. Ramariopsis pulchella—a small, violet-colored <b>coral</b> <b>fungus</b> rarely taller than —could be mistaken for a small C.zollingeri. It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0–4.5 by 2.5–3.5μm.|$|E

500|$|Ramaria botrytis, {{commonly}} known as the clustered coral, the pink-tipped coral mushroom, or the cauliflower coral, is an edible species of <b>coral</b> <b>fungus</b> in the family Gomphaceae.

Its dense branches, which originate from a stout, massive base, are swollen at the tips and divided into several small branchlets. The branches are initially whitish but age to buff or tan, with tips that are pink to reddish. The flesh is thick and white. The spores, yellowish in deposit, are ellipsoid, feature longitudinal striations, and measure about 13.8 by 4.7micrometers.|$|E

500|$|Ramariopsis kunzei is an edible {{species of}} <b>coral</b> <b>fungi</b> in the Clavariaceae family, {{and the type}} species of the genus Ramariopsis. It is {{commonly}} known as white coral because of the branched structure of the fruit bodies that resemble marine coral. The fruit bodies are up to [...] tall by [...] wide, with numerous branches originating from a short rudimentary stem. The branches are one to two millimeters thick, smooth, and white, sometimes with yellowish tips in age. Ramariopsis kunzei has a widespread distribution, and is found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{it could}} be {{confused}} with two edible yellow coral fungi—the high yellow clavaria (Ramaria flava) and R. aurea. These have pale golden yellow flesh in their branches, unlike the white flesh of R. formosa. However, this difference {{can be hard to}} make out. A general rule is to avoid all old <b>coral</b> <b>fungi.</b> The North American species R. largentii has orange branches. There are several other Ramaria species with yellow-tipped, salmon-coloured branches, including R. leptoformosa, R. neoformosa, R. raveneliana and R. rubricarnata. These are distinguished from R. formosa most reliably using microscopic characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The {{family was}} {{described}} in 1970 by British mycologist E.J.H. Corner to accommodate species of club and <b>coral</b> <b>fungi</b> that were similar to species in the Clavariaceae, but whose context hyphae were uninflated. As well as the genus Aphelaria, Corner included the small genera Corticirama, Phaeoaphelaria, and Tumidapexus within the Aphelariaceae. No research has been published on the family, though several standard reference works have recognized the Aphelariaceae, placed it within the order Cantharellales, and moved the genus Corticirama elsewhere, though the basis for these dispositions is unclear.|$|R
