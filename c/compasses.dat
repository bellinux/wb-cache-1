5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is drawn {{through the center of the}} Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and <b>compasses</b> would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and <b>compasses</b> do not generally point at either.|$|E

40|$|While {{integrating}} their foraging and homing paths, desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, {{depend on}} external <b>compass</b> cues. Whereas recent research in bees and ants has focused nearly {{exclusively on the}} polarization <b>compass,</b> two other <b>compass</b> systems—the sun <b>compass</b> and the wind (anemo) compass—as well as the mutual interactions of all these <b>compass</b> systems have received little attention. In this study, we show that of the two visual <b>compass</b> systems, {{it is only the}} polarization <b>compass</b> that invariably outcompetes the wind <b>compass,</b> while the sun <b>compass</b> does so only under certain conditions. If the ants are experimentally deprived of their polarization <b>compass</b> system, but have access simultaneously to both their sun <b>compass</b> and their wind <b>compass,</b> they steer intermediate courses. The intermediate courses shift the more towards the wind <b>compass</b> course, the higher the elevation of the sun is in the sky...|$|R
50|$|<b>Compass</b> turns (turns {{using the}} <b>compass</b> {{as the primary}} {{reference}} instrument) are not standard practice in modern aircraft. <b>Compass</b> turns are typically performed in simulated or actual failures of the directional gyro or other navigational instruments. A magnetic <b>compass</b> is a simple instrument when the <b>compass</b> is not moving {{and is on the}} earth. A magnetic <b>compass</b> installed in an aircraft is subject to <b>compass</b> turning errors during flight. Pilots must compensate for such errors when using the magnetic <b>compass.</b>|$|R

5|$|Galileo made {{a number}} of {{contributions}} to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, {{and a variety of other}} calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these <b>compasses,</b> which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the <b>compasses</b> for 120 lire.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have used}} <b>compasses</b> for {{direction}} finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century. Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation. Using magnetoception various other organisms, ranging from {{some types of}} bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.|$|E
50|$|The {{top part}} is for {{recording}} direction sailed. It has {{a representation of}} the <b>compass</b> rose with its 32 <b>compass</b> points, just as {{on the face of the}} ship's <b>compass.</b> Eight concentric rings are inscribed on the <b>compass</b> rose. Each ring has one peg hole at each point of the <b>compass.</b> Eight pegs are attached to the centre of the <b>compass</b> rose with strings.|$|R
50|$|In carpentry, architecture, and shipbuilding, a <b>compass</b> is a curve (or bent) {{circular}} form. A <b>compass</b> {{plane is}} {{a plane that}} is convex, length-ways, on the underside, for smoothing the concave faces of curved woodwork. A <b>compass</b> saw is a narrow-bladed saw that cuts a curve. A <b>compass</b> timber is a curved (or crooked) timber, sometimes used in shipbuilding. A <b>compass</b> brick is a curved brick. A <b>compass</b> wall is a curved wall. A <b>compass</b> window is a circular bay window (or oriel window).|$|R

5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small cabin in the bow of the ship and in a few other {{locations}} around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: <b>compasses,</b> divider calipers, a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, <b>compasses</b> were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E
5|$|Over the Bering Sea, {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic Circle, the magnetic <b>compasses</b> fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} radio compass. In Number 2, the radio compass stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E
5|$|The VOC {{authorities}} salvaged as much {{as possible}} from the beached Meermin. They recovered nearly 300 firearms, gunpowder and musket balls, <b>compasses</b> and five bayonets; they auctioned cables, ropes and other items from the ship on the shore. Meermin was left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized <b>compass</b> (or heading indicator) is {{to read the}} magnetic <b>compass</b> only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight. This reading is then used to set the gyro-stabilized <b>compass.</b> The gyro <b>compass</b> will read correctly in a turn, whereas the magnetic <b>compass</b> can't be read properly while turning. Thus the pilot will always ignore the magnetic <b>compass</b> while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level unaccelerated flight.|$|R
60|$|Now Deviation is the {{variation}} in the needle caused by the distribution of iron on board of ship. This purely local variation I derived from the deviation card of my standard <b>compass</b> and then applied to the Correct Magnetic Course. The result was the <b>Compass</b> Course. And yet, not yet. My standard <b>compass</b> was amidships on the companionway. My steering <b>compass</b> was aft, in the cockpit, near the wheel. When the steering <b>compass</b> pointed west-by-south three- quarters-south (the steering course), the standard <b>compass</b> pointed west-one-half-north, which was certainly not the steering course. I kept the Snark up till she was heading west-by-south-three-quarters- south on the standard <b>compass,</b> which gave, on the steering <b>compass,</b> south-west-by-west.|$|R
5000|$|A bearing <b>compass</b> is a {{magnetic}} <b>compass</b> mounted {{in such a}} way that it allows the taking of bearings of objects by aligning them with the lubber line of the bearing <b>compass.</b> A surveyor's <b>compass</b> is a specialized <b>compass</b> made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with map making. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 Cyclopaedia. The bearing <b>compass</b> was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand. In 1885, a patent was granted for a hand <b>compass</b> fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the prismatic <b>compass.</b> [...] Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror. First patented in 1902, the Bézard <b>compass</b> consisted of a field <b>compass</b> with a mirror mounted above it. [...] This arrangement enabled the user to align the <b>compass</b> with an objective while simultaneously viewing its bearing in the mirror.|$|R
5|$|The {{architect}} Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave {{very precise}} instructions to this section. Of wide-ranging experience formed in Asia Minor and Egypt {{and under the}} influence of engineers, he asked them to keep an authentic diary of their excavations where precision measurements read off watches and <b>compasses</b> should be written down, to draw a map of the region they travelled, and to describe the layout of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} azimuth, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. <b>Compasses</b> are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} {{despatching}} personnel {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, <b>compasses</b> and speed indicators. British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} high elevations, sun <b>compass</b> {{decreases}} its precision when providing information to animals. A study {{was performed to}} see if dung beetles respond better to orientations provided by the sun <b>compass</b> or skylight <b>compass.</b> The {{results of this study}} showed that dung beetles use their original bearings (i.e. sun <b>compass)</b> a majority of the time and rarely use skylight <b>compass.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the RDCM- 802 <b>compass</b> module were investigated {{to use it as}} a <b>compass</b> of an ant type robot. The RDCM- 802 	<b>compass</b> module can determine the direction with 3 -bit accuracy, which means that it outputs direction in basic 8 -points (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). The experiments show that the outputs of the <b>compass</b> module as a function of direction has high reproducibility. Therefore, although the outputs of the RDCM- 802 <b>compass</b> module are eight principal <b>compass</b> points, the combination of the <b>compass</b> module RDCM- 802 and out robot driven by stepping motors enable to know the direction with high precision(about ± 2 ℃) ...|$|R

5|$|In 1756, French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{introduced the}} constellation of Circinus with the French name le Compas, representing a pair of dividing <b>compasses,</b> on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.|$|E
5|$|The wreck is {{steadily}} decaying, turning to oxide {{at a rate}} of 0.5–1 ton per day (assuming one ten-thousandth of an inch per day on all surfaces). Eventually Titanics structure will collapse, and she will be reduced to a patch of rust on the seabed, with any remaining scraps of the ship's hull mingled with her more durable fittings, like the propellers, bronze capstans, <b>compasses</b> and the telemotor.|$|E
5|$|Arizona was {{commissioned}} into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with John D. McDonald as captain. She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after {{the crew had}} cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been tested at the dock. After declinating the ship's magnetic <b>compasses,</b> the ship sailed south for her shakedown cruise. Outside Guantanamo Bay, a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order Arizona back to New York for repairs, although {{she was able to}} enter Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19–20 December. The turbine could not be repaired inside the ship, so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing out. It was reinstalled after almost four months of repairs at the naval yard.|$|E
40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} {{interests and}} demands of navigation and positioning services, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has been drawing {{more and more}} attention. Each every country or continent is trying to establish their own GNSS system. <b>Compass,</b> also known as Beidou- 2, which is developed by China {{is one of the}} most popular GNSS in Asian continent. <b>Compass</b> project was started in 2000 and until now, there has been rather few public information regarding <b>Compass.</b> In order to test and analyse <b>Compass,</b> it is necessary to obtain the existing information about <b>Compass.</b> In addition, acquisition and navigation are the main parts of <b>Compass</b> system so that to acquire the signal and extraction the navigation message in a fast and accurate way is very important. In this thesis, the <b>Compass</b> signals and receivers as well as three important segments of <b>Compass</b> systems are discussed. In addition, possible methods to achieve acquisition of <b>Compass</b> signals are illustrated. Meanwhile, a simulator is carried out to simulate the acquisition of <b>Compass</b> real-time field signals. The simulation results show that the parallel code phase search algorithm can be used to acquire <b>Compass</b> signals...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{adaptive}} hyperbox algorithm (AHA), {{which is an}} instance of a locally convergent, random search algorithm for solving discrete optimization via simulation problems. Compared to the <b>COMPASS</b> algorithm, AHA is more efficient in high-dimensional problems.

Both AHA and <b>COMPASS</b> can be used as the local search algorithm within the Industrial Strength <b>COMPASS</b> framework, which consists of a global search phase, a local search phase, and a final cleanup phase. We compare the performance of AHA to <b>COMPASS</b> within the framework of Industrial Strength <b>COMPASS</b> and as stand-alone algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate that AHA scales up well in high-dimensional problems and has similar performance to <b>COMPASS</b> in low-dimensional problems...|$|R
5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic <b>compasses.</b> Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E

5|$|Molyneux {{was known}} as a {{mathematician}} and maker of mathematical instruments such as <b>compasses</b> and hourglasses. He became acquainted with many prominent men of the day, including the writer Richard Hakluyt and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. He also knew the explorers Thomas Cavendish, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and John Davis. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to Elizabeth I. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made {{in such a way that}} they were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} of digital <b>compass</b> with voice output is described, so that the blind can also use it. The digital <b>compass</b> is {{designed}} based on up-graded conventional <b>compass.</b> In the axis direction of conventional <b>compass</b> be added a disc as source of wind direction information, and phototransistor as sensor. The digital <b>compass</b> system is designed, based on AT 89 S 52 microcontroller, as control of all interfaces and read sensor.

50|$|In 1300, an Arabic {{treatise}} {{written by}} the Egyptian astronomer and muezzin Ibn Simʿūn describes a dry <b>compass</b> used for determining qibla.

In the 14th century, the Syrian astronomer and timekeeper Ibn al-Shatir (1304-1375) invented a timekeeping device incorporating both a universal sundial and a magnetic <b>compass.</b> He invented it {{for the purpose of}} finding the times of salat prayers. Arab navigators also introduced the 32-point <b>compass</b> rose during this time. In 1399, an Egyptian reports two different kinds of magnetic <b>compass.</b> One instrument is a “fish” made of willow wood or pumpkin, into which a magnetic needle is inserted and which afterwards is sealed with tar or wax to prevent the penetration of water.
