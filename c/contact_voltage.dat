Data were recorded in helium and nitrogen environments to lower stiction failure rates {{as well as to}} circumvent switch bouncing arising from low pressure at cryogenic temperatures. Contact resistance values were observed to be lower at cryogenic temperatures but still two orders of magnitude higher than the values predicted for the constriction resistance of gold asperity contacts, consistent with the presence of adsorbed films on the contacts. An asperity-heating model was applied, from which it was deduced that <b>contact</b> <b>voltages</b> can selectively disassoci-ate adsorbed films from the contact surface while not soften-ing the gold asperity contacts.

Multi-junction solar cells with different bandgaps have been developed to minimize thermalization losses in heterostructure solar cells. In these devices, each p-n junction cell is designed to effectively harvest solar energy within a certain spectral window close to the bandgap. To date, the triple-junction cells reach a maximum conversion efficiency of approximately 42 %, in the case of concentrator cells. Technological limitations are determined by the need to match crystalline lattices, thermal expansion coefficients, and the most difficult, to match all the photoinduced currents in the cascade of heterojunctions.|$|R

In fact the process of generated particles by mechanical wear produce the increase of <b>contact</b> <b>voltage</b> frequently assimilated as high contact resistance. The main objective of this work is to examine conjointly <b>contact</b> <b>voltage</b> and the occurrence of arcs during the well-known three successive fretting phases. The arc voltage is measured during fretting with set oscilloscopes which plot the arc voltage histograms in real time. So, a histogram is built and arc duration is determined and the position on the track of fretting. We applied a voltage of 16 V and a current of 3 A. Samples extracted from commercial contact are used and fixed on vibration system (frequency 20 Hz and relative displacement of 0. 8 mm). The main results show that the arcs are observed during the first and final phase of fretting. We assume that after the initiation period of fretting, the wear is increased and induce the increase of the <b>contact</b> <b>voltage</b> and it reaches few hundred millivolts (melting and fritting voltage) and induce micro-arcs.
