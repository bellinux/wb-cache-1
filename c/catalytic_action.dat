The <b>catalytic</b> <b>action</b> of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape ("induced fit"), bond strain, proximity and orientation of molecules relative to the enzyme, proton donation or withdrawal (acid/base catalysis), electrostatic interactions and many others.|$|E

The <b>catalytic</b> <b>action</b> of titanium oxide has to be activated by UV light, i.e. artificial illumination. However, modifying titanium oxide with neodymium(III) chloride allows catalysis under visible illumination, such as sun light. The modified catalyst is prepared by chemical coprecipitation–peptization method by ammonium hydroxide from mixture of TiCl4 and NdCl3 in aqueous solution). This process is used commercially on large scale on 1000 liter reactor for using in photocatalytic self-cleaning paints.|$|E
25|$|The same is true, up to a point, of the {{chemical}} reactions of living things. They are usually catalyzed by enzymes which change reaction rates, but with no variation in <b>catalytic</b> <b>action,</b> {{the rule of thumb}} is still mostly applicable.

This is why high temperatures kill bacteria and other micro-organisms: 'tissue' breakdown reactions reach such rates that they cannot be compensated for and the cell dies. On the other hand, 'elevated' temperatures short of these result in increased growth and reproduction; if the organism is harmful, perhaps to dangerous levels.|$|E

The {{oxidation}} of hot-dip aluminized AISI 1020 steel {{coated with}} NaCl in static air at 700 C for a duration of time 49 h was studied by employing thermogravimetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis.

40|$|The cyclic-imide-hydrolyzing {{activity}} of a prokaryotic cyclic-ureide-hydrolyzing enzyme, d-hydantoinase, was investigated. The enzyme hydrolyzed cyclic imides with bulky substituents such as 2 -methylsuccinimide, 2 -phenylsuccinimide, phthalimide, and 3, 4 -pyridine dicarboximide to the corresponding half-amides. However, simple cyclic imides without substituents, which are substrates of imidase (i. e., succinimide, glutarimide, and sulfur-containing cyclic imides such as 2, 4 -thiazolidinedione and rhodanine), were not hydrolyzed.

Prokaryotic d-hydantoinase also catalyzed the dehydrative cyclization of the half-amide phthalamidic acid to the corresponding cyclic imide, phthalimide.

The {{alkaline}} hydrolysis of polyester fabric in NaOH solution {{in the presence}} of several 1 -alkyl- 3 - methylimidazolium bromine ionic liquids (ILs), CnMImBr (n= 8, 12, 14, 16) was examined in comparison to the use of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as an accelerant. The weight loss of polyester fabric was found to be greatly dependent on the concentrations of ILs and the length of alkyl groups in ILs. C 14 MImBr and C 16 MImBr exhibited good <b>catalytic</b> <b>actions.</b> The use of C 16 MImBr as an accelerator could endow polyester fabrics with slightly higher weight loss in comparison with CTAB.

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been paid to the design of enzyme inactivators called enzyme suicide substrates. They are inherently unreactive, but are enzymatically converted into active species to inactivate the enzymes irreversible by a covalent modi-fication of a catalytically essential amino acid residue or a coenzyme. l) Therefore, the specificity of suicide substrates is based not only on their similarity to the normal substrate, but also on the mechanism of action of the target enzyme. Because of this high degree of specificity and efficiency, they are useful in the elucidation of the reaction mechanism and the physiological role of the enzyme as well as in the medical and agricultural uses. Pyridoxal enzymes, which contain pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate as a cofactor, catalyze racemization, transamination, decarboxylation and elimination of amino acids, and play an important role in the metabolism of amino acids.

25|$|It was {{suggested}} that the problem with building and maintaining larger, more complex, and more accurately replicated molecules can be circumvented if several information carriers, each of them storing {{a small piece of}} information, are connected such that they only control their own concentration.

Such a concept, apart from an increased information capacity, has another advantage. Linking self-replication with mutual catalysis can produce nonlinear growth of the system. This, first, makes the system resistant to so-called parasitic branches. Parasitic branches are species coupled to a cycle that do not provide any advantage to the reproduction of a cycle, which, in turn, makes them useless and decreases the selective value of the system. Secondly, it reinforces the self-organization of molecules into the hypercycle, allowing the system to evolve without losing information, which solves the error threshold problem.|$|R

Enzymes play an important part in the metabolism of living organisms because they catalyze most metabolic reactions. The absence or the loss of activity of a particular enzyme in the human metabolic cycle may cause serious disabilities such as in mental or physical development.

Amongst them, single molecules offer activated C=C bonds next to carbonyl oxygen, which are likely applicable to an enzymatic reduction by P 5 ßR activity. Geu-Flores et al. (2012) reported that P 5 ßR activity is expressed in C. roseus during the biosynthesis of a bicyclic monoterpene, namely the iridoid compound nepetalactol (Geu-Flores et al. 2012. Subsequently, it has been demonstrated that the precursor substance 8 -oxogeranial is converted in a NADPH-dependent manner by a number of recombinant P 5 ßR enzymes. This reaction was up to 1.300 times faster than the conversion of progesterone (Munkert et al. 2015). The authors therefore concluded that iridoid synthase activity is an intrinsic feature of all angiosperm P 5 ßR enzymes that evolved early during evolution. However, structural features currently distinguish iridoid synthase from its close homolog progesterone 5 β-reductase (Kries et al. 2015, Alagna et al. 2015). The acceptance of 8 -oxogeranial is not restricted to the angiosperms. We found a reaction using the recombinant spruce enzyme as well, which is not yet quantified due to our limited resources.

Oxygen functionalities, especially phenols, are undesirable components of coal derived liquids. Removal of these compounds from the products of coal liquefaction is required. A beneficial alternative would be the removal of these functionalities, or the prevention of their formation, during the liquefaction process. Organometallic precursors of Co, Ni and Mo have been studied as catalysts. To ascertain the hydrodeoxygenation properties of these catalysts under liquefaction conditions, model compounds were investigated. Anthrone, Dibutylmethyl phenol, dinaphthyl ether and xanthene were studied to provide a comparison of conversions to deoxygenated products. Studies of the deoxygenating abilities of these catalyst precursors in coal liquefaction systems have also been performed. Improvements in conversion and product quality are observed. Both these factors are dependent on the coal used. It is also considered that some mineral matters in coal may have <b>catalytic</b> <b>actions.</b> Demineralization by successive HCl/HF treatments of a low rank coal has demonstrated that removal of the inherent mineral matter imparts no serious detrimental effect upon low temperature liquefaction.

In the cultures with, and without, Pd added, MO (100 mg L) was degraded within 30 min and in over 6 h, respectively. Diatrizoate (20 mg L) was degraded within 10 min in Pd-added cultures.

The αDr enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, both in soluble form and as inclusion bodies. When purified from soluble protein extracts, αDr was found to be tightly associated with E. coli RNA polymerase, from which αDr could not be dissociated. On the contrary, when refolded from inclusion bodies, αDr was devoid of E. coli RNA polymerase and was purified to homogeneity. When assayed with different DNA substrates, αDr featured slower DNA extension rates when compared with the corresponding enzyme from E. coli (E. coli DNA Pol III, αEc), unless under high ionic strength conditions or in the presence of manganese. Further assays were performed using a ssDNA and a dsDNA, whose recombination yields a DNA substrate. Surprisingly, αDr was found to be incapable of recombination-dependent DNA polymerase activity, whereas αEc was competent in this action. However, {{in the presence of the}} RecA recom-binase, αDr was able to efficiently extend the DNA substrate produced by recombination.
