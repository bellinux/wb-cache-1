The results showed that flow encountering a single patch formed a turbulent wake downstream of the vegetation. Within this wake, the Reynolds stress increased downstream initially, and then decayed. When a second patch was positioned within the region of maximum Reynolds stress, the Reynolds stress decreased by between 25 and 50 %. The amount of this reduction was dependent on the porosity of the vegetation and the flow rate, and was greater at lower flow rates and porosities. These changes in turbulent flow fields around patches of emergent vegetation are likely to be important in determining sediment budgets in their vicinity...|$|R

Nearshore zones in the fresh-water, tidally influenced northwest delta were dominated by riprap, and contained sparse sections of tule beds, beaches, and riparian zones. A total of six beach seine sites and eight electrofish sites were sampled during winter 2001 along the Sacramento River, Steamboat Slough, Miner Slough, Prospect Island Marsh, Prospect Slough, and Liberty Island Marsh. Overall, fry densities were higher on the Sacramento River and Steamboat Slough and lower in Liberty and Prospect Island marshes. Chinook salmon fry were significantly larger in the Sacramento River than in Steamboat Slough during March. Highest densities of Chinook salmon fry were observed in shallow beaches than in riprap nearshore zones. Fry densities also increased with Secchi depth and richness of non-native predators, suggesting increased predation risk by opportunistic predators. Shallow nearshore environments in <b>conveyance</b> <b>channels,</b> such as Steamboat Slough and the Sacramento River, seem important for Chinook salmon fry rearing.

Constructing a labyrinth weir in an existing spillway {{is an example of}} an effective way to increases the spillway crest length and the corresponding discharge capacity for the same operating head. Thus, labyrinth weir are well suited to the sites where increasing the spillway width and maximum reservoir water surface elevation would be difficult, yet larger discharge are needed. This type of weir consists of series of slender walls having a repeating shape in plan, usually triangular or trapezoidal with vertical upstream faces and steeply slopping downstream faces. Over the past few decades, labyrinth spillways have been constructed throughout the world.

To best manage water quality one {{must understand the}} sources and sinks of both solutes and water to the river system. Nutrient concentration patterns can identify source and sink locations, but cannot always determine biotic processes that affect nutrient concentrations. Modeling tools can provide insight into these large-scale processes. To address questions about large-scale nitrogen removal in the Middle Rio Grande, NM, we created a system dynamics nitrate model using an existing integrated surface water [...] groundwater model of the region to evaluate our conceptual models of uptake and denitrification as potential nitrate removal mechanisms. We modeled denitrification in groundwater as a first-order process dependent only on concentration and used a 5 % denitrification rate. Uptake {{was assumed to be}} proportional to transpiration and was modeled {{as a percentage of the}} evapotranspiration calculated within the model multiplied by the nitrate concentration in the water being transpired. We modeled riparian uptake as 90 % and agricultural uptake as 50 % of the respective evapotranspiration rates. Using these removal rates, our model results suggest that riparian uptake, agricultural uptake and denitrification in groundwater are all needed to produce the observed nitrate concentrations in the groundwater, <b>conveyance</b> <b>channels,</b> and river as well as the seasonal concentration patterns. The model results indicate that a total of 497 metric tons of nitrate-N are removed from the Middle Rio Grande annually.

40|$|Desert {{riparian}} {{forests are}} the main restored vegetation community in Heihe River basin. They provide critical habitats {{and a variety of}} ecosystem services in this arid environment. Since desert riparian forests are also sensitive to disturbance, examining the spatial distribution and temporal variation of these forests and their influencing factors is important to determine the limiting factors of vegetation recovery after long-term restoration. In this study, field experiment and remote sensing data were used to determine the spatial distribution and temporal variation of desert riparian forests and their relationship with the environmental factors. We classified five types of vegetation communities at different distances from the river channel. Community coverage and diversity formed a bimodal pattern, peaking at the distances of 1000  and 3000  m from the river channel. In general, the temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trend from  2000 to  2014 was positive at different distances from the river channel, except for the region closest to the river bank (i. e. within 500  m from the river channel), which had been undergoing degradation since  2011. The spatial distribution of desert riparian forests was mainly influenced by the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e. g. soil moisture, bulk density and soil particle composition). Meanwhile, while the temporal variation of vegetation was affected by both the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e. g. soil moisture and soil particle composition) and to a lesser extent, the temporal variation of water availability (e. g. annual average and variability of groundwater, soil moisture and runoff). Since surface (0 – 30  cm) and deep (100 – 200  cm) soil moisture, bulk density and the annual average of soil moisture at 100  cm obtained from the remote sensing data were regarded as major determining factors of community distribution and temporal variation, conservation measures that protect the soil structure and prevent soil moisture depletion (e. g. artificial soil cover and water <b>conveyance</b> <b>channels)</b> were suggested to better protect desert riparian forests under climate change and intensive human disturbance...|$|R
40|$|In many aquatic systems, from tidal creeks with {{fringing}} mangroves to {{rivers and}} associated floodplains, there exists an interface between dense vegetation {{and a high}} <b>conveyance</b> <b>channel.</b> A shear flow develops across this interface and its dynamics influences the exchange of mass and momentum between the vegetation and the channel. This thesis describes an experimental study in a shallow laboratory channel with 1 / 3 of its width filled with circular cylinders, a model for emergent vegetation. The experiments reveal {{the formation of a}} shear layer with nearly periodic vortex structures. The vortices are documented with respect to their physical characteristics and their effect on mass and momentum exchange. Distributions of mean velocity and turbulent Reynolds stress show a two layer structure in the shear flow. An inner layer exists near the interface, with a width that establishes the penetration of momentum into the vegetation; an outer boundary layer exists in the main channel, where the vortices reside, with a width independent of the vegetation. In each layer the mean velocity distributions are self-similar. Results of a linear stability analysis suggest that channels with differential drag are conducive to the growth of Kelvin-Helmoltz shear instabilities. Indeed vortices are observed for all experimental conditions, and their passage frequency matches the most unstable frequency from linear theory. A typical vortex structure is educed by conditional sampling, and reveals strong crossflows consisting of sweeps from the main channel and ejections from the vegetation, leading to high Reynolds stress at the interface. (cont.) The sweeps also maintain the coherent structures by increasing the shear at the interface and enhancing energy production. Finally, a model is developed for exchange between the vegetation and the channel in terms of the vortex size and passage frequency. The semi-empirical model describes both mass transfer coefficients and interfacial friction coefficients in data from a range of vegetated flows, and suggests that a constant proportion of the vortex volume is exchanged over each cycle. The exchange coefficient is used to quantify the flushing timescale of a vegetated layer, and is applied to the problem of overbank transport of suspended sediment between a river and its floodplain. by Brian L.

40|$|The Rio Grande River {{flows from}} its {{headwaters}} in southern Colorado, south through New Mexico, turning southeast at El Paso, Texas, where {{it becomes the}} international boundary between the United States and Mexico until it drains into the Gulf of Mexico. The Rio Grande is a “National Historic River. ” The Rio Grande is managed according to interstate and international agreements that apportion its water through the operation of reservoirs and diversion systems. Downstream of Elephant Butte Reservoir, New Mexico {{the waters of the}} Rio Grande are used primarily by irrigators {{on both sides of the}} border. The City of El Paso, however, under contractual agreements with the local irrigation districts treats Rio Grande water to supplement the city’s drinking water supply. This paper provides an overview of the hydrologic challenges of making the Rio Grande “wet” once again through the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez region on the U. S. -Mexico border. Currently water is released downstream only during the irrigation season, which during normal-flow years extends from late February to early October. Every aspect of water delivery in the stretch of the Rio Grande from Elephant Butte Reservoir and El Paso, Texas is managed through the use of engineering structures that divert water for irrigation or municipal uses. In the past 100 years, the response to declining flow within the actual river has turned a once meandering stream to an efficient <b>conveyance</b> <b>channel.</b> The historical water flow and water quality data recorded at various gauging locations downstream of the Elephant Reservoir to Fort Quitman, Texas are reviewed and analyzed to determine the impacts and structure of the existing delivery system.

40|$|From Imperial Dam downstream, in {{addition}} to Mexico, the Colorado River supplies water to Arizona and California for predominantly agricultural use. In Arizona, the Colorado River is {{the major source of}} water supply to the various irrigation districts in the Yuma area. Due to legal constraints, the amount of Colorado River water available to the State of Arizona is limited. On the other hand, it was discovered that the amount of water applied to the soil in irrigation exceeds that amount needed for crop-growing. Two areas where the amount of water considerably exceeds the requirements, the mesa section of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District and the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District, were studied in detail. The excess water applied on the mesa of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District flows into the Wellton-Mohawk Valley whence it is pumped into a <b>conveyance</b> <b>channel</b> and then discharged into the main channel of the Colorado River. This drain water has a very high salt content and therefore it adversely affects the quality of the river water. Since the drain water is discharged into the Colorado River above the point of diversion to Mexico and it is considered {{to be part of the}} Mexican water allotment, the quality of the Colorado River water has become a source of friction between the United States and the Republic of Mexico. The excess irrigation water from the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District flows into the adjacent valleys as well as into uncultivated areas. In the adjacent valleys it is raising the water table and thus causing drainage problems. When it flows underground into the uncultivated lands, in large measure it constitutes a loss of water that otherwise could be put to beneficial use by Arizona. It is known that flood irrigation is not conducive to efficient application of water in the sandy soils that are predominant in these areas, and that the effects of this application of excess water are diverse and far-reaching. The change to sprinkler irrigation would be advantageous in many ways and beneficial to all concerned. The change to sprinkler irrigation on the mesa of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District would benefit both the farmers and the district financially. At the same time, it would decrease the salinity of the Colorado River water, thereby improving the quality of the water that Mexico receives and, consequently, the relations between the United States and the Republic of Mexico. In the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District, the change in the method of irrigation would increase the amount of water available for use by the State of Arizona. Furthermore, it would alleviate the drainage problem of the adjacent valleys and would thereby decrease the amount of drain water flowing back into the channel of the Colorado River. In this district, such a change may entail a small added cost to the farmer. Alternatives for augmenting the flow of the Colorado River, such as importation of water from other basins, desalting sea water, phreatophyte eradication, and evaporation suppression, were found to be economically unfeasible at present or still in the experimental stages...|$|E

Found approximately in the geographic middle of New Mexico, Socorro County is an agricultural community that relies on the Rio Grande as {{the major source of}} water for irrigation. The Rio Grande is used throughout the region for agricultural, industrial, domestic-municipal consumption, recreation and riparian vegetation, {{as well as for the}} protection of endangered species found in the environment. Salinity, a concern for all users, has been studied throughout the Rio Grande from Colorado to the Mexico border. Previous research suggests that salinity may increase through irrigation practices, municipal and industrial uses, evapotranspiration, climatic changes, and natural geologic processes and weathering of minerals. This study examines salinity variability in river and irrigation water through the Socorro region, from late February to November; within the time that irrigation water is diverted by the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, and delivered to agricultural lands through a series of canals and diversions. The study reach extends from the San Acacia Diversion Dam, north of Socorro, where irrigation for agriculture is supplied by the surface and groundwater return flows from the Unit 7 Drain and runs south for approximately 44 kilometers to San Antonio, NM, near the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. The Low Flow <b>Conveyance</b> <b>Channel</b> (LFCC) is found directly west of the river and is hydrologically connected through ground water seepage to the river in areas where the river bed is higher than the valley floor, and through diversions to the drain and irrigation systems. The Riverside drain is found west of the LFCC, between the irrigation canals and farms, and LFCC, drawing off excess water from agricultural fields. Salinity of the Rio Grande, LFCC, drains, and the irrigation canal flows were measured semi-monthly, both preseason and throughout the irrigation season from February 28 to November 10, 2011. Regional flows of the Rio Grande, within the Socorro region between San Acacia and San Antonio, NM, were compared to associated salinity within this time frame. Seasonality accounted for the greatest salinity variations. Electroconductivity (EC), as well as alkalinity, in general, rose over time along the study reach. For example, the EC at any given point in early spring (April 18) was between 590 and 861 μs/cm, while by the later part of the irrigation season ranged from 812 and 967 μs/cm (October 28). During the same time period, the alkalinity of samples (as CaCO 3) ranged from 105 - 156 mg/L (April 18) to 176 - 209 mg/L (October 28). As expected, in most cases, salinity increased further south down river. Alkalinity and streamflow showed a positive correlation. Salinity increased in the river and associated channels when there was less streamflow. The salinity of the Rio Grande at San Acacia on April 7 was 537 μs/cm compared to San Antonio at 605 μs/cm on the same day. In addition, irrigation water, in general, had higher EC and alkalinity than the Rio Grande, except for periods in late summer when the river was at its lowest stream flow or had no flow at all. For instance, San Antonio irrigation was higher over the course of the season (average 868 μs/cm), than the river water EC average (715 μs/cm) at San Antonio. The major ions were primarily calcium and sodium cations and carbonate, and to a lesser degree sulfate anions. The river and irrigation samples showed similar ionic compositions through time, while the drain and LFCC water samples showed less calcium and sodium carbonates...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Debris flows, which {{occur in}} {{mountain}} settings worldwide, {{have been particularly}} damaging in the glaciated basins flanking the stratovolcanoes in the Cascade Range of the northwestern United States. This thesis contains two manuscripts that respectively investigate the (1) initiation processes of debris flows in these glaciated catchments, and (2) debris flow occurrence {{and its effect on}} valley bottoms over the last thousand years. In a 2006 storm, seven debris flows initiated from proglacial gullies of separate basins on the flanks of Mount Rainier. Gully heads at glacier termini and distributed collapse of gully walls imply that clear water was transformed to debris flow through progressive addition of sediment along gully lengths. In the first study, we analyze gully changes, reconstruct runoff conditions, and assess spatial distributions of debris flows to infer the processes and conditions necessary for debris flow initiation in glaciated catchments. Gully measurements suggest that sediment bulking requires steep gradients, abundant unstable material, and sufficient gully length. Reconstruction of runoff generated during the storm suggests that glaciers are important for generating the runoff necessary for debris flow initiation, particularly because infiltration capacities on glacial till covered surfaces well exceed measured rainfall rates. Runoff generation from glaciers and abundant loose debris at their termini explain why all debris flows in the storm initiated from proglacial areas. Proglacial areas that produced debris flows have steeper drainage networks with significantly higher elevations and lower drainage areas, suggesting that debris flows are associated with high elevation glaciers with relatively steep proglacial areas. This correlation reflects positive slope-elevation trends for the Mount Rainier volcano. An indirect effect of glacier change is thus the change in the distribution of ice-free slopes, which influence a basin’s debris flow potential. These findings have implications for projections of debris flow activity in basins experiencing glacier change. The second study uses a variety of dating techniques to reconstruct a chronology of debris flows in the Kautz Creek valley on the southwest flank of Mount Rainier (Washington). Dendrochronologic dating of growth disturbances combined with lichenometric techniques constrained five debris flow ages from 1712 to 1915 AD. We also estimated ages of three debris flows ranging in age from ca. 970 to 1661. Run-out distances served as a proxy for debris flow magnitude, and indicate that at least 11, 2, and 1 debris flow(s) have traveled at least 1, 3, and 5 km from the valley head, respectively since ca. 1650. Valley form reflects the frequency-magnitude relationship indicated by the chronology. In the upper, relatively steep valley, discrete debris flow snouts and secondary channels are abundant, suggesting a process of debris flow <b>conveyance,</b> <b>channel</b> plugging, and channel avulsion. The lower valley is characterized by relatively smooth surfaces, an absence of bouldery debris flow snouts, few secondary channels, and relatively old surface ages inferred from the presence of tephra layers. We infer that the lower valley is deposited on by relatively infrequent, large magnitude, low-yield strength debris flows like an event in 1947, which deposited wide, tabular lobes of debris outside of the main channel. Debris flows during the Little Ice Age (LIA) predominantly traveled no further than the upper valley. Stratigraphic evidence suggests that the main Kautz Creek channel was filled during the LIA, enhancing debris flow deposition on the valley surface and perhaps reducing run-out lengths. Diminished areas and gradients in front of glaciers during the LIA also likely contributed to decreased run-out lengths. These findings suggest that changes in debris flow source and depositional zones resulting from temperature and glacier cycles influence the magnitude and run-out distances of debris flows, and the dynamics of deposition in valley bottoms...|$|E

Three different approaches regarding the modelling of off-channel storage are considered, namely, the single-channel approach and two interface-plane methods, which artificially separate main channel flows from floodplain flows, using (i) vertical and (ii) diagonal interface planes. The single-channel method, which views composite flow fields as single units without storage, produced significant differences between simulated and observed stage and discharge hydrographs. The vertical interface method gave generally good results {{in the case of}} the laboratory data, but was less successful when applied to the field data. The diagonal interface method, which in this instance applied outward-facing diagonal interface planes at the junctions of the main channel and floodplain zones, produced superior results overalPublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|The Kugart River, Kyrgyzstan, {{has been}} partly channelised {{in the past}} decades {{with the aim of}} {{reducing}} floodingrisk for the villages of the surrounding, fairly densely populated flood plain. The reduction of the channel width was expected to improve the <b>channel</b> <b>conveyance</b> of the high sediment load produced by the river basin. The resulting longitudinal sequence of relatively sharp channel expansions and contractions has, however, triggered rapid siltation rates in the narrower reaches. Such a relatively unexpected dynamics motivated the application of a numerical model to understand the causes of the silting processes. Migrating sediment waves related to channel expansions and contractions are found to be the main driving forces of aggrading and degrading processes. The outcomes of the analysis allow to suggest possible mitigation measures to reduce the high silting rates and disclose the main parameters which govern the process...|$|R
40|$|Stoppage and {{deposition}} of debris flows {{due to an}} abrupt flattening of channel slope aretheoretically and experimentally studied. A critical slope {{is defined as a}} function of concentration, angle of repose and densities of debrisand water. On a channel steeper than that slope debris can flow without any deposition. Thecapacities of the <b>conveyance</b> of the <b>channels</b> in such cases are discussed. Another critical slope, on a channel flatter than which a debris flow deposits with that slopeangle is obtained. This critical slope is a function of water discharge in the debris flow and the phy-sical properties of the deposit. Depositting processes in such cases are mathematically modeled. A debris flow can flow with partial deposition on the channel of which slope is between thetwo critical slopes. The process of channel bed variation in such a case is also treated. Theoretically obtained results are proved valid by the experiments...|$|R
40|$|In Bourke Irrigation {{district}} (BID), one of {{the most}} productive agricultural soil types is the Vertosol which has been extensively developed for irrigated agricultural production. However, there have been increasing instances of decline in productivity as a result of secondary soil salinization due to injudicious location of water storages and <b>conveyance</b> <b>channels</b> in irrigated farmlands. Therefore, it is important to map the soil in this area to understand the long-term sustainability issues and spatial variability in soil types. A great deal of soil data is required to characterise large areas such as BID. One approach is to use digital soil mapping (DSM) methods because they rely on the use of low-cost ancillary data to value add to limited soil information via the use of spatial and non-spatial numerical methods. In this thesis, two different DSM approaches are used in order to identify soil landscape units and a soil property (i. e. ECe dS/m). Firstly ancillary data, including remotely sensed air-borne gamma-ray (gamma-ray) spectrometer (i. e. potassium-K, uranium-U, thorium-Th and total counts-TC) and proximal sensed EM 38 in the horizontal (EM 38 h) and vertical (EM 38 v) mode of operation are used with a non-spatial numerical clustering algorithm (fuzzy k-means: FKM). The FKM analysis (using Mahalanobis metric) of the kriged ancillary (i. e. common 100 m grid) data revealed a fuzziness exponent (phi) of 1. 4 was suitable for further analysis and that k = 4 classes was smallest for the fuzziness performance index (FPI) and normalised classification entropy (NCE). Using laboratory measured physical (i. e. clay) and chemical (i. e. CEC, ECe and pH) properties revealed k = 4 was minimized in terms of mean squared prediction error (i. e. sigma 2 p,C) when considering topsoil (0 - 0. 3 m) and subsoil (0. 9 - 1. 2 m) Clay, CEC, ECe and pH (i. e. only for topsoil). Secondly, in order to map a soil property limiting agricultural productivity, ancillary data, including remote and proximal, were used with a spatial numerical model (linear mixed modelling-LMM and restricted likely - REML) to map the spatial distribution of the saturated soil paste –extract (ECe dS/m). DSM of ECe using the same sources of ancillary data and empirical best linear unbiased prediction (E-BLUP) showed elevation, radioelement of thorium (Th) and logEM 38 v were the most statistically useful ancillary data. It was also found that the development of an error budget procedure, enabled the quantification of the relative contributions that model, input, combined and covariate error made to the prediction error of the map of ECe. The combined error is approximately 4. 44 dS/m, which is relatively large compared to the standard deviation of measured ECe (3. 61 dS/m). Of this error, most of it is attributable to the input error (1. 38 dS/m) which is larger than the model error (0. 02 dS/m). In terms of the input error, it is determined that the larger standard deviation is attributable to the lack of ancillary data, namely the ECa in areas adjacent to the Darling River and also on the aeolian dune where data collection was difficult owing to dense native vegetation...|$|R
