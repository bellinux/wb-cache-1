A [...] "pilot" [...] microwave beam emitted {{from the center of the}} rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna.

This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the phase <b>control</b> <b>value</b> fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused. Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the differences in mandibular morphology between the deviated and nondeviated sides in patients with noncongenital skeletal mandibular asymmetry.

As with the private sector, which focuses on [...] "customer service", NPM reforms often focused on the [...] "...centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector." [...] NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used e-government consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using quasi-market structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in health care). Key themes in NPM were [...] "...financial <b>control,</b> <b>value</b> for money, increasing efficiency...,identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over.. power to the senior management" [...] executives.

Subjects and methods: To determine whether early-life stress leads {{to changes in the}} limbic system structures: the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens, 9 -day-old Wistar rats were exposed to 24 hour MD. On P 60 the rats were sacrificed for morphometric analysis and their brains were compared to the control group. Results: Results show that MD affected important limbic system structures: the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens, whose volume was decreased (17 % of the <b>control</b> <b>value</b> for the amygdala and 9 % of the <b>control</b> <b>value</b> for the nucleus accumbens), as well as the number of neurons (41 % of the <b>control</b> <b>value</b> for the amygdala and 43 % of the <b>control</b> <b>value</b> for the nucleus accumbens) and the size of their cells soma (12 % of the <b>control</b> <b>value</b> for the amygdala and 33 % of the <b>control</b> <b>value</b> for the nucleus accumbens).
