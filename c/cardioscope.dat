40|$|ObjectiveCardioscopy {{is a novel}} {{imaging method}} that allows closed-chest, {{real-time}} fiberoptic imaging of intracardiac structures. This study tested the feasibility and safety of cardioscopy as a platform for mitral and tricuspid valve surgery in the beating heart. MethodsThrough a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass was established in 10 calves. Lactated Ringer’s solution was administered through the pulmonary artery to eliminate residual blood volumes in the lung vasculature and was drained through a left ventricular cannula. A fiberoptic <b>cardioscope</b> within its translucent outer sheath was inserted through the left ventricle. Irrigating solution was continuously administered through the <b>cardioscope</b> sheath for clearer visualization. An endoscopic clip was used for edge-to-edge repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves. After mitral valve clipping, the <b>cardioscope</b> was inserted into the right ventricle. The solution was administered from the right atrium and continuously drained from the pulmonary artery. After tricuspid valve repair, the animal was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. ResultsSuccessful double-valve repair {{was carried out in}} all 10 cases. All calves were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with dobutamine only. Hematocrit values were maintained during the procedure (pre 29. 0 % ± 3. 1 % vs post 28. 5 % ± 3. 6 %, P = . 70). ConclusionsThis study showed the technical feasibility of beating heart valve surgery using direct cardioscopic visualization. Cardioscopy represents a promising platform for future interventions and surgery under direct visualization in the beating heart...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveEndoscopic {{methods to}} perform {{intracardiac}} procedures are of enormous interest, {{with the introduction}} of transcatheter techniques for complex cardiac procedures. In the present study, we demonstrate the use of a novel transapical cardioscopy system to visualize intracardiac structures in a porcine model. MethodsThe <b>cardioscope</b> was designed to mount a miniature CCD camera at its tip and was covered in a blunt convex Plexiglass top that allowed displacement and visualization of the tissue in front of the <b>cardioscope.</b> Transapical access for 11 -mm cardioscopy was performed by way of a median sternotomy (n =  4) and minithoracotomy (n =  1) in an anesthetized porcine model, and various cardiac structures were imaged under beating heart conditions. The images from the camera were projected onto a monitor for the operator to guide <b>cardioscope</b> positioning. ResultsVideo images and identification of structures {{on the left side of}} an in vivo beating porcine heart were obtained. Initially, the papillary muscle and mitral valve components were evaluated. The left atrium was entered, and the pulmonary vein orifices and atrial appendage were confirmed. Next, the camera was positioned within the left ventricle, and the ventricular portion of the trileaflet aortic valve was inspected. Using direct visualization, the camera was passed into the proximal ascending aorta. The left and right coronary arteries were also visualized. A catheter was introduced by way of a side port to confirm the position of the aortic valve leaflets during visualization. The pig experienced no significant decrease in blood pressure and maintained a stable heart rate throughout the procedure. The port was removed, and the transapical incision was closed with minimal blood loss during the procedure and closure of the orifice. ConclusionsTransapical cardioscopy is a novel approach that allows for precise visualization of intracardiac structures within a beating porcine heart without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. This technique might allow for more successful minimally invasive valvular, intracardiac, or ascending aortic procedures without the use of radiation...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Anaphylaxis during {{anesthesia}} {{is a rare}} {{event that}} may occur in up to 1 : 20, 000 cases and approximately 60 % to 70 % of these cases are secondary {{to the use of}} muscle relaxants, particularly succinylcholine and rocuronium. The aim of this report is to describe the treatment of a case of rocuronium-induced anaphylaxis with inadequate response to traditional therapy, and the case resolution after using sugammadex. Case report: A female patient, 62 years old, 72 kg, was referred to the surgical center for treatment of epidural hematoma following an accident at home. She was monitored with pulse oximetry, <b>cardioscope,</b> and blood pressure meter for non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurement. The baseline data were: BP 138 / 80 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) 80 bpm, and oxygen saturation (SaO 2) 100 % on room air. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 70 mg, fentanyl 200 mg, and rocuronium 45 mg. After tracheal intubation, anaphylaxis non-responsive to conventional treatment was diagnosed. We chose the use of sugammadex 700 mg intravenously as an adjuvant agent. The patient had reversal of the anaphylactic reactions with improvement of hemodynamic profile and was operated and conducted to the intensive care unit. Conclusion: In this case, sugammadex was used to reverse the hemodynamic picture caused by rocuronium-induced anaphylaxis. However, {{it was not possible to}} identify the exact mechanism for the reversal...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} utility of {{ultrasound}} visualization for guiding ablation of cardiac tissue, an intracardiac ultrasound <b>cardioscope</b> incorporating a catheter visualization/delivery system into the imaging head of the device was examined in 16 dogs. The ultrasound ablation probe (Acuson 7. 5 MHz/ 8 mm) was introduced via the right external jugular vein into the right atrium/ventricle. Long axis imaging from the probe to a depth exceeding 7 cm enabled high resolution visualization extending from the pulmonary veins, through the level of each cardiac valve to the left ventricular apex. Ablation catheters along with tip electrodes were readily visualized, allowing their non-fluoroscopic passage across the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves for ventricular mapping and ablation. Specific parallel or perpendicular catheter tip/tissue orientation was readily documented in each case, as was the catheter tip/tissue contact {{with the use of}} standard and basket array catheters. For ablation of right heart structures, an ablation catheter port incorporated into the imaging head facilitated direct visualization of the catheter-tissue interface and evolving tissue injury and thrombus formation during ablation. Using non-contrast techniques, ablation lesions in the left ventricle could be measured and catheter-related clot formation monitored. Perfusion catheter tip flow used to ameliorate the ablation-related impedance rise was also documented by color flow techniques. These studies demonstrate the facilitation of ablation catheter positioning and catheter tip/tissue orientation and contact monitoring with a high resolution intracardiac ultrasound system. This study strongly supports the concept of incorporating ultrasound and ablation catheter deployment into a single cardioscopy system...|$|E
40|$|NASA {{has applied}} its {{communications}} equipment expertise to {{development of a}} communications console that provides, in a compact package only slightly larger than an electric typewriter, all the emergency medical services communications functions needed for a regional hospital. A prototype unit, built by Johnson Space Center, has been installed in the Odessa (Texas) Medical Center Hospital. The hospital is the medical control center for the 17 -county Permian Basin Emergency Medical System in west Texas. The console project originated {{in response to a}} request to NASA from the Texas governor's office, which sought a better way of providing emergency medical care in rural areas. Because ambulance travel time is frequently long in remote areas of west Texas, it is important that treatment begin {{at the scene of the}} emergency rather than at the hospital emergency room. A radio and telephone system linking ambulance emergency technicians and hospital staff makes this possible. But earlier equipment was complex, requiring specialized operators. A highly reliable system was needed to minimize breakdowns and provide controls of utmost simplicity, so that the system could be operated by physicians and nurses rather than by communications specialists. The resulting console has both radio and telephone sections. With the radio equipment, hospital personnel can communicate with ambulance drivers and paramedics, receive incoming electrocardiagrams, consult with other hospitals, page hospital staff and set up a radio-to-telephone "patch. " The telephone portion of the system includes a hotline from the Permian Basin Emergency Medical Service's resource control center, an automatic dialer for contacting special care facilities in the Permian Basin network, a hospital intercom terminal and a means of relaying <b>cardioscope</b> displays and other data between hospitals. The integrated system also provides links with local disaster and civil defense organizations and with emergency "Dial 911 " control points...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Due to {{the high}} {{incidence}} of technical and neurological complications, continuous spinal blocks were not performed for several years. With the advent of intermediate catheters the technique has been used more often and gaining acceptance among anesthesiologists. The objective of this report was to demonstrate the usefulness of the technique as a viable alternative for medium and major size surgeries. CASE REPORT: This is a 58 years old female patient, weighing 62 kg, physical status ASA I, with a history of migraines, low back pain, and prior surgeries under spinal block without intercurrence. The patient was scheduled for exploratory laparotomy for a probable pelvic tumor. After venoclysis with an 18 G catheter, monitoring with <b>cardioscope,</b> non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry was instituted; she was sedated with 2 mg of midazolam and 100 μg of fentanyl, and placed in left lateral decubitus. The patient underwent continuous spinal block through the median approach in L 3 -L 4; 9 mg of 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine and 120 μ g of morphine sulfate were administered. Inspection of the abdominal cavity revealed a gastric stromal tumor that required an increase in the incision for a partial gastrectomy. A small dose of hyperbaric solution was required for the entire procedure, which was associated with complete hemodynamic stability. Postoperative admission to the ICU was not necessary; the patient presented a good evolution without complaints and {{with a high degree of}} satisfaction. She was discharged from the hospital after 72 hours without intercurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate catheters used in continuous spinal blocks have shown the potential to turn it an attractive and useful technique in medium and large size surgeries and it can even be an effective alternative in the management of critical patients to whom hemodynamic repercussions can be harmful...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesBetter {{control of}} the level, intensity, and {{duration}} of spinal analgesia represents the greatest advantages of continuous spinal anesthesia. With the advent of intermediate catheters (over-the-needle catheter) and its low incidence of headaches and neurological symptoms, the technique has been gaining credibility. The objective {{of this paper is}} to report the possible safety of the new catheter with a large dose of hyperbaric 0. 5 % bupivacaine with 1. 6 % glucose associated with hyperbaric 2 % lidocaine with 1. 6 % glucose. Case ReportMale patient, 78 years old, 85 kg, 168 cm, physical status ASA III, with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure. The patient was candidate for surgery for huge bilateral inguinal and umbilical hernias, being submitted to preoperative pneumoperitoneum for one week to stretch abdominal cavity. After venoclysis with an 18 G catheter, he was monitored with <b>cardioscope,</b> non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry; he was sedated with 1 mg of midazolam and 100 μg of fentanyl intravenously, and placed in left lateral decubitus. He underwent continuous spinal anesthesia by a median puncture in L 3 -L 4 with a set with a 27 G cut-bevel needle and 22 G catheter. The total dose of anesthetic used was 25 mg of 0. 5 % bupivacaine (hyperbaric, with 1. 6 % glucose), 160 mg of 2 % lidocaine (hyperbaric, with 1. 6 % glucose), and morphine (100 μg). The patient was followed-up until the 30 th postoperative day without neurological complaints. ConclusionsRecently, the poor distribution of the local anesthetic through the microcatheter was attributed as the cause of cauda equina syndrome. This case report showed that, with the administration of high doses of hyperbaric anesthetics through the new catheter, poor distribution or risk of cauda equina syndrome were not observed...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesWerdnig-Hoffmann {{disease is}} {{the most common cause of}} {{hypotonia}} in infants and its prognosis is worse if it is present shortly after delivery. Symmetrical muscular weakness, areflexia, and fasciculations of the tongue are characteristic. The majority of the infants die before two years of age as a consequence of respiratory failure. The present report presents a case in which total intravenous anesthesia was used. Case reportThis is a 1 year old white female weighing 10 kg, physical status ASA III, with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease diagnosed at two months of age. The patient was a candidate for open gastrostomy, fundus gastroplication, and tracheostomy. After venoclysis, the patient was monitored with <b>cardioscope,</b> non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter, precordial stethoscope, and rectal temperature. She was oxygenated and, after bolus administration of atropine (0. 3 mg), boluses of remifentanil (20 μg) and propofol (30 mg) were administered for anesthetic induction. After tracheal intubation, she was ventilated with manual controlled system without CO 2 absorber, Baraka (Mapleson D system), FGF of 4 l. min- 1, and FiO 2 0. 5 (O 2 /N 2 O). Anesthesia was maintained with continuous manual infusion of propofol, 250 μg. kg- 1. min- 1, and remifentanil, 0. 3 μg. kg- 1. min- 1. The surgery lasted 150 minutes. The patient regained consciousness 8 minutes after the end of the infusion, ventilating spontaneously. Two hours later, she was transferred to the pediatric unit, being discharged from the hospital on the fourth postoperative day. ConclusionsThe choice of anesthetic technique gives priority to the safety associated with the familiarity of handling available drugs. In children with neuromuscular diseases, due to the extremely short duration, total intravenous anesthesia with remifentanil and propofol in infusion systems can have a favorable influence on disease evolution...|$|E
