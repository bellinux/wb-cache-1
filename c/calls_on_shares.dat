2500|$|In London, puts and [...] "refusals" [...] (calls) {{first became}} {{well-known}} trading {{instruments in the}} 1690s {{during the reign of}} William III and Mary II. Privileges were options sold over the counter in nineteenth century America, with both puts and <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares</b> offered by specialized dealers. Their exercise price was fixed at a rounded-off market price on the day or week that the option was bought, and the expiry date was generally three months after purchase. They were not traded in secondary markets.|$|E

"The fifteen {{thousand}} pounds mentioned above {{as having been}} drawn by me from my bank {{for the purpose of}} the mortgage, was really used for the payment of <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares</b> held by me in the Oakhurst Mining Company.

50|$|For {{a limited}} {{liability}} company, {{the legal right}} of the company to make calls and the obligation to pay them ceases when shares become fully paid. In Australia, a mining exploration company may be formed as a no liability company, which {{is not able to}} make <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares,</b> even on partly paid shares.|$|E

50|$|From {{this time}} until early 1848 {{the price of}} NBR shares was on a {{downward}} slide, and many shareholders regretted the refusal of Hudson's 8% offer; Hudson declined to renew the offer when requested {{to do so in}} September 1848. Although part of it had been opened, completion of the Hawick line was stalled through inability to get <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares</b> paid.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares</b> became due {{some of the}} {{shareholders}} defaulted and arrears soon amounted to £28,000: the company was unable to pay current bills. On 23 July 1840 statutory authority to raise a further £75,000 was obtained, and the opportunity provided by this second application to Parliament was used to change the name to the West London Railway Company.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{the line}} began in 1847, and by 1849 over £100,000 had been {{expended}} {{on the construction of}} the line, the majority on works (£52,921) and permanent way (£31,597). The bursting of the speculative bubble of the Railway Mania in the late 1840s adversely affected the line's prospects. By early 1849 the company's <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares</b> were in arrears.|$|E

25|$|The railway mania was a {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} huge number of railway schemes were put forward, when investors imagined that huge gains on investment were certain. Investors overcommitted themselves, and many lost substantial sums; money became scarce even for respectable schemes as subscribers simply had no money to pay <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> their <b>shares.</b> At the same time labour and material prices escalated substantially.|$|R
5000|$|By 1851 {{about half}} (...) {{of the line}} had been {{completed}} as a single line; the [...] branch was by then in abeyance. In early 1852 the <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares</b> were still in arrears requiring the company to funds by loans. An estimated £65,000 was required for {{the completion of the}} line; £40,000 had been borrowed by late January 1852; over £55,000 by mid 1852.|$|E
5000|$|Connecting Christchurch to {{the main}} line network was only a first step, and income from the line was very poor. Undaunted by the poor {{response}} to <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares,</b> the Company took powers by Act of 13 July 1863 to raise an additional £30,000 and extend the line [...] to {{the east side of}} Holdenhurst Road in Bournemouth; the present-day Bournemouth station is on the west of that road. The location was criticised by a local newspaper as being too far from the town centre.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{started at}} once; {{it seems that}} it was mostly carried out by direct labour under Coad's control. Some {{modifications}} to the route were required as Coad's original alignment {{was found to be}} impracticable in certain details. Work started at the Cheesewring, and the permanent way used stone block sleepers, the stone blocks being procured at Cheesewring itself. Lower down, serious problems were encountered in gaining possession of land from the Duchy of Cornwall, who were demanding very high prices for the land. The railway construction was costing more than had been estimated, {{and at the same time}} some subscribers were not responding to <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> <b>shares</b> they had taken up. The Company found itself unable to pay the Duchy's price.|$|E
50|$|The {{run to the}} FA Cup Final in 1900 had {{generated}} a surplus of £31 but the club were still £1,000 in debt. In July 1900, the company made a <b>call</b> <b>on</b> its <b>shares</b> {{in an effort to}} raise cash. The response to the call was disappointing with many shareholders having their shares forfeited {{as a result of their}} failure to pay the balance due.|$|R
50|$|Although arrears <b>on</b> <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> the <b>shares</b> {{were said}} to be minimal, the take up of the {{authorised}} share issue was incomplete, and the company soon found itself short of cash and appealed to the Caledonian Railway for financial help, which was swiftly refused. The request was repeated in June 1892 with the same result. Subsequent appeals to the public to subscribe were not much taken up, and a large loan was incurred, much of it personally guaranteed by the directors of the company.|$|R
50|$|An {{official}} receiver {{was appointed to}} pursue the former directors of the Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union for misfeasance, and other funds. It recovered £7000 in damages for misfeasance and £1200 in <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> unpaid <b>shares</b> from former shareholders. However, a group of debenture holders {{had not yet been}} paid. They claimed the money recovered was theirs, given that it first went to the company on which they held charges, and could not be used to pay unsecured creditors before the debentures were paid off.|$|R
5000|$|Contracts {{similar to}} options {{have been used}} since ancient times. The first reputed option buyer was the ancient Greek {{mathematician}} and philosopher Thales of Miletus. On a certain occasion, {{it was predicted that}} the season's olive harvest would be larger than usual, and during the off-season, he acquired the right to use a number of olive presses the following spring. When spring came and the olive harvest was larger than expected he exercised his options and then rented the presses out at a much higher price than he paid for his 'option'.

50|$|No-liability {{companies}} are differentiated from other companies as their shareholders are not liable to pay <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> unpaid <b>shares.</b> This differs from traditional company structure where {{the purchase of}} shares is a binding contract. Should the shareholder choose not to pay {{when there is a}} call, the shareholder forfeits both the unpaid and paid shares. This encourages investment in potentially risky mining ventures, as a shareholder with unpaid shares can choose to withdraw from the company with no legal consequences. A successful mining company usually converts to a limited liability company when advantageous.|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the adverse}} {{judgment}} {{given in the}} Corngreaves case {{the affairs of the}} company were thrown into disarray. Its already unhappy position was further exacerbated by the severe recession of the early 1840s. Dissension developed between a faction of shareholders and the directors, with subscribers resisting the payment of further <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> their <b>shares</b> and urging that the company be dissolved in order to release them from future financial liability. After several angry meetings it was finally resolved in September 1841 that the company should be dissolved after the liquidation of all its liabilities. In the meantime operations continued as normal.|$|R

Violations of factory workers’ fundamental rights in export-oriented industry nevertheless remain intractable, prompting scholars and practitioners in corporate responsibility to promote the leverage of private and public power to create ‘just supply chains’ (Locke 2013; Mayer and Gereffi 2010; Boston Review 2013).

The law has three principal goals for all EL students: a) academic English proficiency, b) grade-level content knowledge, and c) multilingual skills development.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{various parts}} of the world, Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples are {{actively}} working towards Reconciliation. In Australia, the context in which we each undertake our work as educationalists and researchers, the Reconciliation agenda has been pushed into schools and English teachers have been <b>called</b> <b>on</b> to <b>share</b> responsibility for facilitating the move towards a new national order. The recently introduced Australian Curriculum mandates that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures be embedded with “a strong ” but “varying presence ” into each learning area (Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, 2013). In this paper we consider the tensions between policy and practice, when discourses external to education are recontextualised into the discipline of English. We do so by applying an analytical framework based on Bernstein’s (1990, 1996, 2000) sociological theories about the structure of instructional and regulative discourses. Our findings suggest that the space to exert Reconciliatory agendas in the Australian Curriculum English is ambiguous and thus holds the potential to not only marginalise Indigenous knowledges but also to create tensions between policy and practice for non-Indigenous teachers of English...|$|R
