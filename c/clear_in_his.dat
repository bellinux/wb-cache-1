5|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{classical}} figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any {{specific set of}} rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular. In comparison with Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> methodology. Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for {{the primacy of the}} material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.|$|E

25|$|As a young man, Russell had {{a decidedly}} {{religious}} bent, himself, {{as is evident}} in his early Platonism. He longed for eternal truths, as he makes <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> famous essay, , widely regarded as a masterpiece of prose, but a work that Russell came to dislike. While he rejected the supernatural, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life.|$|E

25|$|DeLillo's {{concerns}} about {{the position of the}} novelist and the novel in a media- and terrorist-dominated society were made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> next novel, Mao II (1991). Clearly influenced by the events surrounding the fatwa placed upon the author Salman Rushdie and the intrusion of the press into the life of the reclusive writer J.D. Salinger, Mao II earned DeLillo significant critical praise from, among others, fellow authors John Banville and Thomas Pynchon. He earned a PEN/Faulkner Award and a Pulitzer Prize finalist nomination for Mao II in 1991 and 1992, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{provides}} {{insight into}} what works Coleridge was relying on and would rely on again when he wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. He makes these works <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> footnotes, such as one from Crantz's History of Greenland Vol. I. Other footnotes refer to Lemius's De Lapponibus and the Book of Revelation. Other sources are the works of Godwin, Hartley, and Priestley along with Erasmus Darwin's Botanic Garden. More general influences on individual lines include Richard Glover's Leonidas (1737), James Thomasons's Winter, and Bryan Edwards History, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies (1793–1794).|$|E
25|$|In 1814 Coles wrote {{a letter}} to his Albemarle County {{neighbor}} Thomas Jefferson, asking the former President to again embark on a campaign of emancipation and publicly work for an end to slavery in Virginia. Jefferson’s response has become a signal document in the study of Jefferson’s troubling and complex relationship with the institution of slavery. At age 71 and generally retired from politics and because Virginia law did not allow for emancipation of slaves, Jefferson declined Cole’s request, advising his young friend and associate to stay in Virginia to help in the long-term demise of slavery. Coles’ disappointment is <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> return letter of September 26, 1814.|$|E

25|$|Richard Johnson (1753–1827) was a Church of England clergyman who {{performed}} the first Christian church service in Australia. He joined the Fleet {{as a result}} of his interest in mission and prison reform. He travelled on Golden Grove. He wrote a series of letters to friends and family from the colony. In his letter had 10 February 1788, he gives an account of the voyage and arrival in Australia. His faith is <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letters and does not waver. He describes a storm which struck the Fleet on 1 January 1788, which lasted 24 hours. Johnson remained in the colony for 12 years, returning to England in 1800 for health reasons.|$|E
25|$|He {{then joined}} Rangers for £65,000, then a record fee for a {{transfer}} between two Scottish clubs. He was blamed for {{a goal that}} they conceded in the 1969 Scottish Cup Final, in a match {{in which he was}} designated to mark Celtic captain, Billy McNeill, and was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side instead of for the first team. According to his brother, Ferguson was so upset by the experience that he threw his losers' medal away. There have been claims that he suffered discrimination at Rangers after his marriage to a Catholic, Cathy Holding, but Ferguson himself makes it <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography that Rangers knew of his wife's religion when he joined the club and that he left the club very reluctantly, due to the fall-out from his alleged cup final mistake.|$|E
500|$|The {{rivalry between}} Fillmore and Seward was {{affected}} by the growing anti-slavery movement. Although Fillmore disliked slavery, he saw no reason {{it should be a}} political issue. [...] Seward, on the other hand, was hostile to slavery and made that <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> actions as governor, refusing to return slaves claimed by Southerners. When in 1839, the Buffalo bar proposed Fillmore for the position of vice chancellor of the eighth judicial district. [...] Seward refused, and nominated Frederick Whittlesey; in making the nomination, Seward indicated that if the state senate rejected Whittlesey, he still would not appoint Fillmore.|$|E

500|$|Chinese {{records of}} eclipses begin at around 720 BC. The 4th century BC {{astronomer}} Shi Shen described {{the prediction of}} eclipses by using the relative positions of the Moon and Sun. The [...] "radiating influence" [...] theory (i.e., the Moon's light was reflection from the Sun) was existent in Chinese thought from about the sixth century BC (in the Zhi Ran of Zhi Ni Zi), though it was opposed by the 1st century AD philosopher Wang Chong, who made <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> writing that this theory was nothing new. Ancient Greeks, such as Parmenides and Aristotle, also supported {{the theory of the}} Moon shining because of reflected light.|$|E
500|$|Florence Seymour was {{the first}} person called to the witness box. She said that her {{statement}} was false, and that she had only made it because Edgar Power had told her that she would be charged with murder if she did not. This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams. [...] Hastings did not cross-examine her, only asking if what she had said in court was true; she said that it was and then burst into tears.|$|E
500|$|In October 1917, Beebe had his {{opportunity}} {{to serve in}} the war. With the help of a letter of recommendation from Roosevelt, he was given the duty of flying aerial photography planes over German gun emplacements. He also spent time in trenches and accompanied a Canadian Indian platoon on a night raid. Beebe subsequently wrote several articles describing his war experience for Scribner's Magazine and Atlantic Monthly. Beebe generally did not make the exact nature of his military service <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> writings about it, although he expressed his general dismay at the realities of the war. The best-known of these accounts is provided by the opening paragraph of his 1918 book Jungle Peace: ...|$|E

500|$|Eric Lenneberg, Noam Chomsky, and Steven Pinker {{have also}} criticized Whorf {{for failing to}} be {{sufficiently}} <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> formulation of how language influences thought, and for failing to provide real evidence to support his assumptions. Generally Whorf's arguments {{took the form of}} examples that were anecdotal or speculative, and functioned as attempts to show how [...] "exotic" [...] grammatical traits were connected to what were considered equally exotic worlds of thought. Even Whorf's defenders admitted that his writing style was often convoluted and couched in neologisms– attributed to his awareness of language use, and his reluctance to use terminology that might have pre-existing connotations. [...] argues that Whorf was mesmerized by the foreignness of indigenous languages, and exaggerated and idealized them. According to Lakoff, Whorf's tendency to exoticize data must be judged in the historical context: Whorf and the other Boasians wrote at a time in which racism and jingoism were predominant, and when it was unthinkable to many that [...] "savages" [...] had redeeming qualities, or that their languages were comparable in complexity to those of Europe. For this alone Lakoff argues, Whorf can be considered to be [...] "Not just a pioneer in linguistics, but a pioneer as a human being".|$|E
500|$|Allowing him to [...] "tell {{the best}} story {{and tell the}} truth", Brown's notes were self-reflexive, and drew {{attention}} to the artistic choices he made when putting together the book. [...] Brown makes explicit the inaccuracies in the book, as when he realized his drawings of William McDougall did not match up with descriptions of him by biographers as a [...] "portly" [...] and [...] "heavily built man". [...] Brown chose not to redraw McDougall's scenes, deciding he [...] "could live with that level of inaccuracy". [...] He also admits that he deliberately changed some of the historical details, as when he has Prime Minister Macdonald in talks with the Hudson's Bay Company in London—Macdonald was not in London at that time and did not directly participate in the negotiations. [...] In other instances, Brown noted where he paid special care to historical details: the dialogue of Riel's trial comes directly from court transcripts. [...] Brown makes <b>clear</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> notes the amount of research undertaken for the book, emphasizing both its authenticity and his desire to show the different aspects of Riel's ambiguous story. [...] Many of his changes were made for space considerations, as he intended to limit the book to about two hundred pages.|$|E
