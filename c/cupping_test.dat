40|$|Erichsan <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> {{is one of}} the {{formality}} testing of sheet metals in sheet metal forming analogy. It is used for evaluation of formability characteristics of sheet metals. This test is the inward drawing of sheet blank with stretching methodology. In this test a spherical punch is used to evaluate the formability characteristics of sheet metals. This test deforms the blank into the shape of hemispherical dome. The formability characteristics such as Erichsan number and peak load can be determined through the Erichsan <b>cupping</b> <b>test.</b> In general drawing process the sheet is formed to cup shape. The tensile forces produced sheet metal and it is stretched radially, but it circumferentially compressed due to punch force. In Erichsan <b>cupping</b> <b>test,</b> a single specimen with required dimension drawn into cup until the fracture occurred at dome of cup by the force applied through continuous movement of hemispherical punch into specimen of sheet metal. In this test the cup height at fracture and peak load is measured. These are used as a measure of the formability index. Cup height at fracture in ‘mm ’ is measured as Erichsan number. Cup height at fracture is used as the measure of stretchability. The formability can be expressed as erichsan number and peak load. In this test the formability characteristics of sheet metals such as alloys o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With {{the demands}} of {{environmental}} protection and energy conservation, increasing resources and improving environment, TWB (Tailor Weld Blank) as one of green re-manufacturing technologies will be a guiding orientation in industry. In this study, microstructure of welded joint, tensile test, fracture surface, <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> of the TWB were carried out. Results show that the microstructure of weld is acicular ferrite and plate pearlite. The microstructure of HAZ beside SAPH 440 is pearlite and grain ferrite, and the microstructure of HAZ beside DP 600 is numbly pearlite and plate ferrite. The results of tensile test show that {{the shape of the}} materials after drawing is not easy to be rebounded, plastic deformation of the blanks is excellent, and the SEM of fracture morphology shows that the fracture is ductile and cleavage when the weld line parallels tensile axis. When the weld perpendicular to tensile axial, the deformation of the TWB is uneven, the plastic deformation is poor and the fracture is typical ductile rupture. The research results of the <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> suggest that the bulging formability of the TWB is worse than that of base materials, and the bigger proportion of the thin blank in the TWB, the better bulging formability of the TWB...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to the induced {{effect of}} plastic {{deformation}} and markedly influence of contact friction, the surface topography of galvanized steels has changed along {{with time and}} space during the sheet metal forming.

The results indicated that the surface topography was roughened with the increase of deformation and the degrees of roughening in different deformation zones were different. The function curve of micro-peak height in punch fillet zone which had serious deformation was relatively flat. It indicated that the data distributions were scattered, the roughness values were large and the zinc coating was severely exfoliated. However, the function curve in vertex zone was lanky with centralized data, small roughness values and intact zinc coating. Moreover, the surface topography was also affected by the contact friction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{demonstrates}} applying laser {{heat treatment}} for reversion treatments of cold-formed AISI 301 LN. Sheets were cold- rolled to final thicknesses of 1. 5 and 3 mm (65 pct reduction), having martensite fraction of 70 - 95 %. Sheets were heated locally by {{a laser beam}} to various peak temperatures to obtain different degrees of martensite reversion to austenite. Mechanical properties and formability of grain-refined and coarse-grained structures were measured by tensile, bending and Erichsen cup tests. In addition to standard Erichsen cup test, additional interrupted tests were carried out, where cups were first stretched close to the critical strain. Drawn cups were then heated locally by a laser beam to revitalize the structure and thereby enhance the formability in the following <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> until failure. Various structures were produced: completely reverted microstructures (T > 700 °C) with grain sizes 0. 9 - 2 μm in addition to partially reverted structure (T < 700 °C) containing nano- and ultrafine-grained austenite (0. 6 μm) with some martensite. Results showed that local laser heat treatment is suitable for the reversion treatment to refine the austenite grain size. Refinement of the austenitic structures increased strength properties and the formability was better than with coarse grained structures having the same strength. Especially the yield strength was significantly enhanced, being around 900 MPa in the strongest reverted structure compared to the 300 - 400 MPa of the coarse grained austenitic structure. It was demonstrated that the local laser treatment restored formability of the drawn cups, allowing stretching to be continued...|$|E

40|$|Coffee is a {{refreshing}} beverage product and its price {{is determined by}} physical quality and flavor. An excellent coffee flavor is resulted only from quali fied coffee beans, produced by well managed plantation. The objective of this experiment was to study the effect of sunlight intensity entering coffee farm on flavor profiles and caffeine content of Robusta coffee. The experiment was con ducted at the field experimental Kaliwining Estate of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) during 2009 – 2011. Treatments were Robusta coffee clones and sunlight intensity. Experimental design was split plot design with three replications. Robusta clones used were BP 409, BP 534, BP 936 and BP 939, planted in 2002. The sunligt intensity treatments were 100 % (without shade tree), 50 — 60 % (Leucaena leucocephala shade), and 20 — 30 % (Hibiscus macrophyllus and Melia azedarach L. shades). Only red coffee cherries were harvested for flavor and caffeine analysis. Coffee cherries were washed, depulped and sundried until moisture content of less than 12 %. The green coffee bean samples were roasted at medium level (Agtron Scale at 65 #) for <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> which involved five expert panelists by using ICCRI protocol. Caffeine content was determined by spectrophotometric method. The experiment result indicated that high sunlight intensity resulted in strong aroma of Robusta coffee, while good flavor coffee need medium light intensity.

40|$|Earing and {{thinning}} {{are often}} the major manufacturing problems occur during deep drawing processes. Thinning occurs when a section of a part undergoes localised deformation, and earing is the formation of wavy edges at the open end of a drawn part that must be trimmed at final stage leading to higher manufacturing costs. The anisotropic mechanical behavior of the initial sheet metal is the predominant source of thinning and earing problems. This work aims to establish {{a relationship between the}} properties of a sheet blank and thinning and earing issues during deep drawing by studying the evolution of crystallographic texture throughout the sheet forming process using crystal plasticity simulation modelling and experimental measurements. Firstly, to understand the impact of individual texture components on the mechanical properties of the material, Lankford coefficients for FCC crystal structure during uni-axial tensile loading were analysed using Visco-Plastic Self Consistent (VPSC) model. Subsequently, Finite Element (FE) analyses were carried out to study the effect of initial state of the material on earing and thinning issues occurred during deep drawing. It was observed that the existing Cube and Goss texture components evolved during annealing heat treatments were responsible for the generation of troughs along 45 ° to the rolling direction (RD) and peaks along the transverse direction (TD), respectively. Optical 3 D scanning of a manufactured part confirmed that earing is less prominent in the case of as-rolled and shear-formed condition due to weakening of Cube and Goss texture components. Furthermore, a combination of FE simulation and the VPSC model has been used to simulate texture evolution during a standard earing <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> at various points of interest. The results of texture evolution simulations were compared to those measured experimentally by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and a good qualitative agreement is achieved...|$|E

AISI 202 appears to work-harden at a slightly higher rate than AISI 304, even though the austenite in type 202 is more stable than that in 304 with respect to the formation of deformation-induced a¢ martensite. Although both grades are predicted to be susceptible to earing during deep drawing, AISI 202 displays a higher work-hardening exponent, higher average normal anisotropy, and a higher limiting drawing ratio than AISI 304. Similar cup heights were measured during Erichsen <b>cupping</b> <b>tests,</b> confirming that the two grades have very similar deep drawing properties. The results of this investigation therefore suggest that AISI 202 is a suitable alternative for AISI 304 in applications requiring good deep drawing properties...|$|R
