50|$|It {{has been}} shown that survivin can heterodimerize {{individually}} with the two splice variants Survivin-2B and survivin-deltaEx3. Evidence of the heterodimerization of survivin splice variants with survivin was shown with co-immunoprecipitation experiments after <b>cotransfection</b> with the respective survivin variants with survivin. To determine the localization of exogenously expressed survivin-2B and survivin-deltaEx3, fusion constructs of the proteins were made with GFP and HcRed respectively and Daoy cells were transfected with the plasmid constructs. Survivin was also tagged with a fluorescent protein. The fusion of the survivin variants with the fluorescent molecules allows for simple detection of cellular location by fluorescence microscopy. Survivin-2B by itself, localized to both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments whereas survivin-deltaEx3 localized only in the nucleus. The localization of the three variants (survivin, Survivin-2B, and survivin-deltaEx3) differ, however, when cotransfected together rather than individually.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveBecause {{almost all}} {{pulmonary}} diseases are {{not caused by}} one gene, multiple gene transfection is required for current gene therapy. Adenovirus is an important gene therapy vector, but a short duration and the inability of repeated administration remain limitations. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate whether adenoviral vector encoding soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor immunoglobulin and β-galactosidase <b>cotransfection</b> prolongs gene expression and facilitates repeated vector administration to investigate the feasibility of a <b>cotransfection</b> strategy. MethodsF 344 rats received intratracheal administration of 1 × 109 plaque-forming units of adenoviral vector encoding β-galactosidase or both adenoviral vector encoding β-galactosidase and adenoviral vector encoding soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor immunoglobulin. In the expression study β-galactosidase gene expression in the lung was examined by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on days 2, 7, 14, 28, and 56 (n = 4 /day). In the repeated transfection study, soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor immunoglobulin and β-galactosidase were readministered once (7 days after the first adenovirus administration) or twice (on days 7 and 14; n = 4 /day). A 2 -way factorial analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. ResultsSoluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor immunoglobulin and β-galactosidase <b>cotransfection</b> prolonged the duration of β-galactosidase expression. However, antiadenovirus antibody production was significantly increased in the <b>cotransfection</b> group. In addition, there was no increase in β-galactosidase expression after readministration of soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor immunoglobulin and β-galactosidase. ConclusionAdenoviral vector encoding soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor immunoglobulin and β-galactosidase <b>cotransfection</b> prolongs β-galactosidase expression but does not increase β-galactosidase expression after repeated administration. These results suggest that tumor necrosis factor α {{is one of the most}} important factors in regulating the duration of gene expression.

Four mutant constructs with different genotypes displayed < 1 % RC when transfected alone. <b>Cotransfection</b> of as little as 9 % of the WT clone resulted in an 18 - to 33 -fold increase in the RC of the mutant clones. In addition, the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of lopinavir against seven mutant clones decreased by up to 97 % after incremental <b>cotransfection</b> of 9 to 50 % of the WT clone. The enhancement of RC and decrease in IC 50 for mutant variants following <b>cotransfection</b> with the WT variant appear {{to be due to}} complementation rather than genetic recombination.

Virol. 74 (2000) 3418]. To further analyze the effects of repositioned PR on virus particle production and Gag-Pol incorporation, we introduced the chimeric PR construct into a PR-negative Gag-Pol expression plasmid and coexpressed the resultant construct with a Pr 55 gag expression plasmid (pGAG) in 293 T cells. Analysis indicated that the chimeric PR was similar to native PR in that both could prevent virus particle production in <b>cotransfections</b> with an equivalent amount of pGAG plasmid DNA, suggesting an efficient trans processing of Pr 55 gag by the chimeric PR. In <b>cotransfections</b> with the pGAG at a DNA ratio of 1 : 10 to 1 : 20, which resembles the normal intracellular expression ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag, Gag-Pol carrying the PR in the Gag coding region could undergo autoprocessing in cells and was incorporated into virus particles at a level about 20 – 40 % of that of wild-type Gag-Pol. However, the incorporated chimeric Gag-Pol was unable to autocleave and unable to process the Gag particles properly, as mature particle-associated reverse transcriptase (RT) and p 24 gag proteins were barely detected.

We examined the effects of endurance exercise on IL- 6 mRNA levels and promoter activity in skeletal muscle in vivo, {{and the role of the}} calcium-activated calcineurin signaling pathway on muscle IL- 6 expression in vivo and in vitro. IL- 6 mRNA levels in the mouse tibialis anterior (TA) were increased 2 – 10 -fold by a single bout of treadmill exercise or by 3 days of voluntary wheel running. Moreover, an IL- 6 promoter-driven luciferase transgene was activated in TA by both treadmill and wheel-running exercise and by injection with a calcineurin plasmid. Exercise also increased muscle mRNA expression of the calcineurin regulatory gene MCIP 1, as did treatment of C 2 C 12 myotubes with the calcium ionophore A 23187. <b>Cotransfection</b> of C 2 C 12 myotubes with a constitutively active calcineurin construct significantly increased while <b>cotransfection</b> with the calcineurin inhibitor CAIN inhibited activity of a mouse IL- 6 promoter-reporter construct. <b>Cotransfection</b> with a myocyte enhancer-factor- 2 (MEF- 2) expression construct increased basal IL- 6 promoter activity and augmented the effects of calcineurin <b>cotransfection,</b> while <b>cotransfection</b> with the MEF- 2 antagonist MITR repressed calcineurin-activated IL- 6 promoter activity in vitro. Surprisingly, <b>cotransfection</b> with a dominant-negative form of another calcineurin-activated transcription factor, nuclear factor activator of T cells (NFAT), greatly potentiated both basal and calcineurin-stimulated IL- 6 promoter activity in C 2 C 12 myotubes.

A direct role for myc in activating the eIF 4 E promoter was demonstrated by <b>cotransfections</b> with two dominant negative mutants of c-myc (MycdeltaTAD and MycdeltaBR) which equally suppressed promoter function.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified an interaction between GATA- 6 and putative binding sites in the AQP 5 promoter. However, mutation of these sites did not reduce GATA- 6 -mediated activation, implicating mechanisms in addition to direct binding of GATA- 6 to DNA.

This was in distinct contrast to the situation with the alkaline exonuclease promoter (a model early promoter) and defined the regions of this promoter which can be used to study the interaction between viral promoters and putative regulatory proteins induced by viral infection...|$|R
40|$|Islet {{transplantation}} therapy {{would be}} applicable to {{a wider range of}} diabetic patients if donor islet acceptance and protection were possible without systemic immunosuppression of the recipient. To this aim, gene transfer to isolated donor islets ex vivo is one method that has shown promise. This study examines the combined effect of selected immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory genes known to extend the functional viability of pancreatic islet grafts in an autoimmune system. These genes, indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and interleukin (IL) - 1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP), were transferred to isolated NOD donor islets ex vivo then transplanted to NODscid recipients and evaluated in vivo after diabetogenic T-cell challenge. The length of time the recipient remained euglycemic was used to measure the ability of the transgenes to protect the graft from autoimmune destruction. Although the results of these <b>cotransfections</b> gave little evidence of a synergistic relationship, they were useful to show that gene combinations ca...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} <b>cotransfection</b> replication assay identified eight human herpesvirus 8 (HHV 8) -encoded proteins {{required for}} origin-dependent lytic DNA replication. Previously, we demonstrated that under conditions where K-Rta is overexpressed, a K-bZIP knockout bacmid displayed an aberrant subcellular localization pattern for the latency-associated nuclear protein (LANA). Additionally, these same studies demonstrated that K-bZIP interacts with LANA {{in the absence}} of K-Rta and that K-bZIP does not directly participate in, but may facilitate, the initiation of lytic DNA synthesis. We developed a modification of the transient <b>cotransfection</b> replication assay wherein both lytic (oriLyt) and latent (terminal repeat) DNA replication are evaluated simultaneously. We now show that LANA represses origin-dependent lytic DNA replication in a dose dependent manner when added to the <b>cotransfection</b> replication assay. This repression was overcome by increasing amounts of a K-bZIP expression plasmid in the <b>cotransfection</b> mixture or by dominant-negative inhibition of the interaction of LANA with K-bZIP by the overexpression of the K-bZIP-LANA binding domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that LANA interacts with oriLyt {{in the absence of}} K-bZIP expression, suggesting that suppression of lytic replication by LANA is mediated by direct binding. The interaction of K-bZIP with oriLyt was dependent upon the expression of LANA; however, LANA interacted with oriLyt independently of K-bZIP expression. These data suggest that the interaction of LANA with K-bZIP modulates lytic and latent replication and that K-bZIP facilitates lytic DNA replication and modulates the switch from the latent phase of the virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{serotonin}} transporter (SERT) mediates the re-uptake of released serotonin into presynaptic nerve terminals. Its {{activity is}} regulated by different mechanisms including protein kinase C (PKC) triggered internalization. Here, we used yeast 2 -hybrid screening and <b>cotransfection</b> into 293 cells {{to identify a}} homologue of the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), MacMARCKS, as a C-terminally interacting protein of SERT. Upon <b>cotransfection</b> with SERT, MacMARCKS caused {{a reduction in the}} maximal rate of [H- 3]serotonin uptake and reduced its down-regulation elicited by activation of PKC. Our data are consistent with MARCKS proteins regulating the plasma membrane dynamics of neurotransmitter transporters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluated}} {{the hypothesis that}} the telomerase expression is associated with c-Myc and peroxiredoxin I (Prx I) in patients with prostate cancer. The study determined the link between Prx I, c-Myc and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in prostate cancer cells. Materials and Methods: The cDNA of the Prx I gene was obtained by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. <b>Cotransfections</b> were performed by using a hTERT luciferase reporter plas-mid and each expression vector as indicated (c-Myc or Prx I). Empty vectors were used as controls for determining the basal promoter activity. RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the effect of the DEM-induced Prx I mRNA expression. Luciferase assay was performed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of transfected Prx I and the DEM induced Prx I on the transcriptional activity of hTERT in the human prostatic cancer cell lines PC- 3 and DU- 145. Results: In this study, we found that Prx I could inhibit hTERT expressio...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the role of liver-specific trans-acting factor(s) in the regulation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression. A recorder plasmid (pEcoAluCAT; HBV nucleotides 1 through 1878) was constructed containing the HBV enhancer and the promoter region of the pregenomic RNA, which was ligated to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Upon transfecting this plasmid into various cell lines, the CAT gene was expressed only in cells of liver origin. Moreover, competition <b>cotransfections</b> with pEcoAluCAT and plasmids containing HBV enhancer sequences in human hepatoblastoma-derived HepG 2 cells indicated the presence of titratable trans-acting factor(s) in these cells. Gel mobility shift assays using HBV enhancer and core promoter domains confirmed the existence of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins in liver cell nuclear extract which bound to these regions. These binding sites encompass 17 - and 12 -nucleotide palindromes in the HBV enhancer and core promoter domains, respectively, when mapped by the methylation interference assay...|$|R
40|$|Replacement vectors with genomic DNA {{originating}} from different mouse strains {{were used to}} introduce site-specific mutations into the creatine kinase M (CKM) gene of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we demonstrate that in mouse strain 129 -derived ES cells, the gene is at least 25 -fold more efficiently targeted with an isogenic, 129 -derived vector (129 -pRV 8. 3) than with a nonisogenic, BALB/c-specific vector (BALB/c-pRV 8. 3). The two targeting constructs were identical except for allelic differences which were typed by partial sequencing. These included base pair mismatches (2 %) and a polymorphic [GTC]-repeat length variation. Both in separate transfections {{as well as in}} <b>cotransfections</b> with mixed vectors, homologous disruption of the CKM gene resulted uniquely from the 129 -isogenic DNA. Our data confirm earlier observations on requirements for homologous recombination in pro- and eukaryotic systems and indicate that targeting of the CKM locus is highly sensitive to small sequence differences between cognate segments in the endogenous and incoming DNA...|$|R
