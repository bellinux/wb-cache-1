Gas to liquids (GTL) technology, {{although}} an attractive method for meeting liquid fuel requirements into the future, has an inherent concern regarding {{the environmental impact}} of dealing with the large amount of carbon dioxide that is generated. In this investigation, the potential to reduce this <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> by utilising process heat from high temperature helium at 950 oC downstream of a High Temperature Gas (cooled) Reactor (HTGR) is examined. The study compares a base case steam methane reformer (SMR) heated by the combustion of natural gas to a nuclear heated steam methane reformer heated by hot helium from one HTGR. It has been shown {{that it is possible to}} reduce the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> almost entirely for the synthesis block of a GTL facility. Process heat integration from one HTGR has the potential to reduce the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> of an SMR by approximately 42 tons per hour. The full potential of one HTGR in terms of carbon dioxide reduction for a GTL facility was also investigated. This was achieved by estimating the cogeneration potential impact on carbon dioxide emissions where the residual heat in the helium stream downstream of the reformer was used for power generation. The overall amount of carbon dioxide reduction from both the reformer and power generation facility was then quantified and an economic study was completed. The study shows that with one HTGR it would be possible to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of a GTL facility by almost 200 t/h if nuclear process heat was used in the reformer and nuclear power generation was used instead of conventional coal based power generation. Results from the economic study show that industry would have to incur an operating cost increase of approximately R 200, at current natural gas prices, to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by one ton if nuclear energy was used as a process heat source and for power generation.

40|$|Concrete {{with a low}} <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> (LCDF) {{contains}} less cementitious materials (CM) {{than ordinary}} concrete and hence less cementitious paste. Besides the reduced <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint,</b> LCDF concrete offers other advantages such as reduced cost as well as improved dimensional stability due to reduced hydration heat, creep and shrinkage. Nevertheless, decreasing the quantity of CM has {{a negative impact on}} concrete workability. To restore workability, multi-sized fillers are advocated to replace aggregates and CM. Generally, fillers can improve the packing density of concrete due to the filling effect and thus more excess water or paste is available to facilitate spread and flow rate. Two types of fillers were examined in this study – limestone with particles smaller than 75 μm and foundry sand with particles of 75 – 400 μm. The particles of these two fillers are respectively similar and larger in size when compared with cement. Concrete mixes with no fillers and with mono- or multi-sized fillers were prepared and tested for flowability and strength. The results indicate that more superplasticiser is needed to achieve the same flowability when fillers are added. It was also found that, at the same water/CM ratio, fillers can improve concrete strength, and the use of multi-sized fillers can simultaneously improve the flowability and segregation resistance of concrete...|$|E

However, the stability of nitrification process in MBR was significantly affected when the total nitrogen load in the influent increased by 30 % while maintaining the constant inlet wastewater flow rate.

Large IT companies have recently increased their efforts in reducing the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> originated from their data center electricity consumption. On one hand, better infrastructure and modern hardware allow for a more efficient usage of electric resources. On the other hand, data-centers can be powered by renewable sources (green energy) that are both environmental friendly and economically convenient.

We propose a mathematical model to minimize the operational costs of multi-center Web search engines by exploiting renewable energies whenever available at different locations. Using this model, we design an algorithm which decides what fraction of the incoming query load arriving into one processing facility must be forwarded to be processed at different sites to use green energy sources. We experiment using real traffic from a large search engine and we compare our model against state of the art baselines for query forwarding. Our experimental results show that the proposed solution maintains an high query throughput, while reducing by up to ~ 25 % the energy operational costs of multi-center search engines.

40|$|The global cement {{industry}} {{is responsible for}} 7 % of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and, as such, has a vital {{role to play in}} the transition to a low carbon dioxide economy. In recent years, this has been achieved by technological advances and increased use of supplementary cementitious materials, but the authors have recently shown that there are other means of achieving comparable carbon dioxide savings, for example, by reducing workability. However, price remains a considerable barrier to the widespread implementation of low carbon dioxide concrete. Using the same model for concrete mix design as was used to determine embodied carbon dioxide (ECD), variations in the cost of the components of concrete have now been considered. Considering 24 different mix designs, each spanning a range of characteristic strengths from 20 to 100 [*]MPa, measures to reduce the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> were also found to reduce the material cost of the concrete. As such, it may be considered that the construction industry is already encouraged to reduce its ‘carbon footprint’. However, the concept of the carbon footprint was then considered in a more nuanced fashion, considering the ECD per unit strength. On such a basis, the cheapest mixes did not have the lowest ECD. Therefore, the impact of levying a charge on the carbon footprint was considered. To ensure low carbon dioxide concrete is also the cheapest, carbon dioxide emissions would have to be priced approximately one to two orders of magnitude higher than current market value. This would become the dominant factor in construction, with serious consequences for the industry. Furthermore, such charges may pose ethical problems, being viewed as a ‘licence to pollute’ and therefore undermining society's efforts to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the construction industry...|$|E
40|$|High Volume Pozzolan Concrete (HVPC) can be {{manufactured}} with low <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> and energy consumption {{with the help}} of a new technology based on Energetically Modified Cement (EMC). The technology consists of mechanical processing a blend of ordinary portland cement (PC) and a pozzolan (Class F fly ash) through multiple high intensity grinding mills. The process imparts an increased surface activation of the PC and the pozzolan particles. Fly ash may be processed with all cements forming ready-to-use cement. Alternatively, fly ash can be processed with a small amount of cement (circa 5 % by weight) and used as a pozzolan added to the concrete mixer. The latter product is called CemPozz and has been produced from 2004 by Texas EMC Products, Ltd, at the Limestone plant in Jewett, Texas. It can replace up to 60 % of the PC in concrete. The performance of CemPozz (mechanically processed pozzolan) in concrete is equivalent to Grade 100 blast furnace slag in accordance with ASTM C 989 "Standard Specification for Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag for Use in Concrete and Mortars. "Th e strength of HVPC with 50 % CemPozz is comparable to concrete made of ordinary portland cement, the setting time is similar, with improvements to alkali-silica reactivity mitigation and drying shrinkage. Concretes produced with CemPozz also have much higher sulfate resistance, very low permeability to chloride ions and are characterized by a signifi cantly reduced cracking. Th ere are three environmental benefi ts with the EMC-based HVPC: (i) You can activate a fl y ash that otherwise would not be suitable for high replacement of PC in concrete, (ii) You can reduce the CO 2 footprint by using a much less amount of clinker as concrete binder, and (iii) You can reduce the energy consumption associated with the binder. Calculations show that as much as 45 % can be saved in energy with 45 % less CO 2 emissions when 50 % fl y ash of cement mass is used with the EMC technology. During the period 2004 - 2007, over two million cubic yards (1. 5 million cubic meters) of High Volume Pozzolan Concrete (HVPC) made with CemPozz have been manufactured in Texas and eff ectively used for different applications in Texas (highway paving, housing concrete, shotcrete and blocks).

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of producing agricultural commodities is an increasingly important topic {{at a time when}} climate change, an increasing population and competing demands for food, fibre and fuel are placing heavy demands upon the environment. There are already various methods available for quantifying {{environmental impact}}; however, none of them are flexible enough to account for multiple indicators while producing a simple, easy to comprehend result. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to quantify every aspect of a production process and in agriculture has proved valuable in quantifying the inputs and outputs of resources and pollutants that are associated with the production of food commodities.

40|$|Interest in {{alternative}} energy and fuels has grown considerably {{in recent years}} due to increasing concern about the adverse effects of global warming, the limited sources of non-renewable feedstocks, the insecurity of their supply and associated fluctuations in their prices. However, although there is an urgent, and widely recognized, need to address these issues, selecting suitable candidate feedstocks and fuels is far from straightforward, since numerous factors must be considered when selecting promising candidates for further evaluation and, ultimately, commercial use. This thesis addresses the potential use of one alternative fuel for Diesel engines that is renewable (when produced from biomass) : dimethyl ether, DME, which is a promising candidate mainly because of its excellent life cycle efficiency and low <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> (due to its renewability). A combustion system designed to use Diesel fuel is not suitable for combusting DME efficiently, especially not at high levels of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), {{which is used to}} control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX). Hence, the aims of the work this thesis is based upon were to: (i) elucidate the requirements of a combustion system using DME that enables faster combustion, providing higher efficiency while yielding lower emissions, and (ii) implement appropriate modifications to the test engine. This was done by adapting the engine’s combustion system to the intrinsic characteristics of the fuel. Piston and nozzle geometries were selected as the most important and relevant hardware parameters for achieving this aim. These were re-designed and the effects of the re-configurations were evaluated in combustion computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses, heavy duty single-cylinder engine experiments and spray chamber studies. Combusting DME in a Diesel engine has faced challenges of poor efficiency, hardware considerations by peak cylinder pressures and exhaust gas temperatures, and high emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) as large amounts of EGR have been used to suppress NOX formation. However, these challenges can be solved by appropriate adjustments of the combustion system, which can be summarized as follows. First, the piston bowl geometry should enable greater tangential and radial spreading of the flames, thereby exposing a larger flame area to the surrounding air (and combustion products). Second, the included angle should allow for sufficiently large distances between the spray axis and piston bowl, and optimal spreading of the sprays/flames when interacting with the bowl. Third, the flow should be lower than flows historically used, to enhance mixing and thereby limit the extent of very rich zones impinging on the piston bowl. Fourth, the number of orifices should be correlated to piston bowl diameter to balance the advantages of increasing the total spray area and the disadvantage of reducing their spatial distribution in the bowl. Fifth, the injection pressure should be increased to promote mixing and thereby reduce CO emissions. In conclusion, {{it has been shown that}} a combustion system for DME can be considerably improved by using a piston design that promotes flame spread; a nozzle configuration that improves mixing late during the diffusion combustion; and raising the injection pressure. These modifications result in significantly reduced exhaust emissions and increased engine efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{modern world}} {{we are living}} in today, consumes fasts amounts of fossil fuels in many sectors. One of these sectors is {{transport}} which is almost completely dependent on oil derivatives. This heavy dependency on oil and other types of fossil fuel makes it vulnerable for depletion. That the world is running out of fossil fuels is certain, but when most of the oil fields will be depleted is not known precisely. Waiting for the moment of depletion without taking any preventive steps can have devastating effects on transport throughout the world. With the collapse of transport whole economies can crumble and grind to a complete hold. Other side effects of fossil fuel use are the emissions of greenhouse gasses. When the fuel is used in transport it is most likely burned in an internal combustion engine. This produces greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide, hydro carbonates and nitrogen oxides. To combat the mentioned problems renewable forms of transport must be researched and developed. This project will focus on two candidates that are seen as capable replacements for fossil cars in the future, namely the hydrogen and electric car. Research on new transport systems requires high priority, given the importance of transport within society. The current field of research is mainly focused on the car it self and not on the whole car transport system. This research will investigate options for a Sustainable transport system in the Netherlands. Included within the analysis are the car and the impact on the national electricity production system. Studying the car as well as the system will improve the quality of information on which important choices can and have {{to be made in the}} near future. During this research focus will be put on the four main aspects of the transport system, technique, environment, economics and social factors. The technical focus will be on the car itself, by determining efficiency and safety, but also by looking at a full lifetime of the car including construction, use and decommissioning, called lifecycle analysis. This is brought to a national scale by introducing the cars in larger numbers into the Dutch passenger transport sector, and looking to there CO 2 emissions by using modelling. The best technical and environmental solution must still undergo economical and social scrutiny. For the costs of the renewable car and its user friendliness must not be more expensive or less friendly than the gasoline car. This research concluded with a clear environmental and technical winner. The electric car has proven to be the most efficient and less greenhouse emitting of the cars investigated during this project. At present the electric car emits about half the carbon dioxide emissions compared to a normal gasoline car during its lifetime and is around three to four times more efficient. The fuel source electricity and the production of this fuel source can have a very large impact on the emission footprint of the electric car. Higher efficiency in the production chain and renewable energy will have an immediate effect on the electric car emissions. The car itself is even capable of storing normally wasted brake energy back in to the batteries, and when the car is in idle (like for instance in traffic jams) the energy use is zero, unlike the gasoline engine. Efficiency of the electric car will most likely not improve much further than the current rate, due to the fact that the electric engine is already highly developed. Improvements can still be gained in the power management system the battery and the weight of the car. If large amounts of electric cars are used within the Netherlands more electricity will need to be produced, but if the cars are charged at night during the lower electricity demand window or by using smart grid technology, the impact on the electric grid will be insignificant. Extensive safety tests have concluded that the electric car is perfectly safe in crash situations and in case of fire, but still danger of being electrocuted will remain during crash situations, how statistically unlikely it may seem. The electric car has only one weak point, the battery. This single unit lowers the driving range, makes it more expensive, makes the car heavy, limits the lifetime and makes the car difficult to refuel. At present the fastest recharge time is around fifteen minutes with specialised systems, when using a normal socked the charge time will be extended to around 4 to 12 hours depending on the use of the car during the day. The range is dependent on the size of the battery varying between fifty to three hundred kilometres. The destination at present must be situated within this range, or there will be a twelve hour waiting period. Finally the best batteries currently available with a high enough energy density can only be recharged around a thousand or two thousand times, limiting the lifetime of the battery, when used daily to around five years. If the rest of the car will last as long as a normal gasoline car, around 3 batteries will be needed during the lifetime of the electric car. To make the electric car compete on the same level as the gasoline car, research is needed that will improve the battery. The hydrogen fuel cell car is specifically meant to overcome the range and refuelling problem that occur when batteries are used. By using hydrogen as energy carrier the hydrogen car can be refuelled fast and easily (comparable with tanking LPG). Due to its electric drive train similar to that in the electric car the hydrogen car is twice as efficient as the gasoline car. It is capable of storing back brake energy in a small battery used as energy buffer. While standing still the energy use will also be zero. The <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>footprint</b> of the fuel cell car will be lower than the gasoline car if natural gas reforming is used for the production of hydrogen. The range of the car lays around one to three-hundred kilometres. The safety of the fuel cell car is well tested by the producers of the Honda Clarity, the biggest danger is the storage system of the hydrogen. It has proven to be save in crash and fire situations, also hydrogen will disperse more easily compared with for instance CNG due to its low mass, but danger of leakage and explosion will always remain as long as hydrogen is stored in pressure vessels. Unfortunately the additional energy conversions and the use of hydrogen bring with it a lot of disadvantages. Hydrogen as a fuel can not be found in nature in its pure form. At present most hydrogen is produced with natural gas steam reforming, and with electrolysis of water. In every transformation energy is lost, especially when electrolysis of water is used. At present the footprint of a fuel cell car powered with hydrogen produced by electrolysis is almost five times higher than a normal gasoline car during its lifetime. To bring the footprint below the gasoline car, large shares of durable electricity are needed or hydrogen from gas reforming must be used. The lower efficiency of the fuel cell car compared to the electrical car will also increase the grid strain. Larger amounts of electricity are needed for the production of hydrogen when the car is applied in larger numbers. To improve the energy density of hydrogen to a usable level it is stored at high pressures up to 300 bar. To achieve this, high power compressors are needed and to store the hydrogen heavy bottles are used with extensive safety features. The most important part in the hydrogen car is the fuel cell that transforms hydrogen in to an electrical flow and water. This system is still being improved to increase reliability, lifetime, lower the weight and most importantly the costs. The hydrogen car with all its complicated systems is extremely expensive and at present only a toy for the wealthy. Exponential improvement in the car and the fuel production system will be needed to come close to the electric car concerning technical but mainly environmental benefits. For both the electric and fuel cell car the service sector will need to adapt to the new technology used. At present not many mechanics are qualified and capable of solving car problems on an electric or hydrogen fuel cell car. Also the fuel is not readily available at any gas station, or even at home. Charging an electric car on the parking lot when living on the eights floor of an apartment building is quite a challenge without the correct infra structure. Making the car look and behave like the a normal gasoline car is already achieved. Giving these cars the same benefits in user-friendliness as the gasoline car will be more of a challenges, especially in new price of the car, refuelling speed, fuel availability, service availability and range. The electric and hydrogen car must first fulfil the user-friendliness and service availability taken for granted with the gasoline car, before it can win the harts of the most car users. A solution can be found in a hybrid electric and hydrogen car. For most of the car travel in the Netherlands is below 50 km per day, a range easily achieved on batteries, but if longer range is required the hydrogen fuel cell system can kick in. The transport sector is not easily diverted from the fossil fuel path. Fossil fuels still have too much positive benefits to outweigh their negative effects. Luckily people are noticing the negative effects and change is in the air. The only hope is that the right choices are being made. This research clearly shows that firstly electric and eventually, (if needed) hydrogen fuel cells are the right choice for future transport. A lot of research is needed to give the electric car the same versatility as the fossil fuelled cars, and this can only be achieved if maximum effort is put into sustainable transport by the people and the government. For one thing is sure when using fossil fuels, at the end of the line they are a finite fuel source and if we keep using it, they will eventually run out. If we wait till then for solutions it might be too late. ...|$|E
