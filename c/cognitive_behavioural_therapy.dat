5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapy</b> are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapy</b> {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility and present preliminary {{results of a}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> group <b>therapy</b> for patients with mild cognitive impairment and their significant others. Design: One group pretest-posttest design. Subjects: Twenty-two patients with mild cognitive impairment and their significant others, running in four group programmes. Intervention: The main goal of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> group <b>therapy</b> was to strengthen adaptive behaviour in 10 weekly 2 -hour sessions. Main measures: Distress and mood: The RAND- 36, Geriatric Depression Scale - short form; Acceptance and helplessness: Subscales Acceptance and Helplessness from the Illness Cognition Questionnaire; Marital satisfaction: Maudsley Marital Questionnaire; Alertness to memory failure and behaviour changes: Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly and the Revised Memory and Behaviour Problems Checklist Burden. The burden of caregiving reported by the significant others: Sense of competence Questionnaire and Behaviour Problems Checklist Burden, Hindrance subscale. Results: No changes were found on distress and mood measures in both patients and their significant others. Patients showed a significant increased level of acceptance (P < 0. 05) and a trend for an increased marital satisfaction (P < 0. 1). The significant others reported an increased awareness of memory and behavioural problems (P < 0. 05). Attendance was high, indicating a high motivation for this intervention.

40|$|Background: The {{development}} of initiatives to improve access to psychological therapies {{has been driven}} by the realization that untreated anxiety and depression are both very common and costly to individuals as well as society. Effective and efficient treatments, mostly in the form of <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies</b> (CBT), can be used in ways which enhance their acceptability and accessibility. To date, numbers of group therapies have been developed to improve cost efficiency, but in spite of growing interest in transdiagnostic approaches, group therapies have so far mostly been diagnosis specific. Aims: This study is aimed at evaluating a brief transdiagnostic <b>cognitive</b> <b>behavioural</b> group <b>therapy</b> (TCBGT) designed to treat both anxiety and depression among patients in primary care. Method: The participants were 287 adult patients in primary care with diagnoses of depression and/or anxiety disorders. They underwent a 5 -week TCBGT. A mixed design ANOVA was used to evaluate differential effects of treatment according to diagnostic groups (anxiety versus depression) and number of diagnoses (co-morbidity). Results: Pre–post differences were significant and the treatment was equally effective for both anxiety disorders and depression. Number of diagnoses did not affect the outcome. Conclusions: The study indicates feasibility of the brief transdiagnostic group therapy {{for a wide range of}} mood and anxiety disorders in primary care. The results indicate that low intensity, brief transdiagnostic group therapies may be a feasible way to improve access to psychological therapies for a large number of patients...|$|R
