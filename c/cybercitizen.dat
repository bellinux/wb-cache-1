50|$|Cyberspace {{consists}} of plane-like bodies called Cybersites {{which are based}} on themes such as Ancient Egypt, the American Old West, Greek mythology, and amusement park. The Cybersquad travels to many of these locations in order to protect Cyberspace from Hacker. Each inhabited Cybersite has their own type of <b>Cybercitizen.</b> They are meant to represent the diversity of websites on the Internet, and reflect the many ecosystems and neighborhoods of today's world. For example, Gollywood is a Cyberspace representation of Hollywood, and Pefectamundo represent the 100% sustainable ecosystem of tomorrow.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>cybercitizens</b> created Facebook {{pages and}} BBS website {{to show their}} {{objections}} to beauty beggars. In order to gather related information and propaganda, <b>cybercitizens</b> also established their fan club on YouTube platform and set up their database in Google Document and Instagram. In 2014, after some <b>cybercitizens</b> posted on the Golden Forum claiming that they obtained evidences of beauty beggars' behind-the-scenes deals, some beauty bloggers were caught up in some human flesh search (Chinese: 人肉搜索; 起底) cases.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: These days, {{ordinary}} {{people have become}} <b>cybercitizens,</b> or inhabitants of cyberspace, and they are more connected than ever. Unfortunately with this connectedness, comes serious cybersecurity risks. It is therefore important that as <b>cybercitizens,</b> people follow proper Cybercitizenship when online, and develop good cybersecurity habits. Especially digital natives such as university students, {{who grew up with}} technology, and are comfortable using it in all aspects of their life. They are deemed heavy users, but seem to ignore basic information security, which result in 40 % of them experiencing cybercrime (Norton Cyber Security Insights Report, 2016). For this reason, the Centre for Academic Technologies at the University of Johannesburg launched (January 2017) their online Cybercitizenship module (UJCYBER). It is an awareness programme with the objective to support students in their journey of understanding, appreciating and reacting to the dangers that loom in cyberspace, in order to proactively create a positive cyber footprint. This paper presents the UJCYBER awareness module...|$|R
5000|$|Beauty beggars {{originated}} from some local beauty bloggers in Hong Kong, who are keen on sharing their experiences of using some beauty products with other <b>cybercitizens.</b> With their followers accumulating, some beauty bloggers {{that are more}} popular may be invited by some public relations agencies or cosmetics companies to promote beauty products. Thus, even if the product is not effective, these beauty bloggers may still give positive reviews on it. Some beauty bloggers were found to disguise the products that they get from public relations agencies as self-purchased products so as to raise {{the credibility of the}} promoting products. Moreover, some famous bloggers might sell the samples that they obtained from public relations agencies to viewers so as to earn extra profits. Customers who bought those products then discovered that they did not work or might cause allergic problems. Also, some beauty bloggers price their blog, Facebook page, or YouTube video to ask for extra sponsorship from involved companies. Therefore, some <b>cybercitizens</b> criticize them as “beauty beggars”.2 ...|$|R

5000|$|The term netizen is a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} Internet and citizen as in [...] "citizen of the net". It describes a person actively involved in online communities or the Internet in general. The term commonly also implies an interest and active engagement in improving the Internet, making it an intellectual and a social resource, or its surrounding political structures, especially in regard to open access, net neutrality and free speech. Netizens are also {{commonly referred to as}} <b>cybercitizens,</b> which has similar connotations.The term was widely adopted in the mid-1990s as a way to describe those who inhabit the new geography of the Internet. Internet pioneer and author Michael F. Hauben is credited with coining and popularizing the term.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of a post-doctoral {{research}} (CAPES, Brazilian Foundation, 2006 - 2007), carried out at the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology (University of Toronto- UofT) – this paper intends to present some of the main info-inclusion contributions that came from transcultural phenomenon of Canadian society into the constitution of the government and private online service networks. These contributions have really helped in attempt to outline the essential characteristics of cyber citizenship in an approach and precise ways, and with it, to draw a <b>cybercitizens</b> profile in the contemporary. In addition, to glimpse the main and probable onus and bonus from the virtual technologies in to exercise the participatory democracy among others political and social conditions – faced as challenges and (re) discoveries of the non-territorial nature of the internet – they will be reunited and organized in the book entitled Cyber citizenship – what is the meaning of the right and duty in the online world?, with preview edition in 2008 (English and Portuguese versions). </p...|$|R
40|$|Botnets – {{networks}} of machines infected with malicious software – are {{widely regarded as}} a critical security threat. Measures that directly address {{the owners of the}} infected machine end users are useful, but have proven insufficient to reduce the overall problem. Recent studies have shifted attention to key intermediaries – most notably, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) – as control points for botnet activity. Surprisingly little empirical information is available to assess the claim that ISPs are an important control point, as well as related claims, for example, that large ISPs are worse <b>cybercitizens</b> than smaller ones. This paper is a first effort to go beyond generalized arguments by dissecting the diversity of ISPs and the number of infected machines in their networks. As most of the current spam is sent through botnets, the origin of spam messages provides us with a proxy for detecting infected machines. Using a global dataset of 138 million unique IP addresses that connected to a spam trap in the period 2005 - 2008, we have analyzed in detail the geographic patterns, time trends, and differences at the level of countries and ISPs. This data underlines the key position of ISPs as intermediaries. For example, in our dataset just 10 ISPs account for around 30 percent of all unique I...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 31 - 35) Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities {{date back}} to 1996 during {{the early days of}} the World Wide Web. A time when e-commerce began to take off, the bubble days of Netscape, Yahoo, and the obnoxious blink tag. The Web is the playground of 800 million <b>cybercitizens,</b> home to 100 million Web sites, and transporter of billions of dollars daily. Economies have become dependent on the World Wide Web as a global phenomenon. Crackers found that when unsuspecting users visited their Web pages they could forcibly load any Web site (bank, auction, store, Web mail, and so on) into an HTML Frame within the same browser window. Then using JavaScript, they could cross the boundary between the two Web sites, and read from one frame into the other. Moreover Crackers also found out that by using IFRAME and redirection using JavaScript they can install keylogger or Trojan software on the victim???s machine in order to steal his/her personal data. Recognizing these challenges, I would like to examine some of the weaknesses and strengths of the Internet Explorer???s ActiveX Control on two different versions of Internet Explorer and why ActiveX Control on IE 8 can be better than ActiveX Control on IE 7...|$|R
