40|$|Every {{manufacturing}} process {{leaves on the}} surface of the piece a typical "technology signature". In particular, the laser welding leaves a feature at the edge of the weld bead called "undercut". In this work an experimental campaign has been conducted on Ti 6 Al 4 V butt joints. In particular a Central Composite Design (CCD) with the central point repeated three times has been investigated. In the CCD there are two factors (power and speed of the fiber laser) and five levels for each factor. This paper deals with the investigation about the correlation between the severity of the undercut and the process parameters of the laser welding. In particular, through the confocal microscopy, the original geometry of the joint was accurately acquired and rebuilt in order to make a FEM model and simulate the mechanical behavior using Ansys 14. 5. Moreover, response surfaces and level curves were carried out to understand and predict the depth and the width of the undercut starting from the power and the speed of the laser. At last a mathematic and geometry regression was performed in order to find a unique <b>conical</b> <b>curve</b> that interpolates all the different undercuts and that varies its parameters according to the process parameters. It is established that the process with higher speed minimizes and optimizes the undercut in the joints. © 2016 Author(s) ...|$|E

One of the results in this paper gives a classication of special developable surfaces under the condition of the existence of such a special curve as a geodesic. As a result, we consider geometric invariants of space curves. By using these invariants, we can estimate the order of contact with those special curves for general space curves. All arguments in this paper are straight forward and classical. However, there have been no papers which have investigated slant helices and <b>conical</b> geodesic <b>curves</b> so far as we know...|$|R

Instead of building sophisticated 3 D models with muscle simulations, rendering effects, etc., a simpler 2 D model was chosen. This simpler model is convenient because it allow us to keep most of the parameters under control.

50|$|The {{ordinary}} treble cornett {{is made by}} splitting {{a length}} of wood and gouging out the two halves to make the gently <b>conical,</b> <b>curved</b> bore. The halves are then glued together, and the outside planed to an octagonal cross section, the whole being bound in thin black leather. Six front finger holes and a thumb hole on the back (like on the recorder) are bored in the instrument, and are slightly undercut. The socket for the mouthpiece at the narrow end is reinforced with a brass collar, often concealed by an ornamental silver or brass mount. The separate cup mouthpiece is usually made of horn, ivory, or bone, with a thin rim and thread-wrapped shank. Because it lacks a little-finger hole at the bottom, its lowest note is the A below middle C, though another tone lower could be produced by slackening the lips to flatten the note.|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of electrostatic plasma waves, and their subsequent conversion into hot plasma waves {{at the lower}} hybrid frequency is calculated for realistic density profiles and finite rf sources in a slab geometry. A finite length slow wave source having a potential distribution phi ~ cosk 0 z is found to generate spatial oscillations having a well-defined wavelength. These oscillations are confined to regions bounded by <b>conical</b> <b>curves</b> originating {{at the ends of}} the source. The axial distance of rf energy propagation to the lower hybrid layer is found to be greater than the radial distance of propagation by a factor of the order (mi/me) 1 / 2. The conversion at the lower hybrid layer of the electrostatic cold plasma waves excited by a finite source into propagating hot plasma waves is calculated.

40|$|Two offset IRAs are numerically modeled and analyzed. The {{reflector}} of the offset IRA is an offset {{portion of}} a paraboloid that is carved out by {{the intersection of the}} paraboloid and a cone whose apex is at {{the focal point of the}} paraboloid. A pair of <b>conical</b> <b>curved</b> plates is placed on the surface of the cone as TEM feed arms. The TEM feed arm of the first IRA is conical throughout its length and terminated at the reflector through two electrically small resistors. The TEM feed arm of the second IRA is partly conical and tapered to one electrically small resistor. The second IRA performs better in terms of the reflected voltage in the transmission line. The second IRA is further analyzed and compared with a center-fed IRA. The radiated waveforms both in the far- and near-zones, radiation patterns, impulse and prepulse amplitude distributions as functions of observation angle, spot sizes, and power budgets for the offset IRA and the center-fed IRA are presented and compared. The results show that the tail waveform of the offset IRA is significantly lower in amplitude and simpler in shape than that of the center-fed IRA. Both IRAs have a shadow behind the reflector...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Al-Khayâm, {{for the first time in}} history, {{formulated}} a complete theory to solve third degree equations using the intersection of geometric curves and moreover solved the fourteen types of equations using this method. His solution for these equations was either using the intersection of two parabolas, a parabola and a circle, a parabola and a hyperbola, a circle and a hyperbola or two hyperbolas. His style was purely synthetic lacking any analysis which may lead to deducing any motives for his choice of the curves. Our article is centered on a pointed detail which is the justification of the choice of these curves, knowing that R. Rashed studied this choice in all of the mentioned fourteen equations. As for Descartes, whose style is as synthetic as Al-Khayâm's, we ask the same question concerning the solution of the third degree equations, searching for any possible resemblance between the two methods of solution, both mathematicians having been motivated similarly in geometric resolutions. We noticed that the choice of the fourteen curves couples was made by Al Khayyâm regarding a uniform calculation technique that he applied systematically to each equation type among the fourteen. It has appeared that the choice of the curves made by Descartes is the result of distinct calculation techniques, even though the projects of the two mathematicians are of the same essence, and their motivations are the same: finding the solution of third degree equations using the intersection of <b>conical</b> <b>curves</b> and the equations of curves...|$|R

These are similar to the teeth of some prosauropods and early ornithischians, but differ in important features. For example, the teeth lacked the swellings and ridges seen in the teeth of early ornithischians like Lesothosaurus, and the coarse denticles (smaller points) of leaf-shaped ornithischian and prosauropod teeth in general. Phyllodontosuchus also lacked a predentary as found in all known ornithischians. Instead, it is most similar to sphenosuchians.|$|R
