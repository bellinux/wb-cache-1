40|$|This works {{describes}} {{the development of}} a miniature high accuracy, low power CT-DO sensor system for in-situ oceanographic measurements. The sensors were fabricated on glass wafers, using micro-fabrication techniques. Three chip designs were made. The sensors in designs 1 and 2 include a seven-electrode <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensor</b> set in a flow channel, a four-ring-electrode open <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensor,</b> a Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT) bridge temperature sensor, and a DO sensor based on a platinum electrode inset into five 25 ?m deep wells. A 16 -bit impedance measurement circuit was made to support the CT sensor. This has a typical battery life of one month with 10 s sampling interval. The initial CT accuracies are ± 0. 01 mS/cm and ± 0. 003 oC respectively. The seven-electrode <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensor</b> with channel suffered from a durability problem, which was discovered on a mid-Atlantic deployment. This problem was solved with the four-ringelectrode open conductivity and PRT bridge temperature sensor. Dock deployments and 8 -week test in a calibration lab showed that the monthly drift was 0. 02 mS/cm for the <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensor,</b> and less than 0. 01 oC for the temperature sensor. The DO sensor was calibrated to have an initial accuracy of ± 5 ?m. A simple analytical model is proposed to estimate the effect of fluid flow. Tests show that the measured flow effect leads to an error of 1 % DO, compared with an estimate of 10 %. The complete CT-DO sensor was tested during a 75 day Indian Ocean cruise. A novel method of bio-fouling mitigation was tested utilizing electro-chemical reactions on the electrodes of the conductivity and DO sensors, and first results are promising. The CT system was also modified to measure low-conductivity solutions. This system was deployed in Greenland and results showed that the CT sensor can also work in fresh water and harsh environments. Future plans are to integrate the electronics into an ASIC, and to include a miniature sensor chip (design 3), to make a package the size of a pen for fish tag applications...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Conductivity</b> <b>Sensor</b> {{designed}} {{for use in the}} Node 3 Water Processor Assembly (WPA) was based on the existing Space Shuttle application for the fuel cell water system. However, engineering analysis has determined that this sensor design is potentially sensitive to two-phase fluid flow (gadliquid) in microgravity. The source for this sensitivity is the fact that gas bubbles will become lodged between the sensor probe and the wall of the housing without the aid of buoyancy in l-g. Once gas becomes lodged in the housing, the measured conductivity will be offset based on the volume of occluded gas. A development <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensor</b> was flown on the NASA Microgravity Plan to measure the offset, which was determined to range between 0 and 50 %.

40|$|The {{performance}} of Thin Membrane Surface (TMS) highways is largely {{controlled by the}} strength of the subgrade soil which in turn {{is a function of the}} soil suction (Fredlund and Morgenstern, 1977). Thermal <b>conductivity</b> suction <b>sensors</b> can be used to indirectly measure in situ matric suction. Thirty two (32) thermal <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensors</b> were installed under Thin Membrane Surface (TMS) in two highway locations; namely, Bethune and Torquay, Saskatchewan, in September 2000. The sensors were installed beneath the pavement, shoulder and side-slope to monitor matric suction and temperature changes with time. The monitoring system at Bethune was damaged after two years of operation. The thermal <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensors</b> at Torquay all appear to have been working well and data are still being collected. Other attempts had been made in the past to use thermal <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensors</b> for field suction measurement, but all were terminated within a short period of time due to limitations associated with the equipment. The long-term suction measurement at the Torquay site is unique and provides valuable field data. This research project presents and interprets the long-term matric suction measurements made between the years 2000 to 2005 at the Torquay site and from 2000 to 2002 at the Bethune site. To help in the interpretation of the data, a site investigation was undertaken along with a laboratory testing program that included the measurement of Soil-Water Characteristic Curves (SWCC). As well, a limited laboratory study was undertaken on several new thermal <b>conductivity</b> matric suction <b>sensors.</b> The matric suction readings in the field showed a direct relationship to rainfall and regional evaporation conditions at the test sites. At the Bethune and Torquay test sites, the changes in matric suctions appeared to be mainly due to the movement of moisture through the edge of the road. Relatively constant equilibrium suctions were encountered under the driving-lanes. Conversely, matric suctions under the side-slopes were found to vary considerably with time and depth. Matric suctions under the driving-lanes ranged from 20 to 60 kPa throughout the years. Matric suctions on the side-slopes changed from 100 to 1500 kPa over the years. The greatest variation of soil suctions occurred in the month of April from location to location in the subgrade. The soil suctions became less variable in June while larger variations again occurred from July to October. The matric suction measurements obtained from the thermal <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensors</b> showed a general agreement with the values estimated using the soil-water characteristic curves, SWCC, measured in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Sensors {{deployed}} in the Columbia River estuary gather information on physical dynamics and changes in estuary habitat. Of these <b>sensors,</b> <b>conductivity</b> <b>sensors</b> are particularly susceptible to bio-fouling, which gradually degrades sensor response and corrupts critical data. Several weeks may pass before degradation is visibly detected. As a result, an indeterminate amount of the archival data is corrupted, as the onset time of bio-fouling is unknown.
