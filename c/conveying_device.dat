40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was {{to gain a better}} understanding of the impact of the client-clinician interaction in the hearing aid adoption process. The specific goals of this dissertation were: 1) to identify factors in client-clinician interactions that were perceived by clients and clinicians to influence hearing aid adoption in first time adult hearing aid candidates, 2) to investigate the importance of the identified factors from clients and clinicians perspectives, and 3) to compare the importance of the identified factors between clients and clinicians. These goals were achieved using a mixed-methods approach. Three studies were undertaken. In the first study a concept mapping approach was used to explore the collective views of clients and clinicians in identifying factors in client-clinician interaction that influence hearing aid adoption. Ten audiologists and 13 clients generated 122 statements that formed eight conceptually homogenous clusters of factors. The concepts were: 1) ensuring client comfort, 2) understanding and meeting client needs, 3) client-centered traits and actions, 4) acknowledging client as an individual, 5) imposing undue pressure and discomfort, 6) <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician, 7) supporting choices and shared decision making, and 8) factors in client readiness. In the second study, nine audiologists and 11 clients who participated in the first study rated the importance of the 122 statements. Clients rated the concept <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician more important than audiologists. In the third study, a broad and geographically diverse sample of clients and clinicians including audiologists and hearing instrument practitioners rated the importance of the 122 items identified in the first study. The comparison of the client and clinician groups’ ratings revealed discrepancies between the groups’ ratings. The largest discrepancy was between the importance each participant group assigned to the concepts <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician, which was rated much higher by clients and factors in client readiness, which was rated much higher by clinicians. This work contributes to the literature on client-clinician interaction in the audiological encounter.

40|$|During {{the surface}} {{treatment}} of workpieces {{by means of}} electron beams, several areas must often be treated. The energy applied causes the austenitizing of the edge layer of a workpiece. As a result of cooling, the austenite in converted into martensite and causes hardening, this {{is also known as}} self-quenching. During the hardening of several surfaces, the hardening of the next layer requires a high cycle time before it can cool down to ambient temperature. The time required is to be reduced. As is already known, no cooling medium, e. g. water is to be used; this would lead to corrosion or would disturb the vacuum process. According to the invention, the workpieces are exposed to a stream of cooling gas in a cooling station at atmospheric pressure after a surface is hardened by means of the electron beam; at intervals, an atomozing liquid is injected into the stream of cooling gas. In the intermediate time, the next workpiece is supplied to the electron beam system to harden the next su rface.

It is formed from a loom provided of wheels on which are installed: a soil cutting <b>device,</b> a soil <b>conveyer</b> <b>device</b> and a rotating oven whose axis is tilted of 20 ° {{in comparison to the}} horizontal axis. The working width is 1 m. The working depth is suitable until 30 cm. The speed has been 2 m/s with working capability of 0. 72 ha/h and with speed of 3 m/s the working capability has been 1. 08 ha/h. The ribbon conveyer, completely closed and sealed, it performs the soil transport to the hopper of the rotating oven. The rotating oven is formed from a rotating cylinder with length of 2. 500 mm, with a diameter of 500 mm and with angular speed = 3. 2 1 /s. A burner, situated at the extremity of the cylinder, it produces a flame along the cylinder axis. It produces a temperatures distribution inside the cylinder that has been determined by mean a thermodynamic study of the considered process. The soil carried upward by the ribbon conveyor, in around 3 s, it comes in the hopper of the rotating cylinder. It moves toward the cylinder outlet, because of the inclination and rotating motion of the cylinder, advancing in counter-current to the heat propagation. Besides the soil, because of the rotating motion of the cylinder considered, is dragged upward for then reverting in the low part of the cylinder, with further soil breaking up. This is also made easy because there is a metallic fin on the cylinder inside surface. Under such operative conditions the heat transfer in the soil is facilitated and therefore it increases the effectiveness of the soil disinfectant treatment during the range time when it crosses the whole length of the cylinder. It has been seen that with the values used of speed during the tests, it is avoided the “cooking” of the contained clay in the considered soil. On the soil samples treated in such way, physical, chemical and microbiological analysis have been performed, and satisfactory data results have been obtained {{from the point of view}} of the performed treatment. Besides a moisture loss has been noticed of about 3 - 4 % while macroscopically burnt and pulverized zones and reduction of organic substance are not been underlined.

At the end-point the number of subjects reporting symptoms of stress-related PPD on the PSM test was significantly reduced, whereas in the placebo group the difference was not significant. Conclusion A cycle of NPPO treatment with REAC was shown to reduce subjective perceptions of stress measured by the PSM test and in particular on PPD. Trial Registration This trial has been registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) with the number: ACTRN 12607000463471. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} StartMobile, {{a prototype}} system that enables users of cellular telephones and other mobile devices to access information, create information and execute commands {{on the basis}} of written requests expressed in natural language. Interacting with mobile devices through the use of language offers several potential benefits that include: scalability in handling huge numbers of concepts and operations, substantial device-independence, and opportunities for remote interaction. StartMobile uses the START information access system to perform initial interpretation of requests and to generate responses to general information requests. Requests that require further interpretation and/or fulfillment in the distributed mobile environment are encoded in a new, language-based intermediate representation called Moebius, then <b>conveyed</b> to appropriate <b>devices</b> and systems, where special-purpose software serves to complete the interpretation and fulfillment of those requests. 1...|$|R
40|$|In ambient re-scatter communications, <b>devices</b> <b>convey</b> {{information}} by modulating and re-scattering the radio frequency signals impinging on their antennas. In this correspondence, we consider a system {{consisting of a}} legacy modulated continuous carrier multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) link and a multi-antenna modulated re-scatter (MRS) node, where the MRS node modulates and re-scatters the signal generated by the legacy transmitter. The receiver seeks to decode both the original message and the information added by the MRS. We show that the achievable sum rate of this system exceeds that which the legacy system could achieve alone. We further consider the impact of channel estimation errors under the least squares channel estimation and study the achievable rate of the legacy and MRS systems, where a linear {{minimum mean square error}} receiver with successive interference cancellation is utilized for joint decoding.

40|$|Gesture {{recognition}} has {{the potential}} to be a natural and powerful tool supporting efficient and intuitive interaction between the human and the computer. The primary goal of hand gesture recognition research is to create a system which can identify specific hand gestures and use them to <b>convey</b> information for <b>device</b> control. This paper proposes a visionbased dynamic hand gesture recognition system using PCA, pruning and ANN. The system will find hand location in each frame. The hand segmentation is done using color marker for PCA. Skin color detection method is used for pruning and ANN. After connecting all these hand locations, the template is generated at the end of Segmentation. Template is used to extract the feature for training and testing purpose. The implementation uses the eigenspace which is determined by processing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the image set. The experimental results show ANN method gives more recognition rate than PCA and pruning...|$|R
