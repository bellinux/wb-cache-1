30|$|Today {{two general}} types of rolling stock {{are used for}} Swiss Split: {{standard}} flat wagons with wooden floors and conventional <b>container</b> <b>wagons.</b> Both types include two and four axle versions. The big difference between these vehicle types is that <b>container</b> <b>wagons</b> have no floor. This means loading and unloading equipment (e.g., forklifts) is unable to operate on these <b>container</b> <b>wagons.</b> Thus, additional equipment such as moveable ramps is required to load/unload the containers. Therefore a moveable ramp replaces the missing floor of the <b>container</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractRail {{transports}} {{of single}} wagons or wagon groups are an indispensable {{part of the}} transport chain, such as for the forestry and the chemical industry. However, high production costs and low quality standards {{have led to a}} continuous decline in market shares in recent years. In order to counteract this tendency, ten European companies and research institutions, covering the areas of rail transport and logistics, have combined their forces in the scope of the research and development project ViWaS (Viable Wagonload Production Schemes). The goal: Innovative and simultaneously practical solutions for a sustainable wagonload transport. The applicability of these solutions and their effects have been proven with the aid of business cases in terms of field tests and pilot operations. The following main innovations have been achieved within the ViWaS project:(1) Improved “last-mile” operating concepts incorporating hybrid locomotives and bi-modal shunting engines (by Bentheimer Eisenbahn, Fret SNCF and SBB Cargo supported by HaCon and NEWOPERA) : The new production method for last-mile delivery is based on the idea of separating train movements and sidings shunting processes by deploying bimodal road-rail tractors. Processes within the sidings have been simplified; as a result costs for equipment and staff could be reduced considerably. Hybrid locomotives are fundamental in securing a seamless access to regional distribution rail networks. Potential cost advantages have been identified comparing different traction combinations of real-life transport chains. (2) Modular wagon technologies for a flexible and efficient use of resources (by Wascosa and SBB Cargo) : In detail, three components have been developed up to prototype status: Wascosa's Flex Freight Car is a light <b>container</b> <b>wagon</b> with an accessible floor and thereby applicable for various transport purposes. The Timber Cassette 2. 0 is a new superstructure for log wood transport that features foldable stanchions and can be used in combination with a <b>container</b> <b>wagon.</b> In case the Timber Cassette is not loaded, it can be removed and stacked at the terminal or on a <b>container</b> <b>wagon.</b> Empty runs will be minimized generating efficiency improvements. Additionally, SBB Cargo has developed the so-called Container Loading Adapter, another add-on to a <b>container</b> <b>wagon.</b> It facilitates container loading and unloading in sidings. SBB Cargo will deploy this new component within the “Swiss Split” production system, combining intermodal with wagonload transport. (3) Smart wagon telematics allowing improved tracking at reduced costs (by Eureka) : A separate abstract “Smart Telematics Enabling Efficient Rail Transport” (Contribution ID 875) has been submitted for TRA 2016). 4. A new simulation tool for planning and optimizing single wagonload networks (by ETH Zürich) : WagonSIM is an agent-based simulation tool for rail freight networks to facilitate the optimization of SWL production schemes. It is based on the OpenSource software MatSIM. The tool models the routing of freight wagons according to the routes within the real SWL network. Therefore, the modelling of two network levels is required, the production network and the physical infrastructure.

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when replacing conventional flat <b>wagons</b> with standard <b>container</b> <b>wagons</b> is that <b>container</b> <b>wagons</b> (width: 2438  mm; height: 1155  mm) are narrower and lower than flat wagons (width: 2650  mm; height: 1230 to 1260  mm). Since the new wagons had to be designed to meet customers’ needs, the authors visited 18 Swiss Split customer sidings in Switzerland to measure the ramp height and vertical distance on site. They also studied operations and discussed the wagon requirements with company logistic managers.|$|R

VAMPIRE wagon modelling software {{was used for the}} simulation. The simulated and the measured dynamic response of the freight wagons enable more complete understanding and deeper insight into the causes and response of track induced wagon dynamics.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of today’s Swiss Split distribution by rail showed {{weaknesses in the}} fields of rolling stock, transhipment terminal structures and the production schemes for SWL. Thus, a new <b>container</b> <b>wagon</b> has been developed to serve the sidings. The terminal structure has been improved by a new gateway terminal. The production schemes for SWL have been improved by applying a train-coupling-and-sharing network structure and an improved schedule structure for SWL trains. An agent based simulation software for rail freight has been developed to assess the improvements in the production scheme. At last, the new business model for Swiss Split has led to an integration of transhipment processes and rail distribution. In sum all of these measures have resulted in significant cost reductions for the container distribution by rail.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} several {{simulations}} {{have been carried}} out aimed at improving the knowledge of vehicle aerodynamics and improving the flow around vehicles with respect to the aerodynamic drag. Five flows around different simplified vehicle models have been considered in five appended publications. One tractor-trailer model, two passenger car models, one freight wagon model and one regional train model. In the simulations of the flow around the tractor-trailer model, {{the focus is on the}} flow in the gap between the tractor and the trailer and how this flow affects the global drag of the model. Large Eddy Simulation is used to simulate the flow around four variants of the model with different geometrical configurations. The behavior of the drag coefficient of the tractor-trailer model when varying the gap width and the shape of the front edges on the tractor is explained by identifying and analysing the large vortices around and in the the gap. The focus in the study on one of the passenger vehicle models is on the so-called A-pillar vortex. This is a swirling longitudinal vortex formed along the side windows on passenger vehicles due to the separation of the flow from the side edges of the front window and the engine hood. Flow control, both steady blowing and suction, from actuators located on the side of the front of the model, is applied in the LES simulations. Steady blowing into the vortex causes expedited breakdown of the vortex, which in turn influence the pressure distribution on the side windows and the overall drag of the model. Steady suction prevents the formation of the vortex, thereby removing the vortex entirely. Simulations aimed at improving the knowledge of the flow around a generic freight wagon model using LES is also reported. The model is smoothed in comparison to a real <b>container</b> <b>wagon,</b> but the overall geometrical features such as wheels and underhood are included. The simulations of the flow around the regional train model is done using Partially Averaged Navier Stokes (PANS). PANS is a recently proposed hybrid turbulence model for engineering types of flow. The regional train model consists of a bluff body with a length to height/width ration of 7 : 1. The flow around this model poses several challenging flow situations to simulate such as separation from the leading curved front edges, an attached boundary layer flow and separation from the curved rear edges at the moderate Reynolds number of 400 000 based on the models’ width. An open cavity is placed on the model at the base and the drag is thereby decreased by some 10 %. The second passenger vehicle model that has been investigated is a square back Ahmed body. This flow is simulated using LES, and the temporally and spatially resolved flow field is used as input to a Reduced-Order Model (ROM). The ROM is constructed by a decomposition of the flow field into spatially stationary modes with corresponding time-varying amplitudes, using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). The introduction of the POD into the governing equations reduces these equations to a linear-quadratic dynamical system with known coefficient. This system is then truncated, so that the remaining system contains a low number of modes. It is investigated how to best model the influence of the truncated high-frequency modes on the remaining system...|$|E
