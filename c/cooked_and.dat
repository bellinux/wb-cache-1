5|$|Vegetables can {{be eaten}} either raw or <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> play an {{important}} role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{differences}} between the private and public discourses associated with <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs and the identities that are formed by these discourses. Academic literature and memoirs were reviewed to analyze the private discourse created among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs that form their identities. Media articles and two movies were reviewed to analyze the public discourses that form the larger social identities of <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs. Embracing Fairhurst and Putnam’s (2004) conceptualization of “discourse” as local talk and texts and “Discoruse” as large scale systems of meaning, I conceptualized private discourse as local talk among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs and public “Discourse” as larger meanings about <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs. Taking a becoming orientation to discourse and embracing a Foucauldian power/knowledge lens, I analyze discourses about <b>and</b> among <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs to explore their emergent identities. This analysis reveals that the public discourse surrounding the identity of <b>cooks</b> <b>and</b> chefs is oppressive and potentially limits the ways they can engage in necessary discourse to create their own identities...|$|R

5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, carrots and marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and less often chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the main reason it is prepared before the day it is <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> served. Many female family members participate in the rolling and stuffing of the vegetables, relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E
5|$|Three court {{appointed}} psychiatrists found Kemper to {{be legally}} sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis {{that he was}} once psychotic. He also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that Kemper sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed {{the prospect of the}} infamy associated with being labeled a serial killer.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, new {{prisoners were}} {{expected}} to pay garnish, a donation to the prisoners' committee. When the commissioners reported to parliament between 1815 and 1818, male prisoners were paying five shillings and sixpence, increased to eight shillings and sixpence {{by the time the}} anonymous witness was writing in 1833. Women were asked for a smaller sum. The fee allowed prisoners to use the snuggery, where water could be boiled and meals <b>cooked,</b> <b>and</b> candles and newspapers obtained. Prisoners failing to pay were declared defaulters by the prison crier, had their names written up in the kitchen, and were sent to Coventry.|$|E

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, <b>cooked,</b> <b>and</b> frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|The Gaza Strip's cooking {{style is}} similar to culinary styles adopted {{by the rest of}} the Levant countries, and is also {{influenced}} by the Mediterranean coast. The staple food for the majority of the inhabitants in the area is fish. Gaza has a major fishing industry and fish is often served either grilled or fried after being stuffed with cilantro, garlic, red peppers and cumin and marinated in a mix of coriander, red peppers, cumin, and chopped lemons. Besides fish, as well as other types of seafood, Zibdieh, is a clay pot dish that consists of shrimp baked in a stew of olive oil, garlic, hot peppers, and peeled tomatoes. Crabs are <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> then stuffed with a red hot pepper paste called shatta.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown {{weary of the}} prince and welcomed the change of government. They were joined by the military, for whom {{the prospect of the}} return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration. Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government. In one incident at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol's brother, Lon Nil, tore out his liver, and <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> ate it. An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march on the capital to demand Sihanouk's reinstatement. They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{only time}} in the year when {{separate}} food is cooked for the goddess is when she is offered non-vegetarian offerings. During Durga Puja, Vimala is offered non-vegetarian food and animal sacrifice, traditionally offered to the Hindu Mother Goddess. The goddess is considered to assume a destructive form during the festival and the meat is considered necessary to placate her. In strict secrecy during the pre-dawn hours, animal sacrifice of a he-goat is offered in the temple, while fish from the sacred Markanda temple tank are <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> offered to Vimala, as per Tantric rituals. The rituals have to be completed before {{the doors of the}} main sanctum of the vegetarian Jagannath are opened at dawn and the first morning aarti is offered to the god. Vaishnava devotees of Jagannath are debarred from the temple. Only a few who witness the ceremony are given the Bimala parusa (Vimala's cuisine) as prasad. The animal sacrifice and the non-vegetarian offerings to Vimala produced protests.|$|E
5|$|Waraq Dawali (stuffed grape leaves), is a mahshi meal {{reserved}} for large gatherings. The grape leaves are normally wrapped around minced meat, white rice and diced tomatoes, however meat {{is not always}} used. Dawali is an excellent representation of the attention to detail commonly found in Palestinian and Levant cuisine, with each piece being tightly wrapped {{to the size of}} cigarette morsels (some families differ in their structure).It is then <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> served as dozens of rolls on a large plate usually accompanied by boiled potato slices, carrots and lamb pieces. Kousa mahshi are zucchinis stuffed with the same ingredients as waraq al-'ainib and usually served alongside it heavy meals. If made with a large number of zucchinis as well as dawali it is known as waraq al-'ainib wa kousa.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{knew of the}} {{technique}} of distillation, {{but it was not}} practiced on a major scale in Europe until some time around the 12th century, when Arabic innovations in the field combined with water-cooled glass alembics were introduced. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.|$|E
