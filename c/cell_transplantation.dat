40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{effectiveness of}} the treatment of limbal autograft stem <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> combined {{with the use of}} mitomycin C(MMC) for pterygium on the postoperative recurrence and repairing time of corneal epithelial. METHODS: All the relevant reported studies were searched out through Cochrane Datebase, Pubmed, China BioMedical Literature Database(CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI), VIP and Wanfang Database which published before December 2012. All the randomized controlled trials(RCT) which accessed the recurrence of pterygium by comparing the treatment of limbal autograft stem <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> with the additional use of MMC during limbal autograft stem <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> were included. The data were analyzed by RevMan 5. 1 software provided by Cochrane Collaboration Network. RESULTS: Totally 217 studies were included at first and 12 RCT were included at last. A total of 1 044 eyes were included. Twelve RCT were analyzed with Meta-analysis: the postoperative recurrence rate had statistical significance between limbal autograft stem <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> and limbal autograft stem <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> combined MMC,(OR = 0. 23, 95 % CI : 0. 15 - 0. 36, Z = 6. 40, P CI : 0. 62 - 1. 85, Z = 0. 98, P = 0. 33).

The {{aim of this}} study was to comparison of Schwann <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> effect with autograft model in peripheral nerve regeneration in animal model. Materials and Methods: 20 male Wistar rats were randomly were divided into 3 groups: control, Schwann <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> and autograft model. In the control group, a 10 mm segment of the left sciatic nerve was removed and a silicone tube replaced into this nerve gap. In the Schwann <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> group, after placing the silicone tube were transplanted into the tubeabout 500, 000 Schwann cells. In the autograft model group, 10 mm segment of the left sciatic nerve is removed and it was implanted to the two nerve endings after reversing. 12 weeks after surgery we evaluated the number of axons, the number of blood vessels and the restored myelin sheath thickness. Results: Histological analysis by using one way ANOVA showed that the number of axons and the thickness of myelin sheath in autograft model group was significantly greater than the other groups, and in the Schwann <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> group was significantly greater than the control group. Moreover, the number of restored blood vessels in the Schwann <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> group was significantly greater than the other groups (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The results show that Schwann <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> is effective in peripheral nerve regeneration and it may be a good alternative to autograft method...|$|R

5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem <b>cell</b> <b>transplantation</b> is usually recommended if the person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem <b>cell</b> <b>transplantation,</b> and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that normal bone marrow (BM) <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> can correct liver injury in a mouse model of Wilson disease (WD). However, it still remains unknown when BM <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> should be administered. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential impact of normal BM <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> at different stages of WD to correct liver injury in toxic milk (tx) mice. Methods Recipient tx mice were sublethally irradiated (5 Gy) prior to transplantation. The congenic wild-type (DL) BM cells labeled with CM-DiI were transplanted via caudal vein injection into tx mice at the early (2 months of age) or late stage (5 months of age) of WD. The same volume of saline or tx BM cells were injected as controls. The DL donor cell population, copper concentration, serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in the various groups were evaluated at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-transplant, respectively. Results The DL BM cells population was observed from 1 to 12 weeks and peaked by the 4 th week in the recipient liver after <b>transplantation.</b> DL BM <b>cells</b> <b>transplantation</b> during the early stage significantly corrected copper accumulation, AST across the observed time points and serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity through 8 to 12 weeks in tx mice compared with those treated with saline or tx BM cells (all P P P > 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction. The {{number of}} {{allogeneic}} haematopoietic stem <b>cell</b> <b>transplantations</b> is increasing year by year. The most common long-term complication is chronic graft-versus-host disease, with skin involvement noted in over 90 % of cases. Objective. To present and discuss skin lesions occurring in chronic graft-versus-host disease {{with a particular}} focus on available dermatological treatment modalities. Case report. A 45 -year-old male patient, who received allogeneic haematopoietic stem <b>cell</b> <b>transplantations</b> in December 2012, presented {{for the treatment of}} skin lesions secondary to chronic graft-versus-host disease. Clinical examination revealed hyperpigmented lichenoid eruption on the trunk; irregular patches of non-scarring alopecia; poikiloderma on the face and upper limbs; and sclerodermatous lesions on the hands with diffuse epidermal exfoliation on the palms and soles. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Treatment consisting of phototherapy and intensive topical treatment was introduced. Conclusions. Skin lesions secondary to chronic graft-versus-host disease may impair the daily functioning of post-transplant patients. Comprehensive therapeutic management should be based on the cooperation between haematologists and dermatologists...|$|R
30|$|Prevalence {{of cancer}} {{increases}} steadily over time [1] {{and is a}} leading cause of death worldwide, especially in developed countries [2].

40|$|Numerous {{neurodegenerative}} and neuromuscular {{disorders are}} associated with cell-specific depletion in the human body. This imbalance in tissue homeostasis is in healthy individuals repaired {{by the presence of}} endogenous stem cells that can replace the lost cell type. However, in most disorders, a genetic origin or limited presence or exhaustion of stem cells impairs correct cell replacement. During the last 30 years, methods to readily isolate and expand stem cells have been developed and this resulted in a major change in the regenerative medicine field as it generates sufficient amount of <b>cells</b> for human <b>transplantation</b> applications. Furthermore, stem cells have been shown to release cytokines with beneficial effects for several diseases. At present however, clinical stem <b>cell</b> <b>transplantations</b> studies are struggling to demonstrate clinical efficacy despite promising preclinical results.

25|$|Autologous hematopoietic stem <b>cell</b> <b>transplantation</b> (HSCT) {{is based}} on the {{assumption}} that autoimmune diseases like systemic sclerosis occur when the white blood cells of the immune system attack the body. In this treatment, stem cells from the patient's blood are extracted and stored to preserve them. The patient's white blood cells are destroyed with cyclophosphamide and rabbit antibodies against the white blood cells. Then the stored blood is returned to the patient's bloodstream to reconstitute a healthy blood and immune system which will not attack the body. The results of a phase 3 trial, the Autologous Stem <b>Cell</b> <b>Transplantation</b> International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in the treatment group was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in the treatment group was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited to patients who were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself. Therefore, HSCT should be given early in the progression of the disease, before it does damage. Patients with heart disease, and patients who smoked cigarettes, were less likely to survive. Another trial, the Stem Cell Transplant vs. Cyclophosphamide (SCOT) trial, is ongoing.|$|E
