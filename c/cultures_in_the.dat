5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval <b>cultures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then {{would need to be}} regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
5|$|Corvus was {{recognized}} as a constellation by several Polynesian <b>cultures.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Marquesas Islands, it was called Mee; in Pukapuka, it was called Te Manu, and in the Society Islands, it was called Metua-ai-papa. To Torres Strait Islanders, Corvus was the right hand (holding kupa fruit) of the huge constellation Tagai, a man fishing.|$|E

30|$|When the Yangshao {{culture of}} the mid-Yellow River {{suddenly}} declined around 3000  BCE, the {{culture of the}} lower-Yellow River began a Westward expansion. Thus, the Henan Longshan culture proceeded <b>the</b> Yangshao <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region.

5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he <b>cultures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also {{allows them to}} see the spirits {{of people who have}} died in the nursing home and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E
5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} <b>cultures.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village <b>cultures</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was designed}} to assess <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> a foreign language immersion magnet school to determine <b>the</b> type of <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school, to discover how <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school is perceived by the foreign language immersion and non-immersion staff members, and to determine the impact {{the presence of the}} foreign language immersion program has on the culture of the school.

Although there is a perceived <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> has only previously been assessed through the North Carolina Teacher Working Conditions Survey but never specifically with <b>the</b> school <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> a foreign language immersion school as the focus...|$|R

5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African <b>cultures.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
