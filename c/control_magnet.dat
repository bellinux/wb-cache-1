40|$|Abstract—Permanent magnet {{synchronous}} motor (PMSM), em-ploying vector control, {{is used in}} high performance servo drive applications. It is highly non-linear plant which can be described by linear parameter varying (LPV) state-space model. In order to solve nonlinearity problem and syntesize speed controler, tensor product (TP) model transformation is proposed. Using this transformation, given linear parameter varying state-space model is transformed into polytopic model form, namely, to parameter varying convex combination of linear time invariant (LTI) systems. The main advantage of the TP model transformation {{is that it is}} executable in a relatively short time and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) -based control design frameworks can immediately be applied to the resulting polytopic models. Proposed control approach of nonlinear systems is applied to the speed <b>control</b> of permanent <b>magnet</b> {{synchronous motor}} drive (PMSM). Simulation results show benefits of the non-linear control applied to PMSM.

40|$|Abstract—Finite element {{modeling}} treats magnetization pro-cesses {{within the}} framework of micromagnetic theory, taking into account the complex microstructure of a magnet. The numerical integration of the Gilbert equation of motion provides the time evolution of the magnetization and thus shows how reversed domain nucleate and expand. The numerical results of static micromagnetic calculations reveal the influence of the intrinsic magnetic properties on the remanence and the coercive field of three different types of permanent magnets: (1) In nucleation <b>controlled</b> Nd-Fe-B <b>magnets,</b> the magnetic properties of inter-granular regions control the coercive field. The coercive field decreases with increasing alignment if the grain boundary region with reduced magnetocrystalline anisotropy exceeds 10 nm. (2) In isotropically oriented grains of nanocrystalline magnets, exchange interactions between neighboring soft and hard grains lead to remanence enhancement. An increase of the hard phase anisotropy of only 8 % increases the coercive field of two phase Nd 2 Fe 14 B/α-Fe magnets significantly. In two phase Nd 2 Fe 14 B/ Fe 3 B, the reduction of the soft phase magnetization and/or the soft phase exchange constant leads to an improvement of the coercive field without a significant loss in remanence. (3) For pin-ning <b>controlled</b> Sm-Co <b>magnets</b> for high temperature applica-tions a the finite element model was built according to the cellular microstructure. The simulation reveals the upper limits for the coercive field. Index Terms—Finite element method, Permanent magnets, Numerical micromagnetics, Nd-Fe-B, Sm-Co magnets I...|$|R
