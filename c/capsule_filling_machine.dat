40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide ‘semi-quantitative’ or ‘rigorous’ definitions of the fluidity, lubricity and compactibility requirements of formulation for representative dosator and dosing disc <b>capsule</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> To that end, model formulations were developed for those properties using Carr's compressibility index, ejection force, and plug breaking force at a specified compression force to gauge fluidity, lubricity, and compactibility, respectively. These formulations were each encapsulated on an Hofliger-Karg GKF- 400 dosing disc machine and a Zanasi LZ- 64 dosator machine. Each machine was instrumented to measure plug compression and ejection forces. The encapsulation process was evaluated for %CV of fill-weight, ejection force, plug breaking force and the dissolution of marker drugs incorporated in the formulations. The f 2 metric was used to compare dissolution profiles. The results suggest: (1) formulations should meet different flow criteria for successful encapsulation on the two machines, (2) a relatively lower level of lubricant may be sufficient for the dosing disc machine, (3) a higher degree of formulation compactibility is needed for the dosator machine, and (4) transferring formulations between these machine types (same class, different subclass per FDA's SUPAC-IR/MR Manufacturing Equipment Addendum) could be challenging. In certain cases dissolution profiles for the same formulation filled on the two machines with equivalent compression force were different based on f 2 < 50. Overall, the results of this study suggest a range of formulation characteristics appropriate for transferring formulations between these two types of machines...|$|R
40|$|The weight {{variation}} of gelatin capsules filled by a dosator-type machine has several possible causes, one of which, {{the presence of}} density variations within the powder feed bed, has been evaluated, using a number of particle size fractions of material. Existing theories suggested that the bulk density, or porosity of a powder bed depends on the velocity and intensity of deposition of the particles, together with {{the properties of the}} powder. Experiments with lactose confirmed this, indicating in particular that low velocity deposition encourages the formation of regions of relatively high porosity. The application of vibration, especially in a vertical direction, proved effective in reducing the porosity of powder packings, and optimum frequency and acceleration appeared to be largely independent of particle size. A system was developed for detecting porosity variations within powder beds, using the technique of gamma-ray attenuation, the principle being that the reduction in intensity of a Gamma-ray beam traversing a powder bed is a function of local porosity. The observed linear attenuation coefficient of lactose was found to be a function of porosity, for reasons not fully established, hence a calibration expression for the attenuation coefficient was proposed, and was used in subsequent local porosity determinations. The radial distribution of porosity within cylindrical samples of lactose, prepared under various conditions, was studied, and a means of presenting such distributions pictorially was developed. The influence of deposition method, and applied vibration, on the uniformity, of such packings, was clearly demonstrated. A semi-automatic dosator-type <b>capsule</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> was used to evaluate the relationship between powder feed bed porosity variations and capsule fill weight variation.

40|$|Summary. The {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the in vitro dissolution characteristics comparatively between pH sensitive polymer coated tablets and natural polymer coated tablets in a various simulated fluids (pH values 1. 2, 6, 6. 8, 7. 2, 5). The fabricated Mesalamine tablets were coated with pectin-HPMC(Hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose) E 15 LV (FC 1 -FC 5) in combination and with Eudragit L 100 (FC 6 -FC 10) separately. Different buffer conditions were chosen to mimic the pH changes of the terminal part of the ileum as well as the colon.   Two in vitro studies were conducted separately in all the formulations. The impact of the pH changes on the coated tablets in normal pH condition and reduced pH condition (which occurs during inflammation in the colon) were compared. The results showed that the impact of pH changes on the release profile of Eudragit L 100   coated tablets was significant in reduced pH condition. In pH sensitive polymer coated tablets, drug release characteristics and the rate were affected when compared to the pectin coated tablets.  This study indicates that poly methacrylate polymers could not release the drug in predetermined rate in a variety of pH conditions. The present treatment methods of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mostly depend on pH sensitive polymers. These pH sensitive polymers based colonic devices may not serve the patient need successfully because the influence of colonic pH on pH sensitive polymers {{plays an important role in}} drug release. The lowered pH condition in diseased state could not trigger the drug release, as it was not the threshold pH of the particular coated polymer. Therefore, in such diseased conditions natural polymer (pectin) based devices serve better for the objective of the therapy. The study on the effect of pH changes on the drug release profile of natural polymer-based colonic devices revealed that there was no impact by pH changes on the devices since they release the drug by the effect of colonic bacteria and not by the pH sensitivity. Industrial relevance. Targeting the drugs to colon is the most important aspect of modern IBD therapy. The coating is the most widely used  smple technique in the industry. The present coating techniques available for the colon targeting with pH sensitive polymers for colonic delivery can be successfully replaced by the pectin-HPMC E 15 LV  coating. This coating can be given by the usal coating machine used in the industry. The difficulty found in coating with polysaccrides polymers were successfully solved by the incorporation of HPMC premium polymer in the coating formula. The coating not only used for targeting Mesalamine to colon but also used for targeting of many bio active compounds, harmones, proteins such as insulin,calcitonin,vasopressin,antibiotics, vaccines can also targeted to the colon by using Pectin-HPMCE 15 LV coating systems. Prophylaxis to nicotine addiction and treatment of colonic cancer also possible by this coating by targeting the suitable candidates to colon. The simple manufacturing of tablets with suitable drug or bio-active material or simply filling it in the capsule by using a <b>capsule</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> and coating them with the present natural coating systems by using regular coating technique and machine the scale up can be developed easily for the large scale manufacturing.

40|$|Summary: Orally {{administered}} metronidazole {{often requires}} {{just a fraction}} of the administered dose for optimum local activity in the colon. Any formulation design that can target drug to the colon may require dose reduction while improving therapeutic activity. Colon targeted drug delivery achieves this fit. The objective of this work therefore was to evaluate the in vitro effect of, the percentage of surface area of capsule surface coated with Landolphia owariensis latex (LOL), particle size of granules, and %w/w of matrix former (methylcellulose) on the release of metronidazole from coated hard gelatine capsules for possible delivery to the colon. Metronidazole granules were prepared by the wet granulation technique and appropriately encapsulated prior to primary coating of capsule with Eudragit ® L- 100 and secondary coating with LOL. Capsules having primary coating of Eudragit ® L- 100 were coated with LOL atop 50 % or 85 % capsule surface. In vitro drug release was carried out sequentially in media of pH 1. 2 (0. 1 N HCl), 6. 8 and 7. 4 (phosphate buffer solution) respectively. The dissolution data were subjected to kinetic treatment. Results showed that the greatest quantity of drug release took place at pH 7. 4 over 9 - 20 h. Univariate analysis of variance indicated that surface area of capsule coated with LOL had a significant (p 7. 4) at pH 7. 4. Most of the capsules prepared with 4 % methylcellulose had better fit than those of 1 % on the applied kinetic models. Capsules with 85 % surface coated with LOL recorded higher dissolution efficiency (DE) and mean dissolution time (MDT) values, except in a few cases. Landolphia owariensis latex, has therefore proved to be a potentially useful polymer for possible achievement of colon targeted drug delivery. Industrial relevance: Landolphia owariensis latex is an ignored part of the climber tree. It can be cultivated and tapped to commercial scale as in rubber. There is presently a patent based on colon targeted technology which adopted  capsule coating approach. The dip method of coating employed in this article is a common technology in capsule manufacture; therefore coating of the capsules with our natural biopolymer and Eudragit L- 100 {{is not going to be}} tasking. This double hydrophobic coating technique prolongs drug release enough to convey the capsule to the colon with greatest quantity of the drug intact. This makes colon drug targeting an attractive drug delivery approach for the rare oral delivery of protein/biotech products, etc. Insulin is commonly presented as an injectable with its attendant problem of patient compliance and frequent puncturing of the skin. With <b>capsule</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> having coating accessories attached to them large scale manufacture can be embarked upon. </p...|$|R
40|$|These days an {{alternative}} to soft capsules is liquid-filled hard <b>capsules.</b> Their <b>filling</b> technology was investigated earlier with highly viscous formulations, while hardly any academic research focused on low-viscosity systems. Accordingly, this work addressed the filling of such oils that are splashing during the dosing process. It was aimed to first study <b>capsule</b> <b>filling,</b> using middle-chain triglycerides as reference oil, in order to then evaluate {{the concept of a}} new theoretical splashing degree for different oils. A laboratory-scale <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> was used that included capsule sealing. Thus, the liquid encapsulation by microspray technology was employed to seal the dosage form. As a result of the study with reference oil, the filling volume and the temperature were found to be significant for the rate of leaking <b>capsules.</b> The <b>filling</b> volume was also important for weight variability of the capsules. However, most critical for this variability was the diameter of the filling nozzle. We proposed a power law for the coefficient of weight variability {{as a function of the}} nozzle diameter and the obtained exponent agreed with the proposed theory. Subsequently, a comparison of different oils revealed that the relative splashing degree shared a correlation with the coefficient of the capsule weight variability (Pearson product moment correlation of r[*]=[*] 0. 990). The novel theoretical concept was therefore found to be predictive for weight variability of the <b>filled</b> <b>capsules.</b> Finally, guidance was provided for the process development of liquid-filled capsules using low-viscosity oils...|$|R
