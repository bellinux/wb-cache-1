50|$|When Class 15A {{locomotives}} were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2A boilers, {{they were}} therefore reclassified to Class 15AR. Early conversions were equipped with copper and later conversions with steel fireboxes. In the process, {{they were also}} equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs, while the <b>cab</b> <b>platform</b> was extended over {{the front end of}} the tender underframe. Many of the reboilered engines were later fitted with Type MR or Type MT tenders.|$|E
40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2006 The goal of {{this project}} is to reduce or {{eliminate}} simulator users from experiencing motion sickness. This will be accomplished by designing and constructing a motion base platform and developing as well as testing the software that controls {{the motion of the}} platform based on vehicle data provided by the car simulator. The seat motion platform can serve as the foundation design for the entire <b>cab</b> <b>platform</b> in the future...|$|E
50|$|On December 7, 2015, San Diego-based BioAtla {{signed a}} license and option deal with Pfizer, {{involving}} BioAtla's conditionally-active biologics (<b>CAB)</b> antibody <b>platform</b> and Pfizer's antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) payloads. BioAtla is eligible to receive more than $1.0 billion in up-front, regulatory and sales milestone commitments {{as well as}} tiered marginal royalties reaching double digits on potential future product sales.|$|R
50|$|FAP 2026 BDS/A is variant {{with longer}} <b>cab</b> used as <b>platform</b> for {{different}} upgrades, as trucks for transportation of the PM M71 Floating Bridge sections, M-77 Oganj self-propelled multiple rocket launcher, mounting of M-85 Žirafa mobile radar and fire truck.|$|R
50|$|The first 15 locos were swapped {{between the}} narrow and {{standard}} gauge networks {{by changing the}} bogies and couplers. However, by the mid 1960s problems were experienced in working wide standard gauge rolling stock such as the Treadwell hot metal cars. To overcome this {{it was decided to}} dedicate 37 to 41 to the narrow gauge network, with 42 to 53 were progressively fitted with 9 ft wide <b>cabs</b> and <b>platforms</b> to overcome the visibility problems.|$|R
50|$|Up until 1910, {{the only}} trams {{delivered}} to the Vienna tramway network were vehicles with unglazed <b>platforms</b> (or <b>cabs),</b> i.e.: without any windscreens protecting occupants from the cold and wind. This {{was still in the}} tradition of the horse cars, on which direct contact of the driver with the harnessed horses was required. (It took until 1930 until the <b>cabs</b> and <b>platforms</b> of all tramcars had protective glass.) In 1911, the first double stops were introduced.|$|R
50|$|The Dyna and its twin Toyoace and Dutro {{were built}} on the U300 <b>platform</b> for Standard <b>Cab,</b> or U400 <b>platform</b> for the Wide Cab. The Dyna Route Van/Dutro Van are {{essentially}} standard Toyota HiAce van bodies mated with the Dyna/Dutro truck chassis.|$|R
25|$|After the {{decision}} to switch to diesel traction, the site was completely rebuilt in 1962 to accommodate diesels, including the Warship Class that were used on the Exeter to Waterloo services. The Factory was reformed to provide four roads with servicing pits and <b>cab</b> level <b>platforms,</b> providing facilities to repair eight locomotives at the same time. Access was via the existing traversing table. A daily servicing and fuelling point was built beside the old steam shed {{and it was this}} which provided the main facility after the factory closed in 1970.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a part of {{research}} on active suspension systems of cabs in heavy machines and trucks, used for suppressing low-frequency and large-amplitude vibrations. The suspension system incorporates two platform mechanisms placed one upon the other. The lower mechanism is respon-sible for maintaining the cab in the vertical position whilst the upper mechanism controls the cab movements in the vertical direction. Mo-tion of the cab is described using versors associated with the mechanism links. Relationships are derived that yield the instantaneous velocities of the drives that lead to reduction of the cab vibrations in selected DOFs. The procedure is shown for calculating the loads acting on the drives of the active suspension during the specified movement of the machine frame. The mathematical model is further utilised in simulations of the suspension operation. Key words: active vibration reduction, <b>cab</b> suspension, <b>platform</b> mecha-nism 1...|$|R
50|$|The Hino Dutro (日野デュトロ) {{is a light}} {{commercial}} truck shared with the Toyota Dyna, manufactured by Hino Motors. Like the Dyna and its twin Toyoace, the Dutro is built on the U300 <b>platform</b> for standard <b>cab,</b> or U400 <b>platform</b> for the wide cab and offered in many different chassis type suitable for different purposes. The Dutro took over from the earlier Ranger 2 (and Ranger 3), a badge-engineered version of Daihatsu's Delta series. Outside of Japan, it {{is also known as}} the '300 series'.|$|R
5000|$|The RA-2 Multiple Unit [...] (Cyrillic:РА2) is a Russian diesel {{multiple}} unit (rail bus), type 2. The RA-2 is produced by Metrovagonmash and is designed for passenger transportation on non-electrified railway lines with high traffic, as well as suburban and inter-regional communication. They can be operated {{as a part of}} only two head end cars, and with one or two trailing cars. The head / end cars have one exit from the <b>cab</b> for high <b>platforms,</b> and one in the centre of the car high and low platforms.|$|R
60|$|In London, also, on Saturday {{night there}} was a thunderstorm, and my brother reached Waterloo in a <b>cab.</b> On the <b>platform</b> from which the midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an {{accident}} prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The nature of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time. There was very little excitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise that anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred, were running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by Virginia Water or Guildford. They were busy making the necessary arrangements to alter {{the route of the}} Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager, to whom he bears a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview him. Few people, excepting the railway officials, connected the breakdown with the Martians.|$|R
