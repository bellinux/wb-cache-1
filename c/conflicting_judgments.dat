Otherwise the employer has the opportunity to show the dismissal is fair if it falls within five main categories listed in ERA 1996 section 98. The dismissal must have been because of the employee's capability or qualifications, because of conduct, because the employee was redundant, because continued employment would contravene a law, or because of [...] "some other substantial reason". If the employer has an argument based on one of these categories, then the tribunal evaluates whether the employer's actual decision fell within a [...] "reasonable range of responses", i.e. that a reasonable employer could have acted the same way.

However, there is considerable room for Tribunals to assess the facts and come to their own conclusions, which can only be appealed on legal grounds, and not on their judgment of good workplace relations. For example, in a conduct case, HSBC Bank plc v Madden, the Court of Appeal held that it was acceptable for a Tribunal to have decided that dismissing an employee for potential involvement in theft of credit cards was fair, even though an actual police investigation turned up no evidence. By contrast, in Bowater v Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust, an employer argued a nurse who, while physically restraining a naked patient who was unconscious and having a seizure, said [...] "It's been a few months since I have been in this position with a man underneath me" [...] was lewd and deserved dismissal for her misconduct. The Tribunal said the dismissal was unfair and the Court of Appeal held the Tribunal had competently exercised its discretion in granting the unfair dismissal claim. The absence of a role for elected worker representatives in assessing the fairness of the employer or manager's conduct in the UK contrasts to many EU member states. While courts act as a final check, it is often thought that the parties best placed to resolve disputes would be representatives of all staff members, who (unlike an employer or manager) usually have fewer conflicts of interest in dismissal disputes.|$|E

40|$|Though {{there is}} {{considerable}} agreement among the past studies about the great variability in <b>conflict</b> <b>judgments</b> by Air Traffic Control Specialists (ATCS), this work puts a first step forward in direction of a common core shared by controllers for perceiving conflicts.

The conditions created by factorial manipulation of three variables led to the design of short scenarios (about 1 min) upon which 161 controllers gave their opinion about the possible occurrence of separation loss (less than 3 NM and 1000 feet). The data, currently being analyzed, already show an important variability among experts, confirming the results of the past studies. But the way that the median values of responses are spread over the combinatory range of the scenarios appears very coherent and could prefigure a model of conflict perception by ATCS community. Further, values guaranteeing a certain level of security have been found and compared both on the horizontal plane and altitude. It shows (and quantifies) the higher efficiency, or reliability of those obtained on the plane. Considering anticipation in the judgment (variable D°A), it shows how uncertainty varies while anticipation decreases. Moreover, particular variations of uncertainty appear within responses resulting from scenarios with “near minima ” separation values. These variations tend to evidence the line of thought of ATCSs dealing with the limits of the margin they have to set for a conflict/non-conflict classification...|$|R

5000|$|Arising out of comity which {{requires}} each Member State {{to respect the}} courts and judgments of other Members, the theory underpinning Article 27 is a blunt and inflexible instrument because its effect is to stimulate each party to initiate proceedings before the court most likely to produce a favourable outcome. Thus, instead of avoiding forum shopping, it actually turns it into a race (Hartley: 1988). Where one party in a legal relationship foresees that action may be brought against them, they can pre-empt this and bring their own action {{to the court of}} their choice. This will result in the delaying of proceedings while jurisdiction is established. It may also mean that the case is decided in the court they wish, if it is established that the court has jurisdiction. This strategy has become known as a [...] "torpedo" [...] proceeding. The abuse of Article 27 was first described by Franzosi (1997 and 2002) in intellectual property disputes where a party infringing a patent commenced proceedings for a declaration before a court with long delays {{because of the number of}} cases waiting to be heard. Thus, no other European court could accept jurisdiction in cases alleging infringement by the patent holder. One possible response to this abuse of process might arise from the relationship between exclusive jurisdiction granted under Article 16 and the Article 27(2) mandatory duty. Article 29 reserves the priority for the first court when both courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Article 16. But the ECJ has not ruled on the situation where only the second court has exclusive jurisdiction. Article 35 provides that a judgment that conflicts with the provisions on exclusive jurisdiction cannot be recognised and enforced. Since Article 16(4) allows exclusive jurisdiction to the forum in the place of registration, this might provide an arguable case that the second court could review the ground upon which the first court had accepted the action. A further interesting development lies in the application of Article 6 which provides for multi-party proceedings and allows a person domiciled in a Member State to be sued in the state of any one of the defendants so long as there is a real connection between the cause of action and that state. The justification of this provision is one of efficiency. If an action involving many defendants and states can be consolidated, a single judgment enforced in all the relevant states saves costs and time and some Member States are now issuing cross-border injunctions in intellectual property (IP) disputes (see Eisengraeber (2004) for a detailed evaluation of this option). A final option to consider is that the IP licensor should include exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the grant of all licences. Although such clauses almost certainly do not prevail over lis alibi pendens, some courts have been persuaded to prefer the parties' choice over torpedo actions. However, this approach will potentially create <b>conflicting</b> <b>judgments</b> and Article 35 will deny recognition to the subsequent forum's decisions. This situation may represent a breach of Article 6 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights which stipulates that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time. As it stands, one party's selection of a forum suffering from inordinate delays, effectively denies all the other parties a hearing. But it is uncertain whether the European Court of Human Rights would find this prejudice to be a breach of Article 6.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} the theory of Construction Grammar by {{exploring}} the issue of compatibility between constructions. Goldberg(2006 : 10, 21 - 22) maintains that an actual expression is typically analyzable as the amalgam of several distinct constructions,predicting that non-conflicts between constructions will result in actual felicitous expressions but unsolved <b>conflicts</b> <b>judgments</b> of infelicity(ibid: 21 - 22). The present paper discusses the following related issues:(i) the nature of conflicts between constructions;(ii) the mechanisms of“conflict solving”; and(iii) what other consequences(besides felicity/infelicity) do non-conflicts/conflicts between constructions have? The paper identifies four distinct major patterns of compatibility statuses―complete compatibility, partial compatibility,serious incompatibility and absolute incompatibility,respectively. Basing itself on a survey of both constructed and natural data of several different types of mixed imperative constructions,the paper makes the following claims. First,the complete compatibility between constructions results in felicity and may result in high frequency of use as well(e. g. the imperative in the active voice). Second,partial compatibility leads to felicity but with low frequency of use(e. g. the imperative with the progressive verb). Third,serious incompatibility yields either infelicity or felicity with low frequency of use(e. g. the imperative in the passive voice or the imperative in the subordinate clause). Finally,absolute incompatibility results in infelicity(e. g. Topicalization with imperatives with overt subjects). The mechanisms of cross-constructional conflicts within mixed imperative constructions {{as well as their}} solutions are demonstrated to involve multiple cognitive conceptions/operations ―included are the core vs. peripheral portions of semantic structure,adherence to(or departure from) prototypes and conflicts between irreconcilable semantic roles as well as those between rhetorical vs. non-rhetorical interpretations,among others...|$|R
