40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{objective}} ofthis {{project is}} to create a walking robot employing a <b>cam</b> <b>controlled</b> leg. The <b>cam</b> <b>controlled</b> walker was first theorized in the Master's Thesis of Xiaonan Wan of Northern Illinois University. The principle of a <b>cam</b> <b>controlled</b> is to combine the advantages of both wheels and legs into one manipulator. The robot is constructed 'of a body with four motor driven walking pods. Each pod consisted of three cam-controlled members. The robot is capable of walking in a smooth, strait and level line, when it is activated. The robot is designed to be less than 69 centimeters and less than 2 kg in mass. The basic pod design involves a rotating slider and a cam shaped track, which causes a rotating member to have an end path that is a level strait line. This design is advantageous because it allows for the level motion of a wheel and the small footprint and rough terrain navigation ability of a leg. Analysis of motion shows that the robot does not move at constant speed. This creates a dynamic loading problem along with a dynamic control problem. The robot is built to be structurally sound and stable under the dynamic conditions. In order to conserve weight a light motors were used in conjunction with gearboxes. The robot showed it was physically capable of moving but it has problems power issues. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E

Extracellular matrix adhesion molecules, such as integrins and syndecans, and cell–cell adhesion molecules, including cadherins and Ig superfamily members, convey information about the environment to the cell. It is evident that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) regulate a variety of signaling events. An emerging theme is that one level of <b>CAM</b> signaling <b>control</b> is through regulated nucleocytoplasmic distribution of molecules that either phosphorylate or co-activate transcription factors.

50|$|All bird box {{movements}} have a clock-work motor {{which must be}} wound up. This motor is doing two basic jobs: The first one is to operate a small bellows which supplies air, via a wind chest, to a whistle which produces the birdsong and the second task is to rotate a number of <b>cams.</b> One <b>cam</b> <b>controls</b> the note produced by the whistle, a second determines when the note will be produced and for how long, and a third one produces the motion which causes the bird to turn from side to side. In some movements the flapping of the bird's wings {{and its ability to}} turn its head are also cam-controlled, in others not. The final cam determines {{the point at which the}} song ends, the bird folds away, the lid drops and the motor stops.

Using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, we identified two unconventional CaM-binding sites (CaM 1 and CaM 2), one in each of the N- and the C-terminal regions of the beta-subunit. Ca 2 + co-operatively stimulates binding of CaM to these sites exactly within the range of [Ca 2 +] occurring during a light response.

Under conditions in which CPZ inhibits gravitropism for over an hour, at least 11 % of the CaM in gravitropically stimulated coleoptiles is bound to CPZ.

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{characteristics}} that distinguish the 1000-series from the later series cars.

Here we used two complementary approaches to explore the molecular events underlying the association between CaM and Kv 7. 2 and their regulation by Ca 2 +. First, we performed a fluorometric assay using dansylated calmodulin (D-CaM) to characterize the interaction of its individual lobes to the Kv 7. 2 CaM binding site (Q 2 AB). Second, we explored the association of Q 2 AB with CaM by NMR spectroscopy, using 15 N-labeled CaM as a reporter. The combined data highlight the interdependency of the N- and C-lobes of CaM in the interaction with Q 2 AB, suggesting that when CaM binds Ca 2 + the binding interface pivots between the N-lobe whose interactions are dominated by helix B and the C-lobe where the predominant interaction is with helix A. In addition, Ca 2 + makes CaM binding to Q 2 AB more difficult and, reciprocally, the channel weakens the association of CaM with Ca 2 +...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS) {{requires}} calcium-bound calmodulin (CaM) for electron transfer but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a series of CaM mutants with E to Q substitution at the four calcium-binding sites, we found that single mutation at any calcium-binding site (B 1 Q, B 2 Q, B 3 Q and B 4 Q) resulted in ∼ 2 - 3 fold increase in the CaM concentration necessary for half-maximal activation (EC 50) of citrulline formation, indicating that each calcium-binding site of CaM contributed to the association between CaM and eNOS. Citrulline formation and cytochrome c reduction assays revealed that in comparison with nNOS or iNOS, eNOS was less stringent in the requirement of calcium binding to each of four calcium-binding sites. However, lobe-specific disruption with double mutations in calcium-binding sites either at N- (B 12 Q) or at C-terminal (B 34 Q) lobes greatly diminished both eNOS oxygenase and reductase activities. Gel mobility shift assay and flavin fluorescence measurement indicated that N- and C-lobes of CaM played distinct roles in regulating eNOS catalysis; the C-terminal EF-hands in its calcium-bound form {{was responsible for the}} binding of canonical CaM-binding domain, while N-terminal EF-hands in its calcium-bound form controlled the movement of FMN domain. Limited proteolysis studies further demonstrated that B 12 Q and B 34 Q induced different conformational change in eNOS.

40|$|This {{study reveals}} {{the essence of}} ligand {{recognition}} mechanisms by which calmodulin (<b>CaM)</b> <b>controls</b> a variety of Ca 2 + signaling processes. We study eight forms of calcium-loaded CaM each with distinct conformational states. Reducing the structure to {{two degrees of freedom}} conveniently describes main features of conformational changes of CaM via simultaneous twist-bend motions of the two lobes. We utilize perturbation-response scanning (PRS) technique, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations to analyze conformational preferences of calcium-loaded CaM, initially in extended form. PRS is comprised of sequential application of directed forces on residues followed by recording the resulting coordinates. We show that manipulation of a single residue, E 31 located in one of the EF hand motifs, reproduces structural changes to compact forms, and the flexible linker acts as a transducer of binding information to distant parts of the protein. Independently, using four different pKa calculation strategies, we find E 31 to be the charged residue (out of 52), whose ionization state is most sensitive to subtle pH variations in the physiological range. It is proposed that at relatively low pH, CaM structure is less flexible. By gaining charged states at specific sites at a pH value around 7, local conformational changes in the protein will lead to shifts in the energy landscape, paving the way to other conformational states. These findings are in accordance with FRET measured shifts in conformational distributions towards more compact forms with decreased pH. They also corroborate mutational studies and proteolysis results which point to the significant role of E 31 in CaM dynamics. Comment: 47 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
