5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} <b>cable</b> <b>line.</b> They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E
5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>line,</b> {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E

Method of implementation: it is necessary to introduce the reflectometry equipment for quality service and maintenance of <b>cable</b> <b>lines.</b> Results: a mathematical model that can simulate processes of diagnostic of real <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> by impulse reflectometry has been presented.

The Zoo line was Melbourne's last horse tram and the only line still in operation at {{the formation of the}} Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB), it was destroyed by fire during the 1923 police strike; the MMTB took the decision not to reopen it, ending Melbourne's horse tram era.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the authors {{investigate}} steady-state capabilities of very long EHVAC underground <b>cable</b> <b>lines,</b> without intermediate compensating stations, installed in meshed networks. Analytical formulas of cable length-loading relationship are presented to this purpose. The study shows that, in optimal operating conditions, most of the ampacity of such long underground <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> can be exploited for active power transmission. Non-optimal operating envelopes are studied, showing the effect of terminal voltages and <b>line</b> losses on <b>cable</b> utilization and evidencing limited derating under realistic hypotheses. A parametric analysis of loading limits and possible voltage violations along the cable is shown; a simple criterion for optimal utilization of lossy <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> is also proposed. Line-end shunt compensation requirements for integration of long EHVAC <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> in transmission networks are then specified. Studies performed for both ideal and real cables and shunt reactors show that active power transmission of 100 km long, 400 kV- 50 Hz underground <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> can attain 90 % of their thermal limit, without intermediate compensating stations. Excess reactive power and temporary overvoltages are effectively controlled by line-end compensation around 90 %. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The integral characteristics of study process complex – ignition delay times have been established according to <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> electrical overloads modes. The temperature distributions in typical <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> at overloads have been determined.

Thermal decomposition of the cable sheath and diffusion of thermal decomposition components and air were taken into account.

Appropriate choice of shunt compensation by standard, fixed-type shunt reactors, aimed at solving most steady-state constraints on the operation of very long EHV <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> as well as temporary overvoltages, is discussed.
