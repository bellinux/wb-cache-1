5|$|Alfonsín {{bought a}} local {{newspaper}} (El Imparcial). He joined the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> (UCR) in 1946, {{as a member of}} the Intransigent Renewal Movement, a faction of the party that opposed the incorporation of the UCR into the Democratic Union coalition. He was appointed president of the party committee in Chascomús in 1951, and was elected to the city council in 1954. He was detained for a brief time, during the reaction of the government of Juan Perón to the bombing of Plaza de Mayo. The Revolución Libertadora ousted Perón from the national government; Alfonsín was again briefly detained and forced to leave his office in the city council. The UCR broke up into two parties: the Intransigent Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> (UCRI), led by Arturo Frondizi, and the People's Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> (UCRP), led by Ricardo Balbín and Crisólogo Larralde. Alfonsín did not like the split, but opted to follow the UCRP.|$|E
5|$|The National Reorganization Process {{dictatorship}} {{came to an}} end in 1983, when Raúl Alfonsín won the 1983 elections. Rodríguez Saá became {{governor of}} San Luis in those elections, in a close contest with the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union.</b> He was helped by the clergy of the province, who opposed the radical candidate because of his secularism.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Bern disputation, Zwingli was {{canvassing}} for {{an alliance of}} reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, das Christliche Burgrecht (the Christian <b>Civic</b> <b>Union)</b> was created. The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Zurich on 5–6 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, Biel, Mülhausen, Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed die Christliche Vereinigung (the Christian Alliance) with Ferdinand of Austria on 22 April 1529.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Civic</b> Democratic <b>Union</b> contested the 1992 {{election}}s, {{but failed}} to win any seats. It won 4.0% of the Slovak vote for the House of the People, 4.0% for the House of Nations and 4.0% in the election for the Slovak National Council. The <b>Civic</b> Democratic <b>Union</b> finally dissolved in November 1992 and many former members of <b>Civic</b> Democratic <b>Union</b> {{would go on to}} join the Democratic Party in 1994.|$|R

50|$|While the Black Consciousness Movement itself spawned {{an array}} of smaller groups, many people {{who came of age}} as activists in the Black Consciousness Movement did not join them. Instead, they joined other organisations, {{including}} the ANC, the Unity Movement, the Pan Africanist Congress, the United Democratic Front and trade and <b>civic</b> <b>unions.</b>|$|R
5|$|Democratic {{rule was}} {{restored}} in 1983, and Duhalde ran {{for mayor of}} Lomas de Zamora. Being a centrist, the PJ appointed him candidate as a compromise between the internal opposing factions. The elections ended in a technical tie with the candidate of the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> (UCR), Horacio Devoy; Duhalde won by just 700 votes. There was a tie in the elections for the local legislature as well, as both the PJ and UCR got eleven legislators. Duhalde reported that a colonel sought his support for a possible coup against the newly elected president Raúl Alfonsín. Duhalde refused and reported directly to Alfonsín himself. He was elected national deputy in 1987, and became {{vice president of the}} Argentine Chamber of Deputies. He established a commission to fight drug addiction during his term of office.|$|E
5|$|Fernando de la Rúa (born September 15, 1937) is an Argentine retired {{politician}} of the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> (UCR) {{who served}} as President of Argentina from December 10, 1999, to December 21, 2001. De la Rúa was born in Córdoba; he entered politics after graduating {{with a degree in}} law. He was elected senator in 1973 and unsuccessfully ran for the office of Vice President as Ricardo Balbín's running mate the same year. In 1993, he was re-elected senator in 1983 and 1993, and as deputy in 1991. He unsuccessfully opposed the pact of Olivos between President Carlos Menem and party leader Raúl Alfonsín, which enabled the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution and the re-election of Menem in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Front for Victory {{recovered}} {{the majority in}} both chambers of the Congress during the 2011 presidential elections, when Cristina Kirchner was re-elected for a second term. The party had projects to amend the constitution and allow indefinite reelections, but lacked the supermajority required for it. A victory at the 2013 midterm elections would have given such majority, but the party was defeated in most provinces. Sergio Massa, a former cabinet minister of the Kirchners, won in the Buenos Aires Province by nearly 10 points with his new party, the Renewal Front. Argentina lacked a big opposition party {{since the collapse of}} the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> in 2001. Instead, Massa created an alternative party that also stood for Peronism. However, the party still retained a simple majority in Congress. This election was the first one where teenagers from 16 to 18 could vote. President Kirchner, who had undergone brain surgery some weeks before, was hospitalized during the election and unable to join the campaign.|$|E
5000|$|A civic {{strike of}} Vancouver's inside, outside, and library workers that began on July 26, 2007 was dubbed [...] "Sam's Strike" [...] by the strikers. The strike lasted 88 days {{and was the}} second longest in Vancouver's history; the longest was 90 days under Mayor Mike Harcourt in 1981. [...] The unions blamed Sullivan's intransigence at the {{bargaining}} table for prolonging the strike. The union cited the city never tabling a written counteroffer {{as evidence of the}} city not negotiating. A mediator was called in who recommended 17.5% (21% compounded), which was the amount accepted {{by the rest of the}} municipalities in the region. When two of the <b>civic</b> <b>unions</b> rejected the recommendation, public support collapsed, and within the week a new vote by the three <b>civic</b> <b>unions</b> accepted the deal. On October 19, 2007 CUPE Local 391 voted 71 percent in favour of the city's offer and ended the strike.|$|R

5|$|The Dirty War {{eventually}} ended, and the National Reorganization Process allowed {{political activity}} {{in preparation for}} a return to democracy. Kirchner led one of the three internal factions of the local Justicialist Party (PJ), but Peronist Arturo Puricelli prevailed in the primary elections. Kirchner founded the Ateneo Juan Domingo Perón organization, which supported deposed president Isabel Perón and promoted political dialogue with the military. Cristina Fernández became an attorney of the PJ in Santa Cruz, with the help of Rafael Flores, a former friend from the FURN. Raúl Alfonsín, who was running for president for the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> (UCR), denounced an agreement between the military and the Peronist unions which sought an amnesty for the military. Kirchner organized a rally on behalf of Rodolfo Ponce, a union leader mentioned by Alfonsín in his denouncement. Alfonsín won the 1983 presidential election, and Puricelli was elected governor of Santa Cruz. Puricelli sought to unify the local Peronist movement by adding members of the other factions into his government, and appointed Kirchner president of the provincial social-welfare fund.|$|E

25|$|Mauricio Macri, {{from the}} Republican Proposal, was {{the mayor of}} Buenos Aires city. Many smaller parties had created a {{coalition}} the previous year, the Broad Front UNEN. Elisa Carrió of the Civic Coalition left it to join Macri. An internal congress of the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> decided to do so as well, and proposing Ernesto Sanz as their precandidate. UNEN was thus disbanded, and the three candidates ran for the coalition Cambiemos. Margarita Stolbizer refused to join the coalition with Macri, and ran in a separate party instead.|$|E

25|$|Political opponents sustain that Perón and his {{administration}} resorted to organized violence and dictatorial rule, and that Perón showed contempt for any opponents, and regularly characterized them as traitors and agents of foreign powers. Perón maintained the institutions of democratic rule, but subverted freedoms through such actions as nationalizing the broadcasting system, centralizing the unions under his control, and monopolizing the supply of newspaper print. At times, Perón also resorted to tactics such as illegally imprisoning opposition politicians and journalists, including Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> leader Ricardo Balbin, and shutting down opposition papers, such as La Prensa.|$|E
25|$|Alejandro Armendáriz, of the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union,</b> {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1983, when Raúl Alfonsín became president. Alfonsín lost the 1987 midterm elections, {{leading to the}} victory of Antonio Cafiero. From that year to 2015, all governors have been Peronists. The high population of the province makes it highly influential in the Argentine politics. With both ruling for two terms, the rivalry of president Carlos Menem and governor Eduardo Duhalde dominated the Argentine politics during the nineties. A similar case took place with president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and governor Daniel Scioli. María Eugenia Vidal, from Republican Proposal, won the 2015 elections, {{and became the first}} female governor of the province.|$|E
25|$|Having been {{a member}} of the Radical <b>Civic</b> <b>Union</b> (UCR), Caputo {{endorsed}} the FrePaSo ticket ahead of the 1995 general elections, and joined the centre-left party New Space (Nuevo Espacio), later that year.

He left New Space after personal differences with Carlos Raimundi, and in 1998 joined the Popular Socialist Party, remaining as vice-president of FrePaSo until 2000. In 1999, he sought the FrePaSo nomination for election as Mayor of Buenos Aires, but lost to Aníbal Ibarra, who went on to win in 2000.|$|E
50|$|At first, {{many workers}} liked the ideal wage pay, {{but the company}} deducted charges for staying overnight, {{transportation}} and blanket rental, making the workers motivated to revolt against the company. After three months of unproductive negotiations between the employers of the Winnipeg builders exchange and the union, worker frustration grew. The city council's new proposal to the workers was unsatisfactory to the four departments, electrical workers took action and a strike was established. Waterworks and fire department employees joined a few days later. Strikers were labelled as Bolsheviks who were attempting to undermine Canada. The city council viewed this as unacceptable and thus dismissed the striking workers. This did not discourage the latter; instead, other <b>civic</b> <b>unions</b> joined the strike out of sympathy, which was an important feature of twentieth century social history.|$|R
