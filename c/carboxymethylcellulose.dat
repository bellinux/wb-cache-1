5|$|Some true fungi specialise in the {{colonisation}} of the Myxogastriae: {{almost all}} of these are species of sac fungi. The most common such fungus is Verticillium rexianummainly species from Comatricha or Stemonitis. Gliocladium album and Sesquicillium microsporum are often found on Physaridae, while Polycephalomyces tomentosus is often found on certain species of Trichiidae. Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and bacteria can bind atmospheric nitrogen or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> or xylan. In a few cases, the plasmodia acquired salt tolerance or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E

25|$|It {{was shown}} later that higher {{absorbency}} of tampons {{was associated with}} an increased risk for TSS, regardless of the chemical composition or the brand of the tampon. The sole exception was Rely, for which the risk for TSS was still higher when corrected for its absorbency. The ability of <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> to filter the S. aureus toxin that causes TSS may account for the increased risk associated with Rely.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS {{cases were}} reported; 38 deaths {{resulted}} from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the Rely tampon created by Procter & Gamble. The Rely tampon was so super-absorbent that one by itself could, in fact, hold one woman's entire menstrual period flow. Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of adhesions {{begins with}} good {{surgical}} technique to minimize {{trauma to the}} tissue and thus reparative responses by the body. Several drugs and substances are {{used to try to}} prevent adhesion formation. Preoperative use of DMSO, a free radical scavenger, potassium penicillin, and flunixin meglumine may be given. The thick intestinal lubricant <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> is often applied to the GI tract intraoperatively, to decrease trauma from handling by the surgeon and provide a physical barrier between the intestine and adjacent intestinal loops or abdominal organs. It has been shown to double the survival rate of horses, and its use is now a standard practice. Hyaluraonan {{can also be used to}} produce a physical barrier. Intraperitoneal unfractionated heparin is sometimes used, since it decreases fibrin formation and thus may decrease fibrinous adhesions. Omentectomy (removal of the omentum) is a quick, simple procedure that also greatly decreases the risk of adhesions, since the omentum is one organ that commonly adheres to the intestines. The abdomen is usually lavaged copiously before the abdomen is sutured closed, and anti-inflammatories are given postoperatively. A laparoscope may be used post-surgery to look for and break down adhesions, however there is risk of additional adhesions forming post-procedure. Encouraging motility post-surgery can also be useful, as it decreases the contact time between tissues. Adhesion-induced colic has a poor prognosis, with a 16% survival rate in one study.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{controversial}} test marketing in Rochester, New York, and Fort Wayne, Indiana, in August 1978, Procter and Gamble introduced superabsorbent Rely tampons to the United States {{market in}} response to women's demands for tampons that could contain an entire menstrual flow without leaking or replacement. Rely used <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> (CMC) and compressed beads of polyester for absorption. This tampon design could absorb nearly 20 times its own weight in fluid. Further, the tampon would [...] "blossom" [...] into a cup shape in the vagina to hold menstrual fluids without leakage.|$|E
2500|$|The ileum is {{the last}} part of the small {{intestine}} that ends in the cecum. Ileal impaction can be caused by obstruction of ingesta. Coastal bermuda hay is associated with impactions in this most aborad (adj. [...] "In a direction away from the mouth".) segment of the small intestine, although it is difficult to separate this risk factor from geographic location, since the southeastern United States has a higher prevalence of ileal impaction and also has regional access to coastal Bermuda hay. Other causes can be obstruction by ascarids (Parascaris equorum), usually occurring at 3–5 months of age right after deworming, and tapeworms (Anoplocephala Perfoliata), which have been associated with up to 81% of ileal impactions (See Ascarids). Horses show intermittent colic, with moderate to severe signs and with time, distended small intestinal loops on rectal. Although most ileal impactions will sometimes pass without intervention, those present for 8–12 hours will cause fluid to back up, leading to gastric reflux, which is seen in approximately 50% of horses that require surgical intervention. Diagnosis is usually made based on clinical signs, presence of reflux, rectal exam, and ultrasound. Often the impaction can not be felt on rectal due to distended small intestinal loops that block the examiner. Those impactions that are unresponsive to medical management, which includes IV fluids and removal of reflux, may be treated using a single injection into the ileum with 1 liter of <b>carboxymethylcellulose,</b> and then massaging the ileum. This allows the impaction to be treated without actually cutting into the ileum. Prognosis for survival is good.|$|E

50|$|Although pushers are {{typically}} used for inorganic products, {{they appear in}} chemical industries such as organic intermediates, plastics, food processing and rocket fuels. Organic intermediates include paraxylene, adipic acid, oxalic acid caprolactam, nitrocellulose, <b>carboxymethylcellulose,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|Hydrocolloidal plaster {{contains}} croscarmellose sodium (an internally cross-linked sodium <b>carboxymethylcellulose,</b> water-soluble polymer), and tackifier resins. Top {{level of}} plaster {{is made of}} elastomer (that ensures that the plaster stays on skin even while moving) and polyurethane film.|$|E
50|$|Other {{materials}} {{are also used}} to make a superabsorbent polymer, such as polyacrylamide copolymer, ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer, cross-linked <b>carboxymethylcellulose,</b> polyvinyl alcohol copolymers, cross-linked polyethylene oxide, and starch grafted copolymer of polyacrylonitrile to name a few. The latter {{is one of the oldest}} SAP forms created.|$|E
50|$|Powdered TAED is {{stabilized}} by granulation {{with the}} aid of the sodium salt of <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> (Na-CMC), which are sometimes additionally coated blue or green. Despite the relatively low solubility of TAED in cool water, (1 g/l at 20 °C), the granulate dissolves rapidly in the washing liquor.|$|E
50|$|The tablets contain lactose monohydrate, low {{substituted}} hydroxypropyl cellulose, povidone, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, and {{titanium dioxide}} {{in addition to}} the API; the oral suspension contains sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> sodium, poloxamer, simethicone, citric acid, sodium benzoate and purified water {{in addition to the}} API.|$|E
5000|$|Hydro-fiber {{dressings}}: these dressings {{are similar}} to alginate dressings {{when it comes to}} absorbing characteristics, but they do not affect hemostasis. They are composed in sheets which contain polymer <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> and can be cut according to wound size and severity. However, when using these dressings, a secondary dressing is almost always required.|$|E
50|$|Croscarmellose is made {{by first}} soaking crude {{cellulose}} in sodium hydroxide, and then reacting the cellulose with sodium monochloroacetate to form sodium <b>carboxymethylcellulose.</b> Excess sodium monochloroacetate slowly hydrolyzes to glycolic acid and the glycolic acid catalyzes the cross-linkage to form croscarmellose sodium.Chemically, croscarmellose sodium is the sodium salt of a cross-linked, partly O-(carboxymethylated) cellulose.|$|E
50|$|Relatively low {{concentrations}} of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> and Polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this disorder. Use of germ-free mice and fecal transplants indicated that such changes in microbiota were necessary and sufficient for both low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Microcrystalline {{cellulose}} is a {{term for}} refined wood pulp and {{is used as a}} texturizer, an anti-caking agent, a fat substitute, an emulsifier, an extender, and a bulking agent in food production. The most common form is used in vitamin supplements or tablets. It is also used in plaque assays for counting viruses, as an alternative to <b>carboxymethylcellulose.</b>|$|E
50|$|A Cellulase Unit is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} for the enzyme Cellulase. One Cellulase Unit (CU) is that activity that will produce a relative fluidity change of one in 5 minutes in a defined <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> substrate under the conditions of an assay (50 deg Celsius, pH 4.5). Cellulases enzymatically split cellulose {{into a variety of}} hexoses, this is called hydrolysis.|$|E
50|$|Frozen {{products}} do {{not require}} any added preservatives because microorganisms do not grow when {{the temperature of the}} food is below -9.5 C, which is sufficient on its own in preventing food spoilage. Long-term preservation of food may call for food storage at even lower temperatures. <b>Carboxymethylcellulose</b> (CMC), a tasteless and odorless stabilizer, is typically added to frozen food because it does not adulterate the quality of the product.|$|E

50|$|One very {{important}} {{effect of the}} attention to TSS in the 1980s was that the FDA implemented regulation of tampons as medical devices and forced manufacturers to standardize tampon absorbencies and include package inserts that warn tampon users of TSS risk. On the market today are tampons made both from synthetic materials, especially rayon, and from cotton only. The key ingredients used in Rely, <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> and polyester, {{were removed from the}} market in 1980.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} an enzyme {{containing}} a domain belonging to this family {{is one of the}} cellulases (celA) from the genome of the thermophilic anaerobic bacterium Caldocellum saccharolyticum. The celA gene product is a polypeptide of 1751 amino acids; this has a multidomain structure comprising two catalytic domains and two cellulose-binding domains, linked by Pro-Thr-rich regions. The N-terminal domain encodes an endoglucanase activity on <b>carboxymethylcellulose,</b> consistent with its similarity to several endo-1, 4-beta-D-glucanase sequences, {{and is a member of}} the glycoside hydrolase family 9. The C-terminal domain belongs to this family shows similarity to a cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum (CelS), which acts synergistically with a second component to hydrolyse crystalline cellulose.|$|E

50|$|Hydrocolloids are {{long-chain}} polymers {{that form}} viscous dispersions and gels if dispersed in water. They {{have a number}} of functional properties in food products including emulsifying, thickening, coating, gelling, and stabilization. The main reason hydrocolloids are used in foods is their capability to modify the rheology of food systems. Hydrocolloids impact viscosity through flow behavior and mechanical solid properties like texture. Some common hydrocolloids that are used to stabilize juice products include gellan, sodium <b>carboxymethylcellulose,</b> xanthan, guar gum, and gum Arabic. The afore mentioned hydrocolloids are generally used in the production of imitation orange juices and are often referred to as synthetic hydrocolloids. Pectin is the hydrocolloid found in natural orange juices.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other tampons, {{which are}} made with cotton and rayon, Rely was unique: it used <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> and {{compressed}} beads of polyester for absorption - the company released the new product after having conducted extensive research on its safety. This tampon design could absorb nearly twenty times its own weight in fluid.Further, the tampon would [...] "blossom" [...] into a cup shape in the vagina in order to hold menstrual fluids. Because of this, its advertising slogan was [...] "It even absorbs the worry!", and claimed it could hold up longer than the leading tampon, because it was made differently. [...] "Remember, They named it Rely" [...] was {{the last line of}} most commercials.|$|E
50|$|Toxic shock {{syndrome}} (TSS) {{is a disease}} caused by strains of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Most people have these bacteria living in their bodies as harmless commensals {{in places such as}} the nose, skin, and vagina. The disease can strike anyone, not only women, but the disease is often associated with tampons.In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS cases were reported; 38 deaths resulted from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the Rely tampon created by Procter & Gamble. The Rely tampon was so super-absorbent that one by itself could, in fact, hold one woman's entire menstrual period flow. Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.|$|E
50|$|Metallurgically the {{concentrate}} {{is likely}} to be relatively complex. It will contain arsenic which could well incur smelter penalties in the early years because of the enargite (Cu3AsS4) {{in the top of the}} deposit. The zinc and antimony are unlikely to be a problem. A more serious problem is the presence of variable quantities of talc which come out with the copper/molybdenum concentrate and tend to depress the copper grade of the concentrate. Sodium <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> (CMC), will suppress the talc in the flotation process but it has the unfortunate side effect of reducing molybdenum recovery. It gives a higher grade copper concentrate but also lower recovery. A high grade copper concentrate is very desirable because smelters generally deduct 1% from the copper content which is a higher percentage of a low grade concentrate than a high one.|$|E
50|$|Water-based {{drilling}} mud most commonly consists of bentonite clay (gel) with additives such as barium sulfate (barite), calcium carbonate (chalk) or hematite. Various thickeners {{are used to}} influence the viscosity of the fluid, e.g. xanthan gum, guar gum, glycol, <b>carboxymethylcellulose,</b> polyanionic cellulose (PAC), or starch. In turn, deflocculants are used to reduce viscosity of clay-based muds; anionic polyelectrolytes (e.g. acrylates, polyphosphates, lignosulfonates (Lig) or tannic acid derivates such as Quebracho) are frequently used. Red mud was the name for a Quebracho-based mixture, named after {{the color of the}} red tannic acid salts; it was commonly used in the 1940s to 1950s, then was made obsolete when lignosulfonates became available. Other components are added to provide various specific functional characteristics as listed above. Some other common additives include lubricants, shale inhibitors, fluid loss additives (to control loss of drilling fluids into permeable formations). A weighting agent such as barite is added to increase the overall density of the drilling fluid so that sufficient bottom hole pressure can be maintained thereby preventing an unwanted (and often dangerous) influx of formation fluids.|$|E
50|$|Lead azide in its pure {{form was}} first {{prepared}} by Theodor Curtius in 1891. Due to sensitivity and stability concerns, the dextrinated form of lead azide (MIL-L-3055) {{was developed in}} the 1920s and 1930s with large scale production by DuPont Co beginning in 1932. Detonator development during World War II resulted in the need for a form of lead azide with a more brisant output. RD-1333 lead azide (MIL-DTL-46225), a version of lead azide with sodium <b>carboxymethylcellulose</b> as a precipitating agent, was developed to meet that need. The Vietnam War saw an accelerated need for lead azide and it was during this time that Special Purpose Lead Azide (MIL-L-14758) was developed; the US government also began stockpiling lead azide in large quantities. After the Vietnam War, the use of lead azide dramatically decreased. Due {{to the size of the}} US stockpile, the manufacture of lead azide in the US ceased completely by the early 1990s. In the 2000s, concerns about the age and stability of stockpiled lead azide led the US government to investigate methods to dispose of its stockpiled lead azide and obtain new manufacturers.|$|E
