25|$|There {{are three}} card form factors: Type I, Type II, and Type III cards. The <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> used {{for each type}} include: Type I and II use a 100-pin {{stacking}} connector, while Type III uses a 124-pin edge connector, i.e. the connector for Types I and II differs from that for Type III, where the connector is {{on the edge of}} a card, like with a SO-DIMM. The additional 24 pins provide the extra signals required to route I/O back through the system connector (audio, AC-Link, LAN, phone-line interface). Type II cards have RJ11 and RJ45 mounted connectors. These cards must be located at the edge of the computer or docking station so that the RJ11 and RJ45 ports can be mounted for external access.|$|E

50|$|Recently, {{electronic}} {{devices such as}} digital cameras, MP3 players, cellular phones, etc., are required with larger capacity of storage to store data. A memory card, such as a Micro SD card, a MMC card, etc., which has larger capacity of storage and a small size, is extensively used to expend the capacity of storage of the {{electronic devices}}. The data transmission between the electronic device and the memory card is through a memory <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> mounted on a PCB of the electronic device for connecting with the memory card. The memory <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> has an insulating housing; the insulating housing includes a receiving cavity for receiving the memory card and a plurality of grooves for respectively receiving a plurality of terminals. One end of the terminal forms a soldering portion for being soldered to the PCB and {{the other end of}} each terminal forms a connecting portion for mating with the memory card. A metallic cover couples with the insulating housing. The memory card is inserted and held in the receiving cavity of the memory <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> for being used in storing various data and taken by the electronic device as a recording medium. If not in use, the inserted memory card can be pulled out from the receiving cavity of the memory <b>card</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E

40|$|Gold, {{nickel and}} copper are usually used in {{connector}} of the smart card. Since Au is expensive and Ni is an allergenic material, simulated (CES) and bibliographical work {{is carried out}} in order to re-place the Au and Ni layer in smart <b>card</b> <b>connectors</b> without sacrificing reliability. During the work, mechanical and electrical properties, corrosion resistance, cost, toxicity and process compatibility of the samples have been taken into consideration. Cu alloying with Zn or Sn, Cr and stainless steel were selected for electrodeposition process. Secondly, carbides (WC, TiC, ZrC), Ti, TiN, borides (TiB 2) and silicide (MoSi 2) are considered as a vapour deposited materials and some Cu alloying with Al, N or Mg also considered via ion implantation processes. But, vapour deposition and im-plantation are high energy processes compared to the electrodeposition process, which is expen-sive. Therefore, electrodeposited materials such as, Cu alloys (Brass or bronze), Cr and stainless steel could be considered as promising candidate to replace the Au and Ni layer in smart <b>card</b> <b>connectors...</b>|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the microprocessor, a digital computer consisted of multiple printed circuit boards in a card-cage case with components connected by a backplane, a set of interconnected sockets. In very old designs, copper wires were the discrete connections between <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> pins, but printed circuit boards soon became the standard practice. The Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals were housed on individual printed circuit boards, which were plugged into the backplane. The ubiquitous S-100 bus of the 1970s is an example of this type of backplane system.|$|E

5000|$|The 401x series {{consisted}} of a large monitor {{sitting on top of}} a wheeled cart. The cart held most of the electronics in a vertical case at the back.

Inside the cart, expansion cards were connected using the [...] "Minibus" [...] system, using a 36-pin <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> with an 8-bit data bus.

50|$|The EX is {{upgradable}} via Tandy PLUS cards, {{and systems}} have bays for three. A PLUS <b>card</b> <b>connector</b> is electrically identical to an ISA slot connector, but uses a Berg-style 62-pin connector {{instead of a}} 62-contact ISA card-edge connector. RAM can be upgraded in the EX—and later the HX—to 640 KB, but requires a PLUS memory expansion card, which also provides DMA. Other PLUS cards could be installed to add serial ports, a 1200-baud modem, a clock/calendar and bus mouse board, or a proprietary Tandy network interface. RadioShack later sold an adapter card allowing installation of a PLUS card into a standard ISA slot, {{such as those in}} the larger Tandy 1000 models.|$|E

40|$|ATLAS LAr {{calorimeter}} {{will perform}} its Phase-I upgrade {{during the long}} shut down (LS 2) in 2018, a new LAr Trigger Digitizer Board (LTDB) will be designed and installed. Several commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multichannel high-speed ADCs have been selected as possible backups of the radiation tolerant ADC ASICs for LTDB. In order to evaluate the radiation tolerance of these back up commercial ADCs, we developed an ADC radiation tolerance characterization system, which includes the ADC boards, data acquisition (DAQ) board, signal generator, external power supplies and a host computer. The ADC board is custom designed for different ADCs, which has ADC driver and clock distribution circuits integrated on board. The Xilinx ZC 706 FPGA development board is used as DAQ board. The data from ADC are routed to the FPGA through the FMC (FPGA Mezzanine <b>Card)</b> <b>connector,</b> de-serialized and monitored by the FPGA, and then transmitted to the host computer through the Gigabit Ethernet. A software program has been developed with Python, and all the commands are sent to the DAQ board through Gigabit Ethernet by this program. Two ADC boards have been designed for the TI ADS 52 J 90 and ADI AD 9249 respectively. TID test of both ADCs have been performed at BNL, and SEE test for ADS 52 J 90 has been performed at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Test results have been analyzed and presented.
