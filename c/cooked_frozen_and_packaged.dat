40|$|Background: Anisakis simplex is {{responsible}} for allergic symptoms after repeated ingestion or contact with parasitized fi sh. Objective: To further analyze type I and IV immunologic mechanisms {{in a group of}} patients with allergic reactions to A simplex, we performed prick-by-prick testing with A simplex larvae and patch tests with live, <b>cooked,</b> or <b>frozen</b> larvae of the A simplex parasite. Methods: Thirty-eight patients underwent skin prick test and radioallergosorbent test with inhalant allergens, foods, and A simplex. Prick-by-prick tests with A simplex and patch tests with live, <b>cooked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> larvae were carried out in 10 patients with evidence of allergy to A simplex. Results: Prick-by-prick testing yielded a positive result in 100 % of cases with live larvae and in 70 % with <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> larvae. Patch tests with A simplex were positive in 8 patients for live larvae, in 3 patients for <b>frozen</b> larvae, <b>and</b> in 1 patient for cooked larvae. Conclusion: Our data emphasize that A simplex {{is responsible}} for both immediate allergic reactions and cell-mediated (delayed) reactions, in particular in subjects with occupational exposure. In addition, our data demonstrate that not only live but also <b>frozen</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> larvae can induce sensitization.

40|$|Dietary {{antioxidants}} (AO) {{are believed}} {{to contribute to the}} overall health benefits seen from fruit and vegetables. Despite increased public awareness of the health benefits of fruit and vegetables through campaigns such as 5 A DAY, consumption remains low. Freezing is usually regarded as destructive to AO and ascorbic acid (AA) and this has fostered a belief that fresh vegetables are nutritionally superior to frozen. In this study, AO and AA activity in commercially bought fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> vegetables were investigated and compared after a typical home cooking practice (boiling). Five different vegetables were examined: carrots, broccoli, green beans, peas and spinach. Each vegetable was bought four times from a selection of local supermarkets and green grocers in the Wirral, United Kingdom to account for variation. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay and 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) assay were utilised to measure total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and AA content respectively. The results showed both fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> vegetables to contain AO and AA after cooking. Cooked fresh spinach and peas contained significantly (p<. 05) higher levels of total AO than <b>cooked</b> <b>frozen</b> spinach <b>and</b> peas. However the remaining fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> vegetables (broccoli, carrots and green beans) did not appear to differ in AO content after cooking. Furthermore {{there was no difference between}} AA content in fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>cooked</b> vegetables. The current study provides evidence against the misconception that fresh is always nutritionally superior to frozen at the point of consumption. Frozen vegetable promotion may be the way forward to increase fruit and vegetable consumption as they are generally nutritionally comparable to fresh but, cheaper, result in less waste, are more convenient <b>and,</b> if <b>packaged</b> correctly, taste the same as fresh. Further work, on a larger scale, is needed, to measure AO and AA content of fresh <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> vegetables bought <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> by the consumer...|$|R

40|$|A irradiaÃÃo representa uma tÃcnica eficiente na conservaÃÃo dos alimentos, e o interesse pela sua utilizaÃÃo tem crescido nos Ãltimos anos, pois alÃm de melhorar a qualidade microbiolÃgica, produz mÃnimas alteraÃÃes nos constituintes dos alimentos. Sendo assim, este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar o efeito da radiaÃÃo gama (60 Co), aplicada ao camarÃo congelado e embalado, sobre a microbiota, a estabilidade quÃmica de alguns componentes, bem como sobre algumas propriedades sensoriais da carne. Foram avaliadas caudas de camarÃes da espÃcie Penaeus vannamei, provenientes da carcinicultura local. O estudo foi dividido em duas etapas, sendo a primeira destinada a verificar o efeito da radiaÃÃo gama, aplicada nas doses de 0, 2, 4 e 6 kGy, sobre a populaÃÃo de duas bactÃrias patogÃnicas inoculadas no camarÃo: Vibrio cholerae O 1 e Salmonella enteritidis. Este estudo utilizou um delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 3, em que os fatores avaliados foram as quatro doses de irradiaÃÃo e trÃs modalidades de inoculaÃÃo (com V. cholerae O 1, com S. enteritidis e sem inoculaÃÃo de microrganismos). JÃ na segunda etapa foi usado um delineamento experimental inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 4 x 5, sendo quatro doses (0, 2, 4 e 6 kGy) de irradiaÃÃo e cinco repetiÃÃes, para as anÃlises de substÃncias reativas ao Ãcido tiobarbitÃrico (TBARS), cor e textura instrumental. Para a anÃlise sensorial foi utilizado um delineamento de blocos completos balanceados, onde o provador foi considerado como bloco. Houve uma reduÃÃo significativa (p 0, 05) com as doses de irradiaÃÃo estudadas. Com relaÃÃo as caracterÃsticas sensoriais, a aceitaÃÃo global apresentou uma reduÃÃo significativa (p 0, 05). Desta forma, o tratamento de irradiaÃÃo com atÃ 6 kGy mostra-se efetivo na reduÃÃo de microrganismos patogÃnicos, com leves efeitos sobre as caracterÃsticas sensoriais da carne, quando aplicado sobre o camarÃo congelado e embalado. Irradiation {{represents an}} efficient technique to extend shelf life of several foods {{and the interest}} in using this technology has been growing {{in the last years}} because besides improving food safety it produces minimal alterations in the food constituents. Thus, this study investigated the effect of ionizing irradiation (60 Co) of <b>frozen</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaged</b> shrimp on microorganisms as well as on some chemical and sensory characteristics of the product. Cultivated shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) from local farms processed into shrimp tails were <b>packaged,</b> <b>frozen,</b> irradiated <b>and</b> analyzed. The study was divided in two stages. The first stage was intended to verify the effect of the gamma radiation on the population of inoculated Vibrio cholerae O 1 and Salmonella enteritidis bacteria. It used a complete randomized factorial (4 x 3) design with four irradiation doses (0, 2, 4 and 6 kGy) and three inoculation modalities (one with V. cholerae O 1, one with S. enteritidis and one without microorganisms). The second stage aiming to verify the effect of the gamma irradiation on the chemical stability of lipids, color and instrumental texture of shrimp followed a complete randomized factorial (4 x 5) design with four irradiation doses (0, 2, 4, and 6 kGy) and five replicates. Sensorial analysis followed a complete randomized factorial of balanced complete blocks, where the panelist was considered as block. The experimental units (UE) from the first stage were analyzed for V. cholerae O 1 and S. enteritidis survival after the irradiation procedure, while those from the second stage were analyzed for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), instrumental color and texture and sensory evaluation of the meat. As irradiating dose increased a significant (p 0. 05). Therefore, irradiation treatment in doses up to 6 kGy on <b>frozen</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaged</b> shrimp tails significantly reduces V. cholerae O 1 and S. enteritidis counts with minor effects on sensory characteristics in cooked shrimp...|$|R

40|$|Low-temperature {{blanching}} (LTB) {{of potatoes}} (cv. Kennebec), both {{without further processing}} and prior to cooking or freezing + cooking, significantly increased firmness retention as measured from compression parameters. The increase in firmness with respect to that of unblanched potatoes diminished in the order: blanched at 60 °C for 60 min and cooked > blanched at 60 °C for 60 min <b>frozen</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> > blanched at 60 °C for 60 min. Potato tubers were kept in refrigerated storage, and firmness, PME activity and dry matter (DM) content were periodically sampled {{over a period of}} 80 days. In the early stages of storage, PME activity lost 40 % of its original value after 60 min at 60 °C, indicating that the contribution of starch breakdown products to the firmness of <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>cooked</b> potatoes predominated over the effect of enzyme activity. With increasing time in storage, PME activity measured in the fresh tissue increased by 95 % of its original value after 35 days; this resulted in changes in the pectic polymers which made for a firmer texture and different PME behaviour versus LTB temperature and time. A central composite rotatable design was used to study the effects of variation in levels of temperature (52. 93 - 67. 07 °C) and time (31. 72 - 88. 28 min) on compression parameters and PME activity. Stationary points showing maximum mechanical resistance had critical temperatures and times in the ranges of temperature (58 - 60 °C) and time (66 - 75 min) used for each independent variable. Results show a high correlation between PME activity and tissue firmness, suggesting that the contribution of the changes in the composition of the cell wall to the firmness of <b>frozen</b> <b>cooked</b> potatoes increased with increasing time in storage and reached a maximum in the intermediate stages of storage (35 days). Engineering stress (σu) proved to be the most appropriate compression parameter for detecting the firming effect that the PME activity produced on the frozen-cooked potato tissues as a consequence of LTB under these conditions. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

Method:Ten cases of S. Typhimurium phage type (PT) 12 infection were notified in South Australia in a four-week period from 7 May 1998. Nine cases and 27 controls were included in a case control study {{to test the hypothesis}} that illness was associated with the consumption of chicken nuggets. Results: A significant association between illness and the consumption of one brand of chicken nuggets was determined, odds ratio undefined (95 % CI undefined; p= undefined). Nine of nine cases and one of 27 controls reported eating these chicken nuggets. S. Typhimurium PT 12 was isolated from an opened sample of this particular brand of nuggets which had been retrieved from the home of one case. Conclusions and implications: The implicated nuggets were essentially a raw product which had been 'flash fried' in contrast with other brands which were fully cooked. The investigation highlighted issues of inadequate labelling and consumer responses to labelling information which affect food safety. A media release to highlight to the consumer the need to <b>cook</b> <b>frozen</b> food properly <b>and</b> a voluntary recall of the 'flash fried' product was instigated {{as a result of these}} conclusions. Further action is needed to eliminate the potential hazard that consumers will perceive and handle 'flash fried' nuggets as if they are a cooked chicken product.
