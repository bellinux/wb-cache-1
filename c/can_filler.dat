5000|$|The {{regulation}} {{states that}} the can manufacturer is responsible for providing the <b>can</b> <b>filler</b> with guidelines and specifications for the can seam: [...] "Can seam guidelines (specifications) are provided to the low acid canned food manufacturer by the supplier of the container and end being used. The guidelines detail the measurements, in thousands of an inch, of each attribute of the double seam for both {{the first and second}} seaming operations. They also provide a set-up aim or ideal starting dimensions for the set up of the seamer. The operating limits set the range for good practice." [...] While specifying these guidelines is important, the plant is responsible for the double seam quality: [...] "It is extremely important to understand that seam guidelines by themselves cannot be used for determining the quality of a double seam. The seam guidelines are to be used in setting up the double seams initially and maintaining seam integrity during production. Final acceptability of the double seam should be based on total evaluation of the seam by a qualified person and not on dimensions alone. Good seaming practice requires constant visual examination, frequently scheduled tear-down evaluation, machine maintenance, and immediate correction of unacceptable conditions." [...] The regulation also states that if the double seams do not meet the guidelines, the <b>can</b> <b>filler</b> plant [...] "must know what steps to take to correct the condition".|$|E

The presence of <b>fillers</b> <b>can</b> enhance simultaneous lineup performance, but the presence of <b>fillers</b> <b>can</b> harm sequential lineup performance.|$|R

5000|$|Non-surgical {{rhinoplasty}} is {{a medical}} procedure in which injectable fillers, most commonly hyaluronic acid ones like Restylane and Juvederm or calcium hydroxyapatite (Radiesse), are used to alter and shape a person's nose without invasive surgery. The procedure fills in depressed areas on the nose, lifting {{the angle of the}} tip or smoothing the appearance of bumps on the bridge. Non surgical rhinoplasty is an augmentation procedure, so it cannot reduce the size of someone's nose. It is a cosmetic procedure.

40|$|Concrete with a {{low carbon}} dioxide {{footprint}} (LCDF) contains less cementitious materials (CM) than ordinary concrete and hence less cementitious paste. Besides the reduced carbon dioxide footprint, LCDF concrete offers other advantages such as reduced cost as well as improved dimensional stability due to reduced hydration heat, creep and shrinkage. Nevertheless, decreasing the quantity of CM has {{a negative impact on}} concrete workability. To restore workability, multi-sized fillers are advocated to replace aggregates and CM. Generally, <b>fillers</b> <b>can</b> improve the packing density of concrete due to the filling effect and thus more excess water or paste is available to facilitate spread and flow rate. Two types of fillers were examined in this study – limestone with particles smaller than 75 μm and foundry sand with particles of 75 – 400 μm. The particles of these two fillers are respectively similar and larger in size when compared with cement. Concrete mixes with no fillers and with mono- or multi-sized fillers were prepared and tested for flowability and strength. The results indicate that more superplasticiser is needed to achieve the same flowability when fillers are added. It was also found that, at the same water/CM ratio, <b>fillers</b> <b>can</b> improve concrete strength, and the use of multi-sized <b>fillers</b> <b>can</b> simultaneously improve the flowability and segregation resistance of concrete...|$|R

In addition to particle composition, we could confirm the particle size through PSD measurement, as demonstrated in Fig.  2 c.

30|$|Table  3 {{reveals that}} PPO and PBI have been {{utilised}} in {{several types of}} research as a polymer matrix for membrane preparation. The gas transport properties of the neat membranes are in accordance {{with those of other}} works. Upon addition of any kind of filler, different effects on the separation performance can be observed. In general, the addition of silica, ZIF- 8, SBA- 15, and non-modified or modified TiNTs, respectively, to PPO or PBI cause an increase in gas selectivities. As far as permeabilities are concerned, they either increased or decreased. This can be explained by good adhesion of the polymer chains {{on the surface of the}} filler. Poor adhesion of the polymer onto the <b>filler</b> <b>can</b> cause voids between the interface of polymer chains and fillers, which leads to an increase in permeability, whereas selectivity remains almost the same. In conclusion, the employment of <b>fillers</b> <b>can</b> result in high selective membranes with superb permeation rates depending on the choice of polymer and filler.|$|R
