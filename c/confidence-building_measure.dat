The EU-3 in return explicitly agreed to recognize Iran's nuclear rights and to discuss ways Iran could provide [...] "satisfactory assurances" [...] regarding its nuclear power program, after which Iran would gain easier access to modern technology. Iran signed an Additional Protocol on 18 December 2003, and agreed to act as if the protocol were in force, making the required reports to the IAEA and allowing the required access by IAEA inspectors, pending Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol.|$|E

The measure was said at the time to be a voluntary, <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measure,</b> to continue for some reasonable period of time (six months being mentioned as a reference) as negotiations with the EU-3 continued. On 24 November, Iran sought to amend {{the terms of}} its agreement with the EU to exclude a handful of the equipment from this deal for research work. This request was dropped four days later.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Nicaragua plays {{an essential role}} in the stability and security of the Central American sub region. The de-stabilizing influence of Sandinista policies in the 1980 s gave way to the possibility of a cooperative security community in the 1990 s. However, border disputes and increased arms and drug trafficking have recently threatened the trend toward increased stability and sub regional security. Sub regional <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> adopted immediately following the election of Violeta Chamorro have collapsed in the last two years. This collapse of <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> has led to increased tensions between Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica. The U. S should promote Nicaraguan participation in regional <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> in order to reduce these tensions. In addition, the relationship between the U. S. and Nicaragua is still strained from the policies of the Sandinista and Reagan administrations. Although relations have been normalized between the two countries, steps should be taken to expand the current passive relationship into a more active one. <b>Confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> between the U. S. and Nicaragua will help to alleviate some of the strain between the two countries. This thesis recommends U. S. involvement and participation in re-establishing <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> in the sub region. A perceived gap in U. S. -Nicaraguan civilian engagement could be filled through the implementation of a comprehensive military engagement plan. The use of <b>confidence-building</b> <b>measures</b> in military engagement will foster stability and security in the sub region and strengthen U. S. -Nicaraguan relations.
