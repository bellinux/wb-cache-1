40|$|Reverse thrust {{operations}} {{of a model}} scale Contra-Rotating Open Rotor design were numerically modelled to produce individual rotor thrust and torque results comparable to experimental measurements. The aims of this research were to {{develop an understanding of}} the performance and aerodynamics of open rotors during thrust reversal operations and to establish whether numerical modelling with a CFD code {{can be used as a}} prediction tool given the highly complex flowfield. A methodology was developed from single rotor simulations initially before building a 3 D‘frozen rotor’ steady-state approach to model <b>contra-rotating</b> <b>blade</b> rows in reverse thrust settings. Two different blade pitch combinations were investigated (β 1, 2 =+ 30 °,- 10 ° and β 1, 2 =- 10 °,- 20 °). Thrust and torque results compared well to the experimental data and the effects of varying operating parameters, such as rpm and Mach number, were reproduced and in good agreement with the observed experimental behaviour. The main flow feature seen in all the reverse thrust cases modelled, both single rotor and CROR, is a large area of recirculation immediately downstream of the negative pitch rotor(s). This is a result of a large relative pressure drop region generated by the suction surfaces of the negative pitch blades. An initial 3 D unsteady sliding-mesh calculation was performed for one CROR reverse thrust case. The thrust and torque values were in poor agreement with experimental values and the disadvantages relating to time costs and required computational resources for this technique were illustrated. However, the results did yield a nominal unsteady variation of thrust and torque due to rotor phase position. Overall the work shows that it may be possible to develop a CROR reverse thrust prediction tool of beneficial quality using CFD models. The research also shows that the frozen rotor approach can be adopted without undermining the fidelity of the results...|$|E

40|$|<b>Contra-rotating</b> rotor <b>blade</b> is {{a system}} that can deliver poised torque {{condition}} for any rotorcraft without the manifestation of tail rotor contrivance. This system not only aids to sustain the stability of the aircraft, but also surges the aircraft’s overall efficiency discrete to the conventional single rotor system. Contra-rotation system is capable of operating in reduced size and henceforth is effusively researched and applied to the unmanned micro aerial vehicle (MAV) technology. This study intended to reconnoiter the effect of varying the axial spacing between the forward rotor and the aft rotor of an archetypal <b>contra-rotating</b> rotor <b>blade</b> system. The quantitative data has espoused that the variation of axial spacing between the forward and aft rotor affected the total efficiency of the <b>contra-rotating</b> rotor <b>blade</b> system. Furthermore, at larger spacing, the effects were more substantial contributing adversely to the overall efficiency of the system...|$|R
40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in contra-rotating open rotor technology for aircraft propulsion application has prompted {{the development of}} advanced diagnostic tools for better design and improved acoustical performance. In particular, the determination of tonal and broadband components of open rotor acoustic spectra is essential for properly assessing the noise control parameters and also for validating the open rotor noise simulation codes. The technique of phase averaging has been employed to separate the tone and broadband components from a single rotor, but this method does not work for the two-shaft contra-rotating open rotor. A new signal processing technique was recently developed to process the contra-rotating open rotor acoustic data. The technique was first tested using acoustic data taken of a hobby aircraft open rotor propeller, and reported previously. The intent of the present work is to verify and validate {{the applicability of the}} new technique to a realistic one-fifth scale open rotor model which has 12 forward and 10 aft <b>contra-rotating</b> <b>blades</b> operating at realistic forward flight Mach numbers and tip speeds. The results and discussions of that study are presented in this paper...|$|R

Tail section has {{vertical and horizontal}} stabilizer fins in cross. Each fin has a controlling rudder in aft. Horizontal fins and rudders or elevators have wide span in longitudinal direction and work proportionally, while vertical fins are small, and rudders have very short span.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} was a tapered box-girder fabricated from {{welded steel}} tubes, the pilot's seat being under the wings leading edge {{with the engine}} behind him. This was a 50 hp Metallurgique which drove the aircraft's most novel feature, a pair of <b>contra-rotating</b> two <b>bladed</b> propellers driven by a patented 3:1 reduction gearbox. The wings had ash spars and spruce ribs, with Voisin-style [...] "side-curtains" [...] between {{the ends of the}} wings. Lateral control was by means of four small ailerons fitted to the trailing edges of both wings, a feature not found on Voisin's aircraft. The fabric-covered wood tail assembly was carried on steel booms. Steel tube was also used for the interplane struts, these being of a special streamlined section.|$|R

An incorrect, though similar, torpedo schematic had by mistake been shown at the televised RIG briefing for comparison with the recovered parts.|$|R
50|$|Early in the {{development}} the Navy requested better altitude performance and, in view of unsatisfactory progress in {{the development}} of the XH-2470 engine, Curtiss adapted the design of the aircraft around the new turbocharged Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone air-cooled radial engine. The aircraft equipped with this eighteen-cylinder twin-row radial air-cooled engine and three <b>bladed</b> <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers was designated the XF14C-2. The XF14C-1 was canceled. Also, looking at the problems of operation at altitudes of about 40,000 feet (12,000 m), the Navy also initiated work on a third version with a pressurized cockpit designated the XF14C-3.|$|R
40|$|Small-sized {{axial fans}} {{are used as}} air coolers for {{electric}} equipment. There is a strong demand for higher power of fans according to the increase of quantity of heat from electric devices. Therefore, higher rotational speed design is conducted, although, it causes {{the deterioration of the}} efficiency and the increase of noise. Then, the adoption of contra-rotating rotors for small-sized fans is proposed for the improvement of the performance. In the case of <b>contra-rotating</b> rotors, <b>blade</b> row distance between the front and the rear rotors influences on the performance and the noise. Therefore, it is important to clarify the optimum blade row distance between front and rear rotors. The performance curves of the contra-rotating small-sized axial fan under the condition of different blade row distances are shown and the blade row interaction between the front and the rear rotors are discussed by the numerical results. Furthermore, the optimum blade row distance of the contra-rotating small-sized axial fan is considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{strategy}} for <b>Contra-Rotating</b> Open Rotors <b>blades</b> design is presented. It {{is based on}} several analytical or CFD tools with increasing levels of accuracy. A preliminary design is made with a lifting-line code. These first geometries are then validated and improved with more advanced CFD methods. Steady CFD computations on a blade passage using the mixing-plane technique permit to perform an accurate sensitivity analysis of the main blade geometrical parameters. The key parameters driving the propulsion efficiency are thus identified. Modeling rotor-rotor interactions require more costly unsteady simulations such as chorochronic computations on a blade passage, or chimera/sliding-mesh techniques on the full model for assessing even the installation effects. These methods are performed {{at the end of}} the process to validate the robustness of advanced designs to those interactions. The relevance of this strategy is discussed highlighting the results and limitations...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{conducted}} on axial flow hydraulic turbine {{by comparing the}} performance of turbines which use a single rotor and two rotors that rotate in opposite (contra-rotating). Both turbines are designed to generate energy utilizing a very low head water flow. Single rotor turbine consists of one row of guide vane and one row of rotor <b>blade.</b> <b>Contra-rotating</b> rotor turbine consists of one row of guide vane and two rows of rotor blade, which is the front rotor blade {{also serves as a}} guide vane for the rear rotor. Both of turbines are designed for the same flow and operating conditions. The results of numerical studies show that both of turbines can be applied with a fairly high efficiency, however the single rotor turbine is significantly higher. Especially for contra-rotating turbine, the total power that generated at the same operating conditions will increase because powers are resulted from both of rotors, but the effective head required will be significantly increase compare to the single-rotor turbine. These results may be used as a reference in the development of axial flow hydraulic turbine for very low head sites to expand the applications...|$|R
50|$|The Seafire II {{outperformed}} the A6M5 Zero at low altitudes {{when the}} two types were tested against each other. Contemporary Allied aircraft which had been specifically designed for carrier use, such as the Grumman F6F Hellcat and the Vought F4U Corsair, were considerably larger, more robust and generally more powerful. The more powerful Seafire III enjoyed better climb rates and acceleration than these other fighters. Late-war Seafire models equipped with Griffon engines enjoyed a considerable increase of performance compared to their Merlin-engined predecessors. The Griffon powered Seafires had some serious faults; the main problem {{was a result of}} the increased power yielded by the Griffon engine; the increase in torque meant the pilot had to continuously correct the flight of the aircraft (to prevent the frame of the aircraft rotating in the other direction to that of the propeller). This was a huge problem when attempting to take off and land from an aircraft carrier. The torque also affected the lift of the right wing (the Griffon engines rotated anti-clockwise) which would lose lift and even stall at reasonable speeds. The increased weight of the engine meant that the take-off had to be longer and proved very dangerous from most British carriers. The increased weight of the engine further affected the centre of gravity that Mitchell had concentrated on so carefully in the original Spitfire. As a result, the handling of the aircraft suffered. Eventually most of these problems were fixed in Seafire 47 when the 6 <b>bladed</b> <b>contra-rotating</b> propeller was adopted.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 May 2010, a South Korean-led {{international}} commission {{investigating the}} sinking of Cheonan presented its findings, stating that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo attack.The torpedo parts recovered {{at the site of}} the explosion by a dredging ship on 15 May, which include 5x5 <b>bladed</b> <b>contra-rotating</b> propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, were claimed to perfectly match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes. The markings in Hangul, which read [...] "1번" [...] (or No. 1 in English), found inside the end of the propulsion section were said to have been consistent with markings on a previously obtained North Korean torpedo. However, some (The Hankyoreh) have pointed out without the proper reason that in the North, [...] "호" [...] (pronounced [...] "ho") is most often used rather than [...] "번"; and that a North Korean torpedo found seven years ago bears the marking [...] "4호". Russian and Chinese torpedoes are marked in their respective languages. The CHT-02D torpedo manufactured by North Korea utilizes acoustic/wake homing and passive acoustic tracking methods. However, an expert at a South Korean missile manufacturer disagreed with the idea that the submarine alleged by ROK authorities to have shot the torpedo actually has the capability: [...] "Sango class submarines are known to be used by North Korean commandos in infiltrating areas or laying mines, but they apparently do not have an advanced system to guide homing weapons. If a smaller class submarine was involved, there is a bigger question mark." ...|$|R
