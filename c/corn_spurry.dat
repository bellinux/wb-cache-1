5000|$|The fungus {{does not}} infect tomato, apple, potato, turnip, cauliflower, chickweed, groundsel, or <b>corn</b> <b>spurry.</b> [...] In 1958, it was {{reported}} that there was a race of P. fragariae var. fragariae that infected loganberries. [...] Other plants have been reported to be susceptible to P. fragariae, and they include some Potentialla species, rosaceous plants, and Rubus parviflorus. [...] It is the P. fragariae var. fragariae and P. fragariae var. rubi that attract the most attention and are the most heavily researched. The Phytophthora pathogens in strawberry and raspberry are similar in many ways morphologically, culturally, and molecularly, but are different in growth. Nonetheless, they are both variations of the pathogen P. fragariae. Recent research, however, suggests that these two variations may not have been as similar as once perceived. A study done to genetically map these pathogens revealed such a difference in the genome of these two variations, they likely could be considered two completely different species. This research has yet to make any changes to the present day cytology and taxonomy of this pathogen. [...] There are different races of P. fragariae, that occur within each form (e.g. var. fragariae, var. rubi) that attack only certain host plant cultivars. Depending on the location, there are anywhere from 5 to 18 different races that have been found to infect strawberries. However, there is not currently an international system to classify the differences of these races.|$|E
40|$|Cover crops may difffer in the {{way they}} affect {{rhizosphere}} microbiota nutrient dynamics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal cover crops on soil phosphatase activity and its persistence in subsequent crops. A three-year experiment was carried out with a Typic Quartzipsamment. Treatments were winter species, either mycorrhizal black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) or the non-mycorrhizal species oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiferus Metzg) and <b>corn</b> <b>spurry</b> (Spergula arvensis L.). The control treatment consisted of resident vegetation (fallow in the winter season). In the summer, a mixture of pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum L.) with sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) or with soybean (Glycine max L.) was sown in all plots. Soil cores (0 - 10 cm) and root samples were collected in six growing seasons (winter and summer of each year). Microbial biomass P was determined by the fumigation-extraction method and phosphatase activity using p-nitrophenyl-phosphate as enzyme substrate. During the flowering stage of the winter cover crops, acid phosphatase activity was 30 - 35 % higher in soils with the non-mycorrhizal species oilseed radish, than in the control plots, regardless of the amount of P immobilized in microbial biomass. The values of enzyme activity were intermediate in the plots with <b>corn</b> <b>spurry</b> and black oat. Alkaline phosphatase activity was 10 -fold lower and less sensitive to the treatments, despite the significant relationship between the two phosphatase activities. The effect of plant species on the soil enzyme profile continued in the subsequent periods, during the growth of mycorrhizal summer crops, after completion of the life cycle of the cover crops...|$|E

Ao mesmo tempo foi avaliada a seletividade que estes herbicidas apresentam às culturas de trigo (Triticum aestivum L.), cevada (Hordeum vulgare L.) e centeio (Secale cereale L.). Os resultados da avaliação visual de fitotoxicidade mostra ram que o dicamba causou o maior grau de injúria para as três culturas. Cevada mostrou ser a cultura mais sensível ao dicamba na fase inicial. Trigo, cevada e centeio foram tolerantes ao diclofop. A mistura diclofop + (2, 4 D + dicamba) não controlou o azevém nas três culturas. Esta mistura apresentou ainda redução no controle de gorga, nas culturas de cevada e centeio. Dicamba ocasionou redução no rendimento de grãos das culturas, mostrando ser pouco seletivo na dose testada. Centeio sofreu uma redução no rendimento de grãos causada por diclofop, enquanto que a mistura diclofop + (2, 4 D + dicamba) foi seletiva para todas as culturas. Three field {{experiments}} were carried out, in 1980, at the National Wheat Research Center/ EMBRAPA, Passo Fundo, RS. They aimed at testnig {{the responses of}} herbicides diclofop, dicamba, the association 2, 4 D with dicamba, and the mixture diclofop + (2, 4 D + dicamba) in the control of rye grass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and <b>corn</b> <b>spurry</b> (Spergula arvensis L.). Simultaneously, the selectivity of these herbicides to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and rye (Secale cereale L.) was evaluated. The results of visual evaluation of phytotoxicity showed that dicamba caused the greatest degree of injury to the three crops studied. Barley was the most sensitive crop to dicamba in the initial growth stage. Wheat, barley, and rye were tolerant to diclofop. Mixture diclofop + (2, 4 D + dicamba) provided no control of rye grass in the three crops. Additionally, this mixture showed {{a reduction in the}} control of <b>corn</b> <b>spurry</b> in barley and rye crops. Dicamba caused reduction in grain yield of the three crops, showing to be little selective at the tested dosage. Rye suffered a reduction in grain yield caused by diclofop, while the mixture diclofop + (2, 4 D + dicamba) was selective to all crops studied...|$|E
40|$|At the {{recommended}} rates (1. 0 lb/A for trifluralin, ethalfluralin, EL 5261; 0. 75 lb/A for dinitramine; 1. 2 lb/A for nitrofen), {{none of the}} herbicides we evaluated in these studies reduced rapeseed stands, yields, or test weights. However, at higher rates (1. 5, 3. 0 lb A), dinitramine reduced rapeseed stands, but this {{did not result in}} decreased yields. None of the other herbicides reduced rapeseed stand, yield, or test weights when applied at up to four times {{the recommended}} rate. No trifluralin residues were detected in rapeseed whole-plant or seed samples. All of the herbicides provided adequate control of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.). <b>Corn</b> <b>spurry</b> (Spergula arvensis L.) was controlled by trifluralin. ethalfluralin. EL- 5261, and nitrofen. All of the herbicides except nitrofen controlled chickweed [Stellaria media (L.) Cyrillo]. [...] In 1979, 51 per cent of the trifluralin applied remained {{at the end of the}} growing season in one study while 26 per cent remained in another study. The rate of degradation at three sites in 1979 were as follows (greatest to least); Delta Junction, Matanuska Valley, Fairbanks. Degradation rates of trifluralin were not significantly different in three soil types or at two different application rates. Trifluralin showed no signs of leaching through the soil profile. In 1981, 25 per cent of the trifluralin, 8 per cent of the ethalfluralin, and 24 per cent of the EL- 5261 applied remained at the end of the growing season. Despite the relatively long persistence of these preplant, incorporated herbicides, yields and test weights of barley planted in succeeding years were not reduced. A benefit of these persistent residues was control of broadleaf weeds in the succeeding barley crop...|$|E
