50|$|For each commodity, {{the most}} valid (most {{actively}} traded from the committee point of view) expiration is {{chosen to be}} included into the RICI calculation. The index is rolled {{at the end of}} each <b>month</b> to <b>contracts</b> that are expected to be most active during the next month. Generally, if the next calendar month of a futures contract includes a first notice day, a delivery day or historical evidence that liquidity migrates to a next <b>contract</b> <b>month</b> during this period, then the next <b>contract</b> <b>month</b> is intended to be applied to calculate the index - taking legal constraints into account.|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsDaniel M. O'BrienThe Chicago wheat futures {{contract}} has received attention {{in recent years}} regarding non-convergence with SRW wheat cash prices. In 2009 the CME Group announced their decision to implement a market based mechanism to set daily storage rates at registered delivery locations for the Chicago wheat contract. The new market based mechanism is a variable storage rate (VSR) that monitors Chicago wheat futures spreads relative to financial full carry. The running average of the futures spread {{at the end of}} the contract observation period determines future changes to existing storage rates. The objective of this study is to determine whether or not the adoption of VSR mechanisms has had an impact on SRW wheat basis convergence in the Toledo, OH switching district. The Chicago wheat <b>contract</b> <b>months</b> that were studied using OLS regression models include July 2010, September 2010, December 2010, and March 2011. A final OLS regression model examining the cumulative data collected from these four <b>contract</b> <b>months</b> concludes the research. The explanatory variables used to study SRW wheat basis convergence in Toledo includes days to delivery, all wheat ending stocks as a percentage of use for the United States, and VSR. In two of the regression models for the <b>contract</b> <b>months</b> studied VSR found to have a statistically significant impact, i. e., the December 2010 and March 2011 models. In the cumulative regression model covering all four wheat <b>contract</b> <b>months</b> VSR was also found to have a statistically significant impact on SRW wheat basis convergence. The regression models in this analysis appear to contain some degree of multicollinearity, a statistical condition in which the explanatory variables tend to move collinearly or “together” with each other. Multicollinearity oftentimes can result in deceptively high and inconsistent statistical results in econometric models...|$|R

40|$|The short- and long-run {{daily price}} {{relationships}} between cash and futures markets for live hogs were examined over the 1975 - 89 period. Price discovery generally originates in the futures market with about 65 % {{of new information}} being passed from the futures to the cash market. However, at times, especially during large price moves that are not necessarily anticipated in the futures market, the cash market price relies less on the futures market. The very short-term basis for hogs is fairly stable, with approximately 85 % of yesterday's nearby-basis persisting today. Generally, little can be gained by speculating on basis from day to day. The farther from futures contract delivery they are, the more the futures and cash price diverge from each other, reflecting {{the fact that they}} represent different markets. Hedgers liquidating futures positions prior to the <b>contract</b> delivery <b>month</b> face larger basis risk than those liquidating positions in the <b>contract</b> <b>month...</b>|$|R
