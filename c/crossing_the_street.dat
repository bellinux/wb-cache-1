5|$|Avenged is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a melodrama focusing on John Warren, a young clerk, who is struck by a taxi cab while <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The chauffeur who struck him, Allen, decides to flee as a crowd gathers around John. Allen ditches his taxi on a country road and takes a train, successfully escaping. Six years later, the poor, ill and crippled John has become a timekeeper in a mining town. John's wife, who has taken care of him, sickens and dies. Allen, unaware of John's identity, attempts to comfort him and listens to John's story. After learning Allen wrecked his life, John attempts to shoot him, but the specter of his wife stays his hand. John goes to her grave, forgives Allen, and dies. No cast or production credits are known for this film. Released on October 7, 1910, the film was a distinct departure from other Thanhouser releases and was sharply criticized by reviewers. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
25|$|In 1847, the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad (C) {{announced}} it would build its tracks {{through the heart of}} Newburgh Township. The route opened in 1851. The railroad entered the township near E. 69th Street and Central Avenue, heading southeast to Holton Avenue. The tracks then ran south to the intersection of Harvard and Broadway Avenues, at which point they followed Broadway (<b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> three times) until leaving the township. The railroad greatly improved the economic and social life of Newburgh.|$|E

25|$|Later decisors {{like the}} Chazon Ish (twentieth century) {{fundamentally}} {{agree with this}} ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use {{of a line of}} longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in Changchun, China. If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (tafel) to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. Japan, New Zealand and Tasmania are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and Indonesia would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.|$|E

The diner door opens with a bell ringing, Tony looks up and the show smash cuts to black and after a few seconds the credits roll in silence.|$|E
500|$|In Westminster Corporation v. London and North Western Railway Co. (1905), the {{appellant}} had a statutory {{power to}} provide public sanitary conveniences and to construct these in, on, or under any road. It built an underground convenience on Parliament Street near Bridge Street in London {{with access to}} the pavement {{on either side of the}} street. London and North Western Railway Company, which owned property fronting Parliament Street and Bridge Street, objected to the construction. Lord Macnaghten considered whether the Corporation had constructed the subway [...] "as a means of <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> under colour and pretence of providing public conveniences which were not really wanted at that particular place", which would not have been authorized by statute. He concluded that the Corporation's primary object had been to construct the public conveniences, together with proper means of approaching and exiting from them. Thus, the scheme was not unlawful.|$|E

500|$|As they walk, September reminds Walter of {{the damage}} {{he did when he}} brought Peter from the {{parallel}} universe. September recounts the events of one such chain: in the prime universe, three months after Walter's crossing, Peter (Joshua Jackson) captured a firefly which set into motion a chain of events that eventually led to the death of a pedestrian in a car accident. September mysteriously departs when Walter answers a telephone call, but not before leaving him with a message: [...] "give him the keys and save the girl." [...] Later, Walter returns Roscoe to the nursing home. Roscoe thanks him and explains that the recent events reminded him of the last phone call he had with his son, where Bobby said he had dreamed of meeting Roscoe in a nursing home in the future. Roscoe is remorseful that Bobby died shortly after that call when a car struck him while <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> which led to the breakup of the band. Walter realizes that Roscoe's son was the pedestrian that was previously alluded to by September.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E

5000|$|There is no German {{word for}} jaywalking. In general, {{pedestrians}} {{are allowed to}} <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> everywhere. <b>The</b> {{first and most important}} paragraph of the StVO §1 is not to endanger anybody. Car drivers must always be prepared to brake for pedestrians, especially for children and elderly people. That is the first thing you learn in the driving education. On the other hand, German pedestrians, according to the German Road Traffic Act (Straßenverkehrsordnung) [...] (VwV), have to watch the vehicular traffic carefully and cross a street quickly and on the shortest way across the driving lanes. If the situation on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> requires, pedestrians are only allowed to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at intersections or within the markings of traffic signals or crosswalks. Pedestrians who <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at intersections or crossings have to use existing traffic signals or crosswalks. If one wants to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> outside <b>the</b> markings of traffic lights or crosswalks, one must carefully convince one's self before and during <b>the</b> <b>crossing</b> that <b>the</b> road is clear and wait before crossing if a vehicle approaches. A pedestrian must not interrupt the flowing traffic. [...] Although 15 meters is not considered [...] "at" [...] the crosswalk or traffic light (KG Berlin VR 78 450), pedestrians must not <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> 30 meter (BGH VRS 26 327) near a crosswalk and 40 meter (BGH NJW 00 3069: 39-43m; KG Berlin VRS 89 98: 33,5m) near to a traffic light but they don't need to go 200m to a crossroad or 100m to a traffic signal (OLG Hamburg VRS 87 249). In heavy traffic, pedestrians must not <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> as they might have to stop on a traffic lane (OLG Hamm, Az. 27 U 115/96). Typical fines for jaywalking (i.e. not using existing crosswalks or traffic lights) in Germany are between 5€ and 10€. https://www.bussgeldkatalog.org/fussgaenger/ ...|$|R

2500|$|Crossing {{sweepers}} were {{a common}} sight {{on the streets of}} large cities during much of the 19th century. The predominance of horse-drawn vehiclesand the general uncleanliness of urban streetsentailed certain difficulties in crossing intersections.

Crossing sweepers, by sweeping the pavement ahead of a person <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and creating a path that was referred to as a [...] "broom walk," [...] thus offered a service, particularly to the more affluent.|$|E
