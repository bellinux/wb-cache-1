5|$|An edited {{version of}} the musical <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> the Tar Sequence (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) {{has been used for}} years as the theme music for local {{television}} stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although the music was written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.|$|E
5|$|One of {{his major}} prophetic sources was evidently the Mirabilis Liber of 1522, which {{contained}} a range of prophecies by Pseudo-Methodius, the Tiburtine Sibyl, Joachim of Fiore, Savonarola and others (his Preface contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus {{was one of the}} first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain why they are credited to him. It should be noted that modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics. The latest research suggests that he may in fact have used bibliomancy for this—randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> whatever page it happened to fall open at.|$|E

25|$|Taking his <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> the Junimist leadership, Melik {{followed}} the literary club as it transformed {{itself into a}} liberal conservative party. He represented Iași city in the Assembly of Deputies in the 1884 legislature, and then, under a Junimist government, helped enforce Titu Maiorescu's policies in the educational field. Melik is also remembered as an engineer and entrepreneur, who contributed to the modern history of Costeștii Botoșanilor village, his personal estate.|$|E

However, despite there being some {{difficulties}} and apathy by the authorities the Smoke-Free Chandigarh project has been a success story. Taking a <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> the Chandigarh's success, cities like Shimla also followed the Smoke-Free Chandigarh model to become smoke-free. The success of Chandigarh had been widely recognised and the architect of smoke-free Chandigarh Hemant Goswami. was also awarded the Global Smoke-Free Partnership Award for the initiative.|$|E

25|$|Much of Melton's {{professional}} career has involved literary and field research into alternative and minority religious bodies. In taking his <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> {{the writings of}} Elmer Clark, Melton {{has spent much of}} his career identifying, counting and classifying the many different churches, major religious traditions, and new and alternative religions found in North America. His Encyclopedia of American Religions, which was originally published in 1978 (ninth ed. 2016), has become the standard reference work in the field.|$|E
40|$|In three experiments, we {{investigated}} the contextual control {{of attention in}} human discrimination learning. In each experiment, participants initially received discrimination training in which the <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> Dimension A were relevant in Context 1 but irrelevant in Context 2, whereas the <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> Dimension B were irrelevant in Context 1 but relevant in Context 2. In Experiment 1, the same <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> each dimension were used in Contexts 1 and 2, whereas in Experiments 2 and 3, the <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> each dimension were changed across contexts. In each experiment, participants were subsequently shifted to a transfer discrimination involving novel <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> either dimension, to assess the contextual control of attention. In Experiment 1, measures of eye gaze during the transfer discrimination revealed that Dimension A received more attention than Dimension B in Context 1, whereas the reverse occurred in Context 2. Corresponding results indicating the contextual control of attention were found in Experiments 2 and 3, in which we used the speed of learning (associability) as an indirect marker of learned attentional changes. Implications of our results for current theories of learning and attention are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Taking his <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> the Jewish {{community}} leader Wilhelm Filderman, Aderca reacted against the branding of Jews as inherent anti-Romanians, placing ethnic clashes {{in a larger}} context, where Romanians also battled each other. He was bitter that Jews were being stereotyped as fainthearted; he mentioned lists of Jews who had fought and died for Romania in World War I. During Octavian Goga's premiership, which reintroduced racial discrimination, Aderca issued calls for democratic dissent, suggesting a compendium of Jewish Romanian literary contributions, past and present.|$|E
25|$|Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes {{her role}} as teacher, and {{introduces}} her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At {{the end of the}} school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.|$|E
25|$|Bluewater Comics has {{released}} {{a series of}} comics that take their <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> the TV show. They are The Mis-Adventures of Adam West, The Secret Lives of Julie Newmar, and Burt Ward, Boy Wonder and are similar in tone to the TV series. The Mis-Adventures of Adam West had a four-issue miniseries, and a regular series that ran nine issues. The Secret Lives of Julie Newmar was a four-issue miniseries and Burt Ward, Boy Wonder {{was going to be}} a four-issue miniseries, but has not yet been published.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the association between herbivore behavior and <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> producers. We used stream grazer Glossosoma larvae and determined their crawling direction in relation to chemical and visual <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> microalgae. The experimental treatments included control (no cue), particulate (chemical and particulate cues), and dissolved (chemical <b>cue)</b> <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> microalgae. The experimental water samples were randomly placed into either arm of a Y-shaped channel, and the crawling direction of the grazers was determined. Although the grazers crawled toward the arm containing either particulate or dissolved cues, they preferred the arm with particulate cues. This suggested that grazers responded well to both particulate (i. e., drifting algal cells) and chemical (algal smell) cues, and that particulate cues were more important for foraging. In natural habitats, grazers detect <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> producers and change their behaviors to maintain a balance between top-down and bottom-up cues...|$|R

In 35 trials, homing occurred with a frequency of 0. 66. Experiments were carried out to investigate the roles of the following: (a) airborne odour from the homesite, (b) topographical memory, (c) chemical <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> the current outward trail, (d) chemical <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> old browsing trails, and (e) “foreign” trails. Homesites whose immediate surroundings had been broken up retained an attraction which is not adequately explained.

25|$|In France, {{during the}} long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or {{skittles}} {{at one end of}} the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. A standardized version of the game eventually became known as bagatelle.|$|E
25|$|In June 1994, LGBT union activists {{gathered}} in New York City {{as part of}} the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Wallace and others associated with the Gay and Lesbian Labor Activists Network (GALLAN), an organization of LGBT labor union activists in San Francisco, pushed for the formation of national organization out of frustration with the labor movement's silence during the debate over the Defense of Marriage Act. Taking a <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> a 1990 booklet titled Pride at Work: Organizing for Lesbian and Gay Rights in Unions, the group decided to adopt the title as its name.|$|E
25|$|The {{new wave}} scene has {{collapsed}} {{by the end}} of the eighties, to be replaced by the newcomers like; Tutti Frutti band, Daleka Obala, Majke and Laufer. While Daleka Obala sported a pop-rock sound influenced by Novi val, Croatian pop and even Dalmatian folk, Majke were a back-to-basics, garage-rock act stylistically influenced by bands like the Black Crowes, Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, as well as their Serbian counterparts Partibrejkers. Laufer, led by Damir Urban (who later went on to form Urban & 4), were an early nineties alternative rock band taking their <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> the grunge movement.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the {{performance}} of a state-of-the-art statistical parser (Bikel, 2004) in parsing written and spoken language and in generating subcategorization <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> written and spoken language. Although Bikel’s parser achieves a higher accuracy for parsing written language, it achieves a higher accuracy when extracting subcategorization <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> spoken language. Additionally, we explore the utility of punctuation in helping parsing and extraction of subcategorization cues. Our experiments show that punctuation is of little help in parsing spoken language and extracting subcategorization <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> spoken language. This indicates that {{there is no need to}} add punctuation in transcribing spoken corpora simply in order to help parsers. ...|$|R

40|$|The big-handed brachyuran crab Heterozius rotundifrons {{extends the}} time spent in its anti-predator posture, limb {{extended}} posture, if exposed to chemical <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> crushed conspecifics. In this study, we tested whether crabs also respond to chemical <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> crushed heterospecific crabs, and if so, whether phylogenetic relations or ecological overlap is more important in influencing {{the duration of the}} anti-predator posture. Chemical <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> two other brachyuran crabs (Cyclograpsus lavauxi and Hemigrapsus sexdentatus), which do not overlap directly in ecological distribution with H. rotundifrons, elicited a duration of the anti-predator posture that was indistinguishable from that produced by conspecific chemical cues. In contrast, chemical <b>cues</b> <b>from</b> two anomuran crabs (Petrolisthes elongatus and Pagurus novizealandiae) that overlap in ecological distribution with H. rotundifrons, elicited durations of the antipredator posture that were significantly shorter than those of either conspecifics or more closely related crab species. Thus, phylogenetic relationship seems to be more important than ecological overlap in influencing anti-predator behavior in H. rotundifrons...|$|R
25|$|Remuneration for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong {{is among}} the highest in the world for a {{political}} leader, and second only to that of the Prime Minister of Singapore.

In 2005, then-CE CH Tung received some HK$3million ($378,500). From 2009 until the end of 2014, the salary for the job stood at HK$4.22million. In January 2015, CY Leung reversed a pay freeze imposed in 2012, resulting in its increase to HK$4.61million ($591,000).|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, most railroads {{took the}} <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even {{up to six}} {{automobiles}} onto one flat car left {{a large amount of}} space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, foldaway bridges were added {{to the ends of the}} flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.|$|E
25|$|In this view, {{the beast}} {{from the sea}} is {{interpreted}} as the state or any human kingdom that is in opposition to God. This would include the Roman Empire but would broadly apply to all empires. Scholars take their <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> the parallels between Revelation 13 and Daniel 7, noting that in Daniel 7:17 that the beasts are revealed as kingdoms. Therefore, given that the beast of Revelation thirteen is a composite of the beasts of Daniel, one should similarly interpret this beast as a kingdom, more specifically a composite of all kingdoms. Similarly, in some idealist circles, {{it is suggested that}} the beast represents different social injustices, such as exploitation of workers, wealth, the elite, commerce, materialism, and imperialism. Various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul, have associated the State and political power as the beast.|$|E
