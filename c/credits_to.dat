5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the <b>credits</b> <b>to</b> hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of <b>credits</b> <b>to</b> R$420million. The concession was justified by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program. Caixa Econômica Federal is the distributing agent.|$|E

40|$|Credit {{expansion}} {{has been}} associated with faster economic growth and with a higher occurrence of financial crises – a pair of results which seem to contradict each other. This paper advances an explanation for these results by separating <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> the private sector into <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> firms and <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> households. The empirical analysis shows that <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> firms is responsible for the positive growth effect, while the higher occurrence of crises is mainly due <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> households. The events of the last decade, where fast <b>credit</b> expansion led <b>to</b> crises and very little growth, can be understood as a shift in the composition of credit towards its household component...|$|R

5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it. Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit card companies send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and debit card transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state Medicaid program, MassHealth. Spending increases to MassHealth, local government and local education aid, higher education (including $78 million towards repairs of the University of Massachusetts Boston underground parking garage), an anti-opioid trafficking program and substance abuse services, homelessness prevention, improvement in clinical services at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Department of Children and Families to hire more case workers, a job retraining fund, an MBTA subsidy, and increasing state tax <b>credits</b> <b>to</b> businesses that hire unemployed military veterans {{are included in the}} proposal.|$|E
