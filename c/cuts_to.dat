This is true, for example, for the octagon-shaped 4 Annas stamp of India issued in 1854, which is most commonly found <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> shape on envelopes or pieces.|$|R

5|$|The {{election}} of Republican president William McKinley in 1896 deepened the Democrats' resolve {{to oppose the}} Republican governor and his allies.

5|$|The tariff fight {{continued}} into the 50th Congress, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained control of the House, with a reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter's defeat for reelection, and was as {{much in favor of}} tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills's bill would make small <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> those on manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889.|$|E
