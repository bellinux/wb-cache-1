5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which <b>can</b> <b>represent</b> the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that <b>can</b> <b>represent</b> the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words <b>can</b> <b>represent</b> experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.|$|E
5|$|Heathen rites {{often take}} place in non-public spaces, {{particularly}} in a practitioner's home. In other cases, Heathen places of worship have been established on plots of land specifically purchased for the purpose; these <b>can</b> <b>represent</b> either a hörg, which is a sanctified place within nature like a grove of trees, or a hof, which is a wooden temple. The Heathen community has made various attempts to construct hofs {{in different parts of}} the world. In 2014 the Ásaheimur Temple was opened in Efri Ás, Skagafjörður, Iceland, while in 2015 a British Heathen group called the Odinist Fellowship opened a temple in a converted 16th-century chapel in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Heathens have also adopted archaeological sites as places of worship. For instance, British practitioners have assembled for rituals at the Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire, the Rollright Stones in Warwickshire, and the White Horse Stone in Kent. Swedish Heathens have done the same at Gamla Uppsala, and Icelandic practitioners have met at Þingvellir.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph <b>can</b> <b>represent</b> a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E

If {{the word has}} an even number of bits, the {{magnitude}} of the largest negative number that <b>can</b> be <b>represented</b> is twice as large as the largest positive number that <b>can</b> be <b>represented,</b> and vice versa if the word has an odd number of bits.|$|R

For flowcharts of programs, almost everything that <b>can</b> be <b>represent</b> with a flowchart <b>can</b> also be <b>represented</b> with a Nassi - Shneiderman diagram. The exceptions are constructs like goto and the C programming language break and continue statements for loops.|$|R
5|$|The Tempest {{differs from}} Shakespeare's other plays in its {{observation}} of a stricter, more organised neoclassical style. The clearest indication {{of this is}} Shakespeare's respect for the three unities in the play: the Unities of Time, Place, and Action. Shakespeare's other plays rarely respected the three unities, taking place in separate locations miles apart and over several days or even years. The play's events unfold in real time before the audience, Prospero even declaring in the last act that everything has happened in, more or less, three hours. All action is unified into one basic plot: Prospero's struggle to regain his dukedom; it is also confined to one place, a fictional island, which many scholars agree {{is meant to be}} located in the Mediterranean Sea. Another reading suggests that it takes place in the New World, as some parts read like records of English and Spanish conquest in the Americas. Still others argue that the Island <b>can</b> <b>represent</b> any land that has been colonised.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the postal}} code systems are numeric; {{only a few}} are {{alphanumeric}} (i.e., use both letters and digits). Alphanumeric systems can, given {{the same number of}} characters, encode many more locations. For example, while a 2 digit numeric code <b>can</b> <b>represent</b> 100 locations, a 2 character alphanumeric code using ten numbers and twenty letters <b>can</b> <b>represent</b> 900 locations.|$|E
50|$|Instead, either decimal or vulgar {{fractions}} <b>can</b> be <b>represented</b> natively in finger binary. Decimal fractions <b>can</b> be <b>represented</b> {{by using}} regular integer binary methods and dividing the result by 10, 100, 1000, {{or some other}} power of ten. Numbers between 0 and 102.3, 10.23, 1.023, etc. <b>can</b> be <b>represented</b> this way, in increments of 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc.|$|R

This modulation technique is known as frequency-shift keying (FSK). FSK is widely used in modems and fax modems, and {{can also be used}} to send Morse code. Radioteletype also uses FSK.|$|E
