These include breath-holding spells, bed wetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks.

5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. <b>Children</b> <b>may</b> be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. <b>Children</b> <b>may</b> suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in <b>children</b> <b>may</b> also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|Given that FH {{is present}} from birth and {{atherosclerotic}} changes may begin early in life, {{it is sometimes}} necessary to treat adolescents or even teenagers with agents that were originally developed for adults. Due to safety concerns, many physicians prefer to use bile acid sequestrants and fenofibrate as these are licensed in children. Nevertheless, statins seem safe and effective, and in older <b>children</b> <b>may</b> be used as in adults.|$|E

5|$|Insecure {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The <b>children</b> <b>may</b> snub the returning caregiver, or {{may go to}} the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to him/her, and fail {{to return to their}} previous play. These children {{are more likely to have}} later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E
5|$|Peers help expose {{children}} to multi-party conversations. This allows {{children to}} hear {{a greater variety of}} speech, and to observe different conversational roles. Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners, which pressures the children to communicate more effectively. Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults, but <b>children</b> <b>may</b> still correct their peers. Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour, disagreements and conversational topics.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of strep throat usually improve within {{three to five}} days, irrespective of treatment. Treatment with antibiotics {{reduces the risk of}} complications and transmission; <b>children</b> <b>may</b> return to school 24 hours after antibiotics are administered. The risk of complications in adults is low. In children, acute rheumatic fever is rare in most of the developed world. It is, however, the leading cause of acquired heart disease in India, sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Australia.|$|E

Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe {{signs and symptoms}} in <b>children</b> <b>may</b> include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that <b>children</b> <b>may</b> not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. <b>Children</b> <b>may</b> {{also present}} cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E

5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such <b>children</b> <b>may</b> remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and <b>children</b> <b>may</b> need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views {{have been}} criticized for not fully {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, <b>children</b> <b>may</b> be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E

5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. <b>Children</b> <b>may</b> also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and {{may be more likely}} to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused <b>children</b> <b>may</b> exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in <b>children</b> <b>may</b> be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E
