5|$|Serious issues {{concerning}} {{safety and security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} rallying point for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would be repaid by Congress. The NYPD later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, but part of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent <b>car</b> <b>bombs.</b> The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E
