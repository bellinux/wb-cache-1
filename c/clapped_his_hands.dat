25|$|Rath <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and {{soldiers}} knocked the supports {{from under the}} drops. Surratt and Atzerodt seemed to die quickly. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes. Powell's body swung about wildly, and once or twice his legs came up {{so that he was}} almost in a sitting position.|$|E
25|$|Surratt and {{the others}} stood on the drop for about 10 seconds, and then Captain Rath <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> Four {{soldiers}} of Company F of the 14th Veteran Reserves knocked out the supports holding the drops in place, and the condemned fell. Surratt, who had moved forward enough to barely step onto the drop, lurched forward and slid partway down the drop, her body snapping tight {{at the end of}} the rope, swinging back and forth. Surratt's death appeared to be the easiest. Atzerodt's stomach heaved once and his legs quivered; then, he was still. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes, strangling to death.|$|E
25|$|When Lü Meng pacified Changsha Commandery, {{he passed}} by Ling County (酃縣; east of present-day Hengyang, Hunan) and met Deng Xuanzhi (鄧玄之), {{an old friend}} of Hao Pu. He planned to use Deng Xuanzhi to trick Hao Pu into surrendering. That night, Lü Meng summoned all his {{officers}} and gave them instructions on how to attack Lingling Commandery the following morning, without telling them that Sun Quan had given orders for them to give up on Lingling Commandery and move to Yiyang. He lied to Deng Xuanzhi that Liu Bei was besieged in Hanzhong Commandery by Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan and that Guan Yu was occupied in a battle at Nan Commandery. He then asked Deng Xuanzhi to help him persuade Hao Pu to give up on Lingling Commandery. Deng Xuanzhi went to see Hao Pu later and conveyed Lü Meng's message. Hao Pu became afraid when he heard that he had been isolated, so he agreed to surrender and asked Deng Xuanzhi to lead him to Lü Meng. When Lü Meng met Hao Pu, he revealed the truth, <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and laughed. Hao Pu became wrecked with guilt when he learnt that both Liu Bei and Guan Yu were actually free to reinforce Lingling Commandery but it was too late. Lü Meng left Sun He (孫河) behind to guard the three commanderies while he headed towards Yiyang per Sun Quan's order.|$|E

2500|$|Twelve {{days after}} the Warsaw ghetto uprising, Frumer {{and his family were}} {{deported}} with other Jews to the Majdanek concentration camp. Frumer was murdered a few days later, on May 2, 1943 (27 Nisan 5703). It was reported that as he was taken to the gas chamber, he <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and proclaimed aloud, [...] "Let us sanctify God's Name with joy. Blessed is He who has kept us alive and sustained us to have this great merit".|$|E
2500|$|This miracle is {{not found}} in the New Testament, but it is found in the non-canonical Infancy Gospel of Thomas; [...] "When this boy, Jesus, was five years old, he was playing at the ford of a rushing stream. He then made soft clay and shaped it into twelve sparrows; Jesus simply <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and shouted to the sparrows: [...] "Be off, fly away, and {{remember}} me, you who are now alive!" [...] And the sparrows took off and flew away noisily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{physical}} size, Arbuckle was remarkably agile and acrobatic. Director Mack Sennett, when recounting {{his first meeting}} with Arbuckle, noted that he [...] "skipped up the stairs as lightly as Fred Astaire"; and, [...] "without warning went into a feather light step, <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and did a backward somersault as graceful as a girl tumbler". His comedies are noted as rollicking and fast-paced, have many chase scenes, and feature sight gags. Arbuckle was fond of the [...] "pie in the face", a comedy cliché that has come to symbolize silent-film-era comedy itself. The earliest known pie thrown in film was in the June 1913 Keystone one-reeler A Noise from the Deep, starring Arbuckle and frequent screen partner Mabel Normand.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 208–209, the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei {{defeated}} Cao Cao's forces at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. When Lu Su returned after the battle, Sun Quan hosted a grand reception for him and said, [...] "Zijing, I dismounted my horse and received you on foot. Is this enough to illuminate your glory?" [...] Lu Su replied, [...] "No." [...] All the others present at the scene were startled by Lu Su's response. After taking his seat, Lu Su raised his horsewhip and said, [...] "I hope that our lord will spread his might and virtues throughout the Four Seas, expand his territories to cover the Nine Provinces, and successfully build an empire. When he has achieved that and he comes to receive me on a carriage, I'll {{be the first to}} feel honoured." [...] Sun Quan <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and laughed.|$|E
2500|$|On May 3, 2006, {{the jury}} reached a verdict: that Moussaoui {{be sentenced to}} life in prison without the {{possibility}} of parole. Moussaoui was sentenced to six consecutive life terms on May 4, as Judge Brinkema expressed her belief that the sentence was an appropriate one, inasmuch as it would deprive Moussaoui of [...] "martyrdom in a great big bang of glory" [...] and of the [...] "chance to speak again", after Moussaoui entered the courtroom proclaiming his victory and asserting that the United States would [...] "never get Osama bin Laden". As he was leaving the courtroom he said, [...] "America, you lost and I won." [...] And he <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> twice. A single juror saved Moussaoui from death. The foreman of the 12-person federal jury told The Washington Postthat the panel voted 11-1, 10-2 and 10-2 in favor of the death penalty on the three charges for which Moussaoui was eligible for execution. A unanimous vote on any one of the three terrorism charges was required to return a death sentence.|$|E
2500|$|He {{had faced}} 282 balls for an elegant 148, which {{featured}} 18 fours. His innings {{was full of}} orthodox and stylish shots, notable of which were his cover drives through mid-off and extra cover, which saw him open the full face of the bat without an exaggerated follow-through. He leaned in on his drives for the spinners, while he played close to the body for the pacers, {{with little or no}} bending of his back. He moved his feet well, and used his wrists to play the ball fine, whenever the ball would stray down to middle-and-leg line. He would also flick the deliveries with no effort at all. For the off-side deliveries, Laxman would either utilize the ball's pace and send it scorching to the boundary, or he would open the face of the bat late enough to cut it. On some occasions he back-cut the ball intentionally over the slips. His innings was even appreciated by the Australian fielders. On one occasion, when Laxman drove Stuart MacGill through cover, Adam Gilchrist, exclaimed, [...] "Aw, nice..." [...] and then <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in acknowledgment of the shot, as it sped away to the boundary.|$|E

2500|$|When Sun Ce sent Taishi Ci {{to persuade}} Liu Yao's {{followers}} to surrender, many of Sun Ce's aides felt that Taishi Ci {{could not be}} trusted. They believed that Taishi Ci would defect to either Hua Xin or Huang Zu. However, Sun Ce said, [...] "All of you are wrong. I trust my judgment. Taishi Ci may be brave and headstrong, {{but he is not}} an impulsive person. He is a man of exemplary character and a man who keeps his word. I treat him like a close friend and will not betray him. All of you don't need to worry." [...] Sun Ce's aides only trusted Taishi Ci after he kept his promise and returned from Yuzhang Commandery. When Taishi Ci met Sun Ce again, he said, [...] "Hua Ziyu is a man of virtue, but not a talented leader. He has no grand plan; he only wants to preserve the status quo. Tong Zhi (僮芝) from Danyang lied that he has been appointed as the Administrator of Luling and has taken control of the commandery. The local clans in Poyang have formed their own ruling body and driven away the officials sent by Hua Ziyu to govern the area. Hua Ziyu is unable to control Luling and Poyang. Moreover, about 5,000 to 6,000 local clans in Haihun (海昏) have formed their own ruling body too and rejected control by the commandery administration. Hua Ziyu can do nothing about this." [...] Sun Ce <b>clapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and laughed. Later on, he pacified Yuzhang Commandery and successfully induced Hua Xin to surrender to him.|$|E
