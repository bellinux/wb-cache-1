Methodology/methodsThe methods of induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis, statistical observation and grouping have been used in the research process. The aim of the scientific work is to determine the principles for improving the statistical registration of commodity at the customs in Georgia. ResultsCountries of origin are not yet completely reflected in the cargo-customs declaration at the Georgian customs; the field ``means of transport at the border'' in the cargo-customs declaration is not filled in; data on estimated market value of the means of transport in the databases of Service Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is not complete; detailed coding of imported vehicles is carried out incorrectly; the simplified customs declarations are not completely filled in with reference to countries, 11 -digit item coding and value. In terms of registration, certain problems are caused by the fact that a sender and a country of final destination are not always filled out in the declaration. Problems exist in producing foreign trade price indices, the issue being that he information on foreign trade statistics is classified according to the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System while price indices are calculated according to the classification of types of economic activity on the 4 -digit level; in filling in declarations there are frequent errors related to registration of <b>commodity</b> <b>code,</b> weight and additional units of measurement.

Using the <b>commodity</b> <b>codes</b> of trade data analyses for the European copper model as a connection point, we discuss a concept which links the material flow model to multisectoral economic models based on input output tables.

Data National retail price data. The retail price data were compiled and published by Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Community, {{in cooperation with the}} national statistical agencies of the countries that participated. While all of the price data we utilize is published we are unaware of available electronic copies. All prices refer to cash prices paid by final consumers, including taxes, both VAT and any others paid by the purchaser. Sales points are selected is {{such a way that the}} sample selected is representative of the distribution in the capital city. Prices are collected at different locations so that the average price is representative of the distribution within the city. These data were not available electronically so we had a private firm key-punch the <b>commodity</b> <b>codes,</b> <b>commodity</b> descriptions and prices into an electronic format. Data Reconciliation. In order to explain the price dispersion across goods that exists in our data we constructed measures of tradeability and the costs of non– traded inputs into production. The constructed variables for tradeability, and non– traded inputs from input-output tables are available at different levels of detail. For this reason, and in order to make the most of the information available for each of these factors, we matched the retail price data with each of the variables using two-digit, three-digit, and four-digit classifications depending on the level of detail available for each of the variables rather than attempting to match all variables using the same level of detail. The input-output data are also available at a three-digit level of detail that extends to four-digits for some industry groups. In order to reconcile the data as accurately as possible, we used the ISIC codes and descriptions available in the User Guide of the OECD International Sectoral Database. A description of each of our variables is as follows. • Tradeability. We obtained data on imports, exports, and gross output fo...|$|R

The further manufacturing of illegally logged wood and products made thereof as well as the associated trade has also negative social and economic effects on both sides of the wood markets, the producer and consumer countries. One of the key measures of the European Union (EU) to combat illegal logging is the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR). The EUTR came into effect on March 1, 2013 and it prohibits the placing of wood and wood products made of illegally logged wood on the EU internal market. This placement can either be done by selling removals from European forests or by importing wood and wood-based products into the EU. But for what kind of products does the regulation apply exactly? The EUTR refers to its An-nex where a list is provided with respective commodities. The products are structured ac-cording to the trade classification of the Combined Nomenclature (CN). The main focus is laid on wood and articles of wood (chapter 44 of the CN), on pulp of wood (chapter 47) and on paper and paperboard and articles made thereof (chapter 48). Additionally <b>commodity</b> <b>codes</b> for furniture and one code for prefabricated buildings are listed.

A sign {{is another way to}} communicate among each other. In order to do that, visual signs may be used which contain some pictures with a special meaning to express the messages through the signs in the illustrative pictures such as chapter cover in the graphic novel. Meanwhile, a sign will have no meaning without codes inside it. The writer conducted a study about the semiotic analysis on chapter cover in the graphic novel Maus: A Survivor 2 ̆ 7 s Tale by Art Spiegelman based on Peirce 2 ̆ 7 s triadic theory and Codes theory by Chandler. There are two problems solved, namely: (1) What symbol, icon, and index on chapter covers of the graphic novel Maus: A Survivor 2 ̆ 7 s Tale by Art Spiegelman are, and (2) What kinds of codes are used in interpreting the meaning of signs of the chapter cover in the graphic novels Maus: A Survivor 2 ̆ 7 s Tale by Art Spiegelman are. This study uses qualitative approach since the data are not in the forms of numbers or statistic calculation. The writer conducts the content or document analysis to analyze the signs and the codes used in chapter cover of the graphic novel Maus: A Survivor 2 ̆ 7 s Tale by Art Spiegelman. There are six chapter covers in the graphic novel Maus and the writer chooses all of chapter covers, namely The Sheik, The Honeymoon, The Prisoner of War, The Noose Tightens, Mouse Holes and Mouse Trap.

Grounded in research traditions of textual analysis and cultural studies, {{the present study}} is a semiotic analysis of critical scenes in a study corpus comprised of key scenes from fifteen school films from the 1930 s to present. Films were selected for inclusion in the study corpus based on five criteria: setting of the film in a K- 12 school, teacher as a central character of the film, a school film with a serious message, a film that includes at least one literary event, and a film that is available for rent in the United States. Key scenes (those that embody the film's stance toward literacy and literacy pedagogy) were selected by an inter-rater group of veteran educators and researchers. A semiotic analysis of the texts determined what denotations, connotations, and myths exist in the following: o Components of literacy o Expressions of literacy o Importance of literacy o Role of the teacher o Role of the student o Role of the school The analysis was conducted through a textual study of the dialogue, basic cinematic techniques, and the semiotic codes of body <b>codes,</b> <b>commodity</b> <b>codes,</b> and behavioral codes found in the critical scenes to identify emerging themes. During the open coding stage, data revealed twelve categories that contributed to the four axial codes of Self, Beyond Self, Critical Connections, and Representations of Literacy. The four axial codes contributed to three different themes that emerged in the representations of literacy in popular school film: internal versus external forces, traditional versus non- traditional pedagogy, and traditional representations of literacy versus new literacies. A grounded theory based upon the research data proposes a symbiotic relationship between educational policy and the portrayal of literacy pedagogy in serious school film.
