Unique design feature was remotely mounted brake valve which was operated via hydraulic master and slave cylinder principle on the Hauler 6x6 or via mechanical linkage on 8x8 models.|$|E
5000|$|Spencer {{patented}} {{his idea}} in 1873; unfortunately, his patent attorney failed {{to protect the}} most significant part, the <b>cam</b> <b>drum,</b> which Spencer called the [...] "brain wheel". Therefore many other people quickly took up the idea. Later important developers of fully automatic lathes (large and small) included S. L. Worsley, who developed a single-spindle machine for Brown & Sharpe; Edwin C. Henn, Reinhold Hakewessel, and George O. Gridley, who developed multiple-spindle variants and who were involved with a succession of corporations (Acme, National, National-Acme, Windsor Machine Company, Acme-Gridley, New Britain-Gridley); Edward P. Bullard Jr, who led {{the development of the}} Bullard Mult-Au-Matic; F.C. Fay and Otto A. Schaum, who developed the Fay automatic lathe; Ralph Flanders and his brother Ernest, who further refined the Fay lathe and who developed the automatic screw thread grinder; and many others. Meanwhile, engineers in Switzerland were also developing clever new manually and automatically controlled lathes during this same era. The technological developments in America and Switzerland flowed rapidly into other industrialized countries (via routes such as machine tool exports; trade journal articles and advertisements; trade shows, from world's fairs to regional events; and the turnover and emigration of engineers, setup hands, and operators). There, local innovators also developed further creative tooling for the machines and built clone machine models.|$|E

50|$|Tonight Alive are an Australian {{rock band}} from Sydney, formed in 2008. The band {{consists}} of lead vocalist Jenna McDougall, lead guitarist, keyboardist Whakaio Taahi, rhythm guitarist Jake Hardy, bassist <b>Cam</b> Adler and <b>drummer</b> Matt Best.|$|R
50|$|The band, {{like many}} other of the Perth group's bands, {{features}} an ever-changing lineup. Currently, Pond is Nick Allbrook (keys, flute, vocals), Jay Watson (bass), Joe Ryan (guitar) and Jamie Terry (keys, guitar, bass) The band has also previously featured Kevin Parker (drums, 2008-2011, mixing and production, 2012-present) <b>Cam</b> Avery (<b>drums,</b> 2011-2014), Nick Odell (congas) and Richard Ingham (guitar.)

50|$|It {{was from}} the {{automotive}} industry in the USA that the PLC was born. Before the PLC, control, sequencing, and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of relays, <b>cam</b> timers, <b>drum</b> sequencers, and dedicated closed-loop controllers. Since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands, the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model change-over was very time consuming and expensive, as electricians needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Paul Mckenzie (lead vocals, saxophone) and Mike Davies (lead guitar) {{originally}} came together, {{sharing a}} mutual musical interests in Vancouver's blossoming punk rock scene, when they formed the Bone-a-Partes with Brian Olinek (bass guitar), and <b>Cam</b> Wagner (<b>drums)</b> in 1981. However, when the band discovered a French garage rock act had already appropriated the name, McKenzie suggested to rename themselves the Enigmas. In March 1982, {{the band played}} their debut gig at the Smilin' Buddha with the Greasy Spoons, one of McKenzie's former groups.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cam</b> timers and <b>drum</b> sequencers were {{primarily}} used with industrial machines to control repetitive sequencing operations. The cam followers often operated hydraulic valves.

2500|$|The {{weapon is}} {{described}} as an [...] "air-cooled, electrically powered, rapid firing weapon." [...] All portions of the firing cycle are powered this way so the unit requires an external power source. Other important features are the reciprocating barrel and cam assembly that drive the other components of the system. All phases of the weapon cycle are positively controlled by the <b>drum</b> <b>cam</b> assembly in which a planetary gear train is enclosed, responsible for reducing the motor's high speed to the desired rate for the gun. The 5/8 horsepower 28 Volts DC motor is mounted on the turret bracket and drives the <b>drum</b> <b>cam</b> through a flexible shaft in order to isolate it from the weapon's recoil. The weapon accepts linked ammunition, which was fed from rotary drums {{in the case of}} the M5 and M28 systems, and from boxes {{in the case of the}} XM9 systems. [...] The M5 could also use a box magazine.|$|R
2500|$|The {{total number}} of relays, <b>cam</b> timers and <b>drum</b> sequencers can number into the {{hundreds}} or even thousands in some factories.

50|$|An {{electric}} motor drives a shaft on which is arranged {{a series of}} <b>cams</b> or a <b>drum</b> studded with pegs along its surface. Associated with each cam is one or more switches. The motor rotates at a fixed speed, and the camshaft is driven through a speed reducing gearbox at a convenient slow speed. Indentations or protrusions on the cams operate the switches at different times. By arrangement of the cams and switches, complex sequences of opening and closing switches can be made. The switches then operate different elements of the controlled system - for example motors, valves, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} {{analysis of}} a production machine is a key factor of its functionality, service life and occupational safety. This work deals with mathematical dynamic modelling and its contribution to the improvement of a mechanical design and mechanism failure prevention. The whole process is presented on {{the example of a}} <b>drum</b> <b>cam</b> rotary indexing table and on the example of actuators of multi spindle automatic lathes. The analysis consisted of complex nonlinear models based on basic linear models. It was computed using Matlab, Simulink and MSC ADAMS. Models of these mechanisms were validated with experimental measurements. The results were used for mechanical design improvement and for speed control optimization...|$|R
5000|$|The Nova Local was a {{psychedelic}} pop band {{formed in}} Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in 1964, initially {{under the name}} The Shadows. It was composed of singer Randy Winburn, guitarists Joe Mendyk and Phil Lambeth, bassist Jim Opton, keyboardist <b>Cam</b> Schinhan and <b>drummer</b> Bill Levasseur. Their single [...] "If You Only Had the Time", released in 1967, was a minor hit in North Carolina. They recorded one album, Nova 1 (released on Decca Records in 1968 in the United States), shortly before disbanding. The album was also released in Canada and in the United Kingdom. According to Opton, the album was the first ever recorded using the Dolby NR system.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computer-aided design and manufacturing {{system for the}} design and production of complex profiles for high-performance <b>drum</b> <b>cams</b> within the specified tolerance. The system graphically generates the cam profile on the cylindrical drum after performing {{an analysis of the}} kinematic performance for the prescribed follower motion, using a B-spline representation of follower curves. Eight different types of follower motion for a translating follower are considered. The kinematic performance is based on the criteria of achieving the lowest levels of velocity and acceleration for each curve. The system is also able to simulate the motion of the designed cam graphically. The system also recommends the best cam profile on the basis of comparing the kinematic performance of all the B-spline representations of all the follower motions...|$|R
50|$|The Bullnose {{radiator}} {{was replaced}} by a more conventional flat radiator announced 11 September 1926 on new cars now with doors either side and a longer list of accessories supplied as standard. All steel bodies were coming available. The engines remained the same, but the Cowley unlike the Oxford, retained braking on the rear wheels only as standard, although a front brake system was available at extra cost (featured car has this fitted). The chassis was new and the suspension was updated with semi elliptic leaf springs all round plus Smiths friction type scissor shock absorbers. The brakes are rod and spring operated with <b>cams</b> inside the <b>drums</b> to actuate. Interesting to note that the rear brake drums include two sets of shoes, one of which is connected directly to the handbrake.|$|R
5000|$|The Curta {{calculator}} {{used the}} method of complements for subtraction, and managed to hide this from the user. Numbers were entered using digit input slides {{along the side of}} the device. The number on each slide was added to a result counter by a gearing mechanism which engaged cams on a rotating [...] "echelon drum" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "step drum"). The drum was turned by use of a crank on the top of the instrument. The number of cams encountered by each digit as the crank turned was determined by the value of that digit. For example, if a slide is set to its [...] "6" [...] position, a row of 6 cams would be encountered around the drum corresponding to that position. For subtraction, the drum was shifted slightly before it was turned, which moved a different row of cams into position. This alternate row contained the nines' complement of the digits. Thus, the row of 6 cams that had been in position for addition now had a row with 3 <b>cams.</b> The shifted <b>drum</b> also engaged one extra cam which added 1 to the result (as required for {{the method of}} complements). The always present tens' complement [...] "overflow 1" [...] which carried out beyond the most significant digit of the results register was, in effect, discarded.|$|R

Special computers called programmable logic controllers were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit. [...] In a typical hard wired motor start and stop circuit (called a control circuit) a motor is started by pushing a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "Run" [...] button that activates a pair of electrical relays. The [...] "lock-in" [...] relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The [...] "lock in" [...] contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a [...] "stop" [...] or [...] "off" [...] button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.|$|R
