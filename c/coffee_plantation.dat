5|$|In 1897, Antonio Mattei Lluveras, {{a wealthy}} <b>coffee</b> <b>plantation</b> owner from Yauco, visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There {{he met with}} Ramón Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Méndez Martínez and {{together}} they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising, which {{became known as the}} Intentona de Yauco was to be directed by Betances, organized by Aurelio Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Juan Ríus Rivera. The coup, which was the second and last major revolt against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico failed.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} frustration, Honório Hermeto (or Paraná as he became known) had largely recouped the {{prestige}} he had formerly possessed among his peers. He had liquidated his uncle's domestic slave trading business {{and used the}} proceeds to become a <b>coffee</b> <b>plantation</b> owner in 1836. The land he acquired was located in the hills between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Although Paraná staunchly opposed {{the abolition of the}} transatlantic African slave trade, the importation of slaves was abolished in 1850 by the Eusébio de Queirós Law. The ban on slave imports seems to have had no impact over Paraná's private affairs; by 1852, he had become a very wealthy man. He also married his son Honório to a niece of Rodrigues Torres, thus establishing a link between his family and the province of Rio de Janeiro's planter aristocracy.|$|E
40|$|In {{the highly}} {{populated}} and diverse tropics, conservation in relatively pristine habitats is important but clearly inadequate for sustaining the earth biological diversity. Agro-forestry {{systems such as}} shade-coffee plantations that incorporate arboreal vegetation {{are known to be}} more resilient for biodiversity conservation than other more drastic land transformations. We evaluated amphibian richness and diversity in 15 <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations</b> from three different regimes; organic <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations,</b> NPK <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations</b> and pesticide use <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations</b> in Kodagu District, Western Ghats, India. We treated five sacred groves as control region (CR) and sampled them using a combination of standardized visual and acoustic transect sampling. The sacred groves that were characterized by natural vegetation showed the highest richness and abundance of amphibians among the four regimes. In organic <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations,</b> overall abundance and richness of amphibians was significantly higher compared to NPK <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations.</b> On the other hand, amphibian richness and diversity in pesticide use <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations</b> were significantly lower compared to all other regimes. The results of the study clearly indicated that, the difference in habitat variables in <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations</b> and use of different treatments for pest control had a significant effect on the species richness and abundance of amphibians. This study highlights the great potential of sacred groves and organic <b>coffee</b> <b>plantations</b> as complementary habitat for the conservation of amphibians...|$|R

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Hilo, Hawaiʻi, he was the eldest son of Kinoʻoleoliliha, a Hawaiian high chiefess, and Benjamin Pitman, an American pioneer settler from Massachusetts. Through his father's {{business}} success in the whaling and sugar and <b>coffee</b> <b>plantation</b> industries and his mother's familial connections to the Hawaiian royal family, the Pitmans were quite prosperous and owned lands {{on the island of}} Hawaiʻi and in Honolulu. He and his older sister Mary were educated in the mission schools in Hilo alongside other children of mixed Hawaiian descent. After the death of his mother in 1855, his father remarried to the widow of a missionary, thus connecting the family to the American missionary community in Hawaiʻi. However, following the deaths of his first wife and later his second wife, his father decided to leave the islands and returned to Massachusetts with his family around 1860. The younger Pitman continued his education in the public schools of Roxbury, where the Pitman family lived for a period of time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Cuban society was highly stratified, {{consisting}} of a Spanish creole ruling class of tobacco, sugar, and <b>coffee</b> <b>plantation</b> owners, a middle class of black and Spanish plantation workers, and an underclass of black slaves. The upper echelons of society were also deeply divided between the creoles and Spaniards (known as peninsulares), with the Spaniards benefiting greatly from the colonial regime. Cuba was a colony of Spain, although there were movements for independence, integration into the U.S., and integration with Spain. The roots of anarchism were first seen in 1857, when a Proudhonian mutualist society was founded. After being introduced to the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon by José de Jesus Márquez, Saturnino Martínez (an Asturian immigrant to Cuba) founded the periodical La Aurora in 1865. Directed at tobacco workers, it included the earliest advocation of cooperative societies in Cuba. By the Ten Years' War, the insurgents against Spain included expatriates from the Paris Commune, and others influenced by Proudhon, including Salvador Cisneros Betancourt and Vicente García.|$|E

5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from <b>coffee</b> <b>plantation.</b> Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
5|$|In July 1945, Gibbes was {{assigned}} to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Following his discharge from the Air Force on 11January 1946, he was initially employed as a stock and station agent in Coonamble, New South Wales. He flew a Butler Bat twin-engined aircraft to facilitate his work, reportedly the only New South Welshman in his profession to do so at the time. Gibbes spent much of the next 30 years in New Guinea, pioneering the island's transport, coffee and hospitality industries. In January 1948, he formed Gibbes Sepik Airways using, among other types, three German Junkers Ju52s, one of which was said to have been the personal transport of senior Luftwaffe commander Albert Kesselring. He was joined briefly in this venture, headquartered at Wewak, by Nicky Barr. Gibbes also established a tea and <b>coffee</b> <b>plantation</b> at Mount Hagen, New Guinea, in 1950, and served {{as a member of the}} RAAF Active Reserve, based in Townsville, Queensland, from 1952 until 1957. In 1958, he sold his share in Gibbes Sepik Airways to Mandated Airlines, which was later bought out by Ansett Australia. He continued to develop coffee plantations in New Guinea, and built a large chain of hotels beginning with the Bird of Paradise in Goroka.|$|E
