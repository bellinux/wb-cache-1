40|$|In the {{production}} or annihilation {{of a pair}} of fermions, the initial-state or final-state interactions often lead to significant effects on the reaction cross sections. For Coulomb-type interactions, the Gamow factor has been traditionally used to take into account these effects. However the Gamow factor needs to be modified when the magnitude of the coupling constant or the relative velocity of two particles increases. We obtain the relativistic generalization of the Gamow factor in terms of the overlap of the Feynman amplitude with the relativistic wave function of two fermions with an attractive Coulomb-type interaction. An explicit form of the <b>corrective</b> <b>factor</b> is presented for the spin-singlet S-wave state. While the <b>corrective</b> <b>factor</b> approaches the Gamow factor in the non-relativistic limit, we found that the Gamow factor significantly over-estimates the effects when the coupling constant or the velocity is large.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The bearing {{capacity}} of shallow foundations is classically computed as {{the sum of}} three contributions, coming from the soil cohesion, the overburden pressure {{and the weight of}} the soil mass mobilized by the collapse mechanism. Each of these contributive terms is then multiplied by several special <b>corrective</b> <b>factors</b> that account for the effect of the shape, depth and tilt of the foundation base, the inclination and eccentricity of the applied load, as well as the slope of the ground. Formulas for such factors have been proposed by several authors and are adopted by many codes of practice, namely Eurocode 7. This paper presents a numerical investigation of the adequacy and range of validity of the <b>corrective</b> <b>factors</b> that apply to foundation base tilt. Tilt angles of 6 and 9 degrees, rigid and flexible footings and small and large strain formulations are combined in a total of 8 finite element analyses of shallow foundation collapse in undrained conditions. It is concluded that for tilt angles above 6 º the {{bearing capacity}} tends to be overestimated by the classical approach which may lead to estimates that are not on the safe side. ...|$|R
40|$|The use of geo-reinforcements under shallow {{foundations}} {{is aimed}} {{to increase the}} soil mechanical properties and, consequently, to improve the footing load carrying capacity reducing the associated settlements.

The use of the failure envelope approach, instead of the usual bearing capacity <b>corrective</b> <b>factors,</b> allows a more rational analysis of the interaction phenomena occurring in the reinforced soil.
