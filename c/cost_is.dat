5000|$|By Nature or Traceability:Direct Costs and Indirect <b>costs.</b> Direct <b>Costs</b> <b>are</b> Directly attributable/traceable to Cost object. Direct <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> {{assigned}} to <b>Cost</b> Object. Indirect <b>Costs</b> <b>are</b> not directly attributable/traceable to Cost Object. Indirect <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> allocated or apportioned to cost objects.|$|R
5000|$|Non-manufacturing <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> those <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> not {{directly}} incurred in manufacturing a product. Examples of such <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> salary of sales personnel and advertising expenses. Generally non-manufacturing <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> further classified into two categories: ...|$|R
50|$|Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> {{that change}} in {{proportion}} to the good or service that a business produces. Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also <b>be</b> considered normal <b>costs.</b> Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct <b>costs,</b> however, <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> that can easily be associated with a particular cost object. However, not all variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> direct <b>costs.</b> For example, variable manufacturing overhead <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> variable <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> indirect <b>costs,</b> not direct <b>costs.</b> Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.|$|R

5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> directly related to the shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E

5000|$|Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> whereby {{materials}} and labor may be allocated based on past experience. Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> a classification of costs by time. Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> incurred in the past. Predetermined <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> computed in advance on basis of factors affecting cost elements. In the 19th century and early 20th century time books {{were used to}} register working time, and eventually determine historical costs.|$|R
50|$|Indirect <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> not {{directly}} accountable to a cost object (such as a particular project, facility, function or product). Indirect <b>costs</b> may <b>be</b> either fixed or variable. Indirect costs include administration, personnel and security <b>costs.</b> These <b>are</b> those <b>costs</b> which <b>are</b> {{not directly}} related to production. Some indirect <b>costs</b> may <b>be</b> overhead. But some overhead <b>costs</b> can <b>be</b> directly attributed to a project and <b>are</b> direct <b>costs.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{two-fold}} cost of sex {{was first}} described by John Maynard Smith. The first <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> that in sexually dimorphic species {{only one of}} the two sexes can bear young. (This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many invertebrates.) The second <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes. Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms. The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an ever-changing environment.|$|E

5|$|According to French Senate's Comité des Prix de Revient des {{fabrications}} d'Armement (CPRA) {{cited by}} the daily La Tribune, {{the total cost of}} the AASM program including development costs and the delivery of 2348 kits is €846m. On that basis the per-weapon <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E
5000|$|Resource Costs: Resources {{consist of}} labor, {{equipment}}, materials, subcontractors, trucking, {{and any other}} cost detail items. Labor and equipment <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> internal crew <b>costs,</b> whereas all other resource <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> received from vendors, such as material suppliers, subcontractors, and trucking companies. Labor <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> usually calculated from wages, benefits, burden, and workers compensation. Equipment <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> calculated from purchase price, taxes, fuel consumption, and other operating expenses.|$|R
30|$|Two suffix {{selection}} algorithms are investigated here. In {{the first}} approach, only target <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> used and weights of concatenation <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> set to zero.

30|$|Prices were {{calculated}} and reported in European Euros (€). Since all <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> realised approximately 12  months after treatment, a correction for differential timing of economic <b>costs</b> <b>was</b> not performed. Direct <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> calculated {{using data from}} all of the patients included in the trial, whereas calculation of total <b>costs</b> <b>was</b> limited to those patients who completed the questionnaire. The CI around the mean costs of each treatment and around the difference in <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> obtained using a bootstrap sampling procedure [8]. For this purpose, 2000 random samples with replacement were drawn from the distribution of total costs in the two treatment groups.|$|R

5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E

5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark.

These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E
