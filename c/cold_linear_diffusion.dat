40|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>diffusion</b> along DNA is a {{mechanism}} of enhancing the association rates of proteins to their specific recognition sites on DNA. It {{has been demonstrated}} for several proteins in vitro, but to date in no case in vivo. Here we show that the restriction endonuclease EcoRV slides along the DNA, scanning approximately 1000 bp in one binding event. This process is critically dependent on contacts between amino acid residues of the protein and {{the backbone of the}} DNA. The disruption of single hydrogen bonds and, in particular, the alteration of electrostatic interactions between amino acid side chains of the protein and phosphate groups of the DNA interfere with or abolish effective sliding. The efficiency of <b>linear</b> <b>diffusion</b> is dependent on salt concentration, having a maximum at 50 mM NaCl. These results suggest that a nonspecific and mobile binding mode capable of <b>linear</b> <b>diffusion</b> is dependent on a subtle balance of forces governing the interaction of the enzyme and the DNA.

40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop methods for model {{reduction}} for diffusion processes that exhibit cyclic behavior.

The main idea is to augment the state process for the diffusion with a clock process. For each complex eigenvalue for the original diffusion there exists a real eigenvalue for the augmented process. Results concerning metastability (or quasi-stationarity) are then applied to the augmented process. For the special case of a <b>linear</b> <b>diffusion</b> in two dimensions, this is analogous to analyzing the process in a rotating coordinate frame. The results are illustrated through a <b>linear</b> <b>diffusion,</b> and an empirical model of combustion dynamics. I...|$|R

40|$|It has {{generally}} been assumed that diffusive sediment transport on soil-mantled hillslopes is linearly dependent on hillslope gradient. Fieldwork was done near Santa Barbara, California, to develop a sediment transport equation for bioturbation by the pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae) and {{to determine whether it}} supports <b>linear</b> <b>diffusion.</b> The route taken by the sediment is divided into two parts, a subsurface path followed by a surface path. The first is the transport of soil through the burrow to the burrow opening. The second is the discharge of sediment from the burrow opening onto the hillslope surface. The total volumetric sediment flux, as a function of hillslope gradient, is found to be: qs (cm 3 cmÿ 1 aÿ 1) = 176 (dz/dx) 3 ÿ 189 (dz/ dx) 2 68 (dz/dx) 34 (dz/dx) 04.
