2500|$|Maximum-likelihood {{estimation}} finally transcended heuristic justification in a proof {{published by}} Samuel S. Wilks in 1938, now called [...] "Wilks' theorem". The theorem {{shows that the}} error in the logarithm of likelihood values for estimates from multiple independent samples is χ² distributed, which enables determination of a <b>confidence</b> <b>region</b> around any one estimate of the parameters. The only difficult part of the proof depends on the expected value of the Fisher information matrix, which is provided by a theorem by Fisher. Wilks continued to improve on the generality of the theorem throughout his life, with his most general proof published in 1962.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} statistics is {{the construction of}} <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> for unknown parameters.

This paper describes a new approach, using random sets, which allows users to construct exact <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> without appeal to asymptotic theory. In particular, if the user-specified random set satisfies a certain validity property, <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> obtained by thresholding the induced data-dependent plausibility function are shown to have the desired coverage probability.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the distributed computation of <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> tethered to multidimensional parameter estimation under linear measurement models. In particular, the considered <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> are non-asymptotic, this {{meaning that the}} number of required measurements is finite. Distributed solutions for the computation of non-asymptotic <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> are proposed, suited to wireless sensor networks scenarios. Their performances are compared in terms of required traffic load, both analytically and numerically. The evidence emerging from the conducted investigations is that the best solution for information exchange depends on whether the network topology is structured or unstructured. The effect on the computation of <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> of information diffusion truncation is also examined.

One of the first developments in simultaneous inference, it was devised by Working and Hotelling for the simple linear regression model in 1929. It provides a <b>confidence</b> <b>region</b> for multiple mean responses, that is, it gives {{the upper and lower}} bounds of more than one value of a dependent variable at several levels of the independent variables at a certain confidence level. The resulting confidence bands are known as the Working-Hotelling-Scheffé confidence bands.|$|E

This paper presents alternatives to the ”classical method ” of constructing asymptotically valid <b>confidence</b> <b>regions,</b> which is based on the asymptotic statistical properties of the parameter estimator. It is shown that if alternative test statistics are used, more reliable <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> for finite samples can be obtained.

40|$|The {{standard}} <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> {{based on}} the first-order approximation of quantile regression estimators can be inaccurate in small samples. We show that <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> {{based on the}} smoothed empirical likelihood ratio have coverage errors of order n^{- 1 } and may be Bartlett-corrected to produce regions with an error of order n^{- 2 }, where n denotes the sample size. We further extend these results to censored quantile regression models. Our results are extensions of the previous results of Chen and Hall (1993) to the regression contexts. Also, from the duality of <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> and hypothesis tess, our results imply that the smoothed empirical likelihood <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> might be more accurate in small samples than the <b>confidence</b> <b>regions</b> that can be constructed from the smoothed bootstrap method recently suggested by Horowitz (1998).

50|$|A companion, {{initially}} {{thought to}} be an extrasolar planet in a 39.6-day orbit was discovered in 1997 by observing the star's radial velocity variations. This detection method only gives a lower limit on the true mass of the companion. In 2001, preliminary Hipparcos astrometrical satellite data indicated that the orbital inclination of the star's companion was 0.5°, nearly face-on, implying that its mass was as much as 115 times Jupiter's. This was confirmed in 2011 using a new reduction of the astrometric data, with an updated mass value of 169.7 times Jupiter, with a 3σ <b>confidence</b> <b>region</b> 100.1 to 199.6 Jupiter masses.

40|$|For a {{response}} surface experiment, an approximate hypothesis test and an associated <b>confidence</b> <b>region</b> is {{proposed for the}} minimizing (or maximizing) factor-level configuration. Carter at al. (1982) show that confidence regions for optimal conditions provide {{a way to make}} decisions about "therapeutic synergism". The response surface may be constrained to be within a specified, bounded region. These constraint regions can be quite general. This allows for more realistic constraint modeling and a wide degree of applicability, including constraints occurring in mixture experiments. The usual assumption of a quadratic model is also generalized to include any regression model that is linear in the model parameters. An intimate connection is established between this <b>confidence</b> <b>region</b> and the Box-Hunter (1954) <b>confidence</b> <b>region</b> for a stationary point.
