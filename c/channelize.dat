500|$|The city of Roanoke, Virginia had {{experienced}} a series of major floods that affected. The floods caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 prompted a study that would <b>channelize</b> [...] of the Roanoke River to increase water capacity. After the 1985 floods, the city council sought assistance from the USACE to build flood walls and improve river flow to mitigate against future flooding. The agency estimated that the project would cut the damage in half for a flood similar to the 1985 one. The cost for the project was initially project to be $34.4million, of which the city was expected to pay $14.3million. Private land donations and other financial sources provided about $6.8million of the cost, while the remaining $7.5million was covered by a bond, approved in an April 1989 single-issue referendum. This was the first such referendum for the city, and passed with 56.6% in support amid a voter turnout of 19.6%. The bond would be repaid by a 2% raise of the utility tax. Construction began in 1990, and that year a flood warning system was completed. In 1993, Roanoke's raw sewage plant and hospital finished flood proofing. The bulk {{of the project was}} finished in December 2011 when the final terrain cuts were made. When the project was completed, the USGS estimated that the annual damage from flooding decreased from $5.8million to $2.7million, and that the work prevented major floods in November 2009 from Hurricane Ida and January 2013. Also in the state, the General Assembly passed the [...] "Virginia Flood Damage Reduction Act" [...] in 1989, partly due to the flooding from 1985; this coordinated all work related to flood prevention throughout the state into one department.|$|E

In response to the floods, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies began to <b>channelize</b> local streams in concrete, and built many new flood control dams and debris basins. These works have been instrumental in protecting Southern California from subsequent flooding events, such as in 1969 and 2005, which both had a larger volume than the 1938 flood.|$|E
40|$|Certain lowland streams have {{experienced}} prehistorical and historical cycles of aggradation, occlusion, degradation, headward incision, and renewed aggradation. Historical cycles {{appear to be}} related to human activities. A case study is presented of the Yalobusha River in Mississippi with emphasis on the effects of blockage and removal on aquatic habitats and fish. The adjacent Skuna River, which was <b>channelized</b> and unblocked, was used in space for time substitution to infer effects of blockage removal on the Yalobusha. Variables describing physical aquatic habitat and fish were sampled from three groups of river reaches: unblocked <b>channelized,</b> <b>channelized</b> and blocked, and naturally sinuous. Fish collections were used to compute six indicators of ecological integrity. At baseflow, mean water depths were an order of magnitude lower in the unblocked <b>channelized</b> stream than for the others. In-channel aquatic habitat volume per unit valley length was 5, 85, and 283 m 3 :m for the <b>channelized,</b> blocked <b>channelized,</b> and natural reaches, respectively. Mean values for all six ecological indicators were lowest for the <b>channelized</b> group. Species richness was greatest for the <b>channelized</b> blocked reach. The ecological indicators displayed gradients in response to the range of observed physical conditions. Management of corridors susceptible to the cycle described above should involve a blend of measures designed to conserve higher quality habitats.

Facing four battalions of the 708th Volksgrenadier Division (part of General Max Grimmeiss' LXIV Army Corps) supported by heavy tank destroyers and artillery, the 1st Division's 1st Brigade fought in conditions similar to that experienced by the Americans to the south. The Germans mounted a defense in depth, using positions in the villages and forests to command the open ground to their front and liberally planting land mines to slow and <b>channelize</b> the French advance. Two battalions of the 708th Volksgrenadier Division counterattacked the French bridgeheads over the Ill River around 17:00 on 23 January but were repulsed. Wishing to avoid dug-in German infantry and armor in the Elsenheim Woods (...) , General Garbay directed the 1st Brigade to concentrate their advance along the road from Illhaeusern (...) to Elsenheim. On 26–27 January, the 1st Brigade concentrated on opening this route and skirting the obstacle posed by the Elsenheim Woods, with a key attack into the woods made by the 3rd Battalion of the March Regiment of the French Foreign Legion (R.M.L.E.) on 27 January. At heavy cost, the village of Grussenheim (...) was taken on 28 January by supporting tanks of the French 2nd Armored Division. Against crumbling German resistance, the French surged forward, taking Elsenheim and Marckolsheim (...) on 31 January and reaching the Rhine River the following day.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{acquisition}} {{performance of}} the channel-ized receiver for ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitted reference (TR) system is presented. Instead of sampling the received UWB signal with a single ADC as in a conventional fullband receiver, the <b>channelized</b> receiver digitizes with multiple slow ADCs, each of which samples a partial band of the UWB sig-nal. In this paper, we show that the frequency <b>channelized</b> receiver naturally leads to fast acquisition. In the <b>channelized</b> receiver, the reduced bandwidth in each subband widens the correlation peak, allowing the search increment to be corre-spondingly increased. Consequently, the search space in the <b>channelized</b> receiver is reduced, resulting in significantly faster acquisition time than in a fullband receiver. ...|$|R

Forty-five fish species were collected in natural reaches, but only 24 species were collected in <b>channelized</b> reaches. Cyprinus carpio and Dorosoma cepedianum constituted 40 and 20 percent of the total fish biomass in <b>channelized</b> reaches, respectively, but only 22 and 2 percent of the total biomass in natural reaches. The mean weight of total fishes and game fishes only per surface ha in natural sections were 276 and 46 kg, respectively, but these values in <b>channelized</b> sections were only 88 and 2 kg, respectively. Mean species diversity indices for natural and <b>channelized</b> sections of the Cache River were 3. 1 and 1. 8, respectively, and mean redundancy values for these sections were. 30 and. 55, respectively.

40|$|Rock {{avalanches}} {{are extremely}} rapid, massive flow-like movements of fragmented rock. The travel {{path of the}} rock avalanches may be confined by channels in some cases, which {{are referred to as}} <b>channelized</b> rock avalanches. <b>Channelized</b> rock avalanches are potentially dangerous due to their difficult-to-predict travel distance. In this study, we constructed a dataset with detailed characteristic parameters of 38 <b>channelized</b> rock avalanches triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake using the visual interpretation of remote sensing imagery, field investigation and literature review. Based on this dataset, we assessed the influence of different factors on the runout distance and developed prediction models of the <b>channelized</b> rock avalanches using the multivariate regression method. The results suggested that the movement of <b>channelized</b> rock avalanche was dominated by the landslide volume, total relief and channel gradient. The performance of both models was then tested with an independent validation dataset of eight rock avalanches that were induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the M s 7. 0 Lushan earthquake and heavy rainfall in 2013, showing acceptable good prediction results. Therefore, the travel-distance prediction models for <b>channelized</b> rock avalanches constructed in this study are applicable and reliable for predicting the runout of similar rock avalanches in other regions...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{restoration}} of channel meandering and of groyne structures on physical variables and river-dwelling macroinvertebrates {{were examined in}} a lowland river, the Shibetsu River in Northern Japan. The lowland segment of the Shibetsu River, which previously meandered, was straightened by channelization and groynes installed on some portions of the <b>channelized</b> reach. In 2002, the channelization works were partly reversed to improve the degraded river ecosystem. Physical environment variables and macroinvertebrate community structure and composition were compared among reconstructed meanders and <b>channelized</b> reaches with and without groynes. The shear stress of the river edge in reconstructed meanders and groyne reaches was lower than that in a <b>channelized</b> reach. In addition, the edge habitat near the stream bank created by the reconstructed meander and groyne reaches had higher total density and taxon richness of macroinvertebrates {{than those of the}} <b>channelized</b> reach. Restoration provided a relatively stable edge habitat, contributing to the recovery of macroinvertebrate communities in such <b>channelized</b> lowland rivers. The placement of groynes can be an effective method of in-stream habitat restoration for macroinvertebrates...|$|R
