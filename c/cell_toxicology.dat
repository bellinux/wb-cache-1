40|$|AbstractMitochondrial {{dysfunction}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the <b>cell</b> <b>toxicology</b> and death decision. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of three organocompounds (ebselen [Ebs], diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe) 2] and diphenyl ditelluride [(PhTe) 2]) on mitochondrial complexes (I, II, I–III, II–III and IV) activity from rat liver and kidney to determine their potential role as molecular targets of organochalcogens. All studied organochalcogens caused a statistically significant inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I activity. Ebs and (PhTe) 2 caused a statistically significant inhibition of the mitochondrial complex II activity in both hepatic and renal membranes. Hepatic mitochondrial complex II activity was practically unchanged by (PhSe) 2, whereas it significantly inhibited renal complex II activity. Mitochondrial complex IV activity was practically unchanged by the organochalcogens. Furthermore, organochalcogens inhibited the mitochondrial respiration supported by complex I or complex II substrates. The inhibitory effect of Ebs, (PhSe) 2 and (PhTe) 2 on mitochondrial complex I was prevented by NADH, but it was not prevented by catalase (CAT) and/or superoxide dismutase (SOD). Additionally, the organochalcogens-induced inhibition of complex I and II was completely reversed by reduced glutathione (GSH). In conclusion, Ebs, (PhSe) 2 and (PhTe) 2 were more effective inhibitors of renal and hepatic mitochondrial complex I than complex II, whereas complexes III and IV were little modified by these compounds. Taking into account the presented results, we suggest that organochalcogen-induced mitochondrial complexes I and II inhibition can be mediated by their thiol oxidation activity, i. e., Ebs, (PhSe) 2 and (PhTe) 2 can oxidize critical thiol groups from mitochondrial complexes I and II. So, mitochondrial dysfunction can be considered an important factor in the toxicity of Ebs, (PhSe) 2 and (PhTe) 2...|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{irritants}} {{may result}} in airway smooth muscle (ASM) depolarization and bronchoconstriction. We examined the effect of formalin on membrane potentials in human ASM in two types of in vitro preparations: strip preparations, which contain functional sensory and motor nerve endings and cultured cells, which lack these nerve endings due to the tissue dissociation process. Depolarizations occurred in atropine-treated strip preparations in response to formalin exposures, but not in similarly-treated cultured cells, suggesting a role for non-cholinergic mediators in formalin-induced depolarization. It is suggested that formalin may act as an irritant to produce bronchoconstriction that is mediated by the release of endogenous substance P (SP) from peripheral sensory nerve endings. This is supported by our observation that exogenous SP produced depolarizations of a magnitude similar to those produced by formalin in both strip preparations and cultured cells. In addition, capsaicin, which releases endogenous SP from nerve endings, produced depolarizations of a magnitude similar to formalin in strip preparations, but was without effect in cultured <b>cells.</b> <b>Toxicology</b> and Industrial Health 2006; 22 : 59 / 63.

This paper describes the latest technique in pathway-focused gene expression profiling: the RT 2 Profiler PCR Array System from SABiosciences. The PCR Array System is comprised of a 96 - or 384 -well plate containing qPCR primer assays (84 pathway- or disease-focused genes, 5 housekeeping genes, and 3 replicate controls), instrument-specific SYBR ® Green master mix, and a first strand cDNA synthesis kit.

In the first study, the PCR Arrays were used to profile gene expression changes due to compound-induced cytotoxicity in liver cells. We identified idiosyncratic patterns of expression changes with three drugs that induced liver toxicity, suggesting different mechanisms of action for liver toxicity. In the second study, the expression of cancer-related extracellular matrix and cellular adhesion genes were compared between breast tumors and normal tissue.

The use of Sn-based perovskite has been implemented in transistor with excellent charge motilities [88]. The application of Sn in perovskite solar cells usually involved the alloying of Sn/Pb with the recent study recording a 15 % efficiency in oxygen deficient environment {{as well as in}} tandem applications [77, 89, 90, 91]. Ogomi et al. {{was one of the first}} to vary the composition of Pb:Sn ratio and tested the performance of perovskite solar cells [78]. They had proved the possibility of Sn could be a possible option as the absorber material for solar cells, but also showed that pure Sn perovskite solar cells did not produce any photovoltaic performance. It was also demonstrated that Sn would able to intrinsically maintain its 2 [*]+[*]oxidation state with the presence of Pb in the absorber layer. Nevertheless, Snaith et al. has fabricated a totally Pb-free perovskite solar cells using MASnI 3 as the perovskite light absorber with encapsulation and in nitrogen environment glovebox to prevent the degradation of the Sn-based perovskite absorber [49]. The study also mentioned the stability issues of Sn-based perovskite where a discoloration was observed within seconds after the absorber layer was exposed to the ambient atmosphere due to the intrinsic property of Sn 2 + to oxidise rapidly to Sn 4 + in the presence of oxygen [69]. However, fabrication of a complete cell was successful while in the nitrogen environment.

Meanwhile, the use of stem cells for drug screening and toxicology studies are also beneficial to biomedical science. To cure muscular dystrophy no efficient therapy exists. Stem cells {{can be used to}} replace the affected tissue with newly formed fibers. Besides biomedical applications, stem cell technology can also be used for the generation of cultured meat for human consumption (‘in vitro meat’). By this we can offer an alternative to the bio-industry by using stem cell technology for large expansion of farm animal-derived stem cells and subsequently the formation of muscle tissue in an in vitro culture system. In this PhD project we observed that muscle tissue is a rich source of various stem and progenitor cell types. We optimized stem cell isolation protocols and developed methods for the characterization for porcine muscle stem cells. Thereby, we increased our knowledge concerning the regulation of stem cell maintenance and their development potential. By optimization of the in vitro culture conditions for porcine muscle stem cells we provide a cell culture system in which we improved the maintenance of the stem cell characteristics. Furthermore, based on protein expression we showed that we could select for a highly myogenic stem cell population from porcine muscle tissue.

In addition hPSC treatment with the Src family kinase inhibitor SU 6656 modulated b-catenin localization and produced an enriched population of simple epithelial cells under defined culture conditions. SU 6656 strongly upregulated expression of cytokeratins 18 and 8 (K 18 /K 8), which are expressed in simple epithelial cells, while repressing expression of the pluripotency gene Oct 4.

40|$|The human {{central nervous}} system, {{one of the}} most complex organ systems anatomically and physiologically in the human body, is the body control center which manages and {{coordinates}} functions of all different organ systems. The lack of effective treatments and therapeutic intervention make injuries and disorders associated with the central nervous system {{one of the most}} dangerous and fatal health conditions worldwide. The adult nervous system has a limited capability of self-repair and regeneration following either a neurological disorder or injury. Despite being limited and ineffective in initiating recovery from injuries and disorders, this property opened the doors for a new direction of research aimed at investigating the possibility of developing therapies and treatments for central nervous system injuries and disorders based on the concept of regeneration and cell transplantations. Stem cells have gained significant public attention over the past decade due to their differentiation capabilities and potential utilization in clinical applications. The ability to differentiate stem cells into neural lineages including neurons and glial cells, highlighted their potential role as a therapeutic tool for central nervous system injuries and disorders. The main aim of this thesis is to show that umbilical cord blood stem cells are a potential source of cells that could be used therapeutically in central nervous system injuries and disorders. A distinct population of cells has been purified from human umbilical cord blood. These cells have been characterized and differentiated in-vitro into neuron-like cells using fully defined sequential neuronal induction protocol. The differentiated cells were shown to have similar morphological and functional properties to developing central nervous system endogenous neurons using several different techniques, including immunocytochemistry, real-time PCR, cDNA arrays and calcium imaging. The results highlight the potential role of umbilical cord blood stem cells as a therapeutic tool for central nervous system injuries and disorders for which current mode of therapy is inadequate.

The technology of reprogramming somatic human cells into induced-pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and maturation of hiPSC-derived cells, which allows the production of cardiomyocytes and other cell types in unlimited amounts, has become popular in recent years as an alternative to primary rodent cells for disease modeling, toxicology and tissue engineering.

40|$|Introduction: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a {{significant}} threat to human health and {{a major problem in}} drug development. It is hard to predict due to its idiosyncratic nature and which does not show up in animal trials. Hepatic adaptive stress response pathway activation is generally observed in drug-induced liver injury. Dynamical pathway modeling has the potential to foresee adverse effects of drugs before they go in trial. Ordinary differential equation modeling can offer mechanistic insight, and allows us to study the dynamical behavior of stress pathways involved in DILI. Areas covered: This review provides an overview on the progress of the dynamical modeling of stress and death pathways pertinent to DILI, i. e. pathways relevant for oxidative stress, inflammatory stress, DNA damage, unfolded proteins, heat shock and apoptosis. We also discuss the required steps for applying such modeling to the liver. Expert opinion: Despite the strong progress made {{since the turn of the}} century, models of stress pathways have only rarely been specifically applied to describe pathway dynamics for DILI. We argue that with minor changes, in some cases only to parameter values, many of these models can be repurposed for application in DILI research. Combining both dynamical models with in vitro testing might offer novel screening methods for the harmful side-effects of drugs.

Threee of these compounds were studied in detail and {{found to be more}} active than the inhibition seen with fish oil fatty acid 22 : 6 n- 3. Interestingly these compounds unlike 22 : 6 n- 3 were poor stimulators of the human neutrophil respiratory burst, an additional advantage in their use as anti-inflammatory agents. Examination of one of these three, β-oxa 2 I: 3 n- 3, in in vivo models of chronic and acute inflammation showed that the fatty acids was highly inhibitory in both types of inflammatory responses. Thus the β-oxa 27 : 3 n- 3 inhibited the footpad swelling induced by sheep red blood cell antigens in a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction {{as well as in the}} caffageenan induced paw inflammation. This finding with DTH which is dependent on T lymphocytes is consistent with the ability of β-oxa 2 l: 3 n- 3 to inhibit Thl type cytokine production. While the reason for its effects on the calageenan induced inflammation are less clear in this involves predominantly neutrophil infiltration, this reaction also has some T cell dependency. Studies on tissue distribution of the fatty acid, showed that β-oxa 2 I: 3 n- 3 was incorporated into membrane phospholipids of liver and blood <b>cells.</b> Preliminary <b>toxicology</b> studies also demonstrated that βoxa 2 l: 3 n- 3 was well tolerated by the animals as several chemical and biochemical parameters of liver and kidney function remained within the normal range. The mechanism of inhibition of T lymphocyte responses were in the main identified. The β-oxa 2 l: 3 n- 3 acted at a post receptor level affecting signals modules critical for lymphocyte activation and cytokine production. The fatty acid caused inhibition of PHA-PMA induced translocation of PKC-βI and PKC-ε, but not PKC-α, PKC-βII or pKC-θ. This was further delineated to show inhibition of downstream ERK pathway activation but not the JNK or p 3 g pathways. This work has identified a new class of anti-inflammatory compounds which are based on PUFA. The action of the fatty acids is through the selective inhibition of the pKC-βl/ε and ERK signalling module. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Dept. of Paediatrics, 200...|$|R

The foundation of the device is a silicon-glass multiwell microplate (also referred as microchip) directly compatible with fluorescence microscopy. The initial microchip design involved thousands of square wells of sizes up to 80 µm, for screening large numbers of cell-cell interactions at the single cell level. Biocompatibility and confinement tests proved the feasibility of the idea, and further investigation showed the conservation of immune cellular processes within the wells. Although the system is very reliable for screening, limitations related to synchronization of the interaction events, and the inability to maintain conjugations for long time periods, {{led to the development}} of a novel ultrasonic manipulation multiwell microdevice. The main components of the ultrasonic device is a 100 -well silicon-glass microchip and an ultrasonic transducer. The transducer is used for ultrasonic actuation on the chip with a frequency causing half-wave resonances in each of the wells (2. 0 - 2. 5 MHz for wells with sizes 300 - 350 µm). Therefore, cells in suspension are directed by acoustic radiation forces towards a pressure node formed in the center of each well. This method allows simultaneous aggregation of cells in all wells and sustains cells confined within a small area for long time periods (even up to several days). The biological target of investigation in this Thesis is the natural killer (NK) cells and their functional properties. NK cells belong to the lymphatic group and they are important factors for host defense and immune regulation. They are characterized by the ability to interact with virus infected cells and cancer cells upon contact, and under suitable conditions they can induce target cell death. We have utilized the ultrasonic microdevice to induce NK-target cell interactions at the single cell level. Our results confirm a heterogeneity within IL- 2 activated NK cell populations, with some cells being inactive, while others are capable to kill quickly and in a consecutive manner. Furthermore, we have integrated the ultrasonic microdevice in a temperature regulation system that allows to actuate with high-voltage ultrasound, but still sustain the cell physiological temperature. Using this system we have been able to induce formation of up to 100 solid tumors (HepG 2 cells) in parallel without using surface modification or hydrogels. Finally, we used the tumors as targets for investigating NK cells ability to infiltrate and kill solid tumors.   To summarize, a method is presented for investigating individual NK cell behavior against target cells and solid tumors. Although we have utilized our technique to investigate NK cells, there is no limitation of the target of investigation. In the future, the device could be used for any type of cells where interactions at the single cell level can reveal critical information, but also to form solid tumors of primary cancer <b>cells</b> for <b>toxicology</b> studies.

40|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} and/or liver malignancies {{have been}} nominated as the 5 th {{leading cause of}} death worldwide. The WHO reported, in 2006, that 20 million people around the globe suffer from some form or other of severe liver illness. The ultimate fate of end-stage liver disorders is hepatic dysfunction and eventually organ failure. The only curative mode of management for liver failure is liver transplantation, which is subject to many limitations. Novel alternatives, such as artificial and bio-artificial support devices only aid in temporary replacement of some liver function until an organ is available for transplantation. These newer modalities also have drawbacks or remain experimental and still demand further controlled trials to allow proof of concept and safety before transferring them to the bedside. Regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy has recently shown promise in the management of various human diseases. Recent reports of stem cell plasticity and its multipotentiality has raised hopes of stem cell therapy offering exciting therapeutic possibilities for patients with chronic liver disease. With the understanding that stem cells might not just be about making organs ex vivo, but also regenerating a patients own tissues; a concept is now developing to use stem cells to treat patients with serious disease conditions that are terminal or where conventional modes of treatment are insufficient. There exists a choice of stem cells that have been reported to be capable of self-renewal and differentiation to hepato-biliary cell lineages both in vitro and in vivo. These include: rodent and human embryonic stem cells, bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, umbilical cord blood stem cells, foetal liver progenitor cell and adult liver progenitor cells. It may, however, be argued that with a global population of 6 billion people and a global birth rate in access of 130 million per year, the products of birth,umbilical cord and cord blood, possibly provide the most readily accessible and ethically sound alternative source of stem cells. The differentiated stem cells can be potentially exploited for gene therapy, cellular transplant, bio-artificial liver-assisted devices, drug toxicology testing and use as an in vitro model to understand the developmental biology of the liver. In this study UCB-derived nucleated cells and umbilical cord-derived Mesenchymal stem cells were exploited for liver differentiation ex vivo. These cells were cultured on extracellular matrix (ECM) protein-coated dishes and inserted into ECM incorporated scaffold 3 D culture systems. Stimulation with exogenous mitogens and morphogens to induce hepatic histogenesis was experimented. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed the expression of markers specific for: hepatic stem cells (CK- 19), hepatoblasts (AFP) and 4 mature hepatic and biliary epithelium markers including: albumin (ALB), and cytokeratin- 18 (CK- 18) and cytokeratin- 19 (CK- 19) and cytokeratin- 7 (CK- 7) respectively. The differentiated cells displayed several features of hepatic cell kinetics and metabolic activities, including glycogen synthesis, uptake of Indocyanine green dye and cytochrome P 450 activity. These cells may prove to have potential in developing cellular therapy for various liver disorders for which the current mode of therapy is inadequate and also provide an adequate in vitro model of parenchymal liver <b>cells</b> in <b>toxicology</b> and in bioartificial liver research.
