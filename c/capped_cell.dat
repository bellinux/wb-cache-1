40|$|We {{examined}} the sequence, order or steps of hygienic behavior (HB) from pin-killed pupae until {{the removal of}} them by the bees. We conducted our study with four colonies of Apis mellifera carnica in Germany and made four repetitions. The pin-killing method was used for evaluation of the HB of bees. The data were collected every 2 h after perforation, totaling 13 observations. Additionally, for one hygienic colony and another non-hygienic colony, individual analyses of each dead pupa were made at every observation, including all details, steps or sequences of HB. The bees recognize the cells containing dead pupae within 2 h after perforation, initially making {{a hole in the}} capping, which is the beginning of HB. Uncapping of the dead brood cell reached maximum values from 4 to 6 h after perforation; after 24 h, practically all cells were already uncapped. Another variable, called brood partially removed, was analyzed 4 h after perforation, after the cells had been perforated, which involved uncapping, followed by partial or total removal of the brood. Maximum values of brood partially removed were found 10 h after perforation, though such cells could be found up to 48 h after perforation. The most frequent sequence of events in both colonies was: <b>capped</b> <b>cell</b> -> punctured cell. brood partially removed -> empty cell. A new model of three pairs of recessive genes (uncapping u 1, u 2 and remover r) was proposed in order to explain the genetic control of the HB in Apis mellifera. We recommend evaluating HB 24 h after perforation and using a correction factor to compensate for control removal levels. We found a series of details of HB, which allow a study of how various factors may affect the sequence of the activities involved in HB and investigation of the genetics that controls this process.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Protocadherin-PC (PCDH-PC) {{expression}} is upregulated in apoptosis-resistant sublines of the LNCaP human prostate cancer (<b>CaP)</b> <b>cell</b> line. Here, we assess {{the role of}} PCDH-PC in <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> and its mRNA expression in human prostate tissues. METHODS: LNCaP cells transfected with PCDH-PC were tested {{for their ability to}} grow in vitro and in vivo in androgen-deprived conditions. PCDH-PC mRNA expression was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: PCDH-PC expression induced Wnt signaling in <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> and permitted androgen-independent growth of hormone-sensitive <b>CaP</b> <b>cells.</b> Expression of PCDH-PC-homologous transcripts was low and restricted to some epithelial cells in normal tissue and to <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> in tumors. However, hormone-resistant <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> expressed significantly higher levels of PCDH-PC-related mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a novel mechanism for the progression of CaP involving expression of PCDH-PC. This novel protocadherin induces Wnt signaling, promotes malignant behavior and hormone-resistance of <b>CaP</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Germline {{stem cells}} in the Drosophila ovary are {{maintained}} by a somatic niche. The niche is structurally and functionally complex and contains four cell types, the escort, cap, and terminal filament cells and the newly identified transition cell. We find that the large Maf transcription factor Traffic jam (Tj) is essential for determining niche cell fates and architecture, enabling each niche in the ovary to support a normal complement of 2 - 3 germline stem cells. In particular, we focused {{on the question of}} how <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> form. <b>Cap</b> <b>cells</b> express Tj and are considered the key component of a mature germline stem cell niche. We conclude that Tj controls the specification of <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> as the complete loss of Tj function caused the development of additional terminal filament cells at the expense of <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> and terminal filament <b>cells</b> developed <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> characteristics when induced to express Tj. Further, we propose that Tj controls the morphogenetic behavior of <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> as they adopted the shape and spatial organization of terminal filament cells but otherwise appeared to retain their fate when Tj expression was only partially reduced. Our data indicate that Tj contributes to the establishment of germline stem cells by promoting the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> fate, and controls the stem cell-carrying capacity of the niche by regulating niche architecture. Analysis of the interactions between Tj and the Notch (N) pathway indicates that Tj and N have distinct functions in the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> specification program. We propose that formation of <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> depends on the combined activities of Tj and the N pathway, with Tj promoting the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> fate by blocking the terminal filament cell fate, and N supporting <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> by preventing the escort cell fate and/or controlling the number of <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> precursors...|$|R
40|$|Accessory cells, {{which include}} glia and other cell types that develop in close {{association}} with neurons, {{have been shown}} to play key roles in regulating neuron development. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. A particularly intimate association between accessory cells and neurons is found in insect chordotonal organs. We have found that the <b>cap</b> <b>cell,</b> one of two accessory cells of v'ch 1, a chordotonal organ in the Drosophila embryo, strongly influences the development of its associated neuron. As it projects a long dorsally directed cellular extension, the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> reorients the dendrite of the v'ch 1 neuron and tows its <b>cell</b> body dorsally. <b>Cap</b> <b>cell</b> morphogenesis is regulated by Netrin-A, which is produced by epidermal cells at the destination of the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> process. In Netrin-A mutant embryos, the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> forms an aberrant, ventrally directed process. As the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> maintains a close physical connection with the tip of the dendrite, the latter is dragged into an abnormal position and orientation, and the neuron fails to undergo its normal dorsal migration. Misexpression of Netrin-A in oenocytes, secretory cells that lie ventral to the <b>cap</b> <b>cell,</b> leads to aberrant <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> morphogenesis, suggesting that Netrin-A acts as an instructive cue to direct the growth of the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> process. The netrin receptor Frazzled is required for normal <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> morphogenesis, and mutant rescue experiments indicate that it acts in a cell-autonomous fashion...|$|R
40|$|The Alkali Metal Thermal to Electric Converter (AMTEC) is {{a static}} energy {{conversion}} device that operates at high thermal to electric conversion efficiencies that are essentially independent of size, have reached 19 % {{and are expected}} to reach 25 % to 30 % in 1997. AMTEC systems have been chosen by NASA and DOE for spacecraft applications and have considerable promise {{for a wide variety of}} terrestrial applications. Reduction of parasitic heat losses in AMTEC systems related to radiative heat transfer from the hot side to the condenser can make a substantial contribution to system efficiency. Through design, analysis and the fabrication and testing of cells and systems, the proposed program to develop a Directed Reflectivity Condenser (DRC) has investigated the feasibility of an improved AMTEC condenser component. Phase 1 work showed the potential for adding from 4 % to 7 % to overall system efficiency for identical operating conditions using the concept. A detailed thermal analysis of several DRC <b>capped</b> <b>cell</b> designs was carried out and some of the conditions under which a DRC, used as the condenser at an end cap of a cylindrical converter, can reduce thermal radiation related losses were determined. A model experimental converter was built and tested to compare DRC and planar condenser surfaces. The results of both analysis and experiment indicate that for moderate aspect ratios of a cylindrical, end condensed converter, the DRC can reduce overall thermal losses by up to 4 %. The initial effort in Phase 2 extended the analysis to a novel 150 watt radial AMTEC cell design. This analysis indicated that for the effective aspect ratio of this new converter design, the system performance at the 100 + watt level was not significantly improved by use of a DRC type condenser surface. Further analyses however showed that for cylindrical, end-condensed converters, optimized for use with internal radiation shields, the use of DRC surfaces on the side walls of the converter could be more effective than on the condenser end surface itself. The experimental work in Phase 2 was intended to incorporate a DRC into this cell design and use its measured performance to refine the state-of-the-art AMTEC analytical models. Because the analysis had indicated that the new radial converter design, which may be useful for systems at the {approx} 100 watt level was not much assisted by the DRC properties, this program was redirected toward the simpler cylindrical converter design with the corner cube surfaces on the side walls. The Phase II program was proposed and planned with a funding level substantially below the maximum potentially available for Phase II programs at that time. At the time, there were two other funded government sponsored programs at AMPS for which positive results of the analyses described in this report were expected to lead to incorporation of the DRC concept into converters scheduled to be built for these programs. The programs of interest were the Air Force program titled ''Radiation Tolerant, Eclipse Compatible, Solar AMTEC System'' (F 29601 - 99 -C- 0132) and the DOE/NASA Advanced Radioisotope Power System (ARPS) program. Shortly after its start, the Air Force program was canceled due to elimination of AF SBIR funds at AFRL and the ARPS program was reduced to a level that could not support introduction of novel concept testing. As a result of these two circumstances, the direct testing of the DRC concept in a full up converter was not completed in the Phase II period...|$|E

40|$|The human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) replicates to high titers {{in primary}} human fibroblast cell cultures. A variety of primary human cells and some tumor-derived cell lines do also support permissive HCMV replication, yet at low levels. Cell lines established by transfection of the transforming functions of adenoviruses have been notoriously resistant to HCMV replication and progeny production. Here, we provide first-time {{evidence that a}} permanent cell line immortalized by adenovirus type 5 E 1 A and E 1 B (CAP) is supporting the full HCMV replication cycle and is releasing infectious progeny. The <b>CAP</b> <b>cell</b> line had previously been established from amniotic fluid cells which were likely derived from membranes of the developing fetus.

In the case of currently used egg-based vaccine manufacturing technology an average production campaign of e. g. influenza vaccines takes up to 6 months. In contrast to the egg-based production technology, cell culture-based systems show the potential to drastically shorten production cycles and improve quality of the vaccine regarding e. g. glycosylation of immunogenic antigens and risk of animal contaminants.

40|$|AbstractAdult {{stem cells}} reside in {{specialized}} microenvironments, or niches, {{that are essential}} for their function in vivo. Stem cells are physically attached to the niche, which provides secreted factors that promote their self-renewal and proliferation. Despite intense research {{on the role of}} the niche in regulating stem cell function, much less is known about how the niche itself is controlled. We previously showed that insulin signals directly stimulate germline stem cell (GSC) division and indirectly promote GSC maintenance via the niche in Drosophila. Insulin-like peptides are required for maintenance of <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> (a major component of the niche) via modulation of Notch signaling, and they also control attachment of GSCs to <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> and E-cadherin levels at the cap cell–GSC junction. Here, we further dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these processes. We show that insulin and Notch ligands directly stimulate <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> to maintain their numbers and indirectly promote GSC maintenance. We also report that insulin signaling, via phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and FOXO, intrinsically controls the competence of <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> to respond to Notch ligands and thereby be maintained. Contrary to a previous report, we also find that Notch ligands originated in GSCs are not required either for Notch activation in the GSC niche, or for <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> or GSC maintenance. Instead, the niche itself produces ligands that activate Notch signaling within <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> promoting stability of the GSC niche. Finally, insulin signals control cap cell–GSC attachment independently of their role in Notch signaling. These results are potentially relevant to many systems in which Notch signaling modulates stem cells and demonstrate that complex interactions between local and systemic signals are required for proper stem cell niche function...|$|R

Growth characteristics of <b>CaP</b> <b>cell</b> lines transiently and stably expressing Lin 28 were examined. The clonogenic ability of <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> expressing Lin 28 was determined by colony formation and soft agar assays. Increase in expression of AR and subsequent increase in transcription of AR-target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, luciferase assays, and ELISA.

Each gland is composed of a voluminous, flask-shaped basal cell, embedded in the leaf and a smaller, dome-shaped <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> that protrudes beyond the epidermis. An ornamented, porose cuticle overlies the protruding gland. The dense cytoplasm of the basal cell is partitioned into channels by a system of paired membranes which originate from invaginations of the plasma membrane, adjacent to the common wall between basal and <b>cap</b> <b>cells.</b> Closely associated with the partitioning membranes are numerous mitochondria, microtubules and endoplasmic reticulum.

The dense cytoplasm of the <b>cap</b> <b>cell</b> lacks partitioning membranes, but contains numerous small vacuoles and a concentration of organelles {{in close proximity to}} the outer surface. The basal cell appears to be suitably located and designed to access and direct ions from surrounding mesophyll and epidermal cells into the channels formed by the partitioning membranes.

40|$|International audienceSphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) plays {{important}} roles in cell proliferation, differentiation or survival mainly through its surface G-protein-coupled receptors S 1 P 1 - 5. Bone represents the major site of metastasis for prostate cancer (<b>CaP)</b> <b>cells,</b> which rely on bone-derived factors to support their proliferation and resistance to therapeutics. In the present work {{we have found that}} conditioned medium (CM) from the MC 3 T 3 osteoblastic cell line or primary murine and human osteoblast-like cells, as well as co-culture with MC 3 T 3 stimulate proliferation of CaP lines in S 1 P-dependent manner. In addition, osteoblastic-derived S 1 P induces resistance of <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> to therapeutics including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. When S 1 P release from osteoblastic cells is decreased (inhibition of SphK 1, knock-down of SphK 1 or the S 1 P transporter, Spns 2 by siRNA) or secreted S 1 P neutralized with anti-S 1 P antibody, the proliferative and survival effects of osteoblasts on <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> are abolished. Because of the paracrine nature of the signaling, we studied the role of the S 1 P receptors expressed on <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> in the communication with S 1 P secreted by osteoblasts. Strategies aimed at down-regulating S 1 P 1, S 1 P 2 or S 1 P 3 (siRNA, antagonists), established the exclusive role of the S 1 P/S 1 P 1 signaling between osteoblasts and <b>CaP</b> <b>cells.</b> Bone metastases from CaP are associated with osteoblastic differentiation resulting in abnormal bone formation. We show that the autocrine S 1 P/S 1 P 3 signaling is central during differentiation to mature osteoblasts by regulating Runx 2 level, a key transcription factor involved in osteoblastic maturation. Importantly, differentiated osteoblasts exhibited enhanced secretion of S 1 P and further stimulated <b>CaP</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation in a S 1 P-dependent manner.

The polyphenol piceatannol has shown inhibition against tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Whether piceatannol also exerts activity on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase involved in growth control of eukaryotic cells, is not known. In this study, we tested the effects of piceatannol on proliferation of androgen-dependent (AD) LNCaP and androgen-independent (AI) DU 145 and PC- 3 prostate cancer (<b>CaP)</b> <b>cells.</b> Suppression of AD and AI <b>CaP</b> <b>cell</b> growth by piceatannol was accompanied by cell cycle blockade in G 1 /S and S phases for LNCaP and PC- 3 and induction of apoptosis in DU 145 cells. Induction of apoptosis by piceatannol in DU 145 cells was evident by reduced expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cleavage of caspase 3 and apoptosis inducing factor AIF, {{and an increase in}} cytochrome c. The apoptotic changes occurred in concordance with DNA damage, supported by increased phosphorylated histone H 2 AX. Immunoblot analyses showed that exposure of different-stage <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> to piceatannol also resulted in cell-type-specific downregulation of mTOR and its upstream and downstream effector proteins, AKT and eIF- 4 E-BP 1. We propose that the observed AKT and mTOR changes are new targets of piceatannol possibly contributing to its inhibitory activities on proliferation of <b>CaP</b> <b>cells.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Stem cells {{reside in}} {{specialised}} microenvironments, or niches, which often contain support cells that control stem cell maintenance and proliferation. Hedgehog (Hh) proteins mediate homeostasis in several adult niches, but a detailed understanding of Hh signalling in stem cell regulation is lacking. Studying the Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC) niche, {{we show that}} Hh acts as a critical juxtacrine signal to maintain the normal GSC population of the ovary. Hh production in <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> a type of niche support cells, is regulated by the Engrailed transcription factor. Hh is then secreted to a second, adjacent population of niche cells, the escort cells, where it activates transcription of the GSC essential factors Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Glass bottom boat (Gbb). In wild-type niches, Hh protein decorates short filopodia that originate in the support <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> and that are functionally relevant, as {{they are required to}} transduce the Hh pathway in the escort cells and to maintain a normal population of GSCs. These filopodia, reminiscent of wing disc cytonemes, grow several fold in length if Hh signalling is impaired within the niche. Because these long cytonemes project directionally towards the signalling-deficient region, <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> sense and react to the strength of Hh pathway transduction in the niche. Thus, the GSC niche responds to insufficient Hh signalling by increasing the range of Hh spreading. Although the signal(s) perceived by the <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> and the receptor(s) involved are still unknown, our results emphasise the integration of signals necessary t...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pristimerin (PM), a quinonemethide triterpenoid, is a {{promising}} anticancer agent with potent antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities against cancer cell lines. However, the anticancer activity and mechanisms of PM in prostate cancer cells {{have not been}} adequately investigated. Here we report that the degradation of survivin {{plays an important role}} in the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of PM in carcinoma of the prostate (<b>CaP)</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Treatment with PM inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in LNCaP and PC- 3 cells as characterized by the loss of cell viability and an increase in Annexin V-binding and cleavage of PARP- 1, respectively. The antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of PM were associated with the inhibition of cell cycle regulatory proteins, antiapoptotic survivin and members of the Bcl- 2 family. Data showed that response to PM is regulated by survivin since overexpression of survivin rendered <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> resistant to PM. Furthermore, downregulation of survivin by PM was mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Together, these data demonstrate that pristimerin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in <b>CaP</b> <b>cells</b> by abolishing survivin through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway...|$|R
40|$|The {{movement}} of cells and cell fragments in an electric field provided {{a means for}} determining the nature of cellular surface charges. We found that changes in ionic strength and particularly changes in Ca 2 + and H+ in the bathing medium cause changes in the surface charges on the root <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the absence of}} red light. Red light-induced charge changes are demonstrable only on root <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> and are reversible with far red light. By osmotically separating the membrane from the wall, we demonstrated that both light-induced and ionically mediated charge changes are associated with the cell membrane and not the cell wall...|$|R
50|$|In {{developing}} mammary glands, {{the growing}} {{tips of the}} ductal network consist of two layers made up of luminal epithelial <b>cells</b> and <b>cap</b> <b>cells.</b> The luminal cells secrete netrin 1, which binds to the receptor neogenin (a homologue of DCC) on the <b>cap</b> <b>cells.</b> This allows for adhesion between the two cell layers, which {{is necessary for the}} proper morphogenesis of the terminal end buds (TEBs) in the mammary glands. Loss of the gene coding for either netrin 1 or neogenin led to the improper formation of the (TEBs), suggesting that rather than acting as a guidance molecule as in neuronal systems, netrin 1 serves as an adhesive in mammary tissue.|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to seek an {{association}} between markers of metastatic potential, drug resistance-related protein and monocarboxylate transporters in prostate cancer (CaP). Methods: We evaluated the expression of invasive markers (CD 147, CD 44 v 3 - 10), drug-resistance protein (MDR 1) and monocarboxylate transporters (MCT 1 and MCT 4) in <b>CaP</b> metastatic <b>cell</b> lines and <b>CaP</b> tissue microarrays (n= 140) by immunostaining. The co-expression of CD 147 and CD 44 v 3 - 10 with that of MDR 1, MCT 1 and MCT 4 in <b>CaP</b> <b>cell</b> lines was evaluated using confocal microscopy. The relationship between the expression of CD 147 and CD 44 v 3 - 10 and the sensitivity (IC 50) to docetaxel in <b>CaP</b> <b>cell</b> lines was assessed using MTT assay. The relationship between expression of CD 44 v 3 - 10, MDR 1 and MCT 4 and various clinicopathological CaP progression parameters was examined. Results: CD 147 and CD 44 v 3 - 10 were co-expressed with MDR 1, MCT 1 and MCT 4 in primary and metastatic <b>CaP</b> <b>cells.</b> Both CD 147 and CD 44 v 3 - 10 expression levels were inversely related to docetaxel sensitivity (IC 50) in metastatic <b>CaP</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Overexpression of CD 44 v 3 - 10, MDR 1 and MCT 4 was found in most primary CaP tissues, and was significantly associated with CaP progression. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the overexpression of CD 147, CD 44 v 3 - 10, MDR 1 and MCT 4 is associated with CaP progression. Expression of both CD 147 and CD 44 v 3 - 10 is correlated with drug resistance during CaP metastasis and could be a useful potential therapeutic target in advanced disease...|$|R
5000|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, the GSC niche {{resides in}} the anterior-most region of each ovariole, known as the germarium. The GSC niche {{consists}} of necessary somatic cells-terminal filament <b>cells,</b> <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> escort cells, and other stem cells which function to maintain the GSCs. The GSC niche holds on average 2-3 GSCs, which are directly attached to somatic <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> and Escort stem cells, which send maintenance signals directly to the GSCs. [...] GSCs are easily identified through histological staining against vasa protein (to identify germ cells) and 1B1 protein (to outline cell structures and a germline specific fusome structure). Their physical attachment to the <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> is necessary for their maintenance and activity. A GSC will divide asymmetrically to produce one daughter cystoblast, which then undergoes 4 rounds of incomplete mitosis as it progresses down the ovariole (through the process of oogenesis) eventually emerging as a mature egg chamber; the fusome found in the GSCs functions in cyst formation and may regulate asymmetrical cell divisions of the GSCs. [...] Because of the abundant genetic tools available for use in Drosophila melanogaster and the ease of detecting GSCs through histological stainings, researchers have uncovered several molecular pathways controlling GSC maintenance and activity.|$|R
40|$|Boundary <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> are a transient, neural-crest-derived {{population}} {{found at}} the motor exit point and dorsal root entry zone of the embryonic spinal cord. These cells contribute to the central/peripheral nervous system boundary, and in their absence neurons and glia from the CNS migrate into the PNS. We found Netrin 5 (Ntn 5), a previously unstudied member of the netrin gene family, to be robustly expressed in boundary <b>cap</b> <b>cells.</b> We generated Ntn 5 knockout mice and examined neurodevelopmental and boundary-cap-cell-related phenotypes. No abnormalities in cranial nerve guidance, dorsal root organization, or sensory projections were found. However, Ntn 5 mutant embryos did have ectopic motor neurons that migrated out of the ventral horn and into the motor roots. Previous studies have implicated semaphorin 6 A (Sema 6 A) in boundary <b>cap</b> <b>cells</b> signaling to plexinA 2 (PlxnA 2) /neuropilin 2 (Nrp 2) in motor neurons in restricting motor neuron cell bodies to the ventral horn, particularly in the caudal spinal cord. In Ntn 5 mutants, ectopic motor neurons {{are likely to be}} a different population, as more ectopias were found rostrally. Furthermore, ectopic motor neurons in Ntn 5 mutants were not immunoreactive for NRP 2. The netrin receptor DCC is a potential receptor for NTN 5 in motor neurons, as similar ectopic neurons were found in Dcc mutant mice, but not in mice deficient for other netrin receptors. Thus, Ntn 5 is a novel netrin family member that is expressed in boundary <b>cap</b> <b>cells,</b> functioning to prevent motor neuron migration out of the CNS...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} individual reproductive {{flexibility and}} {{the division of}} labour in five post-emergence colonies of the primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia revolutionalis, by relating behavioural observations of individuals at the nest to their ovarian development. Analysing time-activity budgets with principal components and canonical discriminant analysis revealed three distinct groups of individuals, based on their spatial distribution relative to the nest. Individuals could be assigned to a group based on: whether they {{spent most of their}} time near or away from the nest (first principal component, 75 % variance); whether they sat on or next to the comb when in the nest vicinity (second principal component, 16 % variance); or whether they sat on or off the <b>capped</b> <b>cells</b> (that contain pupae) when sitting on the combs themselves (third principal component, 6 % variance). Colonies had either one or two reproductive individuals, but the distinct groups they belonged to could vary. In three monogynous colonies reproductive individuals spent the majority of their time sitting on <b>capped</b> <b>cells.</b> In two polygynous colonies, primary reproductives were also located on <b>capped</b> <b>cells</b> but the secondary reproductives, with smaller oocytes, were located either next to the nest or on the <b>capped</b> <b>cells</b> of a second comb. In all colonies levels of aggressive interactions were low. These findings indicate that spatial position is an important component of social organisation and that there are multiple pathways through which an individual can achieve reproductive dominance. Finally, comparison with other Ropalidia species shows that the pattern of social organisation varies in this wasp genus...|$|R
