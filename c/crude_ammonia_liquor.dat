Such technologies must be: capable of effectively treating human faecal wastes without any health or environmental impacts; scalable to address rapid increases in population and urbanization; capable of meeting environmental regulations and standards for faecal management; and competitive with existing strategies. Further and importantly, despite its noxiousness and pathogenic load, the chemical composition of human faecal sludge indicates {{that it could be}} considered a potentially valuable, nutrient-rich renewable resource, rather than a problematic waste product. New approaches to faecal sludge management must consequently seek to incorporate a ‘valuable resource recovery’ approach, compatible with stringent treatment requirements. This review intends to advance the understanding of human faecal sludge as a sustainable organic-rich resource that is typically high in moisture (up to 97 per cent), making it a suitable candidate for dielectric heating, i. e. microwave irradiation, to promote faecal treatment, while also recovering value-added products such as <b>ammonia</b> <b>liquor</b> concentrate (suitable for fertilizers) and chars (suitable for fuel) – which can provide an economic base to sustain the technology.

Piglets received a basal diet with a) no addition (control), or with SB at b) 1, 000 ppm, c) 2, 000 ppm, or d) 4, 000 ppm. After 6 wk, 6 animals per treatment were killed, and samples of intestinal content and mucosa were collected. Sodium butyrate did not improve the animal growth performance. In the cecum, SB increased pH and isobutyric acid concentration (linear, P < 0. 05) and tended to increase ammonia concentration (P = 0. 056). Intestinal counts of clostridia, enterobacteriaceae, and lactic acid bacteria as well as intestinal mucosal morphology were not affected by feeding SB. This study showed that SB influenced the cecal microflora in an in vitro system, reducing the total gas production but increasing ammonia concentrations. When fed to piglets, SB did not improve the animal growth performance, increased cecal pH, and tended to increase cecal ammonia concentrations.

Samples of rumen headspace gas and corresponding samples of rumen liquor were taken from three lactating cows, prepared with rumen fistulae, at intervals after receiving their morning feed allocation (grass silage and concentrates). Hydrogen sulfide, methyl sulfide, and dimethyl sulfide, were the predominant gases that were measured in the rumen headspace by this technique.

Based on the size, concentration, and spectral characteristics of these promising observables, we then determine whether these observables can be identified using current commercial satellite systems, namely Hyperion, ASTER, and Quickbird. We conclude that the only promising observables at Ranger that can be uniquely identified using a current commercial satellite system (notably Hyperion) are magnesium chlorite in the open pit mine and the sulfur stockpile. Based on the identified magnesium chlorite and sulfur observables, the decision tree narrows the possible mineral candidates at Ranger to uranium, copper, zinc, manganese, vanadium, the rare earths, and phosphorus, all of which are milled using sulfuric acid leaching...|$|R

Cattle were supplemented with escape protein, rumen degradable protein, {{or a combination}} of the two protein types while grazing a mixed stand of primarily switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii (Nash) Fern.). Forage protein degradation was determined at 16 hours in situ. Pulse and continuous dosing of ytterbium or erbium were compared in two trials. Continuous dosing of ytterbium was used to estimate fecal output in a one-year study of the effect of forage availability on intake, selectivity, and rumen protein degradation of smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.). ^ Cattle grazing warm-season grass produced more gain when supplemented with rumen degradable protein or the combination of protein types when compared to the controls. Escape protein in the forage was approximately 50 % of the <b>crude</b> protein. Rumen <b>ammonia</b> was often less than 5 mg/ 100 ml in unsupplemented animals. ^ Intake of smooth bromegrass reached a maximum at a forage availability between 500 and 1500 kg/ha. As forage availability increased, selectivity increased for crude protein and in vitro dry matter digestibility. However, selectivity was not able to fully compensate for reduced whole-plant crude protein at high forage availabilities. Selectivity of neutral detergent fiber was approximately 10 percentage units lower than the standing forage and did not seem to be affected by forage availability. Cattle selected a diet that averaged 63 % in vitro dry matter digestibility for all forage availabilities. Only 17 to 25 % of the crude protein passed intact to the small intestine. ...|$|R

As much as three head of fistulated male buffaloes (live weight of 450 - 550 kg) and three fistulated female cattle (live weight 250 - 380 kg) were used. This experiment was done three stage as follows: pre-inoculation, inoculation and post-inoculation. In Pre-inoculation, the sample of rumen content was taken two hours before morning feeding and directly observed for pH rumen <b>liquor,</b> <b>ammonia</b> nitrogen (NH 3 -N) and total volatile fatty acid (VFA). During {{the last three days}} of the first week of pre and post inoculation, the in situ dry matter digestibility was conducted. The samples were incubated for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours in the rumen of the experimental animals. Napier grass, leucaena, and wheat pollard were incubated separately in the nylon bags to determine DM digestibility. The cross inoculation (total of rumen content) was done less than 10 minutes. In post-inoculation, the sample of rumen content was taken at two hours before morning feeding as long as two days of two weeks after inoculation. Changes in rumen ecosystem (pH, NH 3 -N and total VFA) were tested by using Completely Randomized Design. Result showed that the transfer of rumen content from cattle to buffalo significantly reduced the pH level in the rumen of buffalo. However, it had no significant effect on the ammonia concentration in the rumen of buffalo and showed significantly decreased of bacteria but it was not affect on the total count of protozoa and fungi. The transfer of rumen content from cattle to buffalo significantly decreased the value of insoluble and potential digestible fraction of leucaena. The DM effective degradability of Napier grass was significantly increase (P< 0. 05) within outflow rate 0. 02 and 0. 04 h- 1 after cross inoculation.

40|$|Manure {{additive}} {{products can}} be used to reduce odour emissions (OE) from livestock farms. The standardised evaluation of these manure additive products under specific farm conditions is important. In this study, the efficacy of a manure additive (WonderTreat(TM), CKLS, Inc., Hong-Kong) was assessed under Australian conditions utilising a combination of laboratory and field-scale evaluation techniques. As a first step, the efficacy of the manure additive was assessed in a laboratory-scale trial using a series of uniformly managed digesters and standard odour, <b>liquor</b> <b>ammonia</b> and hydrogen sulphide concentration measurement procedures. This showed that the addition of WonderTreat(TM) at the 'low dose rate' (LDR) (102. 6 g m- 2) used during the trial significantly, but only marginally (30 %; P = 0. 02) reduced the OE rate (mean 13. 9 OU m- 2 s- 1) of anaerobic pig liquor relative to an untreated control (UC) (19. 9 OU m- 2 s- 1). However, the 'high dose rate' (HDR) (205. 3 g m- 2) also assessed during the trial preformed similarly (19. 7 OU m- 2 s- 1) to the UC. No statistically significant difference in the concentrations of a range of measured water quality variables at the 5 % level was observed between the treatments or controls digesters. As a second step, a field-scale assessment of the manure additive was undertaken at a commercial piggery. Two piggery manure lagoons (each with approximately 2500 m 2 surface area) were included in the study; one was treated with WonderTreat(TM) while the other was used as control. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed using olfactometric evaluation of odour samples collected {{from the surface of the}} pond using a dynamic wind tunnel and ancillary equipment. No statistically significant reduction in OE rate could be demonstrated (P = 0. 35), partially due to the limited number of samples taken during the assessment. However, there was a numerical reduction in the average OE rate of the treatment pond (29 OU m- 2 s- 1 at 1 m s- 1) compared to the control lagoon (38 OU m- 2 s- 1 at 1 m s- 1) ...|$|R

When fed to monogastric animals, GA is poorly absorbed in the small intestine and can reach the lower gut where it is fermented to butyric acid. This study investigated the effect of GA on in vitro growth response and proteolytic state of swine caecal microflora. A diet for pigs (CP 15. 8 %, DE 15. 0 MJ/kg) was predigested in vitro to simulate ileal digestion and later used as the substrate in the in vitro fermentation. Caecal content was collected from 6 pigs, diluted with buffer and used as inoculum. The inoculum was flushed with CO_{ 2 }_ and dispensed into five glass syringes and five vessels per treatment, containing predigested diet. Syringes and vessels were incubated at 39 °C for 24 h. There were 6 treatments: control diet, or control diet with GA added at 2, 000, 4, 000, 6, 000, 8, 000, and 10, 000 ppm. Gas production was measured recording the cumulative volume of gas produced every 30 min. Samples of fermentation fluid were collected from each vessel at time 0, 4, 8 and 24 h for ammonia and at time 24 h for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) determination. During the 24 h in vitro caecal fermentation, total gas production and maximum rate of gas production were increased by all GA concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0. 001). <b>Ammonia</b> in fermentation <b>liquor</b> was reduced by GA at 2, 000 (– 26 %; P < 0. 01) and 4, 000 ppm (– 17 %; P < 0. 05) after 4 h and at all concentrations (P < 0. 001) after 8 h and 24 h, with the only exception of GA at 2, 000 ppm. After 24 h of fermentation, total SCFA, acetic acid, butyric acid, acetic to propionic acid ratio, and acetic + butyric to propionic acid ratio were linearly increased in all GA treatments (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Livestock are {{reared in}} all agroecological zones of Ethiopia under various {{production}} systems. Goats, although {{found in all}} agroecological zones, are popular in the drier environments since they adapt well in harsh condition better than sheep and cattle. Natural vegetation comprised of both woody and herbaceous species provides the feed base year round in such environments. Due to seasonal variations, a marked fluctuation in feed resource exists in quantitative and qualitative terms. The herbaceous particularly the grasses, are faster in deteriorating {{while most of the}} woody (browse) species maintain greenness and are able to provide higher level of crude protein and minerals to animals. In areas where crops and livestock are integrated, crop residues provide substantial amount of feed to animals. However, cereal straws are inherently low in crude protein and high in fibre which results in low intake and digestibility. Thus such feeds cannot even meet maintenance requirement of animals and should be supplemented to enhance their nutritive value. Supplementation with browse foliage and fruits could be a viable alternative in smallholder livestock-crop mixed production systems. The study was comprised of four individual works. In experiment I, nutritional quality of some important browse and grass species collected from Borana rangeland during the hot dry and main rainy seasons were evaluated in terms of chemical composition, in vitro digestibility and in sacco degradability potentials. In experiment II, the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on feed intake, digestibility, ammonia nitrogen concentration, nitrogen balance and body weight gain of Borana goats was evaluated. Goats were fed a basal diet of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay supplemented with either Acacia brevispica or Acacia seyal leaves with or without PEG addition. The concentrate replacement value of Balanites aegyptiaca leaves was evaluated in experiment III. The concentrate was replaced at 25, 50, 75 and 100 percent by Balanites aegyptiaca and feed intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance, excretion of purine derivatives and microbial nitrogen supply and average daily body weight gain were evaluated using Arsi-Bale goats fed barley straw as a basal diet. The fourth component of the study was a survey conducted in the southern rangelands to assess the perception of pastoralists towards dry season feed shortage and associated livestock poisoning in the rangeland. The browse foliage had higher crude protein content (> 10 %) during both seasons with higher values in the main rainy season (except for A. seyal). On the other hand, crude protein content of grass species was only slightly above the critical limit required to maintain proper functioning of rumen microbes. The fibre content was lower in the browses and higher in the grasses. The concentration of condensed tannins was variable among the browses ranging between negligible levels to over 30 %. The in vitro and in sacco digestibility values were generally higher for browses, which shows their potential to be used as supplements to poor quality fibrous feeds. Experiment II showed that addition of PEG did not result in significant differences in feed intake, digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and neutral detergent fibre as well as in nitrogen excretion and retention, and average daily weight gain. However, goats receiving PEG had higher <b>crude</b> protein digestibility, <b>ammonia</b> nitrogen concentration, and urinary nitrogen excretion. Goats without PEG addition had higher faecal nitrogen loss. When the type of Acacia was considered, A. seyal supplemented goats had higher feed intake while crude protein digestibility and ammonia nitrogen concentration were higher for A. brevispica supplemented goats. Higher average daily body gain was recorded for A. seyal supplemented goats. Experiment III showed that B. aegyptiaca had a potential to be used as supplement to cereal straw based diets. This was evident from the performance of the animals even when the concentrate was replaced completely by B. aegyptiaca. All animals had positive average daily body weight gain although it was lowest in animals supplemented with sole leaves of B. aegyptiaca. The survey revealed that the pastoralists in the southern rangelands are knowledgeable in allocation of resources, animal husbandry and ethnoveterinary practices. It also showed the concern of pastoralists about the changes in vegetation that favors woody and some unpalatable herbaceous species. Twenty two plants were identified by pastoralists as causes of livestock poisoning when ingested which usually occurs when animals are hungry and thirsty...|$|R
40|$|Ruminants {{increasingly}} attract {{public concern}} {{due to their}} methane release and contribution to the greenhouse effect. One strategy to reduce the release of methane is to modify microbial fermentation in the rumen {{by the use of}} feed additives such as monensin and tannin extracts. However, other characteristics of fermentation including the synthesis of microbial protein may also be affected. The aim of the present studies was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of monensin and tannin extracts on ruminal fermentation and methane production. The ionophore monensin is known to increase feed efficiency in ruminants. Although the use of silages is common practice in cattle feeding, the effects of monensin on the fermentation of silages in the rumen and microbial protein synthesis are lacking. Monensin has often been described to have indirect effects on methane production resulting from its effects on feed intake, protozoa and Gram-positive bacteria. It has rarely been studied whether monensin can reduce methane production without adverse effects on other criteria of rumen fermentation. The first objective therefore was to investigate the effects of different dosages of monensin on methane production and microbial protein synthesis when supplemented to different silages in two in vitro systems (Study 1). In Experiment 1 of Study 1, 15 g of oven-dried grass silage alone or combined with a concentrate was incubated in a rumen simulation (Rusitec) over a period of 13 d {{to examine the effects of}} monensin supplementation (2 or 4 mg/d, n = 4) on the production of total gas, methane, volatile fatty acids (VFA), degradation of nutrients and microbial protein synthesis. In Experiment 2 of Study 1, different dosages of monensin (0. 5, 1, 2, 6 and 10 µg) were supplemented to syringes containing 120 mg of grass silage alone, grass silage combined with concentrates, or maize silage alone. After 24 h of incubation the effects of monensin on total gas, methane and VFA production were determined. In Experiment 1 monensin inclusion to grass silage and grass silage combined with concentrate resulted in a decreased total gas, methane and acetate production, while propionate production was increased. Along with a decreased degradation of <b>crude</b> protein, <b>ammonia</b> concentration in the system was reduced. While microbial protein originating from solid associated microbes decreased with monensin inclusion, microbial protein from liquid associated microbes was increased, resulting in an increase in total microbial protein synthesis. In Experiment 2, different dosages of monensin reduced methane production in grass silage (17 %), grass silage combined with concentrate (10 %) and maize silage (13 %) without adverse effects on total gas production. Based on these two in vitro experiments it was concluded that monensin is able to reduce methane production without a major decrease in total gas and VFA production and degradation of organic matter. Although microbial fractions were differently affected, the total microbial protein synthesis was increased upon monensin supplementation. Tannins are secondary plant compounds that are known to complex with feed and microbial proteins. Several products from this heterogeneous group have shown potential to affect rumen fermentation in vivo and, even more, in vitro, but are often accompanied by negative effects on digestibility, feed intake and microbial protein synthesis. In Study 2 of the present work, ten tannin extracts (chestnut, mimosa, myrabolan, quebracho, sumach, tara, valonea, oak, cocoa and grape seed) and four monomers of rapeseed tannin (pelargonidin, catechin, cyanidin and sinapinic acid) were screened in grass silage based diets in successive runs using the Hohenheim Gas Test. The objective was to determine the optimal dosage of each tannin extract to cause a maximal methane reduction without negative effects on total gas production. Whereas the supplementation of pelargonidin and cyanidin to grass silage did not reduce methane production; catechin and sinapinic acid reduced methane production without affecting total gas production. Except tara extract, all tannin extracts reduced methane production by 8 to 28 % without adverse effects on total gas production. Based on these results, chestnut, grape seed, myrabolan, sumach and valonea extract were investigated in a second step in a Rusitec to determine their effects on degradation of nutrients, VFA and ammonia production, and particularly on microbial protein synthesis. All tannin extracts were supplemented at similar dosages of 1. 5 g to 15 g of grass silage. The supplementation of chestnut resulted in the greatest decrease in methane production (63 %), followed by valonea (35 %), grape seed (23 %), sumach (18 %), and myrabolan (7 %; not significantly different from the control). While chestnut extract reduced acetate production by 19 %, supplementation with grape seed or myrabolan extract increased acetate production; however, degradation of fibre fractions was reduced in all tannin treatments. Degradation of dry and organic matter was reduced by all tannin extracts, but there were no differences between tannin treatments. Crude protein degradation and ammonia production were also reduced by tannin extract supplementation. Microbial protein synthesis and its efficiency were not affected by tannin supplementation, which indicates that a reduction in methane production due to tannin extract supplementation is possible without negatively affecting microbial protein synthesis. Chestnut and valonea extract had the greatest potential in reducing methane production without negative effects on rumen fermentation of grass silage and microbial protein synthesis. Therefore, these tannin extracts were investigated for their long-term effects in sheep (Study 3). In Experiment 1 of Study 3, sheep receiving the control, chestnut or valonea treatment (each n = 4) were fed 842 g/d of hay (fresh weight). The animals on the control treatment also received 464 g/d of concentrate, and animals on the tannin treatments received the same amount of concentrate but were also fed 20 g of the respective tannin extract. Following initiation of tannin feeding, methane release from sheep was measured in 23. 5 h intervals in respiration chambers on day 1, 8, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 148, and 190. In three balances periods faeces and urine were collected for 6 and 3 days, respectively. Effects on nutrient digestibility, nitrogen and energy metabolism were evaluated, with microbial protein synthesis estimated from the urinary excretion of purine derivatives. Based on the results of Experiment 1, a second experiment was conducted four month after the start of Experiment 1. Experiment 2 had the same study design and data collected, but the dosage of tannin extracts was doubled compared to Experiment 1 (0. 9 vs. 1. 7 g tannin extract/kg body weight) and the duration was shorter (85 days). Hay and concentrates used in both experiments were also evaluated using the Hohenheim Gas for their effects on total gas and methane production. In both experiments, methane release was not significantly reduced by tannin extract supplementation when analysed over the whole experimental period. In Experiment 1 the supplementation of chestnut extract on day 190 resulted in a reduced methane release. In both experiments, on day 1 a numeric reduction in methane release for the tannin treatments was observed, with a greater reduction recorded for the higher dosage used in Experiment 2. This trend disappeared by day 57. In the third balance period of Experiment 1, digestibility of dry and organic matter was reduced by tannin supplementation. The digestibility of crude protein was reduced in both experiments, whereas the digestibility of fibre fractions was not influenced. In both experiments a long-lasting shift in nitrogen excretion from urine to faeces was observed, which occurred to a greater extent in Experiment 2. The urinary excretion of purine derivatives was not significantly affected by tannin supplementation, indicating that the microbial protein synthesis was not altered in either experiment. The in vitro methane production was reduced for concentrates containing tannin extracts, but it was not significantly affected when concentrates were incubated with hay. It is concluded that monensin added to different silages caused a decrease in methane production without affecting total gas production but with an increased microbial protein synthesis. Nine of the ten considered tannin extracts and two tannin monomers decreased methane production without affecting total gas production. The Rusitec study confirmed the great potential of chestnut and valonea extract to reduce methane production without negative effects on microbial protein synthesis. However, neither chestnut nor valonea extract reduced the methane release in sheep when fed over a longer period of time. It is assumed, that rumen microbes adapted to the tannin dosages in terms of methane release but not nitrogen metabolism, as there were long-lasting effects on nitrogen excretion. The shift in nitrogen excretion can have a positive effect on the environment due to the reduced potential of ammonia emission from the urine. Both in vitro systems used in the present studies showed effects of tannin extracts that were considerably different from those observed in sheep. The monomers investigated in the present study are the basic units of condensed tannins, whereas the tannin extracts selected in vitro only contain hydrolysable tannins. It is possible that monomers of chestnut and valonea extract may reduce methane production, whereas higher dosages of these tannin extracts cause negative effects on feed intake, digestibility and microbial protein synthesis. Further investigations should focus systematically on the transfer of in vitro studies to estimate in vivo responses. Therefore, a parallel implementation of|$|R
