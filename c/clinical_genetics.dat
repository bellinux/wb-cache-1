Once a mutation is confirmed, it is possible to screen family members for the disease as part of <b>clinical</b> <b>genetics</b> family counseling. Regional distributions of genes associated with Wilson's disease are important to follow, as this can help clinicians design appropriate screening strategies. Since mutations of the WD gene vary between populations, research and genetic testing done in countries like the USA or United Kingdom can pose problems as they tend to have more mixed populations.|$|E

25|$|Initial <b>clinical</b> <b>genetics</b> {{assessment}} is commonly {{performed by the}} high-risk obstetrician or genetic counselor where they may ask for a blood sample from the fetus or will perform an amniocentesis. These samples are used to perform several tests, one {{of which may be}} to check for the proper number of chromosomes, called a karyotype, of the fetus. Some birth defects are known to be associated with missing a chromosome, having an extra chromosome, such as in Down syndrome, as well as by having a part of one chromosome break off and relocate to a portion of another chromosome (called a translocation). However, on each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes are thousands of different genes. While chromosomes are easy to visualize under a microscope and count, the genes on them are not. Genes are very small pieces of DNA when compared to the chromosomes they reside on. A gene contains a code for a protein and if the gene is mutated (different from normal) the protein that is made from it may not function properly - if at all. Unfortunately, genetic abnormalities could still exist despite having normal chromosomes. The only way to determine genetically inherited mutations in the infant is to perform a genetic analysis of the mother, father, affected infant and any unaffected siblings of the affected fetus. These analyses will reveal what genetic mutations are present in the affected infant, and by comparing these results to the surviving siblings and parents, it can be determined which mutations were inherited or were not.|$|E

[...] The book examines {{the effects of the}} routinization of fetal diagnosis and analyzes its cultural and social significance in a U.S. context, positing that pregnant women's experience with amniocentesis is deeply influenced by gender, race, and class. Rapp drew on her own experience with amniocentesis in her approach towards the book, participating in fifteen years of fieldwork and engaging with laboratory technicians, geneticists, support groups (of women who terminated pregnancies and families with disabled children), families of children with Down syndrome, genetic counselors, women who underwent amniocentesis or who refused the test, and some male partners. Rapp also suggests ideological links between abortion rights and disability rights activists, and argues that society should cultivate better communication between the two [...] "realms".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hereditary {{haemochromatosis}} (HH) is a recessively-inherited {{disorder of}} iron over-absorption prevalent in Caucasian populations. Affected individuals for Type 1 HH are usually either homozygous for a cysteine to tyrosine amino acid substitution at position 282 (C 282 Y) of the HFE gene, or compound heterozygotes for C 282 Y {{and for a}} histidine to aspartic acid change at position 63 (H 63 D). Molecular genetic testing for these two mutations has become widespread in recent years. With diverse testing methods and reporting practices in use, {{there was a clear}} need for agreed guidelines for haemochromatosis genetic testing. The UK <b>Clinical</b> Molecular <b>Genetics</b> Society has elaborated a consensus process for the development of disease-specific best practice guidelines for genetic testing. Methods A survey of current practice in the molecular diagnosis of haemochromatosis was conducted. Based on the results of this survey, draft guidelines were prepared using the template developed by UK <b>Clinical</b> Molecular <b>Genetics</b> Society. A workshop was held to develop the draft into a consensus document. The consensus document was then posted on the <b>Clinical</b> Molecular <b>Genetics</b> Society website for broader consultation and amendment. Results Consensus or near-consensus was achieved on all points in the draft guidelines. The consensus and consultation processes worked well, and outstanding issues were documented in an appendix to the guidelines. Conclusion An agreed set of best practice guidelines were developed for diagnostic, predictive and carrier testing for hereditary haemochromatosis and for reporting the results of such testing. </p...|$|R
