5000|$|In mathematics, and in {{particular}} homotopy theory, a hypercovering (or hypercover) is a simplicial object that generalises the Čech nerve of a cover. For the Čech nerve of an open cover , one can show that if the space [...] is compact and if every intersection of open sets in the cover is contractible, then one can contract these sets and get a simplicial set which is weakly equivalent to [...] in a natural way. For the étale topology and other sites, these conditions fails. The idea of a hypercover is to instead of only working with -fold intersections of the sets of the given open cover , to allow the pairwise intersections of the sets in [...] to be covered by an open <b>cover</b> , <b>and</b> to <b>let</b> the triple intersections of this cover to be covered by yet another open <b>cover</b> , <b>and</b> so on, iteratively.

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric grill would be the best choices for what is known as [...] "barbecue-braising" [...] or [...] "grill-braising", or combining grilling directly on the surface and braising in a pot. To braise on a grill, put a pot on top of the grill, <b>cover</b> it, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> it simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising. The first is that this method allows for browning the meat directly on the grill before the braising, and the second is that it also allows for glazing the meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising, effectively cooking the meat three times, which results in a soft textured product that falls right off the bone. This method of cooking is slower than regular grilling but faster than pit-smoking, starting out fast, slowing down, and then speeding up again to finish. If a pressure cooker is used, the cooking time will be much faster.|$|R

40|$|To every {{analytic}} function g {{in the unit}} disk D one associates the integral operator T_g(f) (z) z^- 1 ∫^z_ 0 f(ξ) g'(ξ) dξ on spaces of {{analytic function}}s in D. Operators of this form appear naturally in complex analysis. For instance, the choice g(z) ≡ z leads to the integration operator, and the choice g(z) =(1 /(1 -z)) leads to the Cesàro operator. The notation used in the paper is standard. For 0 <p≤∞, H^p denotes the Hardy space, B_p denotes the analytic Besov-p space, and S_p(H^ 2) denotes the Schatten-p class of operators on H^ 2. BMOA and VMOA denote the spaces of analytic functions of bounded [respectively, vanishing] mean oscillation. The main results of the paper are as follows. Theorem 1 : Let g be an analytic function in D <b>and</b> <b>let</b> 1 ≤ p<∞. Then T_g is bounded on H^p {{if and only if}} g∈ BMOA. Theorem 2 : Let g be an analytic function in D. (i) If 1 <p<∞ then T_g∈ S_p(H^ 2) if and only if g∈ B_p. (ii) If 0 <p≤ 1 then T_g∈ S_p(H^ 2) if and only if g is constant. Theorem 1 generalizes an earlier result of Ch. Pommerenke [Comment. Math. Helv. 52 (1977), no. 4, 591 [...] 602; MR 0454017 (56 # 12268) ] in the context of H^ 2. It also implies the following corollary: Let g be an analytic function on D <b>and</b> <b>let</b> 1 ≤ p<∞. Then T_g is compact on H^p if and only if g∈ VMOA. The main tool in the proof of Theorem 2 is Luecking's results [D. H. Luecking, J. Funct. Anal. 73 (1987), no. 2, 345 [...] 368; MR 0899655 (88 m: 47046) ] on Cauchy transforms of Borel measures μ on D. Q_μ(f) (w) ∫_ Df(z) / 1 -w zdμ(z).

Then Luecking's theorem [op. cit. ] says that Q_µ∈ S_p(H^ 2) if and only if ∑^∞_j= 1 (μ(R_j) /l(R_j)) ^p<∞. The connection to Luecking's theorem is via the relation T^∗_gT_g=Q_μ with dμ(z) = 2 |g'(z) |^ 2 (1 /|z|) dm(z), where m is Lebesgue measure...|$|R

5000|$|Released by Looking Glass Studios in 1998 and {{powered by}} their own {{in-house}} developed Dark Engine, Thief: The Dark Project was {{considered by many to}} be a revolutionary game. The foremost defense of this position is that it was arguably the first morally ambiguous video game to receive a major release (as one might expect from its title). Cast in the role of the thief, Garrett, the player can forgo all morality or choose to exercise restraint in multiple situations. This represented a departure from popular video games of the time, which tended to rely upon a Manichean conception of conflict along with [...] "black and white" [...] settings and objectives. Another groundbreaking facet of the game was that although it utilized a first-person perspective, it was not an action-oriented shooter like almost all other first-person games. Instead, the emphasis was on stealth: The character is unusually agile, but is not a particularly skilled fighter, and much of the gameplay involves using shadows to avoid enemies. However, for those who desire action, there are weapons available that allow direct confrontation. A skilled player can often break <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> go head-to-head with the enemies. An even more skilled player can stay in <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> never <b>let</b> the enemies know that he was there. The game's original gameplay quickly developed a cult following. A re-release of Thief: The Dark Project entitled Thief Gold fixed various bugs and added three new levels (mostly derived from, but not identical to, content that was planned for the original game but cut for budget or time constraints) which contributed significantly to the existing plot. The package also contains bonus content such as the DromEd Dark Engine editor, a behind-the-scenes [...] "making of" [...] video, and a desktop theme designed for Windows 98. Looking Glass was working on a similar re-release of Thief II: The Metal Age, provisionally entitled [...] "Thief II Gold", at the time they went out of business in 2000.|$|R
