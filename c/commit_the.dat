5|$|Britain's {{declaration}} of war against Nazi Germany in September 1939 included the Crown colonies and India but did not automatically <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa. All soon declared war on Germany, but Ireland chose to remain legally neutral throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's Imperial Guard, {{the only}} unit on the {{battlefield}} that saw no fighting, was available to swing into action at a moment's notice. In refusing to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> Guard, some historians believe, he lost his one chance to destroy the Russian army and to win the campaign.|$|E
5|$|According to Jain texts, {{the fruits}} of himsā (violence) depends upon the {{severity}} of passions {{at the time of}} commencement of such an act. One may be responsible for the sinful act of himsā without actually causing injury; the other, while having caused injury, may not be responsible for the act. Also, when two persons <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> act of himsā jointly, its consequences on fruition (of karma), may be grave for one person and mild for the other.|$|E

5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> crime {{and what happens to}} him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} time the court had {{considered}} an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or one involving conduct that had only recently been criminalized. By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Kean saw the North Korean {{breakthrough}} at Haman as {{a serious}} threat to his division's line. At dawn on September 1, Kean requested permission from Walker to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> entire 27th Infantry Regiment, just arrived at Masan the previous evening and still held in Eighth Army reserve. Walker denied this request, but did release one battalion of the regiment to Kean's control.|$|E

5|$|Russian {{historian}} Oleg Sokolov {{posits that}} Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic {{victory for the}} French, which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown, although at the time {{none of this was}} apparent to either side. Sokolov adds that the decision to not <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz-style defeat and quotes Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, one of Napoleon's finest strategists, who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces and allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms. Digby Smith calls Borodino 'a draw' but believes that posterity proved Napoleon right in his decision to not <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> Guard so far away from his homeland. According to Christopher Duffy, the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau in the 18th century, when both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals, and the battle itself did not have a clear result, although both sides claimed the battle as their own victory.|$|E
5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> federal government to a program to land {{a man on the}} Moon {{by the end of the}} 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|Word of Sharp's alleged claims soon reached Jereboam Beauchamp, {{reviving}} {{his resolve}} to kill him. Beauchamp abandoned {{the idea of}} killing Sharp honorably in a duel. Instead, he decided to murder him and cast suspicion on his political enemies. To add to the intrigue, Beauchamp plotted to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> murder {{on the eve of}} the General Assembly's opening session.|$|E

However, their caution against <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions.|$|R
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> murder.|$|E
5|$|Australian Army {{involvement}} in UNTAG was formalised in February 1979 by Cabinet, which approved {{the plan to}} <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> 17th Construction Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers and Workshop as the main force for deployment. The squadron was to be supplemented by a Field Troop and by members posted from other units throughout the Army, bringing the squadron to a deployment strength of 275. A headquarters was to be formed, supporting the Chief Engineer at the UNTAG Military Headquarters. The total strength of the force was to be over 300 of all ranks, in what was known as Plan Witan. The unit had been placed on eight weeks' notice in July 1978, which {{was reduced to a}} week's notice to move in February 1979.|$|E
5|$|Black {{doubts that}} Winston is the killer, and while Hollis {{stays in the}} hotel, he visits the production's climactic shoot, set during a {{performance}} by the band Kiss. As he looks around him, the sheriff's body is thrown down from the rafters; as the pandemonium settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted—the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis fending off a chainsaw-wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis disables the chainsaw; the actor then explains that he lacked Black's insight and had to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> crimes {{in order to see}} {{through the eyes of a}} killer.|$|E

5|$|But {{the emperor}} {{rejected}} an outright invasion. Just {{coming off a}} disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275–76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Dannatt gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002. He described an initial reluctance to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment {{and the provision of}} naval and air support to the United States. He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 217, Caracalla was in the eastern provinces {{preparing}} a campaign against the Parthian Empire. Macrinus was among his staff, as were {{other members of the}} Praetorian Guard. In April, Caracalla went to visit a temple of Luna near the site of the battle of Carrhae and was accompanied only by his personal guard, which included Macrinus. On April 8, while traveling to the temple, Caracalla was stabbed to death by Justin Martialis, a soldier whom Macrinus had recruited to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> murder. In the aftermath, Martialis was killed by one of Caracalla's men.|$|E

Smith and Higgens {{have been involved in}} the trial of former sheriff William Garry (John Finn), who has been convicted of killing his three children and wife. Garry pleaded guilty to murders, and forensic evidence has linked him to a wood-carving chisel used to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> murders. Black has been asked to construct an offender profile for Garry, to determine whether the man is sufficiently dangerous to society for a judge to issue a death penalty. Garry himself is asking to be executed.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1944 Shanina became {{eligible}} for the Order of Glory 1st Class for her actions in a battle near Schlossberg (now Dobrovolsk), but ultimately received the Medal for Courage instead. She {{was among the first}} female snipers to receive the Medal for Courage. Shanina was awarded the medal on 27 December for the gallant posture displayed during a German counter-offensive on 26 October. There Shanina fought together with Captain Igor Aseyev, a Hero of the Soviet Union, and witnessed his death on 26 October. Shanina, who served as an assistant platoon commander, was ordered to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> female snipers to combat. Schlossberg was finally retaken from Germans by the troops of the 3rd Belorussian Front on 16 January 1945 during the Insterburg–Königsberg Operation.|$|E
5|$|Texans were {{hesitant}} {{to pursue a}} US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America, since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the annexation measure stalled in the US Senate, Texas could face a war alone against Mexico. Because only Congress could declare war, the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations.|$|E
