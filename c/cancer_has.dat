5|$|Brachytherapy can be {{used with}} the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally {{advanced}} tumours, provided the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> not metastasized (spread {{to other parts of the}} body). In appropriately selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{endometrial cancer}} is made first by a {{physical}} examination and dilation and curettage (removal of endometrial tissue; D). This tissue is then examined histologically for characteristics of cancer. If cancer is found, medical imaging may {{be done to}} see whether the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> spread or invaded tissue.|$|E
5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E

50|$|On 25 May 1963, {{the pope}} {{suffered}} another haemorrhage and required several blood transfusions, but the <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> perforated the stomach wall and peritonitis soon set in. The doctors conferred {{in a decision}} regarding this matter and John XXIII's aide Loris F. Capovilla broke the news to him saying that the <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> done its work and nothing could be done for him. Around this time, his remaining siblings arrived to be with him. By 31 May, it had become clear that the <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> overcome the resistance of John XXIII - it had left him confined to his bed.|$|R
50|$|Detractors also purport that {{previous}} beliefs {{in regards to}} sharks and <b>cancer</b> <b>have</b> been overturned, as forty-two varieties of <b>cancer</b> <b>have</b> now been discovered in sharks and related species. Also, many opponents feel that non-existent (or even limited) results do not justify the rampant over-fishing of many endangered species of sharks, further threatening their extinction.|$|R
5|$|As cancers do not {{immediately}} emerge after {{exposure to radiation}} instead radiation-induced <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> a minimum latency period of some 5+ years. An epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality, {{could be due to}} radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality. Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those {{who took part in the}} study.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Phil calls Sal, wanting Louise's (now {{played by}} Tilly Keeper) address, {{and when he}} goes to her house, Peggy is there, having {{returned}} a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try and make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> already spread beyond the original site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E

Hartson is a lifelong Swansea City supporter.|$|R
5|$|Occasionally {{neuroblastoma}} {{may be due}} to a mutation {{inherited from}} a person's parents. Environmental factors have not been found to be involved. Diagnosis is based on a tissue biopsy. Occasionally it may be found in a baby by ultrasound during pregnancy. At diagnosis the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> usually already spread. The cancer is divided into low, intermediate, and high risk groups based on a child's age, cancer stage, and what the cancer looks like.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E
5|$|The International Agency for Research on <b>Cancer</b> <b>has</b> {{classified}} cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans. Although {{occupational exposure}} to cadmium {{is linked to}} lung and prostate cancer, {{there is still a}} substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E

30|$|Patients with <b>cancer</b> <b>have</b> {{high rates}} of comorbid conditions, {{some of which may}} be age related [1, 2]. Nearly 70 % of {{patients}} with <b>cancer</b> <b>have</b> one comorbid condition, and more than 30 % of patients with <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> two or more comorbidities [2]. Studies have also demonstrated that patients with <b>cancer</b> and comorbidities <b>have</b> lower survival rates than patients with no other comorbidities [3 – 8]. Specifically, Jørgensen et al. (2012) [5] found higher overall mortality rates in elderly patients with lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer and higher comorbidity levels. The additional disease burden for patients with both cancer and other comorbidities is compounded by the challenges of managing maintenance pharmacologic treatment for these comorbidities while simultaneously undergoing cancer treatment.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recognition of}} pancreatic <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> {{been attributed to}} the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, {{who claimed to have}} traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Hazel and Augustus {{arrive in}} Amsterdam and are {{presented}} with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E

5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rates}} of the leading causes of death, {{cardiovascular}} disease, cancer and lung disease, are similar in women and men, women have different experiences. Lung <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries, {{and is one of the}} more important chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), an important sexually transmitted disease. HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in research studies, an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E
