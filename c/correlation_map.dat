40|$|International audienceCT-Scanner devices produce {{three-dimensional}} {{images of}} the internal structure of the body. In this paper, we propose a method {{that is based on}} the analysis of sensor noise to identify the CT-Scanner device. For each CT-scanner we built a reference pattern noise and a <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> from its slices. Finally, we can correlate any test slice with the reference pattern noise of each device according to its <b>correlation</b> <b>map.</b> This <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> gives a weighting for each pixel regarding its position in the reference pattern noise. We used a wavelet-based Wiener filter and an edge detection method to extract the noise from a slice. Experiments were applied on three CT-Scanners with 40 3 D images, including 3600 slices, and we demonstrate that we are able to identify each CT-Scanner separately...|$|E
40|$|Among {{different}} phase unwrapping approaches, {{the weighted}} least-squares minimization methods are gaining attention. In these algorithms, weighting coefficient is generated from a quality map. The intrinsic drawbacks of existing quality maps constrain {{the application of}} these algorithms. They often fail to handle wrapped phase data contains error sources, such as phase discontinuities, noise and undersampling. In {{order to deal with}} those intractable wrapped phase data, a new weighted least-squares phase unwrapping algorithm based on derivative variance <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> is proposed. In the algorithm, derivative variance <b>correlation</b> <b>map,</b> a novel quality map, can truly reflect wrapped phase quality, ensuring a more reliable unwrapped result. The definition of the derivative variance <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> and the principle of the proposed algorithm are present in detail. The performance of the new algorithm has been tested by use of a simulated spherical surface wrapped data and an experimental interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) wrapped data. Computer simulation and experimental results have verified that the proposed algorithm can work effectively even when a wrapped phase map contains intractable error sources. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

Most cross-correlation techniques fail when the viewpoint rotation grows over a certain value, usually around 20 degrees. The approach presented here aims at resolving this problem {{and at the same}} time provide an estimate of the actual rotation. This paper presents a method to obtain a <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> robust to rotation together with an orientation map that gives an estimate of the rotation between the region and the image at each point. We call this a Rotation <b>Correlation</b> <b>Map</b> (RCM) and is built using texture and intensity information consecutively. The gradient histogram (texture distribution) of the region is used as a fast strategy to locate possible points of high correlation and an estimate of their orientation with respect to the region that is compared. Among the candidates with high histogram similarity, Normalised Cross Correlation (NCC) (using intensity) is computed using the orientation estimated in the previous step. Results show the accuracy in correlation and orientation and the overall higher performance when compared to similar maps...|$|E

40|$|To {{identify}} atmospheric teleconnection {{patterns in}} 60 years of NCEP temperature, pressure and geopotential height anomalies, point <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> are presented to a Self Organizing Map (SOM), which topologically orders the patterns {{and provides a}} measure of frequency of pattern occurrence. Well known patterns can be identified within the SOM, such as the NAO, ENSO and the PNA, however {{the flexibility of the}} SOM allows these patterns to be viewed as part of a spectrum, or continuum, of patterns, each identifiable as a variation within a defined teleconnection pattern. The SOM patterns are then clustered {{to reduce the number of}} patterns and explore the separation of distinct patterns from the spectrum. Idealized periodic patterns of increasing complexity are used to test and explain the method. To assess the robustness of the method a SOM was constructed using point <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> for 60 years of NCEP surface temperature anomalies. Point <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> for the first and last 30 years are then compared to the SOM patterns constructed from the whole period. The patterns were robust and the pattern frequency data was able to identify the increased frequency of ENSO Modoki in the second half of the data, as observed in other studies, illustrating the method’s capability to detect changes within teleconnection patterns over time. This method can be extended by the use of <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> from multiple variables presented simultane- ously to the SOM, helping to investigate the relationship between different aspects of the atmosphere. For example, <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> for surface temperature, surface pressure and geopotential height can be combined to evaluate the state of the atmosphere associated with specific patterns and how changes in the structure affect the form of the teleconnection patterns.

The first step of this study consisted of using monthly Maximum Value Composites to create <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor mounted on Terra satellite and historical yield during the soybean crop cycle in Paraná State, Brazil, from 2000 / 2001 to 2010 / 2011. We compared the ability of forecasting crop yield based on <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> and crop specific masks. We ran a preliminary regression model to test its ability on yield estimation for four municipalities during the soybean growing season. A regression model was developed for both methodologies to forecast soybean crop yield using leave-one-out cross validation. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values {{in the implementation of}} the model ranged from 0. 037 t ha− 1 to 0. 19 t ha− 1 using <b>correlation</b> <b>maps,</b> while for crop specific masks, it varied from 0. 21 t ha− 1 to 0. 35 t ha− 1. The model was able to explain 96 % to 98 % of the variance in estimated yield from <b>correlation</b> <b>maps,</b> while it was able to explain only 2 % to 67 % for crop specific mask approach. The results showed that the <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> could be used to predict crop yield more effectively than crop specific masks.

The objective of the procedure is to obtain stem density, position, and height values, on a stand with the following characteristics: ellipsoidal canopy shape (Pinus pinaster), even-aged and single-layer structure. The process consists of three steps: extracting a <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> from CHM by applying a template whose size and shape resembles the canopy to be detected, applying a threshold mask to the <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> to keep a subset of candidate-pixels, and then applying a local maximum filter to the remaining pixel groups.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{identifying}} teleconnection patterns in gridded climate data is presented. Point <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> constructed from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis sea level pressure (SLP) {{for the period}} 01. 1984 - 12. 2005 are used to train a self-organizing map (SOM), which topologically orders the patterns and provides a measure of frequency of pattern occurrence. Well known patterns can be identified within the SOM, such as the NAO, ENSO and the PNA, however {{the flexibility of the}} SOM allows these patterns to be viewed as part of a continuum of patterns, each identifiable as a variation within a defined teleconnection pattern. As the SOM is a non-linear method, asymmetries between patterns generated from opposite centres of action are revealed. Clustering the SOM patterns identifies the regions of the SOM corresponding to different teleconnection types by classifying similar patterns together. This retains the continuum of patterns, but allows generalization and characterization of the teleconnections present in the data. The patterns identified by the SOM can be used to evaluate the teleconnections in climate model SLP data. Point <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> are determined for the model data and compared to the SOM. By matching each of the NCEP/NCAR <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> and each of the model <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> with their most similar pattern on the SOM, discrepancies between the datasets are revealed. Additionally, the base points corresponding to the <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> for each teleconnection show the regions important to their existence. Differences in the location of the base points between NCEP/NCAR and the models provide insight into the biases underlying the model deviations from reality. The method can be extended to investigate other variables, for example the SOM can be trained using both SLP and geopotential height to investigate the 3 D structure of teleconnections, while the location of the base points of the <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> for certain patterns can be used {{to assess the impact of}} teleconnections, such as rainfall and temperature patterns. ...|$|R

When applied to intensity data recorded {{as a function of}} time and frequency, the result can be viewed {{in the form of a}} <b>correlation</b> <b>map,</b> wherein the temporal correlation between fluctuations in every possible pair of spectral channels is represented. In addition to serving as a useful diagnostic tool for the measuring system itself, such a <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> offers a wealth of information on spectral channels affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) and intermodulation products, if any. Although such estimations are inherently less sensitive than those using voltage correlations, the technique promises much broader applicability since intensity data are more commonly available. The strengths and weaknesses of this technique with respect to RFI mitigation are discussed and are illustrated with real examples. An extension of this analysis to polarization data is also explored. A promising way to isolate RFI on the basis of its highly polarized nature is proposed, and relevant practical issues are discussed. The present study suggests that high-resolution time-frequency data for the full Stokes parameters allow effective excision of RFI (by typically more than 20 dB), particularly for observations of unpolarized astronomical sources. This method is exceedingly effective in situations where a large fraction of the data is affected by polarized RFI, where a robust statistics approach fails...|$|E

However, divisions within basal ganglia nuclei (e. g., within the caudate) are difficult to identify using structural MRI. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) {{can be used to}} identify putative cerebral cortical functional areas in humans (Cohen et al., 2008). Here, we determine whether rs-fcMRI can be used to identify divisions in individual human adult basal ganglia. Putative basal ganglia divisions were generated by assigning basal ganglia voxels to groups based on the similarity of whole-brain functional connectivity <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> using modularity optimization, a network analysis tool. We assessed the validity of this approach by examining the spatial contiguity and location of putative divisions and whether divisions’ <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> were consistent with previously reported patterns of anatomical and functional connectivity.

Further, <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> associated with putative divisions were consistent with their presumed connectivity.

Tie points are computed in mappings between corresponding pixels in the left and right images of a stereoscopic pair. The mappings are sometimes not perfect because image data can be noisy and parallax can cause some points to appear in one image but not the other. The present {{computer program}} relies on the availability of a left- right <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> in addition to the usual right left <b>correlation</b> <b>map.</b> The additional map must be generated, which doubles the processing time. Such increased time can now be afforded in the data-processing pipeline, since the time for map generation is now reduced from about 60 to 3 minutes by the parallelization discussed in the previous article. Parallel cluster processing time, therefore, enabled this better science result. The first mapping is typically from a point (denoted by coordinates x,y) in the left image to a point (x',y') in the right image. The second mapping is from (x',y') in the right image to some point (x",y") in the left image. If (x,y) and(x",y") are identical, then the mapping is considered perfect. The perfect-match criterion can be relaxed by introducing an error window that admits of round-off error and a small amount of noise.

The human cortex can be parcellated into distinct regions based on structural features, such as gyri and sulci. Brain network patterns in a given region with respect to its neighbors, known as connectional fingerprints, {{can be used to}} parcellate the cortex. Distinct imaging modalities might provide complementary information for brain parcellation. Here, we established functional connectivity with time series data from functional MRI (fMRI) combined with a <b>correlation</b> <b>map</b> of cortical thickness obtained from T 1 -weighted MRI. We aimed to extend the previous study, which parcellated the medial frontal cortex (MFC) using functional connectivity, and to test the value of additional information regarding cortical thickness. Two types of network information were used to parcellate the MFC into two sub-regions with spectral and Ward's clustering approaches. The MFC region was defined using manual delineation based on in-house data (n = 12). Parcellation was applied to independent large-scale data obtained from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, n = 248). Agreement between parcellation using fMRI- and thickness-driven connectivity yielded dice coefficient overlaps of 0. 74 (Ward's clustering) and 0. 54 (spectral clustering). We also explored whole brain connectivity using the MFC sub-regions as seed regions based on these two types of information.

We have developed the Point Process Algorithm (PPA), a Bayesian technique for extracting planetary signals using the sine-chopped outputs of a dual nulling interferometer. It is so-called because it represents the system being observed {{as a set of}} points in a suitably-defined state space, thus providing a natural way of incorporating our prior knowledge of the compact nature of the targets of interest. It can also incorporate the spatial covariance of the exozodi as prior information which could help mitigate against false detections. Data at multiple wavelengths are used simultaneously, taking into account possible spectral variations of the planetary signals. Input parameters include the RMS measurement noise and the a priori probability of the presence of a planet. The output can be represented as an image of the intensity distribution on the sky, optimized for the detection of point sources.

This led to uncovering of analytic expressions capturing the full evolution of the two-particle momentum <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> over the entire range of interparticle interactions, from the independent particle limit with a substantial site-double-occupancy fraction, to the Mott insulating regime.

40|$|NMR <b>correlation</b> <b>maps</b> {{of paper}} samples suggest a two-site {{residence}} model for {{water in the}} ultrastructure of cellulose. When cross-linking and degradation of cellulose occur due to c-irradiation-induced ageing, a significant fraction of water appears confined into low-mobility sites of the cellulose matrix. As the cellulose damage grows more pronounced, the two-site structure turns into a single-site water arrangement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
