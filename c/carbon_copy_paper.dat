50|$|The printer was {{improvement}} over hobby printer CENTRUM T-85 and {{was designed to}} be very primitive and therefore cheap printer for 8-bit home computers. In BT100 ink ribbon was completely omitted. Instead single nail hit paper backed by <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> to print single dot on back side of paper. This arrangement was introduced to protect thin <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> from direct hit by nail.Also internal electronics was simple. Printer head was single nail with electromagnet driven by software on home computer. One direction motor for paper movement and two directions motor to move printer head were also controlled directly from computer. To give necessary feedback, motor axes were connected to plastic disc with cutouts on perimeter. LED and photoresistor were placed against disc cutouts and as the disc rotated light beam would reach photoresitor only when facing a cutout. This way distance travelled by motors could be measured, again directly from software.With provided drivers the printer would print 480 points across A4 (58 DPI) with 560 lines on page (48 DPI). That is 70 lines with 60 to 80 characters on line. Printer could print one A4 page in 10 minutes in low quality. Higher quality was available at cost of doubling the time. It was even possible to print on same paper several times using carbon copy papers of different colors to produce low quality color print.|$|E
40|$|A relay {{interferer}} channel {{consists of}} the classic relay channel with an additional source of interference. A three- terminal full-duplex Gaussian relay interferer channel with a cognitive source is analyzed. Each of the relay node and the destination node experiences on its link an additive Gaussian outside interference, in addition to additive noise. Only the source node, referred to as being the cognitive encoder, knows the interferences, in a non-causal manner. We first focus on the {{case in which the}} links to the relay and to the destination are corrupted by the same interference; and then we focus on the case of independent interferences. For each of these two models, we establish a lower bound on the channel capacity. The coding schemes for the lower bounds use techniques of dirty <b>paper</b> coding or <b>carbon</b> <b>copying</b> onto dirty <b>paper,</b> interference reduction at the source and decode-and-forward relaying.

50|$|The use of <b>carbon</b> <b>copies</b> {{declined}} {{with the}} advent of photocopying and electronic document creation and distribution (word processing). <b>Carbon</b> <b>copies</b> are still sometimes used in special applications: for example, in manual receipt books which have a multiple-use sheet of carbon paper supplied, so that the user can keep an exact copy of each receipt issued, although even here carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> is often used to the same effect.|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} a state-dependent three-terminal full-duplex relay channel with the channel states noncausally available at only the source, that is, neither at the relay nor at the destination. This model has application to cooperation over certain wireless channels with asymmetric cognition capabilities and cognitive interference relay channels. We establish lower bounds on the channel capacity for both discrete memoryless (DM) and Gaussian cases. For the DM case, the coding scheme {{for the lower}} bound uses techniques of rate-splitting at the source, decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, and a Gel'fand-Pinsker-like binning scheme. In this coding scheme, the relay decodes only partially the information sent by the source. Due to the rate-splitting, this lower bound {{is better than the}} one obtained by assuming that the relay decodes all the information from the source, that is, full-DF. For the Gaussian case, we consider channel models in which each of the relay node and the destination node experiences on its link an additive Gaussian outside interference. We first focus on the case in which the links to the relay and to the destination are corrupted by the same interference; and then we focus on the case of independent interferences. We also discuss a model with correlated interferences. For each of the first two models, we establish a lower bound on the channel capacity. The coding schemes for the lower bounds use techniques of dirty <b>paper</b> coding or <b>carbon</b> <b>copying</b> onto dirty <b>paper,</b> interference reduction at the source and decode-and-forward relaying.

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, better copying methods {{had become}} available. Consequently, the copying pencil was being used as an {{indelible}} pencil, a precursor to the ball-point pen. When used dry, it left a slightly-purplish gray mark on paper, not dissimilar to a lead pencil's, but which could not be erased. When used wet, its tip moistened repeatedly by water or saliva, it produced a bright purple writing. The copying pencil served as a convenient substitute for the fountain-pen: it could be carried on one's person without need for ink or fear of leaks. Furthermore, for producing <b>copies</b> using <b>carbon</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>copying</b> pencils were considered superior to both ordinary pencils (whose writing in the original could be erased) and fountain-pens (whose nibs could not always withstand the pressure needed to produce the carbon-copy).|$|R

40|$|This essay {{constitutes}} part of {{my research}} at the interface between fine art and film. I am interested in how practices from each discipline change works from the other. The essay discusses a practice of drawing film which the artist Anna Lucas developed for herself and the gallery visitor (as temporary artist) at her exhibition The Delinquent Silhouette (2006). The viewers made drawings of movies on <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> while watching them. They could only see their drawing after the copy paper was removed – a kind of 'blind' drawing. When we watch a movie in the cinema, we have {{to submit to the}} temporality of the film. Through the blind movie drawings, the viewer resists this imposed temporality. Drawing the film liberates the viewer from the passive and linear mode of viewing for not only does she produce an original of her own through the process of copying, but also the viewing experience of the film changes. In the act of trying to draw film, shapes become more important than the narrative, which is in essence impossible to draw because it constantly moves on. As we try to imagine what we have drawn and where, alongside the action of the film, it becomes cumulatively more difficult to draw everything (or anything) that moves past on the screen figuratively. The focus turns inward as we try to capture our own emotions or those of the characters, and we cannot but fail to represent our suspense or their passions. This essay developed out of my research on Werner Herzog's documentaries. It was {{part of my}} keynote address 'Land of Science and Artness: Translation, Documentary and the Copy' at the symposium 'Land of Silence and Darkness: Four Days of Talk and Action Connecting Movies, Blindness, Drawing, Perception and Neuroscience,' University of Oxford, 2009...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{strives to}} convey the {{problems}} and proposed solutions for Strasbaugh’s Nonconforming Report (NCR) Optimization. Strasbaugh is a world leader in silicon wafer polisher and grinder technologies. After a significant down size to the company parts they used to manufacture now have to be purchased, {{and many of these}} incoming parts do not conform to Strasbaugh’s high standards. This has led to an increase in NCRs that need to be processed, which takes up time, resources and money. The objective therefore became to update the multi-sheet <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> system to better optimize the use of these reports and get to the root cause of the issue. This was done using Microsoft Access (per clients request) as a low cost solution with a quick implementation period. Higher cost web-based server solutions were also proposed for future use. The design of the database is simple, sleek and user friendly. The main menu gives options to view the percentage breakdown report, search for potential trends in NCR’s, export NCR entries to an excel file, as well as track trends to find faulty suppliers or other major issues. In addition to the database, three flowcharts were created to document the process for current employee use and aid in training future employees. Lastly, a cost breakdown was done to show Strasbaugh that by using the new procedure {{they would be able to}} save money in the long term. Ideally, Strasbaugh would be able to identify root causes by using the database and completely eliminating all NCRs. Realistically, they will be able to reduce somewhere between 25 % and 50 % of their NCRs. In reducing 25 % Strasbaugh would save $ 11, 250 in overtime caused by rework and $ 1, 502. 40 in time the Quality Engineer can spend doing someone else or even towards solving the root causes. With a 50 % reduction, the savings would double. As Strasbaugh has more money and resources they can dedicate to improving this process, they can begin using a web-based server. This will allow them to easily send data within the company, input NCRs from multiple locations, and generate more in depth reports for management. With a web-based server, an administrative account could also be created so not all information is accessible and only the administrator will have editing capabilities. The following report will give a detailed analysis of the processes used and the end deliverables to be given to the client...|$|E

40|$|Costa's "writing on dirty paper" {{capacity}} result establishes {{that full}} state pre-cancellation can be attained in Gelfand-Pinsker channel with additive state and additive Gaussian noise. The "carbon copy onto dirty paper" channel is {{the extension of}} Costa's model to the compound setting: M receivers each observe {{the sum of the}} channel input, Gaussian noise and one of M Gaussian state sequences and attempt to decode the same common message. The state sequences are all non-causally known at the transmitter which attempts to simultaneously pre-code its transmission against the channel state affecting each output. In this correspondence we derive the capacity to within 2. 25 bits-per-channel-use of the <b>carbon</b> <b>copying</b> onto dirty <b>paper</b> channel in which the state sequences are statistically equivalent, having the same variance and the same pairwise correlation. For this channel capacity is approached by letting the channel input be the superposition of two codewords: a base codeword, simultaneously decoded at each user, and a top codeword which is pre-coded against the state realization at each user for a portion 1 /M of the time. The outer bound relies on a recursive bounding in which incremental side information is provided at each receiver. This result represents a significant first step toward determining the capacity of the most general "carbon copy onto dirty paper" channel in which state sequences appearing in the different channel outputs have any jointly Gaussian distribution...|$|R
