40|$|Stabilization of p 53 in erythroid {{precursors}} {{in response}} to nucleosomal stress underlies the hypoplastic anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with chromosome 5 q deletion [del(5 q) ]. We investigated whether <b>cenersen,</b> a clinically active 20 -mer antisense oligonucleotide complementary to TP 53 exon 10, could suppress p 53 expression and restore erythropoiesis in del(5 q) MDS. <b>Cenersen</b> treatment of ribosomal protein S- 14 -deficient erythroblasts significantly reduced cellular p 53 and p 53 -up-regulated modulator of apoptosis expression compared with controls, accompanied by {{a significant reduction in}} apoptosis and increased cell proliferation. In a two-stage erythroid differentiation assay, <b>cenersen</b> significantly suppressed nuclear p 53 in bone marrow CD 34 + cells isolated from patients with del(5 q) MDS, whereas erythroid burst recovery increased proportionally to the magnitude of p 53 suppression without evidence of del(5 q) clonal suppression (r = - 0. 6; P = 0. 005). To explore the effect of p 53 suppression on erythropoiesis in vivo, dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid receptor-dependent p 53 antagonist, was added to lenalidomide treatment in eight lower-risk, transfusion-dependent, del(5 q) MDS patients with acquired drug resistance. Transfusion independence was restored in five patients accompanied by expansion of erythroid precursors and decreased cellular p 53 expression. We conclude that targeted suppression of p 53 could support effective erythropoiesis in lenalidomide-resistant del(5 q) MDS...|$|E
