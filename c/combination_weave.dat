The hybrid natural fiber composites prepared in this study have relatively good mechanical properties. Different <b>combinations</b> of <b>woven</b> and non-woven flax fibers were used. The stacking sequence of the fibers was in different orientations, such as 0 degrees, + 45 degrees, and 90 degrees. The composites manufactured had good mechanical properties. A tensile strength of about 119 MPa and Young's modulus of about 14 GPa was achieved, with flexural strength and modulus of about 201 MPa and 24 GPa, respectively. For the purposes of comparison, composites were made with a <b>combination</b> of <b>woven</b> fabrics and glass fibers. One ply of a glass fiber mat was sandwiched in the mid-plane and this increased the tensile strength considerably to 168 MPa.

They are produced in collaboration with Donald Farnsworth. Although many are translated from black-and-white daguerreotypes, all of the tapestries use multiple colors of thread. No printing is involved in their creation; colors and values appear to the viewer based on combinations of more than 17,800 colored warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads, in an echo of Close's typical grid format. Close's tapestry series began with a 2003 black-and-white portrait of Philip Glass. In August 2013 he debuted two color self-portraits at Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York. Reviewing this exhibition, Marion Weiss writes: [...] "Close's Jacquard tapestries are not obviously fragmented, but are created by repeating multicolor warp and weft threads that are optically blended. Thus, portraits of Lou Reed and Roy Lichtenstein, for example, seem 'whole.' It's only when we get closer that we see the individual threads, which are woven together." ...|$|R
40|$|Paved road {{ways that}} include the carriageways along with the {{shoulders}} have been constructed {{for more than a}} century. Their basic design methods and construction techniques have undergone some changes with the development of modern engineered products as per end use requirements. Out of these the development of geotextiles in the past three decades had provided the strategies for enhancing the overall performance of the paved roadways. Several varieties of Geotextiles either in the form of woven or non-woven have since been developed for a number of end uses mainly as underlay in road construction for strengthening the pavement structure by increasing the soil compactness apart from the other end uses. Some fabrics are also being used as interlayer for the prevention of the reflective cracking in the road. All the Geotextiles that are being used in the geotechnical engineering like road construction, soil erosion control, slope management, agro textiles etc. are either woven or nonwoven. Now a days 3 D or multilayer fabrics are being extensively used as technical textiles which have great market potential. As per the need of the day, combined fabric of jute woven and nonwoven of different number of layers and area density have been produced and optimized in respect to their geotechnical property parameters for potential application in the field of geotechnical engineering.

40|$|High {{temperature}} ceramic matrix composites (CMC) {{are being}} explored as viable candidate materials for hot section gas turbine components. These advanced composites can potentially lead to reduced weight and enable higher operating temperatures requiring less cooling; thus leading to increased engine efficiencies. There {{is a need}} for convenient design tools that can accommodate various loading conditions and material data with their associated uncertainties to estimate the minimum predicted life as well as the failure probabilities of a structural component. This paper presents a review of the life prediction and probabilistic analyses performed for a CMC turbine stator vane. A computer code, NASALife, is used to predict the life of a 2 -D woven silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) turbine stator vane due to a mission cycle which induces low cycle fatigue and creep. The output from this program includes damage from creep loading, damage due to cyclic loading and the combined damage due to the given loading cycle. Results indicate that the trends predicted by NASALife are as expected for the loading conditions used for this study. In addition, a <b>combination</b> of <b>woven</b> composite micromechanics, finite element structural analysis and Fast Probability Integration (FPI) techniques has been used to evaluate the maximum stress and its probabilistic distribution in a CMC turbine stator vane. Input variables causing scatter are identified and ranked based upon their sensitivity magnitude.

40|$|The {{design of}} 3 D {{component}} parts made of fiber-reinforced composites for load bearing applications demands a load oriented fiber alignement. During the draping of the textile an undefined displacement of fibers up to wrinkle formation occurs. One possibility to in-fluence fiber orientation during draping is the utilisation {{of the characteristics}} of different fabric weaves. By combining different weaves in a textile reinforcing fabric adjusted to the component part, gradient-drapability can be developed. This means that local zones with a high structural stability and zones with high drapability can be created in a textile semi-finished product. The design of these zones is done by simulation to produce a fabric structure suitable for the component part. For that purpose, material models for draping simulation developed at the Institute of Textile Machinery and High Performance Material Technology (ITM) are being improved. The material behaviour of each type of fabric weave is analysed and transformed to the simulation model. With the simulations performed the influence of the <b>combination</b> of different <b>weave</b> types on the shear behaviour of fabrics can be demonstrated...|$|R

This project aims to show how a designer can work with fibre-specific dyeing and multiple fibers in a woven textile and the many possibilities this lends in a design process. With a sustainable approach to the matter used in the project, creating more with less, a suggestion is made of an alternative method of creating multidimensional fabrics. The chemical reaction between pigment and fiber is explored to show a greater appreciation for the textile material and to create fabrics capable of multiple expressions. One woven fabric, in individual pieces, is dyed in reactive-, acid- and disperse-dye. The cellulose-, wool- and synthetic yarns in the fabric absorb their intended pigment but also show how they react to another category of dye. A series of dyed samples, all originating from the same woven material with an abstract pattern, show the varied expression the treatment can achieve.

40|$|A {{colorful}} Chancay gauze fragment in the Michael C. Carlos Museum’s {{collection of}} Andean textiles deserves {{consideration for the}} ingenious yet unpublished technical <b>combination</b> of its <b>weave</b> structure. Its Late Intermediate Period weaver pushed beyond technical limitations to join the laborious techniques of gauze weaving and discontinuous warping to reinforce the cloth’s protective and regenerative functions. Worn on the head during moments of transformation, the headdress would have empowered its wearer in ritual contexts, perhaps helping her to initiate her own rebirth in the afterlife. The weaver’s sophisticated fusion of the two techniques resulted in “jumping” serpentine figures, rendered in gold, dark brown, and white, on an indigo background. This depiction of serpent movement, created {{by the use of}} a discontinuous warp made whole through the tying of tiny knots, recalls both the corporeal process of the cloth’s production as well as the physical exertion of snakes. Moreover, the cloth’s overall polychrome patterning evokes the vivid dorsal patterning of snakes who have just shed their skin and emerged headfirst as regenerated beings. Through an examination of the Carlos Museum textile, this paper connects the symbolic attributes of fiber with the physical process of gauze weaving and the funerary contexts from which gauzes are excavated. It also problematizes a tendency in the literature to apply the term “gauze” to openwork textiles; gauze weaving with its inherent iconography must be seen as a deliberate technical choice made by the weaver for its distinctive symbolic connotations...|$|R
40|$|Shedding is {{the first}} primary motions of loom. It is done by raising and {{lowering}} the Heald frames. The heald frames on a loom are positioned {{side by side with}} a little distance as possible. The different positions of heald frame causes the variation in distance from cloth fell to peek of shed. In the present paper, the effect ofthis positional variation upon warp yarns, fabric properties and most importantly the whole weaving procedure have been concentrated. To find out the significance of this effect, two categories of fabric was produced using same <b>weave</b> (<b>combination</b> of plain and twill) but changing drafting plan. In the first category, the warp yarnshaving plain weave were threaded to heald frames nearest to the cloth fell and the other portion of warp yarns having twill weave were threaded farthest to the cloth fell.

40|$|The north {{ring road}} in Semarang City – Central Java, is an {{important}} road since the function of products and services transportation which are passing this north traject of Central Java becoming more dense and commonly bring a very heavy load. Besides, this road often passing soil within a quite thick of sedimented alluvium; a clay ground within consistency from very soft until very hard slice, covered with underground coat, consists of compressible soft-slice land, and located in 5. 00 until 20. 00 metres depth. The load of vehicles, especially for the heavy loaded vehicles that passing through continuously, without recovering the soil before, the diminishing of consolidation about 2. 5 metres will occur. The soft-slice soil that we discussed before is the original soil, consisting some slices of soft until very soft soil consistence. From the analytical result, we found that those basic slices of soil are such a kind of clay slice, within a very high density and visually emerged as peat soil. There are two weaknesses of this soil; first it has relatively low strength which cannot support the high embankment of the road, second it has relatively high consolidation settlement that will shape {{the surface of the}} road become scraggly and waven. The empowerment of basic soil system used in the early soft soil design for The Development Project of North Ring Road in Semarang City – Central Java, is using the combination of Prefabricated Vertical Drain (PVD) and Geotextile Woven.

40|$|High {{temperature}} ceramic matrix composites (CMC) {{are being}} explored as viable candidate materials for hot section gas turbine components. These advanced composites can potentially lead to reduced weight, enable higher operating temperatures requiring less cooling and thus leading to increased engine efficiencies. However, these materials are brittle and show degradation with time at high operating temperatures due to creep {{as well as}} cyclic mechanical and thermal loads. In addition, these materials are heterogeneous in their make-up and various factors affect their properties in a specific design environment. Most of these advanced composites involve two- and three-dimensional fiber architectures and require a complex multi-step high temperature processing. Since there are uncertainties associated with each of these {{in addition to the}} variability in the constituent material properties, the observed behavior of composite materials exhibits scatter. Traditional material failure analyses employing a deterministic approach, where failure is assumed to occur when some allowable stress level or equivalent stress is exceeded, are not adequate for brittle material component design. Such phenomenological failure theories are reasonably successful when applied to ductile materials such as metals. Analysis of failure in structural components is governed by the observed scatter in strength, stiffness and loading conditions. In such situations, statistical design approaches must be used. Accounting for these phenomena requires a change in philosophy on the design engineer s part that leads to a reduced focus on the use of safety factors in favor of reliability analyses. The reliability approach demands that the design engineer must tolerate a finite risk of unacceptable performance. This risk of unacceptable performance is identified as a component's probability of failure (or alternatively, component reliability). The primary concern of the engineer is minimizing this risk in an economical manner. The methods to accurately determine the service life of an engine component with associated variability have become increasingly difficult. This results, in part, from the complex missions which are now routinely considered during the design process. These missions include large variations of multi-axial stresses and temperatures experienced by critical engine parts. There is a need for a convenient design tool that can accommodate various loading conditions induced by engine operating environments, and material data with their associated uncertainties to estimate the minimum predicted life of a structural component. A probabilistic composite micromechanics technique in <b>combination</b> with <b>woven</b> composite micromechanics, structural analysis and Fast Probability Integration (FPI) techniques has been used to evaluate the maximum stress and its probabilistic distribution in a CMC turbine stator vane. Furthermore, input variables causing scatter are identified and ranked based upon their sensitivity magnitude. Since the measured data for the ceramic matrix composite properties is very limited, obtaining a probabilistic distribution with their corresponding parameters is difficult. In case of limited data, confidence bounds are essential to quantify the uncertainty associated with the distribution. Usually 90 and 95 % confidence intervals are computed for material properties. Failure properties are then computed with the confidence bounds. Best estimates and the confidence bounds on the best estimate of the cumulative probability function for R-S (strength - stress) are plotted. The methodologies and the results from these analyses will be discussed in the presentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{coalition}} has been fatally careless in Western Sydney, writes DAVID BURCHELL {{in this special}} report for APO AT AROUND {{this point in the}} last federal election campaign I reported for APO from the federal Coalition’s unlikely new stronghold in Sydney’s outer west. Traditionally Western Sydney has been Labor territory, but since 1996 Sydney’s outer ring - from the north-west around to the city’s southern fringes - has shifted gradually but decisively into the conservative camp. At the same time, it seems, that inner-city bohemians were getting hip to Paul Keating and his manifold policy works, outer-suburbanites were storing up a kind of suppressed rage, compounded out of financial exasperation (those phenomenal interest rates, which still linger in the memory), cultural ressentiment (what’s wrong with being a “real” Aussie, anyway?) and a kind of practical-minded suburban impatience with all those grand but ultimately ineffectual symbolic brushstrokes. By 2004, however, the Keating spectre had begun to fade and Labor had come to seem more palatable again - much as kids of my age had resolved to return to the beach a year or two after the film Jaws had done its dash. Labor’s meteoric boy-leader, Mark Latham - then in his suburban-bloke stage - had been reaching out again to the nation’s serried ranks of home-buyers, bathroom-renovators and soccer-mums. As APO’s worthy editor had judged, it seemed worthwhile to test the mood of Western Sydney. In the event, there was no especially arresting story to tell. Gauging from the buoyant local statistics and the local vibe, it seemed unlikely that these seats were about to rebel against the government (or anybody else) in the near future. The local MPs were popular and ideologically unencumbered. Life was good, and the government hadn’t done much to offend the solid burghers of outer-suburbia. But it was also possible to scent a marine odour of fragility about the Coalition’s fortunes {{in this part of the}} world - something like the smell which forewarns seasoned sailors of a still-distant storm, perhaps. There was a sense that people were wedded not so much to the Coalition as to the cicada-echoing calm and tranquillity that had marked the preceding eight years of Australian neighbourhood life. This sort of allegiance is inevitably ephemeral. And so, by way of approximating a conclusion left hanging tantalisingly in the air, I wound up in the following auspicious but tentative manner: “So long as interest-rates do stay low, the government doesn’t really have to project forward-looking policies for the new communities springing up here like fields of lucerne. But they may not stay low for much longer. The pendulum may not have swung, yet. But if it were the needle of a barometer it might be wobbling, signaling stormy weather ahead. ” It wasn’t much of a prediction. But to the extent that it was one, it might be said to have borne fruit. In the three years since, a wave of redistributions - occasioned by the historic decline of New South Wales as Australia’s demographic hub - have reshaped the electoral map of Western Sydney, dimming somewhat that once bright star in the Coalition’s electoral firmament. Macarthur, until recently an outer-suburban Sydney seat suspended between the twin satellite towns of Campbelltown and Camden, has become more a rural seat than an urban one, and has slipped further onto the government’s side of the electoral ledger. The seat of Greenway, which was once centred upon the austere Western Sydney metropolis of Blacktown, has drifted ever further westwards, so that it now sprawls across the orchards and grazing-fields of Richmond. Struggletown neighbourhoods of Parramatta have shuffled northwards into the prime minister’s once safe northern electorate of Bennelong. And the celebrated seat of Lindsay - where Jackie Kelly became the PM’s anointed missionary for the values of the “Howard’s battlers” after 1996 - is now fastened more firmly than ever onto the striving “pram city” of Penrith and its industrial environs. Finally, the seat of Macquarie, which previously yoked together solid farming folks with the boho villages of the Blue Mountains, has rattled shakily further westwards along the railway line, passing the old mining city of Lithgow on its journey to Bathurst, the old home-town of once local member Ben Chifley. The electoral effect of these changes is mixed. Parramatta - the most marginal seat in Sydney - has become nominally Liberal, even though most observers expect it to swing smoothly back into Labor territory. Greenway and Macarthur have become solid Liberal strongholds, each with a margin of around eleven percent. Macquarie has lurched from being a fairly comfortable Liberal seat to becoming a nominal Labor one. And Lindsay’s Liberal tiara has slipped askew once more, putting it back into marginal status. In short, there’s no single political story to be told here (not that there ever was). And yet across the region that marine smell has undoubtedly grown a little stronger and brinier. When John Howard launched some of his campaign policies in Penrith three years ago, he was sporting a triumphant, fox-like smile. “This is a great way to begin the second part of the campaign, here in territory the Liberal Party thought it could never have,” he began, to exultant applause. In front of him on the lectern was the succinct but effective (and specific) slogan: “Keeping Interest Rates Low. ” This time around when the PM visited Penrith his mood was altogether more saturnine, and the slogan on the curtains (“Go for Growth,” with those mystifying inverted commas) was still upbeat, but decidedly vaguer. Mr Howard even suffered one of those bad auguries that seem to have dogged his campaign, when a retreating camera crew unwittingly knocked a female spectator unconscious in front of him. (He stood stock still, looking a little bewildered, much as Julius Caesar must have looked when the seer made that well-known comment about the Ides of March.) Indeed, across Western Sydney as a whole, there’s a curiously ill-starred atmosphere to the Liberals’ campaign effort. The sitting Labor member in Parramatta, the redoubtable Julie Owens, has to secure a swing towards her simply to hold her seat, let alone strengthen her grip on it. And the suits at Liberal head office (after an eternity dithering over it) must have thought her opponent - former Navy man and self-professed unionist Colin Robinson - was a clever riposte to Labor’s thunderings about the dangers of WorkChoices. Yet local journalists can’t seem to track down Robinson to save their lives. At a recent media event where Robinson failed to appear, anxious scribes button-holed the Greens candidate to see if she knew Robinson’s mobile phone number. Three years ago Jackie Kelly’s face was plastered across Lindsay much as Greta Garbo’s must have been across the cinema hoardings of Los Angeles in the Golden Age of Hollywood. This time around her little-known former staffer, Karen Chijoff, has been reduced to hand-painting the improvised slogan “A True Local Girl” above her grey-hued photographs at the entrance to the motorway. Three years ago Pat Farmer, the easy-going former marathon-runner turned celebrity MP, was ambling around Macarthur offering local improvements much as Jesus offered loaves and fishes. This time he’s trading barbs with Labor candidate and local carpenter Nick Bleasdale, whom he accuses of pork-barrelling the electorate with grand offers of renovations to the local football stadium - offers Farmer loftily refuses to match. Disputes like this make Farmer appear defensive and governmental. This is not necessarily a good look in what has become a more or less rural seat, the kind of seat where roads funding is one of the most talked-about issues, and where Canberra shenanigans can seem like a distraction. Farmer’s double-digit margin ought to be unassailable, yet local newspaper editors are scrambling to find election news, unsettled by the thought of an unheralded Labor win. Nationally Labor’s public-relations gurus like to accuse the government of desperation. Yet the Liberal campaign in Western Sydney doesn’t feel desperate so much as incoherent, as if somebody crucial to events had unaccountably left the campaign script in their other suit. This may be a product of the party’s evident bewilderment at the national level: even after twelve months, the penny still doesn’t seem to have dropped that the electorate might dare to un-elect a government it doesn’t actually hate. By the same token, it may equally be a product of the party’s well-publicised Sydney problem. The nation’s largest city still unaccountably fails to generate many candidates of quality for the Liberals, and too many local branches still appear to savour of knitted tea-cosies and doughy scones. It is as if Sydney is a condundrum to which the state Liberal Party still struggles to find the solution. Or else the answer might be a combination of these two factors - a <b>combination</b> <b>woven</b> together by the person of the PM himself. It’s often been noted in Liberal circles that while John Howard is a quintessential Sydney boy (self-made, unpretentious, ferociously unsentimental), and an undeniably popular figure in his home city, he has played virtually no role in the tenor and conduct of the state Liberal Party - an organisation which still too often proceeds as if its core business were the fighting of internecine ideological disputes. (At times seems almost as if the denizens of Young Labor had mysteriously switched camps and moved back into their parents’ old homes on the city’s North Shore.) Why, they ask, has Howard not taken the time in eleven years to remake the organisation that preselects him? The simple answer may be that Howard (the once-despised ugly duckling of the NSW Liberals) has had little relish for the task. Were elections to be won and lost by the numbers of campaign posters blooming along our front lawns, Labor would be a shoo-in across much of Western Sydney. Of course, anyone with a sense of political history knows this is a perilous equation. The older among APO’s readers will no doubt still recall that fantastical election campaign of 1975, when many youthful supporters sincerely believed Labor would win, on the somewhat harebrained logic that there was - or ought to be - a correspondence between the size of your rallies and the size of your vote. (Then as now, marijuana and politics make an unstable combination.) Equally striking on streets from Penrith through to Lithgow are those ubiquitous ACTU “Your Rights at Work” posters, totems which have assumed for old-time Labor stalwarts an equivalent significance to the “Not Happy, John” bumper stickers of disillusioned liberals. It’s still not absolutely clear how many votes WorkChoices will deliver to Labor in electorates like Macarthur and Lindsay. These are areas where the majority of voters still work with their hands, to be sure - but where increasingly they do so as contractors or on their own account. Perhaps, here as elsewhere, the effect of the issue will be more indirect. It’s not so much that most people in the outer suburbs believe that their own conditions are under threat from the government’s IR legislation, as that they fear those of others will be threatened, or are being threatened, elsewhere. (After all, empathy and fellow-feeling are for most people tied up with a sense of shared conditions, rather than exotic otherness.) And, more than this, that they fear the ideological and confrontational tone which WorkChoices has introduced into political argument. John Howard spent ten years painstakingly untying himself from the bonds of his radical past. It seems to have taken not much more than a year for the threads to be re-tied. The Coalition until recently prided itself on its attentiveness to the needs and opinions of the citizens of its new-found outer suburban prizes. It hasn’t made enemies of these people, by any means. But it has become fatally careless with them. And Labor, for all its own self-immersedness and disconnectedness, may well be about to reap the benefit. • In memoriam Norman Mailer, 1923 - 2007 : a truly atrocious novelist but a fine political journalist.

40|$|Parental time pressure, {{in terms}} of actual {{workload}} and subjective reports, is high and likely to increase in the future, with ongoing implications for personal wellbeing. The combination of parenting young children and maternal employment, in particular, gives rise to greater time pressure in families. Although characterised by increasing diversity, {{two of the most}} time pressured family types, dual-earner and lone parent families are central features in the Australian demographic landscape. In view of predominant social and cultural trends, the ‘problem’ of time pressure is deep-rooted and set to grow. While the need to address ‘work-family balance’ is prominent in political and social life, the relationship between time pressure and wellbeing has not been well quantified and we know little about how that relationship works in families. At the heart of the time pressure problem, is a potential threat to the healthy development of children. This thesis, then, is broadly concerned with the nature of time pressure and its relationship with parental wellbeing when they are caring for young children. The central aim of the thesis is to determine whether time pressure has {{a significant impact on the}} self-reported wellbeing of parents with young children. There are four main research questions. Time pressure is defined as being both objective (‘parental time use’) and subjective in nature (‘parental perceptions about their time’). The questions are: (1) What is the relationship between parental time use and parental perceptions about their time? (2) How do parental time use and parental perceptions about their time relate to their self-reported wellbeing? (3) Are the effects of parental time use and parental perceptions about their time on self-reported wellbeing modified by other perceived stressors and psychological coping resources? (4) What are the predictors of self-perceived time pressure? Because of their broad scope, each of these questions is given further focus by the stating of specific sub-components. The study draws from several selected theoretical perspectives and models around the influence of time on individual health and wellbeing. Because the experience of time pressure has multiple interacting levels of influence from the individual through to family, work, and community settings and more widely from the social, political and cultural environment, the thesis is underpinned by ecological theory. To allow for the meaningful and practical measurement of time pressure within different contexts, the Family and Community Resource Framework was adopted. The Framework views time as a resource that can be utilized and traded by families with other resources of human, financial, psychological and social capital to enable family functioning and individual wellbeing. Then, to make sense of the pathways of influence, subjective time pressure was conceptualized as a psychosocial factor within an epidemiological model of the social determinants of health. These theoretical perspectives in <b>combination</b> are <b>woven</b> throughout the thesis as both a guide and a means of interpreting results. In addressing the broad research gaps around time pressure and parental wellbeing, the study took a population perspective and a quantitative methodological approach. A sub sample of parents with young children (at least one resident child aged less than six) was drawn from Wave Two of the Household Income and Labor Dynamics of Australia (HILDA) Study, conducted in 2002. Acknowledging the key role of gender and employment status in the experience of time pressure, all analysis was undertaken separately for employed mothers (n= 451), non-employed mothers (n= 512) and employed fathers (n= 686). At another level that recognizes the influence of family structure and joint employment arrangements, analysis was undertaken for parents in ‘dual-earner families’ (n= 346), ‘traditional families’ (n= 321) and ‘lone mother families’ (n= 145). This approach addressed the specific deficiency of quantitative studies of time pressure (objective and subjective) among families at the population level. The concepts of “parental wellbeing”, “parental time use”, and “parental perceptions about their time” were all operationalized by a set of self-reported measures. Parental wellbeing was captured by the mental health, vitality and general health subscales of the MOS-Short-Form 36 allowing for variation in positive health states. Parental time use (objective time pressure) was measured by their self-reported estimates of average weekly hours in paid work, household work (sum of indoor and outdoor activities, and chores) and of their time spent with children. Furthermore, these three estimates were summed to provide two measures of total workload. Parental time perceptions (subjective time pressure) were quantified by questions about their paid work hour preferences and satisfaction, perceived fairness in their share of housework and childcare, satisfaction with their amount of free time, and primarily by their self-perceived time pressure. The study also drew on indicators of job quality, financial wellbeing, parenting stress and perceived social support to examine the modifying role of other psychological resources on the relationship between time pressure and wellbeing. The bulk of analyses utilized multivariate linear regression techniques to examine the simultaneous effects of time use and parental perceptions about their time on mental health, general health and vitality, with adjustment for family characteristics and indicators of human and financial capital. Primarily, the thesis concludes that time pressure has a significant negative impact on the wellbeing of many Australian parents with young children, in particular, when they are employed. ‘Self-perceived time pressure’ proves to be a complex issue as high levels were associated with large amounts of paid work and household work; with perceptions of unfairness in household work and childcare; with low free time satisfaction; with higher levels of job and parenting stress, and lower levels of perceived social support. The thesis provides conclusive evidence that a high level of self-perceived time pressure lowers the mental health, vitality and general health of all parents. For employed parents, low levels of satisfaction with their paid work hours, and for all parents, low levels of satisfaction with their free time hours had an additional detrimental effect on their mental health and vitality. In contrast, there was little evidence overall that parental distribution of time to specific activities, or that a greater total workload independently contributed to lower wellbeing. Unpredictably, employed mothers had better wellbeing when they spent a relatively large amount of time with their children. Furthermore, a high level of self-perceived time pressure exerted a detrimental effect on the wellbeing of some employed parents even after adjustment for other reported stressors around work and family life. Additionally, there was evidence that among the most highly time pressured mothers a higher level of perceived social support did little to buffer the impact of time pressure on aspects of their wellbeing. Integral to the findings is the evidence that family employment arrangements and structure alter the meaning of time pressure and its relationship to parental wellbeing. These conclusions raise the question of how to avoid time-pressured circumstances in Australian families, and how to support and resource parents who are already feeling chronically pressed for time. The very nature of time pressure implies multiple levels and points of intervention at the policy, community, workplace, family and individual level. Avoiding time pressure in families requires continued policy directions aimed at creating flexibility and choice in how parents divide their time between work and family with safeguards against excessive hours in paid work. Furthermore, the findings prompt the need for an expanded policy to one that includes leisure or time for oneself and the facilitation of parental time with children. From a preventive perspective, specific and early intervention at a family level from pre-conception through to antenatal and early parenting programs will help to facilitate a gender equitable approach to the division of labour. Among employed parents, correlations between self-perceived time pressure and their perceived stress and complexity of paid work suggest a greater role for workplaces in preventing and identifying psychosocial stress among employees. Inherently more difficult is identifying and supporting parents who are already feeling the strain. The prevalence of perceived time pressures and the strong negative association with parental wellbeing suggests the need for a public health response. The urgency for action lays in the potential damage to the relationship between the parent and developing child. Fundamentally, all strategies should be aimed at giving parents back a sense of control over their time. The thesis lays a foundation for ongoing research examining the effects of paid and unpaid work patterns, free time and perceived time pressures on parental, child and family wellbeing over time...|$|R
