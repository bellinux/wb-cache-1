5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young <b>clatter</b> their bills when aroused.|$|E

25|$|This large stork has a dance-like display. A pair stalk up to {{each other}} face to face, {{extending}} their wings and fluttering the wing tips rapidly and advancing their heads until they meet. They then <b>clatter</b> their bills and walk away. The display lasts {{for a minute and}} may be repeated several times.|$|E
25|$|Bird song is best {{developed}} in the order Passeriformes. Some groups are nearly voiceless, producing only percussive and rhythmic sounds, such as the storks, which <b>clatter</b> their bills. In some manakins (Pipridae), the males have evolved several mechanisms for mechanical sound production, including mechanisms for stridulation not unlike those found in some insects.|$|E
25|$|The third morning {{started with}} two quick wickets, with Watson and nightwatchman Lyon departing for the {{addition}} of just one run. A flurry of runs from Haddin and Mitchell Johnson saw Australia pass 300, but the last two wickets fell for just four runs, and Australia were all out for 308, still 122 runs behind England. As England began their second innings, the Australians again made early breakthroughs, with Cook out for 12 and Ballance out for a duck, before Lyth and Bell shared a stand of 51 runs for the third wicket. The partnership was broken when Clarke made a one-handed catch to dismiss Lyth for 37, but Bell batted on to reach his first Test half-century in 10 innings. He and Root put on 97 for the fourth wicket before Bell was out for 60, bowled by Johnson for the Australian's first wicket of the match, following first-innings figures of 0/111. Root followed 11 overs later for exactly the same score off exactly {{the same number of}} balls, and dismissed in exactly the same manner by Hazlewood. Stokes then made a useful 42, but after the dismissal of Buttler (7), there was a <b>clatter</b> of wickets, reducing England from 236/5 to 245/8 in less than three overs. Wood hit a quickfire 32 not out off 18 balls to push England towards 300, but they were eventually bowled out for 289, a lead of 411. With rain forecast for the fifth day, England knew {{that they would have to}} bowl Australia out on day 4 to ensure victory.|$|E

500|$|Dave Marsh was {{the first}} music critic to employ the term punk rock: In the May 1971 issue of Creem, he {{described}} ? and the Mysterians, {{one of the most}} popular 1960s garage rock acts, as giving a [...] "landmark exposition of punk rock". Later in 1971, in his fanzine Who Put the Bomp, Greg Shaw wrote about [...] "what I have chosen to call [...] "punkrock" [...] bands—white teenage hard rock of '64–66 (Standells, Kingsmen, Shadows of Knight, etc.)". Lester Bangs used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] in several articles written in the early 1970s to refer to mid-1960s garage acts. In his June 1971 piece in Creem, [...] "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung," [...] he wrote, [...] "then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone <b>clatter.</b> ... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, garage rock had no {{name and}} was not {{thought of as a}} genre, but as typical {{elemental}} rock of the period. [...] When it began to be recognised in the early 1970s, [...] "garage rock" [...] was not the name initially prescribed. [...] Between 1971-1973 certain rock critics began to speak nostalgically of mid-1960s garage bands (and artists perceived to be in their tradition) as a genre and for several years used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to characterize it, making it the first musical form to bear the description. [...] Conjuring up the mid-1960s, Lester Bangs in 1971 wrote: [...] "...then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone <b>clatter...</b> oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever".|$|E

500|$|The video {{depicts a}} band playing [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)". U2 were {{cast in the}} role of the band's {{guardian}} angels, watching over the position that corresponds to their instrument in U2. Meret Becker is the lead actress of the video, cast as the band's lead singer. Wenders stated that they [...] "liked the idea that Bono's voice would be sung by a girl in this video." [...] Throughout the video U2 help the musicians play the track; drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. is shown assisting in the beat, while The Edge tunes the guitar, which Wenders noted is [...] "what you'd do if you were guardian angel to a lead guitarist." [...] The video alternates between the band playing, the members of U2 standing on Victoria, and scenes from both Wenders films. At the conclusion of the video, Bono leaves the band on their own. The final shot shows him falling to earth, personifying the final lyric [...] "Just the bang and the <b>clatter</b> as an angel hits the ground." ...|$|E
500|$|Big Boi's {{lyrics are}} playful and irreverent, with clever wordplay and boasts, while {{incorporating}} non-sequiturs, pop culture references, and tongue-twisters. His rhymes are delivered through a fast, versatile flow and dexterous cadence. Rolling Stones Christian Hoard describes his flow as [...] "inimitably slick and speedy". Amos Barshad of New York notes his lyrics as [...] "playful, but his flow is stern and unpredictable". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker describes the album's mood as [...] "decidedly upbeat" [...] and writes of Big Boi's rapping, [...] "The musical DNA of Sir Lucious {{lies in a}} simple strategy that Big Boi has used for years: he often raps in double time, {{no matter what the}} tempo of the song is. This means that even the slower songs [...] don’t drag—Big Boi uses the space in the beat to provide another rhythm with his words". Frere-Jones describes him as [...] "simultaneously forceful and careful" [...] with his lyrics and compares his rapping technique to [...] "the <b>clatter</b> of a machine, like a lawnmower, where secondary rhythms whisper underneath the main beat [...] Big Boi is never laid-back when he raps: he defines wide-awake".|$|E
500|$|For the PlayStation version, IGN's David Zdyrko cited that [...] "Many of {{the games}} are quite enjoyable, {{but the truth of}} the matter is that it never quite matches the thrill of the real thing" [...] and criticized on how [...] "the visuals are very bland on the whole. It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel of one of the most successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background <b>clatter</b> to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E

500|$|Richard Corliss of Time magazine, {{considered}} the film a [...] "by the numbers adaptation," [...] criticising {{the pace and}} the [...] "charisma-free" [...] lead actors. CNN's Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves [...] "are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative {{is more like a}} jamboree inside Rowling's head." [...] Nathaniel Rogers of The Film Experience gave the film a negative review and wrote: [...] "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is as bland as movies can get." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography [...] "bland and muggy," [...] and the majority of the film a [...] "solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo." [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times was highly negative about the film, saying [...] " [...] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides <b>clatter</b> and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve." [...] He also said it suffered from [...] "a lack of imagination" [...] and wooden characters, adding, [...] "The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{arrangements}} were developed through extensive jamming, with Cox's and Miles' playing influencing Hendrix's ideas. [...] According to biographer Keith Shadwick, Cox explained in later interviews, [...] "the process {{was based on}} building up rhythm patterns and that each pattern dictated the shape and character of {{a portion of a}} song in which it appeared". [...] Record producer Alan Douglas witnessed the approach during a jam at the Record Plant and saw it as inefficient. On the other hand, Shadwick feels that it was necessary: [...] "it seemed the only way available, especially as neither Cox nor Miles, in particular, were exactly swift on the musical uptake". [...] Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray noted, [...] "Cox's funky, uncluttered bass style would give Hendrix's new music a more solid, less frenetic underpinning [...] [...] In every way, Cox's function would be to provide the steadiness Hendrix so urgently required". [...] Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt described Miles' style as [...] "pleasantly messy... He wasn't as tight as a Stax drummer ... his rolls would <b>clatter</b> about a bit". [...] However, his often described [...] "fatback grooves" [...] lay down a solid rhythmic foundation and the combination of Cox and Miles adds a [...] "heavy, rolling fluidity which brings out a very different dimension in Hendrix's playing".|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} not as {{complimentary}} towards the album. Charlotte Heathcote of British newspaper the Daily Express said that, while M.I.A. could [...] "still lay claim to being {{one of our most}} imaginative, uncompromising artists", there were [...] "only glimmers of brilliance" [...] on the album. Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot gave the album two and a half out of four stars and expressed a mixed response towards M.I.A.'s [...] " [...] pop more fervently than ever. Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt was critical of the album, stating that it sounded [...] "murky and almost punishingly discordant, as if the album has been submerged underwater and then set upon by an arsenal of exceptionally peeved power tools". She went on to state that nothing on the album sounded [...] "truly vital", or as revolutionary as M.I.A. wanted the public to believe. Stephen Troussé, writing in Uncut, described the album as [...] "anti-climactic" [...] and [...] "self-satisfied" [...] and said that it suffered from [...] "diminished horizons". Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters noted M.I.A.'s [...] "self-aggrandizing" [...] as a weakness, adding that Maya lacks [...] "the focus and confidence of M.I.A.'s previous albums". Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine noted that the album [...] "has the feel of a vanity project" [...] and wrote [...] "It may be an above-average album, but its aesthetic matches her persona only at its shallowest levels, in the thinness of its ideas and the often-forceful ugliness of its message". Chris Richard of The Washington Post called it [...] "a disorienting mix of industrial <b>clatter</b> and digital slush" [...] and noted [...] "there isn't much to sing along to".|$|E

500|$|Wildflower is a plunderphonics album; every {{track on}} the record is sample-based, similar to Since I Left You. The album has also been {{described}} as featuring electronic music, neo-psychedelia, disco, and hip hop throughout. When asked if Wildflower has more than the estimated 3,500 samples on the former record, Chater stated [...] "I’ve got no idea...there’s probably more. It’s so fragmented. Every little footstep and voice and yell and <b>clatter</b> and cowhorn and dog barking, it’s just ridiculous." [...] The group had been clearing samples starting in 2011-12, but would occasionally need to re-negotiate when owners of the source material discovered who the Avalanches were and would request more money. The sample clearance was done by Pat Shannahan in Los Angeles, who also cleared the samples for Since I Left You. The track [...] "Subways" [...] features vocals sampled from a 1980 track {{of the same name}} sung by then 12-year-old post punk artist Chandra off her EP Transportation. Chandra had not heard of the Avalanches until they approached her in early 2014 for permission to sample the track, but has since become a fan of their work. The most difficult sample to clear was of a choir from Kew High School in Melbourne singing [...] "Come Together" [...] by The Beatles on the track [...] "The Noisy Eater". Initially their request was refused, but Chater and Di Blasi made contact with Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono directly through [...] "friends of friends". They sent them the track along with a letter written by Tony explaining their process and in return were granted approval. The song would have not been added to Wildflower if the sample could not be cleared.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - {{and it is the}} old, old story. She takes her tiny daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as he reads the announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he comes out of it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day he forgets his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears the <b>clatter</b> of hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and his hand is stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!" ...|$|E
