5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E

5|$|Perot largely financed his own {{campaign}} and relied on marketing and wide grassroots support. In certain polls, Perot led the three-way race with Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, the incumbent President, and then-Governor Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> Arkansas, the Democratic nominee. He dropped out in July 1992 amid controversy, but re-entered in October, participating {{in all three}} presidential debates. Despite an aggressive use of campaign infomercials on prime time network television, his polling numbers never fully recovered from his initial exit. On Election Day, Perot appeared on every state ballot {{as a result of}} the earlier draft efforts. He won several counties and finished in third place, receiving close to 18.97 percent of the popular vote, the most won by a third-party presidential candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E
5|$|The notable {{exception}} to this was when land was claimed by the Connecticut-based owners of the Susquehanna Company, who had been granted titles to land claimed by Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley, {{in an area that}} is now Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The area was also claimed by Pennsylvania, which refused to recognize the Connecticut titles. Allen, after being promised land, traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long-time nemesis, Governor <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> New York, by proposing that a new state be carved out of the disputed area and several counties of New York. The entire affair was more bluster than anything else, and was resolved amicably when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles.|$|E

5|$|In the American camp, {{the mutual}} resentment between Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold finally {{exploded}} into open hostility. Gates quickly reported {{the action of}} September 19 to the Congress and Governor George <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> New York, but he failed to mention Arnold at all. The field commanders and men universally credited Arnold for their success. Almost all the troops involved were from Arnold's command and Arnold was the one directing the battle while Gates sat in his tent. Arnold protested, and the dispute escalated into a shouting match that ended with Gates relieving Arnold of his command and giving it to Benjamin Lincoln. Arnold asked for a transfer to Washington's command, which Gates granted, but instead of leaving he remained in his tent. There is no documentary evidence for a commonly recounted anecdote that a petition signed by line officers convinced Arnold to stay in camp.|$|E
5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the eight}} major Democratic presidential candidates, then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois {{received}} the most votes and was ultimately declared {{the winner of the}} Iowa Democratic Caucus of 2008, making him the first African American to win the caucus.

25|$|On April 2, 1986, Wallace {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in Montgomery that he would not run for a fifth term as Governor of Alabama, and would retire from public life after leaving the governor's mansion in January 1987. Wallace achieved four gubernatorial terms across three decades, totaling 16 years in office. It is a national record tied by others but thus far surpassed only by Terry Branstad of Iowa, who served six terms from 1983 to 1999 and from 2011 to 2017, and former Vice President George <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> New York, who served twenty-one non-consecutive years as governor between 1777 and 1804.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{declined}} {{to run for}} a third term in 1982, and chose instead {{to run for the}} United States Senate in 1982. However, Brown was defeated by Republican Pete Wilson, and many considered his political career to be over. After traveling abroad, Brown returned to California and served as Chairman of the California Democratic Party (1989-1991), choosing to resign to run for the Senate again in 1992. Changing his mind, Brown ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1992, once again finishing second in the popular vote, carrying six states and coming second in the convention, though substantially behind Governor Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 Democratic presidential {{primaries}} {{were the}} selection {{processes by which}} voters of the Democratic Party chose its nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois {{was selected as the}} nominee, becoming the first African-American to secure the presidential nomination of any major political party in the United States. However, due to a close race between Obama and Senator Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> New York, the contest remained competitive for longer than expected, and neither candidate received enough pledged delegates from state primaries and caucuses to achieve a majority, without endorsements from unpledged delegates (superdelegates).|$|E
25|$|Harkin ran for President in 1992 as {{a populist}} with labor union support. He criticized George H. W. Bush for {{being out of}} touch with working-class Americans.

Harkin won the Iowa caucus and those in Idaho and Minnesota (with help from Senator Paul Wellstone), but he ran poorly in New Hampshire and other primaries and ultimately lost the Democratic Party nomination to Governor Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>of</b> Arkansas. Harkin was the first Democratic primary contender to drop out and throw his support behind Clinton — a favor that led to a close relationship throughout the Clinton presidency.|$|E
