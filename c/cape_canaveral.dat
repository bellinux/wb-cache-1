5|$|August 6, 1970– A {{tropical}} depression moves ashore near <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral,</b> though its effects, if any, are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{dismantled}} Launch Pad 34 at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> Air Force Station bears two memorial plaques.|$|E
5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Before its release, The Day the Earth Stood Still was {{nominated}} for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound at the 2008 Satellite Awards. On the film's December 12, 2008 release, the Deep Space Communications Network at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> was to transmit the film to Alpha Centauri.|$|E
5|$|October 2, 1969– Tropical Storm Jenny makes {{landfall}} near Fort Myers, {{crosses the}} state, and approaches the Atlantic Ocean near <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> {{before turning to}} the west-southwest and exiting into the Gulf of Mexico near Tampa. The storm produces heavy rainfall of 5—8inches (127–203mm) across the central region of the state.|$|E
5|$|October 7 - Hurricane Matthew moved north {{along the}} east coast, {{previously}} hitting Cuba and Haiti, it moved into Florida as a much weaker hurricane than before. Matthew never made landfall, as the eye barely missed <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b> Matthew killed twelve people in the state, and creates flooding, high winds, and knocks out power to 1.1 million people.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 2005, MRO was {{launched}} aboard an Atlas V-401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> Air Force Station. The Centaur upper {{stage of the}} rocket completed its burns over a fifty-six-minute period and placed MRO into an interplanetary transfer orbit towards Mars.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{remained}} aboard {{for three}} days of medical tests and debriefing before disembarking, while the spacecraft was offloaded at Midway Island and transferred to an aircraft for further transport. It was returned to <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> for analysis, with the long-term intention of putting it on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 1 probe was {{launched}} on September 5, 1977, from Launch Complex 41 at the <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> Air Force Station, aboard a Titan IIIE launch vehicle. The Voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier, on August 20, 1977. Despite being launched later, Voyager 1 reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, following a shorter trajectory.|$|E
5|$|The probe was {{originally}} scheduled for launch on December 30, 2004, but NASA officials delayed its launch, {{in order to}} allow more time for testing the software. It was successfully launched from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> on January 12, 2005 at 1:47pm EST (1847 UTC) by a Delta 2 rocket.|$|E
5|$|The project {{included}} {{the building of}} a SAINT operation center within the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) complex in Colorado Springs, and the construction of launch facilities that could respond within 12 hours at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> and Vandenberg, along with stations in Florida and Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially Broccoli and Saltzman {{had wanted}} to produce the eighth Bond novel, 1961's Thunderball, as the first film, {{but there was an}} ongoing legal dispute between the screenplay's co-author, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming. As a result, Broccoli and Saltzman chose Dr. No: the timing was apposite, with claims that American rocket testing at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> had {{problems}} with rockets going astray.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are {{currently}} on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> Air Force Station.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} river flooding along the St. Johns River, resulting in flooding along roads in Seminole County. Roadway, urban, and lowland flooding was also reported in Brevard and Orange counties. Roadway flooding was extensive in some areas, resulting in road closures in Oviedo, Cocoa Beach, and <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b> Heavy rainfall in Pinellas Park caused heavy street flooding along an intersection on U.S. Highway 19. No casualties were reported, and damage was minor.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{says that}} he's {{the only one}} in the office who watches the {{television}} series, Burn Notice. Dwight says after finishing work on the special project in Florida, they will be able to go visit <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> and go sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan. While attempting to convince his group not to go to Florida, pictures of Casey Anthony, Katherine Harris, Brooke Hogan and Tony Montana are used.|$|E
5|$|At <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral,</b> {{the space}} shuttle Discovery was {{considered}} to be safe on its launching pad after concerns of unfavorable weather, and NASA rescheduled a liftoff the following week; however, shuttle managers eventually decided to begin moving Discovery from the launching pad to ride out the storm. In Miami, the Booker T. Washington Senior High School opened as a voluntary evacuation shelter for all pre-registered special needs residents. Also, the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa evacuated its aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base near Wichita.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{visits the}} island, where he meets a local shell diver, Honey Ryder. The three are {{attacked}} by No's men, who kill Quarrel using a flame-throwing armoured tractor; Bond and Honey are taken prisoner. Dr. No informs them he {{is a member}} of SPECTRE, the SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion, and he plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> with his atomic-powered radio beam. Bond and Honey escape from the island, killing No and blowing up his lair in the process.|$|E
5|$|Chaffee {{was given}} a variety of assignments, and participated in {{numerous}} training duties {{over the next few}} years, spending {{most of his time in}} photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral,</b> during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the final, Hamm {{collapsed in the}} locker room from severe hydration. She was treated by medical staff with an intravenous drip and three liters of fluids. After 12 hours of sleep, she joined the team for magazine cover shoots, went to Disneyland for a celebration rally, and made numerous television appearances. A week later, the team met President Clinton at the White House and flew with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton on Air Force One to <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b> Her leadership and performance at the 1999 World Cup cemented Hamm as a soccer icon.|$|E
5|$|Lunney worked backup on Gemini 3, {{taking charge}} of the newly {{established}} Mission Control Center in Houston, {{at a time when}} flights were still controlled from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> in Florida. On Gemini 4, he again was working backup, this time in Florida, supporting the first mission that was controlled entirely from Houston. After spending some time on unmanned testing for the Apollo program, he returned to work as a flight director on Gemini 9, 10, 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b> He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as a warning to others, and then shot. Because No's heart was {{on the right side of}} his body, the bullet missed it and he survived.|$|E
5|$|On June15, a {{tropical}} wave with associated instability {{was observed in}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June16, {{and the next day}} developed a weak circulation {{at the same time that}} Tropical Storm Beulah was on the other side of the gulf. The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast, becoming {{a tropical}} depression by June 18 at 0000 UTC. Moving quickly to the northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2015 film Tomorrowland {{has several}} scenes {{featuring}} Greyhound, including a character {{traveling to the}} 1964 New York World's Fair on a historic bus (a 1969 GMC), a Greyhound Glide-a-Ride trackless train on the World's Fair midway, and the main character traveling on a Greyhound bus in 2015 (a MCI 102DL3) from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral,</b> Florida to Houston, Texas. Greyhound also sponsored a sweepstakes tied in with the film, wrapped several Greyhound buses with imagery from the film, placed promotional items inside terminals, and sponsored the film's Los Angeles premier.|$|E
5|$|The University of Central Florida fosters {{research}} amongst its thirteen academic {{colleges and}} schools, partnerships with corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Siemens, and through partnerships with local community colleges. UCF also houses a satellite campus at the Kennedy Space Center in <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral,</b> Florida. UCF {{is also a}} member of the Florida High Tech Corridor Council. The university has made noted research contributions to optics, modeling and simulation, digital media, engineering and computer science, business administration, education, and hospitality management.|$|E
5|$|Under weak {{steering}} currents while detached to the front, Diana drifted westward, {{and came}} within 50miles (85km) of the Florida coast. Rather than continuing westward, {{where it would}} have hit near <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral,</b> Diana turned to the northwest where it paralleled the coastline. The storm, continually strengthening over the Gulf Stream, turned to the northeast and became a hurricane on September 10. On September11 and September12, Diana rapidly intensified to a peak of 130mph (215km/h) winds while remaining offshore.|$|E
5|$|Upon waking, {{they are}} escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese/German {{criminal}} scientist who, due to radiation exposure, has metal hands. He reveals {{that he is}} a former member of a Chinese crime Tong, from whom he stole ten million dollars. He also reveals that he is working for a secret organisation called SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion). He plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> with his radio beam. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|It {{became clear}} that {{managing}} the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth's Space Task Group, which had been directing the nation's manned space program from NASA's Langley Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC). A site was chosen in Houston, Texas, on land donated by Rice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961. It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida, so a new Mission Control Center would {{be included in the}} MSC.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, while {{orbiting}} the Earth during a routine space mission with his crew, Colonel John Jameson and his ship are {{hit by a}} meteor shower. John struggles to get the ship back safely on Earth but eventually succeeds in landing it at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b> The next day, Jonah learns that the Globes cover story on the Goblin's rampage—featuring Peter's photos—is outselling the Bugles story on John's heroic space journey. An infuriated Jameson decides {{to meet with the}} public's demand by publishing a new cover story questioning if Spider-Man is a hero or a menace. Meanwhile, John is interviewed at the shuttle hangar when he spots a mysterious, vibrating black goo {{on the bottom of the}} shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} from Savannah, Georgia to Fort Pierce, Florida {{subsequent to the}} discovery of the hurricane. The National Weather Bureau advised all small craft to remain at port and recommended residents in the northern Bahamas to take immediate precautions. On Grand Bahama, the threat of Hurricane Able resulted in a construction crew to evacuate further inland; the crew was constructing an observation post for guiding long-range missiles from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b> Fishermen on dozens of boats left the open ocean for safety on two Bahamian islands, while two airplanes safely rode out the hurricane. Small craft warnings and storm warnings were later issued from North Carolina through New England.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini spacecraft, {{which was}} built by McDonnell Aircraft, {{was derived from the}} earlier Mercury spacecraft, but {{modified}} to accommodate two astronauts. It was also equipped with a larger equipment module, allowing it to support longer missions, and maneuver in orbit. It was launched by the Titan II rocket flying from Launch Complex 19 at the <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> Air Force Station. In total, twelve missions were launched, ten of which were manned. Following two unmanned test flights, the first manned flight, Gemini 3, was launched on 23 March 1965. The program concluded on 15 November 1966, with the successful recovery of Gemini 12.|$|E
5|$|The {{nations of}} the world fund the {{construction}} of the machine at <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral.</b> An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.|$|E
5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, {{it was too}} small to test Zeus at its maximum range. Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could fly out over the Pacific. Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral,</b> but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic Test Range, to the northeast of Canaveral, had a high population density and little land available for building accurate downrange tracking stations, Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|E
5|$|The non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas dropped locally heavy {{rainfall}} across the Bahamas and southern Florida, {{as well as}} in portions of the northern Gulf Coast. Gusty winds from the low produced heavy surf and rip currents along the east and west coast of Florida, and a wind gust of 35mph (55km/h) was recorded in <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral</b> as a rainband from the system moved ashore. The low also resulted in two to four foot (0.6 to 1.2m) swells along the East Coast of the United States. Overall, no damage or deaths were associated with Nicholas or the low that absorbed it.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between <b>Cape</b> <b>Canaveral,</b> Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States.|$|E
