5000|$|On 29 September 1941 the Acting Chief of Naval Operations, Rear Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, sent a {{memorandum}} to the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, listing {{a number of}} Army transports, including Thomas H. Barry, that were to be [...] "eventually {{taken over by the}} Navy". Prewar plans had called for the transfer; however, the Army retained the right to obtain additional shipping if required. Delays in Navy manning and conversion and the demands of actual wartime conditions made the mass transfer unfeasable with the Navy concentrating on ships for combat loading, the [...] "attack" [...] transports and Army concentrating on <b>convoy</b> <b>loading.</b> Thomas H. Barry was later given the Navy designation AP-45, but was never taken over by the Navy and remained under Army control through the end of World War II.|$|E
50|$|Combat loading is {{a special}} type of unit loading of ships so that {{embarked}} forces will have immediately needed weapons, ammunition and supplies stowed {{in such a way}} that unloading of equipment will be concurrent with the force personnel and available for immediate combat during an amphibious landing. It gives primary consideration to the ease and sequence with which troops, equipment, and supplies can be unloaded ready for combat, rather than to the efficient use of cargo space as in <b>convoy</b> <b>loading</b> where forces and equipment would be joined in rear or secure areas. The art and science of combat loading were developed in World War II, and contributed greatly to the success of Allied amphibious campaigns. While combat loading usually took place in forward bases, the Western Task Force for the landings in North Africa was combat loaded at the Army's Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation which was called on again for the Sicily force.|$|E
25|$|In November, a <b>convoy</b> <b>loaded</b> {{with heavy}} {{weaponry}} was intercepted {{when trying to}} cross from Libya into neighboring Niger, according to Nigerien security officials.

Goff spent the first 7 months of 1944 with Albemarle, shepherding the tender safely to San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago, Casablanca, Recife, Brazil, and Avonmouth, England, before putting in at Boston, Massachusetts on 13 July 1944 for overhaul.|$|R
50|$|Kanawha {{departed}} San Pedro 21 March 1942 with a <b>convoy</b> <b>loaded</b> with {{supplies for}} Hawaii. She continued convoy runs from California to Pearl Harbor until 18 May {{when she arrived}} Tongatapu for fueling operations in the South Pacific. Throughout the summer she cruised to New Caledonia, Espiritu Santo, and Efate, providing fuel for destroyers and transports {{en route to the}} Pacific campaigns. The oiler departed Pago Pago 12 October and put into San Francisco 29 October for repairs and overhaul.|$|R
5000|$|Torrential {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} southern Taiwan as Typhoon Parma stalled {{south of the}} island. In some areas, more than 500 mm of rain fell, resulting in floods up to [...]5 m deep. These floods prompted emergency evacuations in hundreds of villages throughout Taiwan. After 200 mm of rain fell in Yilan County, emergency officials enacted the first mandatory evacuation in northern Taiwan, relocating hundreds of residents. Several landslides were reported in mountainous regions, mainly in southern parts of the island. Military <b>convoys</b> <b>loaded</b> with sandbags traveled to rising rivers to help reinforce them and prevent them from overflowing their banks. As {{a result of the}} continuous rainfall and cloud cover, temperatures across Taiwan fell below average.|$|R
50|$|Kashii {{departed}} {{again on}} 13 July 1944 from Moji, escorting <b>convoy</b> HI-69 <b>loaded</b> with aircraft for Luzon in the Philippines. The convoy arrived safely in Manila, and after offloading aircraft, proceeded to Singapore, returning to Moji without incident on 15 August 1944.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 June 1940, Espero, Ostro and Zeffiro were in <b>convoy,</b> heavily <b>loaded</b> {{down with}} cargo, {{when they were}} intercepted by a British task force of five ships.

He returns to the Akhram of the Todalpheme, the monks calculating the tides of Kregen and learns that a <b>convoy</b> <b>loaded</b> with flying boats for the Grodnim is scheduled to pass the Dam of Days just before a storm will hit and the dam will be closed. Unwilling to let the Grodnim {{have the advantage of}} flying boats, usually unseen at the Eye of the World, Prescot resolves to destroy this convoy but not after arguing with himself as to whether he should get involved or not.|$|R
50|$|After 18 {{months in}} New Guinea the 348th boarded ship and plane for the Philippines. One squadron, the 460th, arrived {{several weeks before}} the other three, and {{proceeded}} to roll up an imposing score of enemy planes, shipping, and personnel destroyed, providing cover for convoys, flying patrols, escorted bombers, attacked enemy airfields, and supporting ground forces. During a three-week period it sank 50,000 tons of enemy shipping, which was slightly more than one-tenth of all the shipping sunk by the entire Fifth Air Force during the year 1944. On 10 November the 460th squadron deployed forward to Tacloban Airfield on Leyte, simultaneously escorting a group of B-25 bombers attacking a <b>convoy</b> <b>loaded</b> with an estimated 10,000 enemy troops en route to reinforce the Japanese army on Leyte. The squadron's planes were {{the first of the}} Army Air Force to fly over occupied Manila after the Japanese capture of the Philippines. A flight led by Colonel Dunham, made the first return flight on 17 November 1944.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 21 March 2003, when Operation IRAQI FREEDOM began, the Defended Asset List {{experienced}} {{a variety of}} changes and forced 3d LAAD Bn Marines to plan dynamically. When the ground invasion began early {{on the morning of}} 21 March, 3d LAAD Bn Marines provided air defense for Marine Wing Support Squadron 271 (MWSS-271), MWSS-371, MWSS-372, MWSS-373, and served as a gap filler for a battalion from the Army’s 108th Air Defense Artillery Brigade. The mission was to defend logistics <b>convoys</b> <b>loaded</b> with aviation fuel and ordnance that would be staged at FARPS along I MEF’s path into Northern Iraq. These FARPs enabled helicopters to provide the Ground Combat Element with more timely close air support. As Saddam’s Fadayeen put up a fight in places like An Nasiriyah, Qalat Sikar, and Al Kut, fuel and ordnance assumed critical importance and Marines from the battalion often found themselves {{in the midst of the}} fighting.|$|R
5|$|After {{undergoing}} a refit {{in the early}} months of the war, Provence conducted anti-raider patrols with Force Y, based in Casablanca. Bretagne was also overhauled early in the war; in March 1940 she escorted a convoy to Halifax and returned with another <b>convoy</b> <b>loaded</b> with aircraft for the French Air Force. She was then ordered to join Lorraine in Force X, to be based in Alexandria to operate in concert with the British Mediterranean Fleet. Two weeks later, Bretagne was instead ordered to steam at high speed to Bizerte, to join the Force de Raid with Provence. The ships put in at Mers-el-Kébir and remained there until after the fall of France in June 1940. To prevent the ships of the French Navy from falling {{into the hands of the}} occupying Germans, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the neutralization of all French warships. Force H was to deliver an ultimatum to the ships based at Mers-el-Kébir; on 3 July, the British squadron arrived outside the harbor and demanded that the ships sail with them to Britain or they would be sunk.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{in order}} to be in the {{territory}} that is presently the state inhabited by Chichimecas, the so-called Guachichiles, that the conquistadors built several forts or presidios. This was a system devised by Martín Enríquez de Almanza following the strategy that had been developing in Spain throughout the Reconquista period. Therefore, {{in order to protect the}} Camino de la Plata, which stretched between Zacatecas and Mexico City, three presidios [...] founded by the Indian fighter Juan Dominguez, were to be created, which were: the presidio at Las Bocas, later called Las Bocas de Gallardo, situated on the border of Aguascalientes, in what was the jurisdiction of the mayor of Teocaltiche, presently the border of Aguascalientes and Zacatecas; the presidio at Palmillas, which was located near what is now Tepezalá; and the Ciénega Grande presidio, established around 1570. The latter was located on what are now Moctezuma and Victoria Streets, although some historians place it on the Calle 5 de Mayo (once the Camino Real) at Moctezuma, just in front of the Plaza de Armas. This was a fortress whose purpose was the protection of the Valle de los Romero and the road to Zacatecas, entering this way to secure the passage of <b>convoys</b> <b>loaded</b> with silver and other metals.|$|R

A socialist minister asked for authorization to proceed freely; the Government, which was formed by another five socialists, including he who presided it, conceded to such a request, and the bank agents that handed over as much as they were asked were also socialists, in Spain as in Russia, as well as the countrymen that <b>convoyed</b> the <b>load</b> between Madrid and Cartagena.

50|$|On 5 May 1631 Basque Spanish Admiral Oquendo left Lisbon with a {{fleet of}} about 20 men-of-war. He carried {{reinforcements}} to Paraíba, Pernambuco and Bahia. On {{his way back to}} Portugal, he was to <b>convoy</b> ships <b>loaded</b> with sugar. So as to allow the Dutch extra time to get ready, he headed first for Bahia. Once the Dutch learned of his coming, their fleet in Pernambuco, led by admiral Adrian Pater, sailed to intercept the Spanish convoy. Despite Pater had 33 ships at Pernambuco, he left 17 in port as he considered only 8 of Oquendo’s to be battleworthy. Finally, on September 12, the two fleets met around the cays.|$|R
50|$|Contessa {{arrived at}} Norfolk as the convoy was {{preparing}} to sail. She was in a leaking condition with engine problems that required immediate dry docking that was expected to take several days. By extraordinary effort the ship was repaired early, {{but in the meantime}} much of the crew had left town in expectation of a longer stay. Three days late, with a crew filled out from seaman volunteers from a local Naval brig released from minor offenses, the ship got underway {{in the early hours of}} 27 October in an unescorted dash across the Atlantic to join the <b>convoy.</b> Contessa, <b>loaded</b> with only 738 tons of gasoline and bombs, overtook the convoy on 7 November.|$|R
5000|$|Convoy Hi-71 (...) {{was one of}} the World War II Hi convoys of fast tankers and troop {{transports}} from Japan to Singapore. The heavily defended <b>convoy</b> was specially <b>loaded</b> with reinforcements {{for defense}} of the Philippines, and encountered a wolfpack of United States Navy submarines in the South China Sea after being scattered by an August 1944 typhoon. Personnel losses were high because heavy seas prevented rescue of crewmen from sunken ships.|$|R
500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 29 November, U-43 fired two torpedoes at the 5,569 ton British {{merchant}} ship Thornliebank, part of <b>Convoy</b> OS-12, and <b>loaded</b> with general cargo and munitions, about [...] north-north-west of the Azores.

50|$|RONA units {{withdrew from}} Ochota between 22-25 August 1944, but the looting of {{property}} in the district continued {{until the beginning of}} October. The German occupational administration organised a systematic campaign of pillaging; booty was loaded into goods trains in the Warszawa Zachodnia railway station and sent to Germany. Additionally, <b>convoys</b> of trucks <b>loaded</b> with stolen property were sent to Piotrków Trybunalski. In the end, units of the Vernichtungskommando systematically set street after street on fire, thus effecting the final destruction of the district.|$|R

50|$|In the 24 hours {{following}} the Pearl Harbor bombing, 125 separate truck <b>convoys</b> were <b>loaded</b> and dispatched from the Benicia Arsenal, leaving its stock of ammunition, small arms, and high explosives completely exhausted. Throughout the war, the arsenal supplied ports with weapons, artillery, parts, supplies, and tools. In addition, the arsenal overhauled 14,343 pairs of binoculars, manufactured 180,000 small items for tanks and weapons, and repaired approximately 70,000 watches. However, the arsenal is most famous for supplying munitions to Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle {{for the first}} bombing raid on Tokyo on April 18, 1942, launched from the USS Hornet.Prior to 1940, the arsenal employed 85 civilian employees; by October 1942, the payroll had reached 4,545. The labor shortage in 1944 forced the arsenal commander to put 250 Italian and 400 German prisoners of war to work, alongside 150 juveniles from the California Youth Authority. Women comprised nearly half the civilian employee force. During the Korean War, the number of civilians reached an all-time high of 6,700 workers.|$|R
500|$|The U.S. {{lost only}} seven aircrew {{members in the}} battle. However, the Japanese lost 61 veteran aircrew, who were hard for the Japanese to replace because of an {{institutionalized}} limited capacity in their naval aircrew training programs and an absence of trained reserves. The troops in Tanaka's <b>convoy</b> were later <b>loaded</b> onto destroyers at the Shortland Islands and delivered piecemeal, without most of their heavy equipment, to Guadalcanal beginning on August 29, 1942.

By July 1953, 15 doctors were working in rotation benevolently {{in the first two}} care centres, which were opened 7 days a week to provide treatment to 600 patients daily. In the same year, the VRC managed to organize nine convoys, seven by road and two by air, offering help to 50,000 people across South Vietnam. Each road convoy carried around 100 VRC personnel, including 45 nurses and 30 rescuers; the air <b>convoys</b> were less <b>loaded</b> and were made possible with the help of Mr Phạm Hòe, managing director of COSARA, the first privately owned Vietnamese airline.|$|R

She {{then proceeded to}} Antwerp, Belgium, where she discharged her cargo. Departing on 19 May, she arrived at Le Havre, France, on 22 May. There she embarked 31 U.S. Army officers and 321 U.S. Army enlisted men, some of them liberated prisoners-of-war, and departed on 24 May. She paused in The Solent for two days, then got back underway on 27 May in convoy for the United States, the convoy burning its running lights at night {{for the first time}} since the beginning of the war.

50|$|Later, Haggart sinks {{an entire}} <b>convoy</b> of gunships <b>loaded</b> {{with a fresh}} batch of drugs. Soon enough, Macias is tracked down to a small Colombian village called San Lucas. He tries to hide among the {{civilian}} population from the American and Colombian authorities. Haggart destroys several key targets and convoys {{to pave the way}} for an American search for Macias in the village. Unfortunately, Colonel Garo, one of Macias' top commanders, attacks San Lucas with two armored convoys. In the midst of this attack, Garo declares the Colombian President a traitor for collaborating with American forces. Garo gets dangerously close to taking San Lucas, but fortunately, Haggart destroys both tank columns, and Colonel Garo is subsequently killed. Much to the Army's dismay, however, Macias flees the village during the battle. Finally, a few days after the botched siege of San Lucas, U.S. Intelligence finds out that Macias is trying to escape Colombia with the last of his drug convoys.|$|R

German historian Dieter Pohl in The Shoah in Ukraine writes that the auxiliary police was active during killing operations by the Germans already in the first phases of the German occupation. The auxiliary police registered the Jews, conducted raids and guarded ghettos, <b>loaded</b> <b>convoys</b> to execution sites and cordoned them off.
