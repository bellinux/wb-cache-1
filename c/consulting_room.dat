25|$|Because Erickson {{expected}} trance {{states to}} occur naturally and frequently, {{he was prepared}} to exploit them therapeutically, even when the patient was not present with him in the <b>consulting</b> <b>room.</b> He also discovered many techniques for increasing the likelihood that a trance state would occur. He developed both verbal and non-verbal techniques and pioneered the idea that the common experiences of wonderment, engrossment and confusion are, in fact, just kinds of trance.|$|E
25|$|After visiting Venice and Milan, {{he spent}} {{a few days in}} Paris observing Edmund Landolt, an expert on {{diseases}} of the eye. Within three months of his departure for Vienna, Doyle returned to London. He opened a small office and <b>consulting</b> <b>room</b> at 2 Upper Wimpole Street, or 2 Devonshire Place as it was then. A Westminster City Council commemorative plaque is over the front door. He had no patients according to his autobiography and his efforts as an ophthalmologist were a failure.|$|E
25|$|Schweitzer's wife, Helene Schweitzer, was an {{anaesthetist}} for surgical operations. After briefly {{occupying a}} shed formerly {{used as a}} chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (<b>consulting</b> <b>room</b> and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were built, like native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking Galoa (Mpongwe) who first came as a patient.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notorious}} {{criminal}} {{of the period}} (aside from the Nazis and their collaborators) was Doctor Marcel Petiot. Petiot purchased a house at 21 rue Le Sueur in the 16th arrondissement, and {{under the name of}} Docteur Eugène, pretended to be the head of a Resistance network that smuggled Jews from France to Argentina. He collected a large advance from his clients and then instructed them to come to his house, bringing their gold, silver and other valuables with them. After they arrived, he brought them to his <b>consulting</b> <b>room,</b> and, convincing them vaccination was required in order to enter Argentina, gave them a lethal intravenous injection, then watched their slow death in an adjacent room through a spyhole in the door. Afterwards, he cut up their bodies, put the pieces in the well, and dissolved them with quicklime. His activities attracted the attention of the Gestapo, which arrested him in 1943, thus allowing him to claim later that he had been a real member of the Resistance. His crimes were discovered after the Liberation in 1944, and he was charged with the murders of twenty-seven persons, tried in 1946, and sentenced to death. He went to the guillotine on May 25, 1946. The gold, silver and other valuables were not found when he was arrested. In search of the treasure, the house was carefully demolished in 1966, but no trace of it was ever found.|$|E
500|$|Another {{frequently}} used technique is Hooper's tendency {{to use a}} variety of focal length camera lenses to distort the resulting picture. In The Damned United he used a 10mm lens, notably in the scene where Clough stays inside during the Derby–Leeds match. Hooper operated the camera in this scene himself. In The King's Speech, Hooper used [...] "typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm" [...] lenses and put the camera close to the actors' faces. Hooper said the use of this method in the first <b>consulting</b> <b>room</b> scene served to [...] "suggest the awkwardness and tension of Logue and Bertie's first meeting".|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{nuisance}} claims; in Nichols v Marsland, for example, [...] "Act of God" [...] {{was accepted as}} a defence. One defence is that of [...] "20 years prescription", which is valid for private nuisance but not public. If a private nuisance continues for 20 years, it becomes legal by prescription, assuming the defendant can show {{that it has been}} continuous and the claimant has been aware of it. A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance, not from when the activity started. In Sturges v Bridgman, the claimant, a doctor, lived next to a [...] "confectionery business". Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance, and the doctor only complained after building a <b>consulting</b> <b>room</b> in his garden. It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the <b>consulting</b> <b>room</b> was built and the activity began to affect the doctor, not when the activity started. A second defence is statutory authority, when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation; this applies to both public and private nuisance. This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute, but intra vires. In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd, the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament. The Act gave no express authority to operate it, and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through the smell and noise. The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery, saying [...] "Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery to be nothing more than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty". The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008, which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development.|$|E

500|$|Catherine {{established}} rituals such as baptism of infants, {{blessing of}} couples and communion of young people. They simply consist of an [...] "elevation of thought" [...] {{that take place}} after the services in a <b>consulting</b> <b>room</b> of the temple. These rituals have no particular meaning in the religion and are not considered sacraments; they are performed only {{at the request of}} followers, including young people, who want to provide a religious dimension to the important moments of their lives. Funerals are also performed {{at the request of the}} concerned person, unless the family asks for rituals of another religion. The procession always takes place at the cemetery or the funeral home, and the deceased person is never brought to the temple. Desservants read the [...] "Ten Principles of the Father", then an Antoinist text on reincarnation, to help the soul to come off the body to be reincarnated. Sociologists note that many people who never attend the Antoinist services asked for funeral rites of that religion.|$|E
500|$|Attention and {{concentration}} are {{assessed by the}} serial sevens test (or alternatively by spelling a five-letter word backwards), and by testing digit span. Memory is assessed in terms of immediate registration (repeating a set of words), short-term memory (recalling the set of words after an interval, or recalling a short paragraph), and long-term memory (recollection of well known historical or geographical facts). Visuospatial functioning can be assessed by the ability to copy a diagram, draw a clock face, or draw {{a map of the}} <b>consulting</b> <b>room.</b> Language is assessed through the ability to name objects, repeat phrases, and by observing the individual's spontaneous speech and response to instructions. Executive functioning can be screened for by asking the [...] "similarities" [...] questions ("what do x and y have in common?") and by means of a verbal fluency task (e.g. [...] "list as many words as you can starting with the letter F, in one minute"). The mini-mental state examination is a simple structured cognitive assessment which is in widespread use as a component of the MSE.|$|E

They often go to a patient's home when the patient cannot come to the <b>consulting</b> <b>room</b> (especially in case of children or old people), and have to contribute to a night and week-end duty (although this was contested in a strike in 2002).|$|E
2500|$|She was {{met with}} hostility and {{harassment}} from some medical students and professors because of her gender. [...] Because her attendance of classes with men {{in the presence of}} a naked body was deemed inappropriate, she was required to perform her dissections of cadavers alone, after hours. She resorted to smoking tobacco to mask the offensive odor of formaldehyde. [...] Montessori won an academic prize in her first year, and in 1895 secured a position as a hospital assistant, gaining early clinical experience. [...] In her last two years she studied pediatrics and psychiatry, and worked in the pediatric <b>consulting</b> <b>room</b> and emergency service, becoming an expert in pediatric medicine. Montessori graduated from the University of Rome in 1896 as a doctor of medicine. Her thesis was published in 1897 in the journal Policlinico.
