25|$|The {{reason why}} {{interleaving}} {{is used on}} OFDM is to attempt to spread the errors out in the bit-stream that is presented to the error correction decoder, because when such decoders are presented with {{a high concentration of}} errors the decoder is unable to correct all the bit errors, and a burst of uncorrected errors occurs. A similar design of audio data encoding makes <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> (<b>CD)</b> playback robust.|$|E

25|$|The compact {{cassette}} {{technology was}} originally designed for dictation machines, but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the Stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications. Its uses ranged from portable audio to home recording to data storage for early microcomputers. The first cassette player (although mono) {{designed for use}} in car dashes was introduced in 1968. Between the early 1970s and the early 2000s, the cassette {{was one of the}} two most common formats for prerecorded music, first alongside the LP record and later the <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> (<b>CD).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Compact</b> <b>disc</b> (<b>CD)</b> is {{a digital}} optical disc data storage format {{released}} in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for {{storage of data}} (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. The first commercially available Audio CD player, the Sony CDP-101, was released October 1982 in Japan.|$|E

25|$|Compression {{efficiency}} of encoders is typically {{defined by the}} bit rate, because compression ratio depends on the bit depth and sampling rate of the input signal. Nevertheless, compression ratios are often published. They may use the <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> (<b>CD)</b> parameters as references (44.1 kHz, 2 channels at 16 bits per channel or 2×16 bit), or sometimes the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) SP parameters (48kHz, 2×16 bit).

A Collection: Greatest Hits...and More was released as a <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> (<b>CD)</b> in the United States on October 3, 1989 by Columbia Records.

2500|$|Between 1985 and 1992, the {{cassette}} tape {{was the most}} popular format in the UK and wealthy record labels experimented with innovative packaging designs.

[...] The introduction of {{the cassette}} single, called a [...] "cassingle", was also part of this era and featured a music single in Compact Cassette form. Until 2005, cassettes remained the dominant medium for purchasing and listening to music in some developing countries, but <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> (<b>CD)</b> technology had superseded the Compact Cassette {{in the vast majority of}} music markets throughout the world by this time.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the advent}} of the <b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> (<b>CD),</b> music is encoded to a digital format with a clearly defined maximum peak {{amplitude}}. Once the maximum amplitude of a CD is reached, loudness can be increased still further through signal processing techniques such as dynamic range compression and equalization. Engineers can apply an increasingly high ratio of compression to a recording until it more frequently peaks at the maximum amplitude. In extreme cases, efforts to increase loudness can result in clipping and other audible distortion. Modern recordings that use extreme dynamic range compression and other measures to increase loudness therefore can sacrifice sound quality to loudness. The competitive escalation of loudness has led music fans and members of the musical press to refer to the affected albums as [...] "victims of the loudness war." ...|$|E
