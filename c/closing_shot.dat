5|$|The second unit filmed {{part of the}} prologue's 1912 segment from August 29 to September 3. The {{main unit}} began two days later with the circus train {{sequence}} at Alamosa, Colorado, on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7, and then at Cortez on September 10. From September 14 to16, filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah's Arches National Park to shoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado {{was used for the}} Jones family home. The production had intended to film at Mesa Verde National Park, but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use. When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed a rough cut of the film in late 1988, they felt it suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot during post-production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch. The <b>closing</b> <b>shot</b> of Indiana, Henry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Texas in early 1989.|$|E

500|$|As {{the town}} begins to rebuild {{following}} the Mecha-Streisand attack ("for the 39th time", according to Mayor McDaniels), Stan, Kyle, and Kenny find Cartman cryingâ€“ {{not because he}} learned that he murdered his father, but because he is [...] "half-ginger". Mitch Conner reminds Cartman that he is [...] "half-Bronco" [...] as well and tells him that makes him [...] "pretty cool" [...] and departs. The boys find Cruise crying for a place in which he can live without fear of mockery. Stan, Kenny and Kyle promise to help Cruise get to such a place. The episode's <b>closing</b> <b>shot</b> is of Cruise's corpse lying on the Moon's surface alongside the corpse of the orca featured in [...] "Free Willzyx".|$|E

5000|$|In {{the opening}} {{sequence}} of Seven Samurai in the peasant village, the axial cut is used twice. When the villagers are outdoors, {{gathered in a}} circle, weeping and lamenting the imminent arrival of the bandits, they are glimpsed from above in extreme long shot, then, after the cut, in a much <b>closer</b> <b>shot,</b> then in an even <b>closer</b> <b>shot</b> at ground level as the dialogue begins. A few minutes later, when the villagers go to the mill to ask the village elder's advice, {{there is a long}} shot of the mill, with a slowly turning wheel in the river, then a <b>closer</b> <b>shot</b> of this wheel, and then a still <b>closer</b> <b>shot</b> of it. (As the mill is where the elder lives, these shots forge a mental association in the viewer's mind between that character and the mill.) ...|$|R

500|$|Luke {{challenges}} God {{during the}} rainstorm on the road, {{telling him to}} do anything to him. Later, while he is digging and filling trenches and confronted by the guards, an inmate performs the spiritual [...] "No Grave Gonna Keep my Body Down." [...] Toward the end of the film, Luke speaks to God, evoking the conversation between God and Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane, depicted in the Gospel of Luke. Following Luke's talk, the film depicts Dragline as a Judas, who delivers Luke to the authorities, trying to convince him to surrender. In the final scene, Dragline eulogizes Luke. He explains that despite Luke's death, his actions succeeded in defeating the system. The <b>closing</b> <b>shot</b> shows inmates working on crossroads with the repaired photo of Luke and the two women superimposed.|$|E
500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the <b>closing</b> <b>shot,</b> the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly positive. Many reviews praised the Moby Dick conversation between Mulder and Scully. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club was positive towards the episode, grading it an A-. He wrote that it [...] "starts off amazingly" [...] and positively noted {{the way the}} monster was handled. However, he noted {{that it was the}} [...] "linger" [...] conversation scene that [...] "sets 'Quagmire' apart from all the other standard Monster Of The Week procedurals." [...] John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode was a strong look into the psychological issues that Mulder and Scully are carrying around this season. The plot of the episode {{is little more than a}} tool chosen to pry into the minds of the two agents, revealing just how dependent they are on each other. A rare case of character development taking center stage." [...] Keegan also wrote positively of the conversation sequence, writing that the [...] "isolation caused by the sinking of the boat [...] forces Mulder and Scully to actually discuss their issues." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called [...] "Quagmire" [...] a [...] "delightful little gem" [...] and [...] "something rather magical". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Anderson and Duchovny's acting, calling their performances [...] "beautifully played". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She referred to the episode as [...] "part Jaws, part The Lost World, and part Buster Keaton" [...] and noted that the third act was when the episode [...] "becomes truly special, when Mulder and Scully are forced to abandon ship and take refuge on a big rock in the middle of a pitch-black night." [...] Vitaris, however, was critical of the episode's <b>closing</b> <b>shot,</b> noting that the [...] "shot destroys the story's ambiguity. A large ripple in the water would have been much more clever." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the second}} day, Kirsty had {{difficulty}} with their brand's label, {{as the name}} [...] couldn't {{be seen on the}} bottle during their advert, meaning she had to squeeze the bottle for it to be visible in the <b>closing</b> <b>shot.</b> Meanwhile, {{the rest of the team}} failed to have the label's design with them for the artists doing their presentation site's graffiti wall, meaning they had to leave a basic design for them on note sheet as a result.|$|E

50|$|Cinematography of {{the film}} is quite brilliantly done with distant and <b>close</b> <b>shots</b> of rural areas and greenery. Moreover, in the story a subtle {{distinction}} of village and city are drawn which is validated by cinematography too.|$|R
