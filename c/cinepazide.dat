50|$|<b>Cinepazide</b> or <b>cinepazide</b> maleate (Kelinao or Anjieli in China) is a {{vasodilator}} used in China for {{the treatment}} of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and peripheral vascular diseases. It appears to work by potentiating A2 adenosine receptors.|$|E
50|$|Cinepazic acid is a cinnamoyl-piperazine. Its {{derivatives}} {{include the}} vasodilators <b>cinepazide</b> and cinepazet.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cinepazide</b> was {{discovered}} by scientists at Laboratoires Delalande (now part of Sanofi) in 1969 {{in an effort to}} explore useful substituted cinnamoyl-piperazine compounds. [...] The drug, {{in the form of a}} pill taken orally, was launched by Delalande in 1976 under the tradename Vasodistal, for treatment of heart failure, balance disorders, cerebrovascular disease, and vascular complications of diabetes. In 1988 the drug was withdrawn from the market in Spain due to risk of agranulocytosis; other countries where the drug was available added warnings to the label. It was withdrawn from the market in France in 1992. The drug had also been marketed in Japan by Daiichi under the brand name [...] "Brindel" [...] for dementia, but was withdrawn in 1999, following a review by the Japanese regulatory authorities of dementia drugs after a drug, calcium hopantenate, that had been considered the standard of care and against which <b>cinepazide</b> and other dementia drugs had been compared, had failed to demonstrate efficacy in a re-evaluation.|$|E
40|$|The {{curative}} {{effect of}} <b>cinepazide</b> maleate (320 mg/d) and nimodipine (30 mg/d) on the cerebral vasospasm caused by post-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage was compared. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) {{was used to}} examine the changes of hemodynamics of middle cerebral artery (MCA) before and after treatment. On the 3 rd day after treatment the blood flow velocity of MCA in both groups decreased obviously, and the difference between that in pre- and post-treatment was statistically significant (<b>cinepazide</b> maleate group t = 4. 364, P = 0. 000; nimodipine group t = 7. 486, P = 0. 000), but there was no statistically significant difference between 2 groups (P = 0. 124). On the 7 th day, the blood flow velocity of 2 groups continously declined (<b>cinepazide</b> maleate group t = 5. 793, P = 0. 000; nimodipine group t = 10. 364, P = 0. 000), but {{there was no significant difference}} between 2 groups (P = 0. 364). No statistically significant difference on total effective rate and adverse drug reaction rate was seen between 2 groups (P > 0. 05). It was suggested that <b>cinepazide</b> maleate can replace nimodipine in the treatment for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} effect of <b>cinepazide</b> {{combined}} with mecobalamine on nerve conduction velocity, vibration perception threshold and serum indexes in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Methods: 90 patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy treated in our hospital between March 2013 and March 2016 were selected and divided into observation group and control group (n= 45) according to random number table, control group received mecobalamine treatment alone and observation group accepted the <b>cinepazide</b> combined with mecobalamine therapy. Differences in nerve conduction velocity, vibration perception threshold as well as serum oxidative stress indexes and nerve injury marker molecules were compared between two groups of patients 2 weeks after treatment. Results: 2 weeks after treatment, median nerve, ulnar nerve and peroneal nerve sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) levels of observation group were {{higher than those of}} control group (P< 0. 05) while both lower extremities vibration perception threshold (VPT) levels were lower than those of control group (P< 0. 05). Serum homocysteine (HCY), advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), malondialdehyde (MDA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), high mobility group B 1 (HMGB 1) and S 100 Î² content of observation group were lower than those of control group (P< 0. 05) while reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), myelin basic protein (MBP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) content were higher than those of control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: <b>Cinepazide</b> combined with mecobalamine can reduce the nerve injury degree, improve nerve conduction and vibration perception and alleviate the oxidative stress degree in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy...|$|E
