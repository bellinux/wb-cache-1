40|$|INTRODUCTION: Poor {{storage of}} {{medicines}} can reduce their efficacy, yet {{little is known}} about how people store medicines in their homes and elsewhere, why these locations are chosen, and whether the conditions are suitable for medicines storage. AIM: To investigate where medicines are commonly stored in New Zealand households, why, and the typical conditions-temperature and relative humidity-in those places of storage. METHODS: Data from a large qualitative study on the meanings of medicines were analysed to explore where people store medicines in their households, and why. A data logger was used to log temperature and relative humidity in common medicine storage places, such as homes and cars. RESULTS: Kitchens and bathrooms were the most commonly reported storage places, with people influenced by convenience, desire to remember to take medicines, and child safety when deciding where to store medicines. High temperatures and humidity were found in kitchens and bathrooms, extreme temperatures in a car and a backpack, and extremely low temperatures in <b>checked-in</b> <b>luggage</b> on a plane. DISCUSSION: Temperature- and humidity-sensitive medicines should not be stored long-term in common storage locations, such as kitchens and bathrooms. Conditions in these places may not comply with the recommended storage conditions given by the manufacturer. Furthermore, medicines should not be left in backpacks or cars, especially if the vehicle is in the sun. Medicines that may degrade upon freezing and thawing - such as protein-containing medicines, emulsions, suspensions and some solutions - should not be stored in the cargo hold of a plane...|$|E
40|$|Computed Tomography (CT) {{reconstruction}} is {{a fundamental}} component {{to a wide variety}} of applications ranging from security, to healthcare. The classical techniques require measuring projections, called sinograms, from a full 180 ^∘ view of the object. This is impractical in a limited angle scenario, when the viewing angle is less than 180 ^∘, which can occur due to different factors including restrictions on scanning time, limited flexibility of scanner rotation, etc. The sinograms obtained as a result, cause existing techniques to produce highly artifact-laden reconstructions. In this paper, we propose to address this problem through implicit sinogram completion, on a challenging real world dataset containing scans of common <b>checked-in</b> <b>luggage.</b> We propose a system, consisting of 1 D and 2 D convolutional neural networks, that operates on a limited angle sinogram to directly produce the best estimate of a reconstruction. Next, we use the x-ray transform on this reconstruction to obtain a "completed" sinogram, as if it came from a full 180 ^∘ measurement. We feed this to standard analytical and iterative reconstruction techniques to obtain the final reconstruction. We show with extensive experimentation that this combined strategy outperforms many competitive baselines. We also propose a measure of confidence for the reconstruction that enables a practitioner to gauge the reliability of a prediction made by our network. We show that this measure is a strong indicator of quality as measured by the PSNR, while not requiring ground truth at test time. Finally, using a segmentation experiment, we show that our reconstruction preserves the 3 D structure of objects effectively...|$|E
40|$|Airports are fast-growing dynamic {{infrastructure}} assets. For example, the Canadian airport {{industry is}} growing by 5 % annually and generates about $ 8 billion yearly. Since the 9 / 11 tragedy, airport security {{has been of}} paramount importance both in Canada and worldwide. Consequently, in 2002, {{in the wake of}} the attacks, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) put into force revised aviation security standards and recommended practices, and began a Universal Security Audit Program (USAP), in order to insure the worldwide safeguarding of civil aviation in general, and of airports in particular, against unlawful interference. To improve aviation security at both the national level and for individual airport, airport authorities in North America have initiated extensive programs to help quantify, detect, deter, and mitigate security risk. At the research level, a number of studies have examined scenarios involving threats to airports, the factors that contribute to airport vulnerability, and decision support systems for security management. However, more work is still required in the area of developing decision support tools that can assist airport officials in meeting the challenges associated with decision about upgrades; determining the status of their security systems and efficiently allocating financial resources to improve them to the level required. To help airport authorities make cost-effective decisions about airport security upgrades, this research has developed a risk-based optimization framework. The framework assists airport officials in quantitatively assessing the status of threats to their airports, the vulnerability to their security systems, and the consequences of security breaches. A key element of this framework is a new quantitative security metric; the aim of which is to assist airport authorities self-assess the condition of their security systems, and to produce security risk indices that decision makers can use as prioritizing criteria and constraints when meeting decisions about security upgrades. These indices have been utilized to formulate an automated decision support system for upgrading security systems in airports. Because they represent one of the most important security systems in an airport, the research focuses on passenger and cabin baggage screening systems. Based on an analysis of the related threats, vulnerabilities and consequences throughout the flow of passengers, cabin baggage, and <b>checked-in</b> <b>luggage,</b> the proposed framework incorporates an optimization model for determining the most cost-effective countermeasures that can minimize security risks. For this purpose, the framework first calculates the level of possible improvement in security using a new risk metric. Among the important features of the framework is the fact that it allows airport officials to perform multiple “what-if” scenarios, to consider the limitations of security upgrade budgets, and to incorporate airport-specific requirements. Based on the received positive feedback from two actual airports, the framework can be extended to include other facets of security in airports, and to form a comprehensive asset management system for upgrading security at both single and multiple airports. From a broader perspective, this research contributes to the improvement of security in a major transportation sector that has an enormous impact on economic growth and on the welfare of regional, national and international societies...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master's thesis that has been made in {{corporation}} between Swedavia AB and Luleå University of Technology. Background and ambition The airport is always in pursuit of smart solutions for automating work types which has work environmental problems and demands a lot of resources. The airport today has a well-developed automated baggage handling system which has limitations regarding dimensions and weight. Luggage that doesn’t fulfill these limitations are considered to be special luggage and needs to be handled separately. This procedure is handled manually by personnel when the luggage is dropped and when sorting. The evaluation of luggage is done subjective by personnel. This evaluation and handling of special luggage is time consuming and demands great number of personnel. The ambition of this master´s thesis is to develop a applicable solution for Terminal 5, Arlanda Airport. This will make the evaluation procedure more objective, less personnel demanding and decrease the number of special luggage. This will lead to a faster and more efficient check-in process. Method and implementation The master´s thesis was devided into six parts, pre-study, analysis, concept generation, detail study, evaluation and presentation. The pre-study was made with empirical and analytic methods on Arlanda airport, but above all on Terminal 5. Thereafter concepts were generated with creative methods. After this the concepts were improved according to different product developing methods. These concepts were evaluated with regards of demands and wishes. The result became elaborate concepts. During this assignment all collected information was documented and analyzed. Results The work has resulted in two groups, validation/luggage drop-off and modification of special luggage. Every concept is unique and aims to reduce queues, make the process more even, increase the speed of the process, reduce personnel, simplify usage for travellers and to reduce the amount of special luggage. The concepts for validation/luggage drop: Alldrop Travellers leaves checked-in normal luggage on a common use rolling hoop with integrated weight and dimension control. Travellers with special luggage use a separate check-in process and are from there directed to the accurate special luggage drop-off. Photo recognition/scanner <b>Checked-in</b> <b>luggage</b> is left for validation and weighting on a hoop which connects to the automated sorting system. The luggage type is validated with photo recognition or a scanner. If the luggage is validated as special it is directed to the accurate special luggage drop. Trusted bag In this concept a validation application is mounted inside the luggage which communicates with the sorting system. This leads to a direct approval or disapproval of the luggage when it is dropped. Special luggage is handled in a separate check-in process. Special luggage station Travellers with special luggage are directed to a nearby station for special luggage. The luggage tags are scanned for registration and will then be directed to the accurate special luggage drop. The concept for modification: Bag with elastic opening Special luggage that falls into the allowed frame of weight and dimensions in the automated sorting system can be modified with a bag containing an elastic opening. This will solve problems with straps and other loose hanging objects that may get stuck in the sorting system. Validerat; 20110222 (anonymous...|$|E
