If such a damaged thermocouple {{is used in the}} <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature.

For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Load {{resonant}} converter topologies {{are very}} popular {{and used to}} increase circuit switching speeds, allowing the cost of circuit magnetics to be reduced, while still keeping switching losses to a minimum. In this paper a new open <b>loop</b> and <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> method for 2. 1 kW Series Loaded Resonant DC-DC converter operated in above resonant mode is presented. A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is used to regulate the DC output voltage of converter in open <b>loop.</b> The <b>control</b> circuit used to regulate the output voltage of SLR converter is frequency modulation technique in which switching frequency of the converter is varied to regulate the output voltage. The <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> variable frequency <b>control</b> mainly consists of feedback loop and PI regulator with VCO. VCO is a voltage-to-frequency converter used to convert error in output voltage in change of frequency to control the voltage in <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> system.

Bidirectional power flow has been validated with power factor closest to unity. High efficiency of 96 % has been obtained owing to Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) in all MOSFETs.
