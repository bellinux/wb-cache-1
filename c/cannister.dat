60|$|The wild {{irregular}} enclosure {{was as much}} as ever {{an integral}} part of the old hill.

60|$|Mr. <b>Cannister</b> {{had been}} making unnoticeable motions of withdrawal, {{and by the time}} this {{farewell}} remark came from his lips he was just outside the door of the room.

60|$|The {{appearance}} of {{a slip of paper}} in <b>Cannister's</b> hand, and a few shillings lying {{on the table in front}} of him, denoted that the business had been transacted, and the tenor of their conversation went to show that a summary of village news was now engaging the attention of parishioner and parson.|$|R
60|$|They {{turned back}} again, and {{entering}} Endelstow a second time, {{came to a}} door which was standing open.

The name too was not that of the same landlord as formerly, but Martin <b>Cannister's.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{momentary}} anxiety he {{had felt}} with regard to his parents passed away. He had left them in perfect health, and had any serious illness seized either, a communication would have reached him ere this. At the same time, since his way homeward lay under the churchyard yews, he resolved to look into the belfry in passing by, and speak a word to Martin <b>Cannister,</b> who would be there.|$|E
60|$|The {{details of}} the {{accident}} were then rehearsed by Stephen's father, in the dramatic manner also common to Martin <b>Cannister,</b> other individuals of the neighbourhood, and the rural world generally. Mrs. Smith threw in her sentiments between the acts, as Coryphaeus of the tragedy, to make the description complete. The story at last came to an end, as the longest will, and Stephen directed the conversation into another channel.|$|E

Here Mr. <b>Cannister</b> held his {{walking-stick}} scrupulously vertical with his left hand, and struck a blow with great force on the knob of the stick with his right. 'John was steadying the pile so, as I might say.' Here he gave the stick a slight shake, and looked firmly in the various eyes around to see that before proceeding further his listeners well grasped the subject at that stage.

60|$|Martin <b>Cannister,</b> the sexton, {{was rather}} a {{favourite}} with Elfride. He used to absorb her attention by telling her of his strange experiences in digging up after long years {{the bodies of}} persons he had known, and recognizing them by some little sign (though in reality he had never recognized any). He had shrewd small eyes and a great wealth of double chin, which compensated in some measure for considerable poverty of nose.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{one side}} of the amphitheatrical space, perched high upon an {{elevated}} dais, sat a white-headed old man with a tomahawk in his hand: earnestly engaged in overseeing the tumult; though not a word did he say. Occasionally, however, he was regarded by those present with a mysterious sort of deference; and when they chanced to pass between him and the crazy man, they invariably did so in a stooping position; probably to elude the atmospheric grape and <b>cannister,</b> continually flying {{from the mouth of the}} lunatic.|$|E

40|$|Part of the Ship Survivability Enhancement Program (SSEP) was {{a series}} of smoke {{experiments}}. These experiments used cold smoke (training smoke <b>cannisters)</b> and hot smoke (produced from fires) to record the propagation of smoke through a naval vessel, in order to test the effectiveness of different smoke clearance techniques. Temperature, smoke density and air velocity data were recorded. Air velocity was measured with the use of bidirectional anemometer sensors, connected to Air Monitor Corporation Veltron 5000 AZ series differential pressure transmitters. An air velocity calibration for these systems was required to interpret the measurements. Equations based on data recorded using known air velocities in a wind tunnel have been developed to enable this translation...|$|R
40|$|Two rockets {{carrying}} an upleg and downleg trimethyl aluminum chemical trail release and three barium <b>cannisters</b> were launched from Poker Flat, Alaska on Feb. 28, 1978 and Mar. 2, 1978 {{in order to}} study neutral winds and electric fields in the dusk auroral oval. Electric field measurements were also made with a radar system to supplement the barium cloud data. The barium cloud drifts on both days showed intense poleward electric fields in the subauroral region. The drifts were nearly latitude-independent and were equivalent to electric fields of 60 mV/m of February 2 and 40 mV/m on March 2. The data indicate that the Lorentz force and Joule heating had a strong influence on the observed neutral winds...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} of a semi-closed anesthesia breathing circuit. The model comprises four perfect-mixing compartments (corresponding to the lung, the reservoir bag, and the two absorber <b>cannisters),</b> together with four tubes through which gas flows without mixing (corresponding to the inspiratory tube, the expiratory tube, the arm leading to the reservoir bag, and the anatomical dead space). For simplicity, only the case of spontaneous breathing is considered, and only three species of gases are included, namely oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. The model's predictions are compared with experiment, {{and some of the}} parameters are adjusted to get a better fit. The resulting model is used to compare the e#ectiveness of di#erent denitrogenation protocols. Two appendices contain discussions of technical details and modifications needed to include other gases.

On making the descent of another step the living inhabitants of the vault were recognizable.

40|$|Simultaneous {{localisation}} and mapping (SLAM) is {{an often}} used positioning approach in GPS denied indoor environments. This thesis presents a novel method of combining SLAM with autonomous/aided target detection and recognition (ATD/R), which is beneficial for both methods. The method uses physical {{objects that are}} recognisable by ATR as unambiguous features in SLAM, while SLAM provides the ATR with better position estimates. The intended application {{is to improve the}} positioning of a first responder moving through an indoor environment, where the map offers localisation and simultaneously helps locate people, furniture and potentially dangerous objects like gas <b>cannisters.</b> The developed algorithm, dubbed ATR-SLAM, uses existing methods from different fields such as EKF-SLAM and ATR based on rectangle estimation. Landmarks in the form of 3 D point features based on NARF are used in conjunction with identified objects and 3 D object models are used to replace landmarks when the same information is used. This leads to a more compact map representation with fewer landmarks, which partly compensates for the introduced cost of the ATR. Experiments performed using point clouds generated from a time-of-flight laser scanner show that ATR-SLAM produces more consistent maps and more robust loop closures than EKF-SLAM using only NARF landmarks...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{concerned the}} assessment of the pathways utilized by heavy metal pollutants in urban stormwater runoff. A separately sewered urban residential catchment of approximately 107 hectares in Chelmsley Wood, north-east Birmingham was the subject of the field investigation. The catchment area, almost entirely residential, had no immediate industrial heavy metal input, however, industry was situated {{to the north of the}} catchment. The perimeter of the catchment was bounded by the M 6 motorway on the northern and eastern sides and was believed to contribute to aerial deposition. Metal inputs to the ground surface were assumed to be confined to normal suburban activities, namely, aerial deposition, vehicular activity and anthropological activities. A programme of field work was undertaken over a 12 month period, from July 1983 to July 1984. Monthly deposition rates were monitored using a network of deposit <b>cannisters</b> and roadside sediment and soil samples were taken. Stormwater samples were obtained for 19 separate events. All samples were analysed for iron, lead, zinc, copper, chromium, nickel and cadmium content. Rainfall was recorded on site with additional meteorological data obtained from local Meteorological Offices. Use was made of a simple conceptual model designed for the catchment to substantiate hypotheses derived from site investigations and literature, to investigate the pathways utilized for the transportation of heavy metals throughout the catchment...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} on the microbiological quality of fluids associated with different types of dialysis systems located in six dialysis centers and 14 homes. Included were (i) single-pass systems employing either parallel flow (Kiil or Gambro) or capillary cartridge dialyzers and (ii) recirculating single-pass and batch recirculating systems using coil dialyzers. Microbiological assays were performed on the water used to prepare dialysis fluid, the concentrated dialysate, and either pre- and postdialyzer dialysate (single-pass systems) or the dialysate contained in storage reservoirs and recirculating <b>cannisters</b> (recirculating systems). The levels of microbial contamination consisting of gram-negative bacteria were {{directly related to the}} type of dialysis system, method of water treatment, distribution system, and in some instances, the type of dialyzer. Recirculating single-pass and batch recirculating systems consistently contained significantly higher levels of contamination than single-pass systems. These results were directly related to the design of recirculating systems which permits carbon- and nitrogen-containing waste products dialyzed from the patient to accumulate, be used as nutrients by microorganisms, and subsequently allow for 2 - to 4 -log increases in contamination levels during a dialysis treatment. In contrast, levels of contamination in single-pass machines were related more {{to the quality of the}} water used to prepare dialysis fluid and the adequacy of cleaning and disinfection procedures than to the design of the system...|$|R
60|$|Invigorated by a {{momentary}} glow, the veteran grappled with his brawny antagonist; {{but the issue}} of the short struggle was yet suspended, when the English, driven back by the fire of the marines, and the menacing front that Griffith with his boarders presented, retreated to the forecastle of their own ship, and attempted to return the deadly blows they were receiving, in their hull, from the cannon that Barnstable directed. A solitary gun was all they could bring to bear on the Americans; but this, loaded with <b>cannister,</b> was fired so near as to send its glaring flame into the very faces of their enemies. The struggling colonel, who was already sinking beneath the arm of his foe, felt the rough grasp loosen from his throat at the flash, and the two combatants sunk powerless on their knees facing each other.|$|E
60|$|The first {{event was}} very sad, and is soon told. One morning a {{schooner}} anchored off the village, and {{a party of}} armed seamen landed, the leader of whom, {{through the medium of}} an interpreter, had an interview with the chief. He wished to be permitted to cut sandal-wood, and an agreement was entered into. After a considerable quantity had been cut and sent on board, the chief wanted payment. This was refused on some trivial ground. The savages remonstrated. The white men threatened, and the result was that the latter were driven into their boats. They pulled off to their vessel, loaded a large brass gun that occupied the centre of the schooner's deck, and sent a shower of <b>cannister</b> shot among the savages, killing and wounding not only many of the men, but some of the women and children who chanced to be on the skirt of the wood. They then set sail, and, as they coasted along, fired into several villages, the people of which {{had nothing to do with}} their quarrel.|$|E

40|$|Underground {{burial of}} {{radioactive}} wastes in hard rock {{may be an}} effective and safe means of isolating them from the environment and from man. The mechanical safety and stability of such an underground repository depends largely on the virgin state of stress in the rock, groundwater pressures, {{the strengths of the}} rocks, heating by the decay of the radioactive wastes, and the layout of the excavations and the disposition of waste <b>cannisters</b> within them. A large body of pertinent data exists in the literature, and each of these factors has been analysed in the light of this information. The results indicate that there are no fundamental geological nor mechanical reasons why repositories capable of storing radioactive wastes should not be excavated at suitable sites in hard rock. However, specific tests to determine the mechanical and thermal properties of the rocks at a site would be needed to provide the data for the engineering design of a repository. Also, little experience exists of the effects on underground excavations of thermal loads, so that this aspect requires theoretical study and experimental validation. The depths of these potential repositories would lie in the range from 0. 5 km to 2. 0 km below surface, depending upon the strength of the rock. Virgin states of stress have been measured at such depths which would retard the ingress of groundwater and obviate the incidence of faulting. A typical repository comprising three horizons each with a total area of 5 km{sup 2 } would have the capacity to store wastes with thermal output of 240 MW...|$|R

'Every man take his bird' was the cry, when we trained our guns. And those guns all smoked like rows of Dutch pipe-bowls, my hearties! My gun's crew carried small flags in their bosoms, to nail to the mast in case the ship's colours were shot away. Stripped to the waistbands, we fought like skinned tigers, and bowled down the Turkish frigates like nine-pins. Among their shrouds--swarming thick with small-arm men, like flights of pigeons lighted on pine-trees--our marines sent their leaden pease and goose-berries, like a shower of hail-stones in Labrador. It was a stormy time, my hearties! The blasted Turks pitched into the old Asia's hull a whole quarry of marble shot, each ball {{one hundred and fifty}} pounds. They knocked three port-holes into one. But we gave them better than they sent. 'Up and at them, my bull-dog!' said I, patting my gun on the breech; 'tear open {{hatchways}} in their Moslem sides! White-Jacket, my lad, you ought to have been there. The bay was covered with masts and yards, as I have seen a raft of snags in the Arkansas River. Showers of burned rice and olives from the exploding foe fell upon us like manna in the wilderness. 'Allah! Allah! Mohammed! Mohammed!' split the air; some cried it out from the Turkish port-holes; others shrieked it forth from the drowning waters, their top-knots floating on their shaven skulls, like black snakes on half-tide rocks. By those top-knots they believed that their Prophet would drag them up to Paradise, but they sank fifty fathoms, my hearties, {{to the bottom of the}} bay. 'Ain't the bloody 'Hometons going to strike yet?' cried my first loader, a Guernsey man, thrusting his neck out of the port-hole, and looking at the Turkish line-of-battle-ship near by. That instant his head blew by me like a bursting Paixhan shot, and the flag of Neb Knowles himself was hauled down for ever. We dragged his hull to one side, and avenged him with the cooper's anvil, which, endways, we rammed home; a mess-mate shoved in the dead man's bloody Scotch cap for the wad, and sent it flying into the line-of-battle ship. By the god of war! boys, we hardly left enough of that craft to boil a pot of water with. It was a hard day's work--a sad day's work, my hearties. That night, when all was over, I slept sound enough, with a box of <b>cannister</b> shot for my pillow!
