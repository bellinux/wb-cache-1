40|$|Models {{that seek}} to produce a line at ~ 130 GeV as {{possibly}} present in the Fermi data face a number of phenomenological hurdles, {{not the least of}} which is achieving the high cross section into gamma gamma required. A simple explanation is a fermionic dark matter particle that couples to photons through loops of charged messengers. We study the size of the dimension 5 dipole (for a pseudo-Dirac state) and dimension 7 Rayleigh operators in such a model, including all higher order corrections in 1 /M_{mess}. Such corrections tend to enhance the annihilation rates beyond the naive effective operators. We find that while freezeout is generally dominated by the dipole, the present day gamma-ray signatures are dominated by the Rayleigh operator, except at the most strongly <b>coupled</b> <b>points,</b> motivating a hybrid approach. With this, the Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter scenario provides a successful explanation of the lines at only moderately strong coupling. We also consider the pure Majorana WIMP, where both freezeout and the Fermi lines can be explained, but only at very strong coupling with light (~ 200 - 300 GeV) messengers. In both cases there is no conflict with non-observation of continuum photons. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

ADAK-D tree utilizes AK-D tree twice in different geometrical projection orders to reserve true nearest neighbor points used in later ICP stages. An adaptive threshold in ADAK-D tree is used to reserve sufficient <b>coupling</b> <b>points</b> for a smaller alignment error.
