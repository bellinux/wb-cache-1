40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study that explores {{the experiences of}} Latin as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. Research supports that women <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children experience cultural expectations and negative social feedback regarding their decision. Given the research findings regarding the experiences {{of women in the}} general population who <b>choose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children, the researcher was curious about the culture-specific themes that might be identified that are relevant to the experience of being a female <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children in the Latino culture. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was selected and 10 Latina participants from Central America were interviewed about their experiences with <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. Four broad themes were identified: participants 2 ̆ 7 perspectives regarding their decision process <b>to</b> <b>not</b> have children, factors influencing their decision, social interactions experienced regarding their decision, and their sense of identity as women and Latinas <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. The findings suggest that interpersonal approaches toward understanding gender do not take into account complex gender identities that include non-traditional traits and behaviors, such as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. The results also suggest that the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s decision process in <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children is a multidimensional process involving cultural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal factors that may occur concurrently and vary with time and situation. In addition, the findings suggest that despite cultural expectations, negative social interactions, and complex intrapersonal process, Latinas <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children are able to continue with their decision through the help of social support and perseverance. It is not clear that there are culture-specific themes describing the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s experience with <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. It is suggested that these findings have implications for all women choosing non-traditional lifestyles, such as <b>choosing</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have children. Further research implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research were discussed...|$|R
