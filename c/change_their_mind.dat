The town's oldest store, Mercer & Sons, also closed after {{a decline in}} sales blamed on the credit crunch. It opened in 1840 and was originally an ironmonger but the public store converted to selling toys, household goods and hardware. However, in January 2009 {{the directors of the}} company announced that the shop would close following a 30-day statutory consultation, unless they <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> or a buyer is found. The markets continue to offer a wide range of local produce—Lancashire cheeses, tripe, Bowland beef and lamb can all be found. Walsh's Sarsaparilla stall decided not to move into the new market development. The market moved into the Mall shopping centre in 2011, and now opens 6 days a week (closed on bank holidays).|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} that the top four finishers in each event would be selected for the Olympics was not followed completely strictly. Lloyd Hahn, who only {{took part in the}} 800 meters at the Trials, was selected for the Olympics in both that event and the 1500 meters; Orval Martin, who had placed fourth in the 1500 meters, was left out of the Olympic team. Although Hahn was seen as a potential Olympic champion in both the 800 and 1500 meters, the move was still criticized, and failed to pay off as he underperformed in Amsterdam; Avery Brundage, then president of the American Olympic Association, cited the Hahn case as a reason not to give star athletes any special treatment at the next Olympic Trials. In the 10,000 meters Verne Booth and Johnny Zola, who placed third and fourth at the Trials, were left out of the team as too weak; Zola traveled to Amsterdam at his own expense, hoping the selectors would <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind.</b> American officials did eventually enter him, but the deadline for entries had already passed, and he was not allowed to compete. In the end, the American team in the 10,000 meters consisted of the Trials top two (Joie Ray and John Romig) and 5000-meter runner Macauley Smith, with no fourth entrant.|$|E

500|$|The {{mounting}} {{pressure to}} appeal to a mainstream audience, the quick change of tastes in British rock fans with the decline of the NWOBHM phenomenon and the chance to have a breakthrough in the US market prompted Girlschool to change their music, starting with the album Screaming Blue Murder in 1982. Their sound, following the success of Def Leppard's album Pyromania, became more polished with the introduction of keyboards on Play Dirty and veered toward hard rock and glam metal, losing the raw edge of their early works. [...] "We were signed to an American label (...) there was a certain amount of pressure exerted on us to sound more American" [...] was McAuliffe explanation, speaking about the tame sound of the album Running Wild. The band appearance also changed to a more feminine and sophisticated style, imitating the successful American glam metal bands of the time and generally following the direction of the market. However, the failed attempt to create a niche for Girlschool in the USA and the rapidly changing record market behaviour made the band <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> and go back to their original sound, which they retain to this day. Girlschool's members themselves described their music in different ways, from [...] "slapstick rock" [...] to [...] "raucous (...) heavy metal rock 'n' roll", and, even acknowledging the common origin of their music in the NWOBHM, they sometimes found it difficult to associate their songs to a single genre or subgenre of rock music.|$|E

2500|$|During his {{chairmanship}} of the Transport Advisory Committee in 1966, the Star Ferry applied for an increase of the first class fare of the cross-Victoria Harbour ferry from 20-cent to 25-cent and the application was soon approved by the Advisory Committee. The fare increase {{did not include the}} third class and therefore the grass roots community was largely unaffected, since the passengers of the first class deck were usually from the wealthier sector of the society. However, when the fare increase was announced by the government, it resulted in a general dissidence from the grass roots community as the Star Ferry was the only major cross-harbour public transportation at that time. The chairman of Star Ferry, M. A. R.

2500|$|There was a BCS {{controversy}} in the remaining at-large team that was selected {{to play in the}} BCS bowl games. The California Golden Bears expected to get the invite, having only lost one game to the top-ranked and undefeated Trojans. Meanwhile, the Texas Longhorns had lost only one game as well - to the #2 and undefeated Oklahoma Sooners. In the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football rankings on November 27, Cal was in the #4 BCS position and Texas was #5. Texas remained idle the next Saturday, but Cal had defeated the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles in a makeup game from Hurricane Ivan on December 4. Going into the game, the Golden Bears were made aware that while margin of victory did not affect computer rankings, it did affect human polls and just eight voters changing their vote could affect the final standings. In a dramatic twist, Texas, who had been left out of the BCS the year before because of the Oklahoma loss in the Big 12 championship, got enough voters to <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> in the final vote and more computer points to slide into the BCS #4 slot. When the December 4 rankings came out, Texas was in the #4 BCS position and Cal was in the #5 position. Texas edged California out of the #4 spot by a mere [...]0102 points. The final poll positions had been unchanged with Cal at #4 AP, #4 coaches, and #6 computers polls and Texas at #6 AP, #5 coaches, and #4 computer polls.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the Liao emperor's misrule of {{the former}} Later Jin territory, however, many Han rebellions rose against him, with the strongest being led by the Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan, who claimed {{imperial}} title as emperor of a new Later Han. [...] He soon had control over most {{of the former}} Later Jin territory — as Emperor Taizong withdrew and later died. [...] However, the Liao-commissioned military governor of Jinchang Circuit (晉昌, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), Zhao Kuangzan (趙匡贊) — a son of the major Liao general Zhao Yanshou — feared that the Later Han emperor would not tolerate him, and therefore instead sent emissaries submitting his circuit to Later Shu. [...] At Zhao's request, Meng Chang launched a large army and put it under the command of the former Later Jin general Zhang Qianzhao (張虔昭), who had submitted to Later Shu, to aid Zhao. [...] He also had Wang Chuhui write Hou Yi (侯益) the Later Han military governor of Fengxiang, persuading Hou to submit to Later Shu as well. [...] Hou agreed, and the Later Shu army approaching Jinchang's capital Jingzhao Municipality (京兆) appeared to be ready to add large amounts of territory to Later Shu. [...] However, Zhao's staff member Li Shu (李恕) persuaded Zhao to change his mind and submit to Later Han instead; he sent Li to Later Han's capital Kaifeng to beg Liu's forgiveness. [...] Hearing Zhao's change of mind, Hou also sent messengers to Liu, begging forgiveness as well. [...] Liu sent the general Wang Jingchong toward Jinchang and Fengxiang to prepare to combat the Later Shu troops, with instructions to attack Zhao and Hou if they again <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] Zhao, however, left for Kaifeng quickly, and Hou, after some hesitation, also did so, allowing Wang's army to take over control of their circuits. [...] (Wang considered killing Hou when Hou hesitated, but as Liu Zhiyuan had just died around that time, and Wang was concerned that his son and successor Liu Chengyou was unaware of the deceased emperor's instructions. [...] Hou, hearing news of this, quickly left for Kaifeng.) [...] Wang subsequently defeated the Later Shu army in relatively minor engagements, leading to the Later Shu army's withdrawal, ending Later Shu's hopes of large territorial gains for the moment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{constructive}} trusts {{that are}} usually seen as responding to consent (for instance, like a commercial contract), or [...] "intention" [...] are, first, agreements to convey property where all the formalities {{have not yet been}} completed. Under the doctrine of anticipation, if an agreement could be specifically enforced, before formalities are completed the agreement to transfer a property is regarded as effective in equity, and the property will be held on trust (unless this is expressly excluded by the agreement's terms). Second, when someone agrees to use property for another's benefit, or divide a property after purchase, but then goes back on the agreement, the courts will impose a constructive trust. In Binions v Evans when Mr and Mrs Binions bought a large property they promised the sellers that Mrs Evans could remain for life in her cottage. They subsequently tried to evict Mrs Evans, but Lord Denning MR held that their agreement had created a constructive trust, and so the property was not theirs to deal with. Third, gifts or trusts that are made without completing all formalities will be enforced under a constructive trust if {{it is clear that the}} person making the gift or trust manifested a true intention to do so. In the leading case, Pennington v Waine a lady named Ada Crampton had wished to transfer 400 shares to her nephew, Harold, had filled in a share transfer form and given it to Mr Pennington, the company's auditors, and had died before Mr Pennington had registered it. Ada's other family members claimed the shares still belonged to them, but the Court of Appeal held that even though not formally complete, the estate held the shares on constructive trust for Harold. Similarly, in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani the Privy Council held that Mr Pagarani's estate held money on constructive trust after he died for a new foundation, even though Mr Pagarani had not completed the trust deeds, because he had publicly announced his intention to hold the money on trust. Fourth, if a person who is about to die secretly declares that he wishes property to go to someone not named in a will, the executor holds that property on constructive trust. Similarly, fifth, if a person writes a [...] "mutual will" [...] with their partner, agreeing that their property will go to a particular beneficiary when they both die, the surviving person cannot simply <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> and will hold the property on constructive trust for the party who was agreed.|$|E
