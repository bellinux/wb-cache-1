5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a <b>community</b> <b>mental</b> health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Community</b> <b>Mental</b> Health Act of 1963 was a {{predisposing factor}} {{in setting the}} stage for {{homelessness}} in the United States.

It never quite worked out properly, the <b>community</b> <b>mental</b> health centers mostly did not materialize, and this population largely was found living in the streets soon thereafter with no sustainable support system.|$|E

25|$|In 1963 Kennedy, who had {{a mentally}} ill sister named Rosemary, {{submitted}} the nation's first Presidential special message to Congress on mental health issues.

25|$|The {{reform was}} focused on the gradual dismantlement of {{psychiatric}} hospitals, which required an effective <b>community</b> <b>mental</b> health service.

25|$|Deinstitutionalisation (or deinstitutionalization) is {{the process}} of {{replacing}} long-stay psychiatric hospitals with less isolated <b>community</b> <b>mental</b> health services for those diagnosed with a mental disorder or developmental disability. Deinstitutionalisation works in two ways: the first focuses on reducing the population size of mental institutions by releasing patients, shortening stays, and reducing both admissions and readmission rates; the second focuses on reforming mental hospitals' institutional processes so as to reduce or eliminate reinforcement of dependency, hopelessness, learned helplessness, and other maladaptive behaviours.|$|E

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Joint Commission on Mental Health and Health, the Presidential Panel of Mental Retardation, and Kennedy's influence, two important pieces of legislation were passed in 1963: the Maternal and Child Health and Mental Retardation Planning Amendments, which increased funding for research on the prevention of retardation, and the Mental Retardation Facilities and <b>Community</b> <b>Mental</b> Health Centers Construction Act, which provided funding for community facilities that served people with mental disabilities. Both acts furthered the process of deinstitutionalization.|$|E
25|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Loren Mosher, most deinstitutionalisation in the USA {{took place}} after 1972, {{as a result}} of the availability of SSI and Social Security Disability, long after the antipsychotic drugs were used universally in state hospitals. This period marked the growth in community support funds and community development, including early group homes, the first <b>community</b> <b>mental</b> health apartment programs, drop-in and transitional employment, and sheltered workshops in the community which predated community forms of supportive housing and supported living.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, President John F. Kennedy {{accelerated}} the trend towards deinstitutionalization with the <b>Community</b> <b>Mental</b> Health Act. Also, since psychiatric drugs were becoming more available allowing patients {{to live on}} their own and the asylums were too expensive, institutions began shutting down. Nursing care thus became more intimate and holistic. Expanded roles were also developed in the 1960s allowing nurses to provide outpatient services such as counseling, psychotherapy, consultations, prescribing medications, along with the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.|$|E

25|$|Moves to {{community}} living and services {{have led to}} various concerns and fears, from both the individuals themselves {{and other members of}} the community. Over a quarter of individuals accessing <b>community</b> <b>mental</b> health services in a US inner-city area are victims of at least one violent crime per year, a proportion eleven times higher than the inner-city average. The elevated victim rate holds for every category of crime, including rape/sexual assault, other violent assaults, and personal and property theft. Victimisation rates are similar to those with developmental disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Reliability {{refers to}} whether the scores are reproducible.

Reliability is not considered an intrinsic, unchanging property of tests because it could change when used under different conditions or {{in a different context}} than where it had been studied before.|$|E
