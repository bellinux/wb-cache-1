5|$|Analysis {{of central}} European <b>cattle,</b> {{including}} Limousins, {{indicates that the}} origin {{of male and female}} DNA can be traced directly to <b>cattle</b> domesticated in the Near East. This is in contrast to the DNA of northern European <b>cattle,</b> which suggests that wild Eurasian aurochs were at one time mated to domesticated cows, and of southern European <b>cattle,</b> which indicates that wild Eurasian aurochs cows were mated to domesticated bulls.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cattle</b> breeds such as Hereford or Aberdeen Angus {{date back}} to the 1700s, and a handful of farmers {{continue}} to raise <b>cattle</b> sired by registered pedigree bulls.

5|$|Highland <b>cattle</b> {{were first}} {{imported}} into Canada in the 1880s. Both the Honourable Donald A. Smith, Lord Strathcona of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Robert Campbell of Strathclair, Manitoba, imported one bull each. There were also Highland <b>cattle</b> in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1880s. However, their numbers were small until the 1920s when large-scale breeding and importing began. In the 1950s <b>cattle</b> were imported from and exported to North America. The Canadian Highland <b>Cattle</b> Society was officially registered in 1964 and currently registers all purebred <b>cattle</b> in Canada. Towards {{the end of}} the 1990s, there was a large semen and embryo trade between the UK and Canada. However, that has stopped, largely due to the BSE (mad cow disease) outbreaks in the United Kingdom. Today, Highland <b>cattle</b> are mainly found in eastern Canada. The population of Highland <b>cattle</b> for Canada and the United States of America combined is estimated at 11,000.|$|E

5|$|In 1791, Jacques-Joseph Saint-Martin, an agronomist from Limoges, {{acknowledged}} {{the importance of}} Limousin <b>cattle</b> in the markets of cities such as Paris, Lyon and Toulouse. Limousin <b>cattle</b> actually came from the departments of Charente, Dordogne, Haute-Vienne, Vienne, Lot, Corrèze and Creuse. The market for Limousin <b>cattle</b> declined slightly in the early 19th century, but livestock still remained a major activity in the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, <b>cattle</b> ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their <b>cattle</b> assumed that the birds killed the <b>cattle.</b> This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the reintroduction of condors to the Grand Canyon was challenged by some <b>cattle</b> ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s {{the breed}} enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) <b>cattle</b> with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly {{referred}} to as mad cow disease) caused an export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway <b>cattle.</b> This created a fear associated with <b>cattle,</b> so breed numbers declined.|$|E

5|$|Limousin muscling is {{intermediate}} {{to that of}} British <b>cattle</b> breeds such as Angus, Hereford, and Shorthorn and {{the extreme}} double muscling found in the European Belgian Blue and Piedmontese breeds. Studies of double-muscled <b>cattle</b> identified natural mutations of the myostatin gene which produce inactivated proteins that are unable to control muscle development. In Belgian Blue and Piedmontese <b>cattle</b> this causes an increase in muscle mass of 20–25%. Subsequent studies identified a less extreme myostatin mutation known as F94L associated with Limousins. The resulting partially active protein results in Limousins having intermediate muscle development, which avoids the extreme muscling and associated disadvantages of double muscled <b>cattle.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the growth hormone profile of bali <b>cattle’s</b> whichwas reared in three different types of preservation areas in Bali Province namely gardens, fields andcultivated lands. The sample of this study was serum taken from 78 bali <b>cattles</b> which spread inthose three areas. The growth hormone concentration was tested from the serum using ELISA(Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay). The results showed that the highest concentration of growth hormone of bali <b>cattle’s</b> in gardens was 3225, 19 pg/ml and the lowest was 931, 17 pg/mlwith mean was 1311, 38 ± 128, 4. In fields area, the highest concentration of growth hormone was 1852, 91 pg/ml and the lowest was 906, 22 pg/ml with mean was 1185, 89 ± 41, 52, and in thecultivated land, the highest concentration of growth hormone was 5044, 08 pg/ml and the lowestwas 1046, 83 pg/ml with mean was 1927, 64 ± 246, 64. This study concluded that the profile ofgrowth hormone concentration of bali <b>cattle’s</b> reared in gardens, fields, and cultivated land weredifferent.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} compare the dentine wear of primary and {{permanent}} human and bovine teeth because of erosion/abrasion and evaluate if bovine dentine is an appropriate substitute for human dentine in further erosion/abrasions tests. Dentine samples from deciduous molars and human third molars {{as well as from}} calves' and <b>cattle's</b> lower incisors were prepared and baseline surface profiles were recorded. Each day all samples were demineralized in 1 % citric acid, tooth brushed with 100 brushing strokes with toothpaste slurry and stored in artificial saliva {{for the rest of the}} day. This cycle was run for 20 days. Afterwards, new surface profiles were recorded and dentine wear was calculated by a customized computer program. Dentine wear because of erosion/abrasion was not statistically, significantly different for human third molars and <b>cattle's</b> lower incisors (P = 0. 7002). The dentine wear because of erosion/abrasion of deciduous molars and calves' lower incisors was significantly different (P < 0. 0000). No statistically significant difference in the dentine wear of human third molars and <b>cattle's</b> lower incisors was observed, so that the use of <b>cattle's</b> lower incisors as substitute for adult human teeth for further investigations in erosion/abrasion studies could be accepted...|$|R
