40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{the work}} was to study the effect of {{traditional}} processing methods on the β-carotene, ascorbic acid and trypsin inhibitor contents of orange-fleshed sweet potato amala. The most common sweet potato in Nigeria is white or yellow fleshed, which is very low in provitamin A. However, efforts are underway to promote orange-fleshed sweet potato to improve provitamin A intake. This paper describes how orange-fleshed sweet potato slices were traditionally processed into amala, which is increasingly consumed in Nigeria. RESULTS The study revealed that both the <b>cold</b> and hot <b>fermentation</b> methods resulted in increased vitamin A levels and lower vitamin C levels in orange-fleshed sweet potato. Further processing to make amala resulted in a fall in both vitamin A and C content. The study found an increase in trypsin inhibitor activity following the cold-water fermentation and a decrease following the hot-water fermentation compared to raw orange-fleshed sweet potato. Trypsin inhibitor activity in amala produced using both the cold and hot methods was below detectable levels. CONCLUSION The results indicate that amala produced from traditionally fermented orange-fleshed sweet potato {{could be a good}} source of vitamins A and C for the rural poor and that the processing removes any potential negative effects of trypsin inhibitors...|$|R

In general, the deletion and overexpression of these genes did affect fermentation performance at low temperature. Most of the mutants were unable to complete fermentation, while overexpression of CSF 1, HSP 104, and TIR 2 decreased the lag phase, increased the fermentation rate, and reached higher populations than that of the control strain. Another set of overexpressing strains were constructed by integrating copies of these genes in the delta regions of the commercial wine strain QA 23. These new stable overexpressing strains again showed improved fermentation performance at low temperature, especially during the lag and exponential phases. Our results demonstrate the convenience of carrying out functional analysis in commercial strains and in an experimental set-up close to industrial conditions. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2005. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Winemakers or {{producers}} are under constant pressure {{to reduce the}} operational costs {{for the production of}} wine. The reason for this being threefold: Firstly, the number of cellars and estates locally, and internationally, has grown immensely. Thus, the competition on both the national and international front has put producers under pressure to reduce their production cost in order to survive the explosion of brand possibilities on the consumer's horizons. Secondly, the exchange rate {{has been one of the}} most unpredictable variables which highlight the importance of scenario planning and sufficient financial planning in order to overcome significant exchange rate fluctuations which may cause financial strain for the business. Thirdly, the benefits of using expensive oak barrels for the maturation of premium quality wines are undisputable. These benefits include the clarification and decarbonation of wines, decrease in the astringency of tannins ("softening of tannins"), the evolution of colour, providing complementary oak aromas which increase the complexity and finesse of these wines and stabilising the colloid structure of the maturing wine. The greatest disadvantages remain nevertheless that it is a costly and labour intensive operation. Oak is an essential part of the flavour profile of many premium quality wines, and there is still a growing market demand for these wines. The use of oak barrels for the maturation of premium red wines, incorporates a specific flavour dimension to the wine (and adding value), has been the traditional way of storing wines. Well known cellars and Estates all over the world have build remarkable profiles and identities for their brands. To alter any principles regarding the use of oak will alter the style of the wines and will beyond any doubt influence their brand image negatively. Chapter 1 gives an introduction and the main aims of the study. The phenolic composition of grapes and oak are a complex mixture of different molecules which are discussed in Chapter 2. These include those responsible for the colour (anthocyanins), taste (mainly the tannins) and aroma of the wine. The composition of the oak barrel can be influenced by its origin, seasoning of the oak, toasting of the staves, age of the barrel etc. These factors all affect the chemical composition of the oak (lactones, volatile phenols, carbohydrate volatiles, hydrolysable tannins etc.) and ultimately, the wine. The chemical reactions taking place in wine during ageing are also complex, which makes maturation and research of wine in oak a complex business. The challenge, thus, developed to sustain the flavour profiles (oak attributes) and to reduce the operational costs, without influencing the identity or profile of the brand negatively. The use of oak derived products like chips, dust, blocks, staves, balls and even extracts was proposed, although it is considered by-products of the cooperage profession. Some of the major disadvantages of the use of oak derived products still remain the limited control over the production process. This may lead to inconsistency in the quality of these products. Nevertheless, the use of oak derived products and the availability of these products have grown significantly and with it a need for research on this field. Chapter 3 address the results obtained from the maturation of Pinotage, which is uniquely South African, and Shiraz wines, in different oak type barrels (French vs. American vs. Russian), as well as treatments with various oak derived products, and the influence of these oak products on the evolution of colour, phenolic development and quality of the wines during ageing. The results obtained in this project correlated with findings in the literature. The colour density, percentage of red pigment colour and S 02 resistant pigments increased, especially in the first three to six months during ageing in barrels as a result of ellagic tannin extraction from the barrels and polymerisation reactions, but decreased later as maturation progresses as a result of precipitation. In some cases the use of oak increased the colour density significantly with almost 40 %. The colour density, total red pigment colour and total phenolic composition decreased during bottle maturation as a result of polymerisation. No significant colour differences between the barrel types could, however, be detected. The use of oak derived products showed the same tendencies for all colour dimensions, although no significant differences could be detected between the treatments. The most significant difference was that new oak barrels contributed more to the development of colour compared to the oak treatments. The Gelatine index gives an indication of the degree of polymerisation of tannins; higher values will indicate tannins which are highly reactive and will cause an astringent mouth feel. The values should decrease as maturation progresses and tannins polymerise. Little differences between barrel types (French vs. American vs. Russian) were found in the one Shiraz, but in the two Pintage wines the index was the lowest in the wines matured in French oak after 36 months bottle ageing. Sensorial tests indicated little quality differences after 36 months between the different oak types The American oak barrels had, in general, a more "oaky bouquet", even after 36 months in the bottle. Pinotage matured with different alternative oak products showed that chips added to barrels tended to give a higher oak aroma, with a lower fruit compared to the other treatments. The same wine matured in new barrels, as expected, also had a very high oak aroma compared to the same wine matured in older barrels. This led to a higher fruit perception in the latter wines. Lees contact is a practice more commonly used in the production of white wines, but may be a dangerous practice in the production of red wines. Chapter 4 reports on the effect of lees contact during ageing of red wine on the micro flora and colour after 12 month maturation. No significant differences in microbial analysis were detected during of barrel maturation between the wines matured in the lees and the filtered wines for acetic acid, yeast and lactic acid bacteria. The initial pH differences during <b>cold</b> maceration and <b>fermentation,</b> however, did influence these numbers, with higher numbers being observed at higher pH values. However, colour differences could be detected. The concentration of yellow brown pigments (measured at 420 nm) was lower in the lees matured wines than in the filtered· wines which underwent malolactic fermentation in the barrel. Other colour differences that could be detected were higher colour density and total red pigment colour in wines as a result of longer skin contact (due to slower alcoholic fermentation rate). Thus, manipulation of the skins during alcoholic fermentation, the use of barrels and/or oak derived products in various stages of vinification and maturation of wines and additional practices as maturation on lees may be thus be used to set a certain style of wine which meet a specific market demand, trend or style. Chapter 5 summarises the results obtained and future research to be done on wood and wine. This study, however, clearly showed that the origin and oak type does not influence the colour as much as the aroma and taste of red wine under South African conditions. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING; Wynmakers of produsente word onder gedurige druk geplaas om die produksiekoste van wyn te verlaag. Die redes hiervoor is drieledig: Eerstens het die getal kelders en landgoedere op nasionale en internasionale vlak geweldig toegeneem. Dus, die kompetisie op beide nasionale en internasionale gebied plaas produsente onder druk om die produksie koste van die wyn te verminder om sodoende finansieel die ontploffing van nuwe moontlike wyne op die horison van die verbruiker te oorleef. Tweedens, die wisselkoers was altyd een van die meer onvoorspelbare veranderlikes wat die belangrikheid van scenario-beplanning en weldeurdagte finansiele beplanning beklemtoon om sodoende groat veranderinge in die wisselkoers, wat moontlike finansiele druk in die besigheid mag veroorsaak, te oorkom. Derdens, een van die grootste uitgawes in die produksie proses van is die verouderingskomponent van kwaliteitswyn. Die voordele van die gebruik van eikehout vate in die verouderingsproses van rooiwyne is welbekend. Hierdie voordele sluit in die suiwering van die wyn in terme van soliede partikels, dekarbonisering (C 02 -ontgasting}, afname in die vrank smaak ("sagtheid van die tanniene), die ontwikkeling van die kleur van die wyn, toevoeging van komplementere hout boeketstowwe wat bydrae tot die kompleksiteit van die wyn, asook die stabilisering van die kollo"idale struktuur van die wyn. Die grootste nadeel bly, nieteenstaande, die geweldige koste verbonde aan vate, asook die hantering en onderhoud daarvan. Eike hout verwante boeketstowwe is 'n onmisbare komponent van die aroma profiel van baie kwaliteitswyne. Daar is 'n groeiende mark vir hierdie tipe wyne. Die gebruik van eikehout vate vir die veroudering van kwaliteitswyne, behalwe die bydrae van belangrike geurstowwe (een waarde), was nog altyd 'n tradisionele stap in die proses. Beroemde kelders reg oor die wereld het uitmuntende mark identiteite vir hulle self geskep, asook 'n "spesifieke identiteit" vir hulle wyn. Om enige beginsels aangaande die gebruik van eikehout te verander, sal sander twyfel die wynstyl verander en moontlik 'n negatiewe effek op die kelder se identiteit he. Hoofstuk 1 gee 'n inleiding en die hoof doelstellings van die studie. Die fenoliese samestelling van druiwe en eikehout bestaan uit 'n komplekse mengsel van verskillende molekules wat in Hoofstuk 2 beskryf word. Hierdie sluit in daardie verantwoordelik vir die kleur (antosianiene), die smaak (hoofsaaklik tanniene) en die aroma van die wyn. Die|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{economic}} and environmental concerns {{have resulted in a}} great amount of research on renewable sources of biomass and bioenergy to replace fossil fuels in the past decades. Decentralized biogas technology {{is one of the most}} potential technologies of biomass and bioenergy by using agricultural waste materials (e. g., animal manure, crop straw and by-products from food industries) as feedstocks. By-products from biogas production, called digestate, are nutrient rich which could potentially be reused as green fertilizers in agriculture, thereby providing a sustainable substitute for synthetic fertilizers for ecosystem farm. Thus, the biogas production of anaerobic digestion (AD) is win-win option for livestock and crop producers to address issues of waste management and energy supply, and to avoid contamination of surface and ground waters and emissions of odors and greenhouse gases. In this paper, we review biogas production technology and then evaluate environmental effects of digestate used as fertilizer. Finally, we discuss issues of deployment of decentralized biogas technology for ecosystem farms. Economic and technological barriers still exist for large scale deployment of biogas technology. Two national scale deployments in China and Nepal showed that the operational status of biogas digesters is not optimal and up to 50 % of plants are non-functional after a short operation period regardless of the social and economic factors. Main barriers are a wide variation of feedstocks and environmental conditions (e. g., temperature) over space and time. It becomes clear that the experimental conditions of the pilot plants need to be adjusted and calibrated to the local feedstocks and climate.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Despite {{frequent}} {{discussions about}} the health-related value of carbohydrate-rich foods, the grocery stores offer {{a wide range of}} bread varieties. In this context, there are several actors (e. g. Fedon Lindberg, Birger Svihus and Ingers rugbrød) claiming that they have the recipe for the ”ideal” bread. However, their breads are very different, and the argumentation why they are healthy is clearly embedded in very different nutrition philosophies; i. e. low glycemic index/low carb (Lindberg), low energy (Svihus) and high fiber (Ingers rugbrød). PURPOSE: The purpose of the present thesis was therefore to elaborate a more holistic view on what an “ideal” bread really is. METHODS: Four main criteria for an “ideal” bread were set. The “ideal” bread recipe should be; (1) healthy, (2) sensory appealing, (3) environmental beneficial, and (4) practical. To set some exact criteria in relation to the health aspect, it was decided that the resulting bread recipe should fulfil the Keyhole requirements (minimum 25 percent whole grains and 5 gram dietary fiber/ 100 g, as well as maximum 5 g sugar, 0. 5 g salt and 7 g fat per 100 g), and achieve at least three cakes on the Bread scale (i. e. a whole grain bread). A literature review was conducted, and bread baking books were searched for a suitable recipe to be modified to fit with the criteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The resulting bread recipe had a high coarseness (78 percent), relatively much dietary fiber (7. 6 g/ 100 g), low amounts of salt (0. 2 g/ 100 g) and fat (3. 5 g/ 100 g), and no added sugar. Due to a high water content, which among others led to a sensory appealing texture, the bread also had a relatively low energy-density. By basing the recipe on local grains (i. e. rye and oat), environmental considerations were furthermore taken into account. With regard to the practical aspects, an easy and time-efficient fermentation method was identified (i. e. long and <b>cold</b> <b>fermentation</b> (up to 24 hours at approximately 4 oC)). All in all, instead of having an exclusive health focus, it should {{in the case of an}} “ideal” bread be strived for a broader approach where all the aspects surrounding its production and consumption, is taken into account.
