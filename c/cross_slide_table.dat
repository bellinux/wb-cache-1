40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new {{pneumatic}} positioning device {{coupled with a}} piezoelectric self-moving mechanism to overcome the main disadvantages of the inherent poor positioning accuracy obtained by traditional pneumatic cylinder. The new driving mechanism is to mount a piezoelectric Impact Drive Mechanism (IDM) to the controlled <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> driven by the pneu-matic cylinder. Based on the configuration, {{the first step of}} positioning proc-ess is to actuate the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> with rough position accuracy but with the benefits of high-speed and large-range due to the pneumatic cylinder.

40|$|Abstract. In {{grinding}} viscous materials, such as stainless steel, {{aluminum and}} many polymeric materials, {{the application of}} a dither on the workpieces proves to be an effective way to enhance the quality of surface finish. A linear stepper motor is utilized for this purpose. By means of the PWM control to the adjacent phase coils, the linear stepper can drive the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> to make reciprocating motion and also to produce a desired dither signal, while the grinding is undertaken to the attached workpiece. In this paper, a linear stepper motor is introduced to drive the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> and a modulated control strategy is used to control the linear stepper continuously, which also generates an additional dither on the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> and the attached workpiece. The dither amplitude can be adjusted by means of the modulated frequency. Experiments are designed to measure the practical dither signals and to verify the effectiveness of improving surface finish quality using a dither. It is demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental results that by means of proposed table drive, a rather wide band of dither signal can be acquired and can meet the most demand of viscous material grinding...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{measurement}} of the roll error motion of a <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> in a precision linear slide. The proposed method utilizes a pair of clinometers in the production process of a precision linear slide, where the roll error motion measurement {{will be carried out}} repeatedly to confirm whether the surface form errors of slide guideways in the linear slide are sufficiently corrected by hand scraping process. In the proposed method, one of the clinometers is mounted on the <b>slide</b> <b>table,</b> while the other is placed on a vibration isolation table, on which the precision linear slide is mounted, so that influences of external disturbances can be cancelled. An experimental setup is built on a vibration isolation table, and some experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.|$|R
30|$|For {{measurement}} of the yaw error motion, laser interferometers, laser Doppler scales or laser autocollimators [4] have been employed. Especially, autocollimators are often employed in the manufacturing process of linear slides since they can continue their measurement even if their measurement laser beams are interrupted by operators for the hand scraping process. In addition, autocollimators have advantage of high measurement resolution {{on the order of}} sub arc-second [17 – 21]. In the case of measuring the yaw error motion by using an autocollimator, a small mirror reflector will be mounted on a <b>slide</b> <b>table,</b> while an optical sensor head of the autocollimator will be aligned {{in such a way that}} the optical axis will be parallel with the motion axis of the <b>slide</b> <b>table.</b> The setup for this measurement is not so difficult since the required size of the reflector is small.|$|R

The linearity error of each sensor has been verified to be within 0.001 °. The differential output of the two clinometers has also been calibrated, and the output {{difference between the two}} clinometers has been verified to be within 0.0015 °. Finally, the roll error motion of the <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> has been evaluated by using the proposed method. By taking the differential of the sensor outputs, the roll error motion of the slide has successfully been measured, while eliminating the influence of the external disturbances.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a noncontact <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> design and measurements of its performance via ultrasonic levitation. A slider placed atop two vibrating guide rails is levitated by an acoustic radiation force emitted from the rails. A flexural traveling wave propagating along {{the guide rails}} allows noncontact transportation of the slider. Permitting a transport mechanism that reduces abrasion and dust generation with an inexpensive and simple structure. The profile of the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> was designed using the finite-element analysis (FEA) for high levitation and transportation efficiency. The prototype <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> was made of alumina ceramic (Al 2 O 3) to increase machining accuracy and rigidity using a structure composed {{of a pair of}} guide rails with a triangular cross section and piezoelectric transducers. Two types of transducers were used: bolt-clamped Langevin transducers and bimorph transducers. A 40 -mm long slider was designed to fit atop the two rail guides. Flexural standing waves and torsional standing waves were observed along the guide rails at resonance, and the levitation of the slider was obtained using the flexural mode even while the levitation distance was less than 10 pm. The levitation distance of the slider was measured while increasing the slider&# 039;s weight. The levitation pressure, rigidity, and vertical displacement amplitude of the levitating slider thus were measured to be 6. 7 kN/m(2), 3. 0 kN/mu m/m(2), and less than 1 mu m, respectively. Noncontact transport of the slider was achieved using phased drive of the two transducers {{at either end of the}} vibrating guide rail. By controlling the phase difference, the slider transportation direction could be switched, and a maximum thrust of 13 mN was obtaine...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{measurement}} method {{for evaluation of}} the roll error motion of a precision linear slide by using a high resolution fluid-based type clinometer in the production process of the stage system. The clinometer used in this research is developed based on a commercially-available fluid type clinometer [29], which detects the surface level of the liquid enclosed inside of the sensor body. Since the clinometer detects the absolute angle {{with respect to the}} direction of gravitational vector, clinometer detects not only the roll error motion of a <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> but also external inclination such as tilt angle of a vibration isolation table where the linear slide is mounted. In order to remove the influence of the external inclinations, in this paper, another clinometer is directly mounted on the vibration isolation table. By taking a differential output signal of the two clinometers, the roll error motion of the <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> can be evaluated, while eliminating the influence of the external disturbances mainly from the vibration isolation table. An experimental setup employing the pair of clinometers is developed, and experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.|$|R
30|$|By {{using the}} {{calibrated}} clinometers, the roll error {{motion of the}} precision linear slide was then evaluated in experiments. The setup shown in Figure  10 was also employed in the experiments. As shown in the figure, the Sensor 1 was mounted on the <b>slide</b> <b>table,</b> while the Sensor 2 was directly fixed on the vibration isolation table. Since the measurement range of each clinometer was set to be small for enhancement of the measurement resolution, Sensor 1 and 2 were mounted on different manual tilt stages independently. The stage roll error motion was evaluated by using both the developed clinometers and the commercial laser autocollimator, which was employed as a reference in the experiments. Since the commercial autocollimators cannot measure roll motion of a linear slide with a long stroke due {{to the absence of}} a precision mirror having a length comparable with the slide, a linear stage with a short stroke of 45  mm was employed in this paper. A precision reflective mirror with the length of 100  mm was also mounted on the <b>slide</b> <b>table</b> so that <b>slide</b> roll motion could be measured by the commercial laser autocollimator.|$|R
