40|$|The {{commissioning}} {{of building}} services {{is very much}} the ‘Cinderella’ activity in the construction cycle, many complaints are heard but few praises sung. This paper examines the current process of commissioning building services within the traditional procurement route. A literature review is presented followed by the results of a two-stage structured survey from a broad spectrum of participants. A best practice flow chart for managing the commissioning process is presented, tested and confirmed, identifying an auditable chain of responsibilities in the commissioning process. Key conclusions include the need to recognize that the commissioning process requires planning and managing from the earliest possible stage; the need to appoint a <b>commissioning</b> <b>manager</b> — preferable someone in-house, or a member of the design team; the need for better end-user documentation and training; the requirement for a more formalized approach and the requirement for clarification on the terms of engagement for the services designer.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} final report of a student internship project, focusing {{on the development of}} a suicide prevention programme in Kent. Following an increase in prison suicides between 2013 and 2014, Kent & Medway Suicide Prevention Steering Group were approached by the <b>commissioning</b> <b>manager</b> for health and justice to conduct research into this area. Dr Ian Marsh from Canterbury Christ Church University put forward the CCCU student internship as a means of undertaking this research. The Research and Knowledge Exchange internships at Canterbury Christ Church University allow students to work with academic staff on a specific research project. Academics apply for a research intern to work with them on research in areas which are likely to result in tangible outputs. The author of this report is a final year BSc Sociology student at Canterbury Christ Church University who worked as an intern on this project for a period of 10 weeks from May to July. The project involved an extensive literature review, along with consultation with various agencies and individuals, in order to gain a deeper insight into the emerging issues. Consultations were with the following stakeholders: •	Kent and Medway Suicide Prevention Steering Group •	Mental health in-reach team at HMP Elmley •	The Samaritans Listener Scheme Co-ordinator •	The Howard League Policy Officer •	The Prisons and Probation Assistant Ombudsman •	Safer Custody team for Kent This report provides a brief overview of suicides, prison suicides, and prevention - nationally and in Kent. Key themes from the literature are outlined and supported with insight from the consultations where appropriate. Recommendations are put forward where appropriate in regard to potential steps for prison suicide prevention in Kent. Project Aims The main aims of this project were to: •	Review existing literature and data around prison suicides and prevention. •	Meet with key stakeholders who could give a deeper insight into these issues. •	Present findings to the Kent & Medway suicide prevention steering group. •	Use {{the final report}} to inform relevant agencies and prison staff...|$|E

40|$|While a {{significant}} body of scholarly works {{suggests that we}} can best understand the policy output of international bureaucracies {{by focusing on the}} preferences of their political masters, this article joins those looking “inside ” such bureaucracies to comprehend their behavior. Using an original dataset from nearly two hundred interviewees, the article examines the policy preferences of top bureaucrats of the European Commission. It shows that top <b>Commission</b> <b>managers</b> favor deeper European integration regardless of their national background or their organizational experience. The tilt of the Commission bureaucracy toward supranationalism is indicated by a broader consensus within the organization on some of the most controversial initiatives in the EU like the constitutional treaty, Turkish accession and the directive for the liberalization of the services sector. This notable consensus suggests that despite occasional policy setbacks and perceived intergovernmental “trends, ” the Commission will continue serving its integrative mission. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} annual report readability and firm performance. This is motivated by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s plain English disclosure regulations that attempt to make corporate disclosures easier to read for ordinary investors. I measure the readability of public company annual reports using the Fog Index and the Kincaid Index from computational linguistics. I find that the annual reports of firms with lower earnings are harder to read. Moreover, the positive earnings of firms with annual reports that are easier to read are more persistent in the next one to four years. This suggests that, consistent with the motivation behind the plain English disclosure regulation of the Securities and Exchange <b>Commission,</b> <b>managers</b> may be opportunistically choosing the readability of annual reports to hide adverse information from investors. However, I do not find any correlation between annual report readability and future stock returns, suggesting that the market does impound the implications of disclosure readability into stock prices...|$|R

One recommendation of the Committee was to determine if a landscape design could be developed to use plantings less attractive to the deer; planted in ways that might discourage heavy browsing. In 1990, the Morris County Park Commission commissioned landscape architect, Helen Heinrich to design a garden based on the lines and spaces of the gardens surrounding the Tracy mansion in the 1920 s and 1930 s. No attempt was made to restore the original plants in the garden, but to adapt the garden as much as necessary {{to the demands of the}} present deer population. The first step in developing such a design was to determine which plants were browsed by deer in this area, and which could be utilized in the garden design.

40|$|Background: The {{provision}} {{of emotional and}} psychological support for all family members who need it is {{an essential element of}} holistic palliative care. Within East Anglia's Children's Hospice, teams of professionally trained and experienced workers offer psychosocial support to all family members at all times during the child's and family's journey. However, the effectiveness and appropriateness of current psychosocial provision is unclear, as is the requirement for any additional psychological services. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to elicit perceptions about current psychological support within the hospice from a group of stakeholders (parents, hospice staff, and external professionals). Method: Forty-five parents participated in family focus groups, telephone interviews, individual interviews in their home, or a web-based survey.

The 'Buried Treasures' Project at Royal Holloway, University of London, and the British Library, provides a catalogue of all the plays that passed through the Lord Chamberlain's Office from 1852 to 1863, revealing a unique picture of interconnections between themes, theatres and playwrights as well as key information on authors, <b>commissioning</b> <b>managers,</b> dates and the licensing process. The Victorian Plays Project, based at Worcester University, allows free, public access to over 360 printed Acting Editions published by T. H. Lacy from 1847 to 1875, providing searchable materials to encourage research and future performances. Whilst the Lord Chamberlain's Plays form a unique, near complete collection of manuscripts for the professional theatre, the material for the Victorian Plays Project illustrates the resulting industry in publishing playscripts for practical use by provincial and amateur companies. Tracing the differences and areas of convergence, the two projects form an impression of a neglected cultural milieu, articulating the challenge of cataloguing and digitising the performative text. They also demonstrate the extent and flexibility of their output in terms of genre, revealing important links between in-house authors, theatres and publishing houses. What becomes clear through the 'unearthing', collation and identification of these materials is that it is only as they become more accessible that we can begin to challenge the long-held assumptions about Victorian drama and explore the complex interconnections between remediated cultural forms and frames of reference...|$|R
