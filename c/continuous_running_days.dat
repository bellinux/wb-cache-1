40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} polydioxanon absorbable suture for tracheal anastomoses, we performed an experimental study using dose. Eight adult mongrel dogs underwent sleeve resection of the mediastinal trachea. A length of ten to twelve cartilage rings was resected. An end-to-end anastomosis was performed using either interrupted or <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> 4 - 0 polydioxanone (PDS) suture. There was no detectable difference bronchoscopically, microangiografically, or histologically, in tracheal anastomotic healing between interrupted suture and <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> suture. The inflammatory tissue response was mild and disappeared 3 weeks after surgery. The breaking strength, however, was greater in dogs in which interrupted sutures were used than in those with a <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> sutures. We conclude that PDS is a useful suture material for tracheal anastomoses and that interrupted sutures are stronger and possibly safer than a <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> suture for end-to-end anastomosis following sleeve resection of the trachea...|$|R

40|$|Background: In healthy teenagers, {{obesity and}} {{physical}} inactivity {{are the two}} main factors that affect respiratory function. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise training on improving lung function in overweight and obese students. Materials and Methods: Thirty overweight or obese subjects with poor endurance performance and mild deterioration of respiratory indices (forced expiratory volume and forced expiratory volume in 1 second < 90 % predicted) were randomly assigned into control (age: 16. 6 ± 0. 83 years, height: 167 ± 5. 05 cm, weight: 80. 44 ± 7. 65 kg) and intervention groups (age: 16. 5 ± 0. 83 years, height: 166 ± 6. 7 cm, weight: 79. 62 ± 9. 33 kg). The intervention group preformed 24 weeks of <b>continuous</b> treadmill <b>running</b> (3 <b>days</b> a week). Respiratory indices were measured pre, mid and post exercise. Independent t test, paired t test, Pearson's correlation test and repeated measure were used for analyzing the data. Results: In the intervention group, post exercise respiratory indices were significantly higher than the pre exercise values, and did not reach the predicted values. No significant differences were found in pre, mid and post exercise respiratory indices in the control group. In the intervention group, improvements in respiratory indices were positively correlated with maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) improvement but not with BMI reduction. No significant differences were detected between the 2 groups in terms of pre, mid and post exercise measures of BMI, weight, height, and respiratory indices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:The {{purpose of}} the study was to find out the effects of {{interval}} continuous and alternate pace running on cardio respiratory endurance. To achieve this purpose, sixty men students in the department of physical Education and sports sciences, Annamalai university, Tamilnadu, India were selected as subjects at random. The selected subjects were divided into four equal groups of fifteen subjects each, such as interval <b>running</b> group, <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> group, alternate pace running group and control group. The group I underwent interval training programme, Group II underwent <b>continuous</b> <b>running</b> programme and group III underwent alternate pace <b>running</b> for three <b>days</b> per week for twelve weeks. Group 1 V acted as control group which did not participate any special training programmes apart from their regular physical education activities as per their curriculum. The age groups of the subjects were ranged from 18 to 24 years. Cardio respiratory endurance was selected as criterion variable and measured through Cooper’s 12 minutes run and walk test. All the subjects of four groups were tested on selected criterion variables at prior to and immediately training programme. The analysis of covariance revealed a significant adjusted post test mean (F = 113. 63, p < 0. 05). It is concluded that cardio respiratory fitness improved better in continuous method than interval and alternate pace method...|$|R
