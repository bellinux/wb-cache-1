40|$|Abstract. In image {{authentication}} watermarking, hidden data {{is inserted}} into an image to detect any accidental or malicious image alteration. In the literature, quite {{a small number}} of cryptography-based secure authentication methods are available for binary images. This paper proposes a new authentication watermarking method for binary images. It can detect any visually significant alteration while maintaining good visual quality for virtually all types of binary images (possibly excluding dispersed-dot halftones). As usual, the security of the algorithm lies only on the secrecy of a secret- or private-key. This paper also presents a variation of the proposed scheme that can locate the modified region with good spatial resolution. A possible application of the proposed technique is in Internet fax transmission, i. e. <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> <b>authentication</b> of documents routed outside the phone network. ...|$|R

Method: The <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> Police, <b>Legal</b> Aid, Children’s Court, Juvenile Justice YJC administration and Juvenile Justice administration of court orders were separately estimated using a combination of top-down and bottom-up costing methods. These were combined with data from matched samples of young people who were to be dealt with by a YJC and young people who could have been dealt with by a YJC but instead were dealt with in the Children’s Court in 2007 in order to estimate average <b>costs</b> per person <b>for</b> each process. Results: The average cost of a YJC was estimated to be about 18 per cent less than the average cost of a comparable matter dealt with in the Children’s Court. This result was robust under variation of most assumptions (or combinations of assumptions). However, if marginal <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> the Children’s Court and <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> administering Children’s Court orders are low, then it may be more efficient to deal with an additional young person by court rather than by YJC. Conclusion: When viewed in totality, the YJC scheme is more cost-effective than the Children’s Court...|$|R

40|$|Property {{rights are}} an {{important}} political and economic issue in Russia. A weak property rights system is a significant hindrance for economic growth and transition in Russia. This report aims at showing that the problems in creating a new property rights system are institutional. Formal rules are complicated and blurred, {{because of the lack}} of consensus in society. Informal institutions prevail and, in spite of the privatization of enterprises, the same elite as before benefits. The privatization of enterprises made managers the owners of former state enterprises and enabled them to keep things going in the same manner as before. The relations of the new economic elite with the governmental sector maintained monopolistic markets. Financial markets are still weak and because of the bank crisis of 1998, banks become bankrupt and the markets change into an even more monopolistic direction. The government can choose who stays in business. Restructuring has not occurred even in spite of the economic boom caused by oil prices and devaluation. It will take a long time before Russia gets rid of the virtual economy with artificial prices and barter trade. Transaction <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>legal</b> trade are too high and keeps the gray market going as well. Land and natural resources are still mainly state property. The land reform, which started with agrarian reform, made land transferable. Enterprises can buy land and family farms are a legally available form of agricultural production. However, the agrarian reform did not transform the Russian countryside to become more productive. There is no proper infrastructure for family farms and the state supports joint stock companies, which are the former state or collective farms. There are regional differences depending on the interests and opinions of regional authorities. The obstacle for building a uniform system of land law is legislative chaos. In the absence of political consensus a new federal land code has not been passed. Regional legislation differs from region to region. There is still a battle going on between the regional and the federal levels on the ownership of natural resources. Even if reorganization is going on, the state management of natural resources has remained quite unchanged. Forest management is the best example of maintaining the old institutions in spite of the privatization of forest enterprises...|$|R
