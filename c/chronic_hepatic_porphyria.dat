40|$|Dedicated to Professor Claude Rimington {{in honour of}} his 90 th {{birthday}} Summary: The urinary {{distribution and}} relative proportions of the four Coproporphyrin isomers I—IV were investigated in 50 patients suffering from hepatic and erythropoietic types of hereditary porphyrias. A highly efficient sample preparation method was applied to isolate urinary coproporphyrins, the isomer ratios of which were quantitated by isocratic ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography. Results showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 001) of the proportion of Coproporphyrin I in acute hepatic porphyria (acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, porphobilinogen synthase deficiency porphyria) as compared with <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (porphyria cutanea tarda, <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> type B and C) (13. 2 ± 5. 3 %, χ ± S. D., vs. 31. 4 ± 11. 5 %). Conversely, the proportion of isomer III was significantly higher (p < 0. 001) in acute hepatic porphyria than in <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> (80. 9 + 5. 2 % vs. 62. 2 + 10. 9 %). As expected, {{the highest level of}} Coproporphyrin I (90. 0 ± 1. 9 %) was found in congenital erythropoietic porphyria. The atypical coproporphyrins II and IV were detected in all types of porphyria analysed and ranged from 0. 2 to 9. 0 %; no significant differences were seen between acute and chronic hepatic porphyrias. The diagnostic importance of the isomer ratios of coproporphyrins I and III has been confirmed in our study, while th...|$|E

Disorders of normal heme synthesis may cause human diseases, including certain anemias (X-linked sideroblastic anemias) and porphyrias. Porphyrias are classified as <b>hepatic</b> and erythropoietic <b>porphyrias</b> based on the organ system in which heme precursors (5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen and porphyrins) are chiefly overproduced. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> are further subdivided into acute <b>porphyrias</b> and <b>chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias.</b> The acute porphyrias include acute intermittent, hereditary copro-, variegate and ALA dehydratase deficiency <b>porphyria.</b> <b>Chronic</b> <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> include porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria.

40|$|Most {{patients}} with <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms, including abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, confusion, insomnia and mental disturbances such as anxiety and depression. Although heme deficiency and accumulation of heme precursors {{are thought to}} be responsible for neuropsychiatric manifestations in {{patients with}} acute porphyria, the pathogenetic mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we observed psychiatric behaviors in mice with <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> induced by the ingestion of a griseofulvin (GF) -containing diet over a period of 12 weeks. GF ingestion by the mice caused an accumulation of porphyrins in the feces and a decrease in heme in the liver; these effects were observed throughout the entire duration of the experiment, with maximum levels observed after circa 1 week of ingestion of this diet. In addition, the mice developed enlargement of the liver, hepatocyte injury, and cholestasis. Mice with <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> manifested an anxiety-like behavior by the long-term treatment (over 5 weeks) in a GF-dose and duration dependent manner. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> mice also manifested depression-like behaviors by the short-term treatment (3 weeks) of GF 2. 0, which was reversed by administration of anti-depressant, imipramine. In conclusion, this study for the first time demonstrated psychiatric manifestations in GF-induced <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria</b> mice.

This inhibition of the enzyme activity in liver was reflected in concurrent decreases in urinary excretion ofALA and porphobilinogen (PBG). The increased urinary excretion of ALA and PBG observed following AIA treatment was reduced by the lowest dose of Sn-protoporphyrin (1 gmol/kg body wt) and abolished completely by the higher doses of the metallo-porphyrin (10 and 50 gmol/kg body wt).

40|$|INVITED REVIEW ABSTRACT: The <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> are a {{group of}} rare {{metabolic}} disor-ders characterized by enzymatic defects in the biosynthesis of heme, a metalloporphyrin that is the principal product of porphyrin metabolism. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> are genetically transmitted as autosomal-dominant dis-orders with variable expression that produce a particularly severe form of neuropathy. Most medical students readily recognize acute attacks of por-phyria when the classic triad of abdominal pain, psychosis, and neuropathy is present. Yet, porphyric neuropathy {{is a source of}} confusion in practice, and patients with porphyria rarely receive the correct diagnosis early {{in the course of the}} illness. Porphyric neuropathy is manifest by symptoms, signs, and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities resembling acute Guillain–Barre ́ syn-drome. However, accompanying psychological features, a proximal predi-lection of asymmetric weakness, and electrodiagnostic findings indicative of an axonal polyradiculopathy or neuronopathy all suggest the diagnosis of porphyria. Confirmation of the diagnosis depends on use of appropriate laboratory studies. The underlying pathophysiology of porphyric neuropathy has not been established, but it may be related to direct neurotoxicity of elevated levels of -aminolevulinic acid. The severity of the neuropathy and the availability of potential treatments, including avoidance of provocative factors, make identification important...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms {{that cause}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an {{invariably}} fatal neurodegenerative disease, are unknown. Important recent {{data indicate that}} neuronal heme deficiency may contribute to AD pathogenesis. If true, {{factors that contribute to}} the intracellular heme deficiency could potentially alter the course of AD. The porphyrias are metabolic disorders characterized by enzyme deficiencies in the heme biosynthetic pathway. We hypothesize that AD may differ significantly in individuals possessing the genetic trait for an acute <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyria.</b> We elaborate on this hypothesis and briefly review the characteristics of the acute <b>hepatic</b> <b>porphyrias</b> that may be relevant to AD. We note the proximity of genes encoding enzymes of the heme biosynthesis pathway to genetic loci linked to sporadic, late-onset AD. In addition, we suggest that identification of individuals carrying the genetic trait for acute porphyria may provide a unique resource for investigating AD pathogenesis and inform treatment and management decisions.
