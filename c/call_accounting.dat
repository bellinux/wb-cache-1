Extension to {{extension}} calls can be made and kept within the company for cost or security reasons. Extensions make it easier for workers to bring their telephone number with them if they change offices in the building. Extensions allow personalized traffic and <b>call</b> <b>accounting</b> data to be captured by the PBX or a phone recorder for cost control. A hotel or motel, for example, could install PBX extensions in each individual room and use the private branch exchange's <b>call</b> <b>accounting</b> to generate individualised long-distance bills for each room which are presented to the guest upon check-out.|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{debates about}} the nature of proper names have been about whether we should treat them as devices of {{reference}} or as disguised definite descriptions. More recently, however, the debate centers around treating them as devices of reference or as predicates. There are different views {{about the nature of}} name-predicates. At least one version of predicativism relies on analyzing name-predicates as involving the concept of being called by a name – <b>calling</b> <b>accounts.</b> Some have offered meta-linguistic <b>calling</b> <b>accounts</b> of the nature of such predicates, but such accounts are subject to criticism on the grounds of failing to be informative. An alternative <b>calling</b> <b>account,</b> the attributive account, most fully developed by Fara, does not fall prey to this objection, on the face of it. However, {{it is not clear that}} it is informative in any substantive sense. It also rests on a mistaken conception of the nature of meta-linguistic actions that itself suggests another way to understand proper names...|$|R

50|$|Route {{accounting}} software functionality {{can be accessed}} as an online software service. Software services are typically hosted by the software vendor themselves. SaaS providers often include optional levels of systems monitoring, management, and analysis services atop the route {{accounting software}} itself. SaaS solutions (also sometimes called managed service solutions or application service provider (ASP) solutions) generally provide greater operational simplicity while actually providing more software capability and greater return on investment. Like the hosted enterprise route accounting solutions, managed service providers eliminate distributed route accounting systems and with them the related management and attention required to keep multiple distributed systems operating, refreshed, and current. Like enterprise <b>call</b> <b>accounting</b> software above, SaaS is easily justified if you {{compare it to the}} total lifecycle cost of ownership for the distributed technology.|$|E

There are many applications of the Internet that require the creation and management of a session, where a session is considered an exchange of data between associations of participants. The implementation of these applications {{is complicated by the}} practices of participants. Numerous protocols have been authored that carry various forms of real time multimedia session data such as voice, video, or text messages. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) works in concert with these protocols by enabling Internet endpoints (called user agents) to discover one another and to agree on a characterization of a session they would like to share. For locating prospective session participants, and for other functions, SIP enables the creation of an infrastructure of network hosts (called proxy servers) to which user agents can send registrations, invitations to sessions, and other requests. SIP is an agile, general purpose tool for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions that works independently of underlying transport protocols. SER is an open source project that aims to make available a fully functional and scalable Session Initiated Protocol server.
