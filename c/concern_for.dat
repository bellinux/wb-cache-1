40|$|<b>Concerns</b> <b>for</b> {{relative}} {{performance are}} {{integrated into a}} model of contractual renegotiation in bilateral trade. It is shown that <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance do never impede efficient trade. Moreover, conditional on renegotiation to occur, <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance tend to mitigate material rent expropriation. However, <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> relative performance make the occurrence of renegotiation more likely, and may thereby lead to underinvestment even in very optimistic environments. The analysis suggests {{an explanation for the}} occurrence of the Druzhba pipeline conflict between Russia and Belarus in January 2007.

5|$|An {{important}} <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> Barnes, when {{returning from}} the United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E
