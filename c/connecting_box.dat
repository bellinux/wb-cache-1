5000|$|Setting up {{a machine}} {{involved}} building a suitable network of linkages. According to one user, this {{was achieved by}} locating above the reading block, {{in contact with the}} tops of the matrix pins, a removable Y-shaped 'connection box' (equivalent to the Hollerith plug board) which was hard-wired [...] to the job. The box had at the base as many rods as were needed to read the positions within the used data fields, so that, when forced down, appropriate features of the machine - printheads, counters or control links were physically set as a reaction to the moving tops of the <b>connecting</b> <b>box</b> rods. Thus while many connection wires were straight-through, some sensed holes needed to allow multiple actuation, while some multiple code-punching needed to be combined to achieve a single purpose. Designing the system, including setting up the tabulator, was the sales engineers job, while soldering the 'conn-box' forest of cranked rods to meet the design requirement was down to the skill of the Powers Engineer who was thus the doyen of the machine room.|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{a series}} of <b>boxes</b> that are <b>connected</b> with each other is drawn with the first three boxes being single {{followed}} by two <b>connected</b> <b>boxes</b> and one single box, with the last two <b>boxes</b> <b>connected.</b> The <b>boxes</b> look like {{a series of}} three boxes stacked {{on top of each other}} (The Top Section), which is stacked on two boxes placed touching each other that are stacked on a single box (The Middle Section) which are stacked on the bottom section of two toucing boxes (The Bottom Section). The person to pass through each boxes through hopping and walking with eyes closed without touching the borders is the winner. There are different levels the player has to pass through in order to become the ultimate winner.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During search, most interval-based solvers perform {{splitting}} when {{no effective}} reduction can be made. Some connected regions may be undesirably split into small boxes. This makes {{the number of}} branches growing quickly, then impacts the overall performance. Regrouping <b>connected</b> <b>boxes</b> reduces the number of branches of the search tree, thus improves the overall performance. We propose to use clustering techniques based on the connectedness of boxes for the regrouping. This paper introduces new clustering algorithms, that fit {{in the context of}} search, and shows experimental results on numerical constraints. ...|$|R
