5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{electrical}} flaws, the Metroliners proved mechanically sound. Amtrak ordered over 600 non-powered Amfleet cars, {{based on}} the Metroliner design and also manufactured by Budd, in the mid-1970s. Beginning in 1987, Amtrak converted 23 former Metroliners for use as <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> cars on corridor trains. Fourteen more cars were used with minimal modifications - six as cab cars and 8 as trailer coaches. Most former Metroliners were scrapped between 2003 and 2011. However, some cab cars remain in use on Keystone Service and Shuttle trains. Three former Metroliners have also been converted to technology testing or track measurement cars, and one more is used by Amtrak as a special-purpose business car. One original Metroliner is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|The NTSB report {{concluded}} that the MARC crew apparently forgot the approach signal aspect of the Kensington color-position signal after making a flag stop at Kensington Station. The MARC train was operating in push mode with the <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> car out front. The Amtrak locomotives were in the crossover {{at the time of}} the collision; the MARC <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> car collided with the lead Amtrak unit, F40PH #255, rupturing its fuel tank and igniting the fire that caused most of the casualties. The second unit was a GE Genesis P40DC #811, a newer unit that has a fuel tank that is shielded in the center of the frame. The official investigation also suggests that the accident might have been prevented if a human-factors analysis had been conducted when modifications to the track signaling system were made in 1992 with the closing of nearby QN tower.|$|E

50|$|As of October 2016, Irish Rail {{are seeking}} {{solutions}} to re-power {{most of the}} fleet during a mid-life refurbishment. They are looking for floor-up engine and control gear solutions, which keep the existing <b>cab</b> <b>controls</b> and compatibility with the existing GM fleet and push/pull equipment. The body, <b>cab</b> <b>controls,</b> bogies, and traction motors will remain unchanged. 201 and 205 have been brought in from storage for internal and external inspection, possibly in relation to this re-powering. The re-powering is due to begin in Q1 2017.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013 Amtrak California started {{receiving}} refurbished single-level cars {{to supplement}} their current fleet on the San Joaquins route to help with over-crowding issues. The 14 single-level Comet IB rail cars, purchased from NJ Transit, are painted in a heritage paint scheme. As well as a complete refurbishment of the interiors, the cars received a dark blue band over the windows with three colored [...] "disco stripes" [...] (in {{a nod to the}} car's history in New Jersey) by the doors. The stripes are in Amtrak California's colors of orange, blue and green. Caltrans also leased three Non-Powered Control Units (former F40PH locomotives turned into <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> and baggage cars) from Amtrak. These control cars are painted in a livery that matches the original color scheme of Caltrain's F40PH locomotives. The Non-Powered Control Units are painted silver with a blue and green stripe running from the nose and down the side. About two-thirds of the way back, the stripes turn up and swoop over the roof. The nose has red and white warning stripes.|$|E

50|$|There are two default {{methods of}} manual control: DCC mode, which simulates the simple stop-and-go {{of a model}} railway, and Cabin mode (CAB), which simulates {{real-world}} physics and working <b>cab</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>controls</b> {{can either}} be {{operated}} by cable, air or electricity. Both cable and air controls, in a floor mounted lever configuration, offer additional benefits in controlling the load, by feathering the controls.|$|R
5000|$|Train driving {{simulation}} games usually allow a user {{to have a}} [...] "driver's view" [...] {{from the}} locomotive's cab and operate realistic <b>cab</b> <b>controls</b> such as throttle, brake valve, sand, horn and whistle, lights etc.|$|R

50|$|Consists on the San Joaquin, Capitol Corridor, and Pacific Surfliner routes usually include {{between four}} and six cars, with one {{locomotive}} and a <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> {{car on the}} rear end.|$|E
50|$|The service's {{rolling stock}} {{consisted}} of a rebuilt Vermont Railway GP38-2 and ten ex-Virginia Railway Express de-motored RDC cars. Two of these cars were outfitted with <b>cab</b> <b>control.</b> Fares were $1 for a one-way trip, collected on the honor system by being deposited in a box upon entering the train.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cab</b> <b>controls</b> {{were similar}} to those on No.42 except that a steam brake was {{provided}} in addition to the hand brake. The regulator handle was of the normal vertical type but later a long horizontal piece was secured to it, enabling it to be operated from either side.|$|R
25|$|UP 6900 Centennial series â€“ Several of {{the huge}} DDA40X {{diesel-electric}} locomotives have been saved. Other than 6936 that UP maintains in its heritage fleet, none of the remaining Centennials operate. However, 6930 at the Illinois Railway Museum has operating <b>cab</b> <b>controls,</b> allowing it to couple to another locomotive and control it.|$|R
50|$|TE10 {{locomotives}} have A-B-A or A-B-B-A unit configurations, {{which called}} 3TE10M, and 4TE10S respectively. B-unit of 3TE10 have reduced set of driving controls, intended for service {{movement of the}} locomotive. The last 3-unit TE10 rebuild called 3TE10MK, equipped with computer-aided <b>cab</b> <b>controls.</b> Most of these locomotives work on BAM rail line, located on Russian Far East.|$|R

50|$|The end cabs have airconditioning, and are heated using {{waste heat}} from the diesel engine cooling system; the cabins are {{isolated}} from frame vibrations by an air-suspension system. The <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> systems use electronic multifunction display, and joystick control. The trains are permanently coupled whilst in service, and can work in multiple forming consists of up to 630m (7 trains, 35 cars) - the inter-trainset coupling is via a Z-AK type automatic coupler, which includes electrical connections for power and data.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Hillside {{started work}} on {{rebuilding}} imported British Rail Mark 2 passenger cars {{for use in}} Auckland on commuter trains. The cars were stripped and rebuilt, {{for use in a}} push-pull consist, with a <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> car at one end (classed SD), with several standard cars (classed SA) in between and a diesel locomotive providing motive power at the other end (either a DC or DFT). A diesel generator which provides on board electrical power is fitted into a noise insulated compartment in each SD car. The SA/SD rebuilding project ended in 2010.|$|E
5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury bogie {{stock was}} {{converted}} into multiple units by fitting <b>cabs,</b> <b>control</b> equipment and motors. In 1910, two motor cars were modified with driving cabs at both ends. They started work on the Uxbridge-South Harrow shuttle service, being transferred to the Addison Road shuttle in 1918. From 1925 to 1934 these vehicles were used between Watford and Rickmansworth.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cab</b> had two <b>control</b> {{stands and}} since it was {{possible}} to start the six prime movers of three multiple-unit consisted locomotives from one engine <b>cab,</b> each <b>control</b> stand had six engine start buttons and six engine stop buttons. The electrical system was very complicated and unreliable, which eventually led to the locomotives being completely rewired in 1963.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{tractors}} {{have many}} electrical switches and levers in the <b>cab</b> for <b>controlling</b> {{the multitude of}} different functions available on the tractor.|$|R
50|$|Amtrak has {{a number}} of {{converted}} Metroliner EMUs in service as cab cars on the Keystone Corridor, where they operate in conjunction with ACS-64 electric locomotives. In addition, many regional services, such as the Michigan Services and Cascades, are operated with Non-Powered Control Units - EMD F40PH locomotives converted to use as a <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> and baggage car, earning itself the nickname 'cabbage cars'. Similarly, the Capitol Corridor, San Joaquin, and Pacific Surfliner services in California are operated in push-pull configuration using purpose-built cab cars and diesel locomotives.|$|E
50|$|Trains {{operated}} in push-pull mode. A typical consist in the 1980s was three-four coaches, {{the last of}} which was fitted for <b>cab</b> <b>control.</b> Motive power was provided {{by a pair of}} refurbished EMD F7A diesel-electric locomotives. The trains were painted in a brown-and-orange scheme. PAT owned ten ex-Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) coaches, all originally built by Pullman-Standard. When service ended in 1989 the equipment was sold to the Connecticut Department of Transportation to bootstrap the new Shore Line East service. At times Budd Rail Diesel Cars were used instead.|$|E
5000|$|The {{motive power}} for the Piedmont has been {{provided}} by eight state-owned locomotives. Two are EMD F59PHIs, numbered 1755 (City of Salisbury) and 1797 (City of Asheville). Six are EMD F59PHs, numbered 1810 (City of Greensboro), 1859 (City of High Point), 1869 (City of Durham), 1871 (Town of Cary), 1893 (City of Burlington), and 1984 (City of Kannapolis). NCDOT has also had two of five planned <b>Cab</b> <b>control</b> units delivered which are numbered 101 and 102. NCDOT's current F59PHs were originally used by GO Transit of Toronto, Ontario, Canada and rebuilt by American Motive Power and Altoona Works.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} cab {{and electrical}} cabinet were replaced with new EMD SD70ACe style isolated <b>cab</b> AAR-style <b>control</b> stand, and electrical cabinet with Mitsubishi electronics.|$|R
5000|$|Driving {{cars are}} similar to a cab car, {{containing}} a driver's <b>cab</b> for <b>controlling</b> the train. An EMU will usually have two driving cars at its outer ends.|$|R
50|$|The SW6-class were {{introduced}} in 1939 and were followed by the W6-class which were produced between 1951 and 1955, 150 were built in total. At their introduction, W6-class trams were popular with passengers and crew alike for being fast, smooth and comfortable. The <b>cab</b> <b>controls</b> {{are the same as}} of other W-class trams. The first 40 had flip-over wooden seats in the end saloons, the remainder having upholstered bus seats. All had wooden seats in the centre saloon until the 1970s when the entire class was refurbished with upholstered seats throughout.|$|R
50|$|Like many early systems a {{mechanical}} train stop does not inherently control speed. There were accidents where trains had overrun the overlap due to excessive speed. In order to externally control {{the speed of}} a train the operation of timed train stops has been deployed as it is widely used on the New York City Subway, where a second trip arm at a distance is folded down only a few seconds after a train has passed a check point. These expensive speed control systems are generally phased out in favour of a <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> computer that can continuously check a braking curve while approaching a signal.|$|E
50|$|Regularly {{scheduled}} {{service on the}} Atlantic City Line consists mainly of ex-Penn Central GP40PH-2A/2B diesel locomotives, and sometimes PL42AC diesel locomotives bought from Alstom, pushing or pulling primarily a three- to four-car Comet train, although other rolling stock is also used on the line. When Amtrak had regular service on this line, power was provided by now-retired F40PH locomotives, with a Metroliner cab car on the opposite end to provide push-pull operation. All trains run with the locomotive on the west end and the <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> car on the east end to facilitate boarding and reduce diesel noise and exhaust issues at the Atlantic City Terminal.|$|E
50|$|In 1997 and 1998, the LIRR {{received}} 134 double-decker C3 {{passenger cars}} from Kawasaki, including 23 <b>cab</b> <b>control</b> cars, and 46 General Motors Electro-Motive Division diesel-electric locomotives (23 diesel DE30ACs and 23 dual-mode DM30ACs) to pull them, allowing trains from non-electric territory to access Penn Station {{for the first}} time in many years, due to the prohibition on diesel operation in the East River Tunnels leading to Penn Station. They were also the first trains with computerized voices (complete with LED sign displays) announcing stations along the routes. However, over the years of service the automated announcements and LED displays usually do not work, consequently enabling the conductors to announce the stations, as complaints from many riders.|$|E
