50|$|The Selkirk {{locomotives}} were 36 steam locomotives of the 2-10-4 wheel arrangement {{built for}} the Canadian Pacific Railway by Montreal Locomotive Works in Montreal. The first of these large engines with 2-10-4 wheel arrangement were built in July 1929. A total of twenty were constructed {{before the end of}} the year, bearing numbers 5900 to 5919. The Canadian Pacific Railway's classification was T1a. These locomotives weighed 375 short tons (340 t) fully loaded. They were the largest and most powerful non-articulated locomotives in the British Empire. The CPR also put on a <b>crack</b> <b>train</b> in the 1920s—the Trans-Canada Limited. it was popular with Americans, as it was fast and it served alcohol (then illegal in the US).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} neural networks for rotor cracks detection. The basic working principles of neural networks are presented.

Built for high-speed passenger train work, the Hudson locomotives were famously known for hauling the New York Central's <b>crack</b> passenger <b>trains,</b> such as the 20th Century Limited and the Empire State Express.

50|$|As the new AEM-7 {{locomotives}} {{continued to}} arrive, Amtrak assigned them to haul <b>crack</b> Metroliner <b>trains</b> with Amfleet consists and reassigned the less-reliable Metroliners for the secondary Philadelphia-Harrisburg service, calling them Capitoliners. On October 25, 1981, {{the service was}} rebranded as Keystone Service. All service was then operated by the Metroliners, which lacked the quick acceleration of the Silverliners and Arrows and made them unsuitable for the service. After a single Metroliner set was withdrawn from Clocker service in March 1982, the Keystone Service was the only remaining use of the Metroliners. On April 24, 1983, a pair of weekday trains - the 9:54am arrival and 3:55pm departure from Suburban Station - were renamed Keystone Executive.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{is on the}} {{interaction}} of residual stresses and fatigue cracks in welded steel plates. A longitudinal dummy weld was used to create high tensile residual stresses in axial loading direction. The fatigue <b>crack</b> was <b>trained</b> to start at an artificial notch and propagated through a field of high tensile residual stresses. The fatigue crack propagation {{as well as the}} re-distribution of residual stresses were studied in detail by combined experimental methods. The mean stress was varied as well as the residual stress state of the samples used. Samples were tested as-welded as well as stress-relieved at R = (σmin/σmax)  =  0, R = - 1 and R = - 3. The materials used were a typical fine grained construction steel S 355 J 2 +N as well as a high strength quenched and tempered steel S 960 QL. It is shown how residual stress are degraded and in which way moderate residual stresses affect the fatigue strength of welded steel plates. The combined effect of residual stresses and load mean stresses is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{events of}} the {{revolution}} demonstrated that the Beiyang Army, which formed {{the core of the}} 36-division New Army, was absolutely the dominant military force within China. Controlling the fragmented loyalties of its formations was the key to political power in post-1911 China. The insurrection that actually set off the 1911 Revolution took place in Wuchang on 10 October. Four days later, the Qing court organized the New Armies in the north, and particularly the Beiyang Army, into three forces: the First Army, which would be sent to fight at Wuchang under the command of Army Minister Yinchang, the Second Army, which would act as a reserve force and would be sent to the front as needed, under the command of Feng Guozhang, and the Third Army, which would defend the capital, under Zaitao. The First and Second armies consisted of about 25,000 men each, or two divisions. The First included elements from the second, fourth, sixth divisions of the Beiyang army, which were the Qing government's <b>crack</b> troops, <b>trained</b> by Yuan Shikai.|$|R

40|$|Aircraft visual {{inspection}} is often augmented by non-destructive evaluation methods and tools. This research explores one such tool, the eddyscope, {{which is used}} to identify structural defects, corrosion, cracks in bolt holes, and sub-surface <b>cracks.</b> Current <b>training</b> on this piece of equipment involves shadowing an expert during the inspection process; however, this on-the-job training is expensive, time-consuming, and dependent on the expertise and performance of the inspector. A computer-aided eddyscope training and simulation tool is proposed as a solution. To investigate this possibility, the study reported here used a hierarchical task analysis of an eddy current inspection using interviews with technicians, shadowing of Level III technicians, video and audio recordings, and a documentation review; in addition, the think-aloud protocol was used during the inspection of an aircraft for surface flaws. The results identified 11 best practices, focusing on how to calibrate, position, hold, and scan with the eddyscope as well as physical and environmental considerations such as temperature, the use of Teflon tape to minimize wear and reduce probe noise, and the use of nonmetallic guides and templates to reduce the edge effect. These results will serve as a base line for developing a virtual eddyscope training tool...|$|R

The Milwaukee called them Baltic, following the European practice started in France. The initial order of fourteen Class F6 locomotives was followed by eight more Class F6a locomotives in 1931 and, in 1938, the Milwaukee acquired six streamlined Class F7 Baltics with the shrouds.
