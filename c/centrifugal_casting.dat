40|$|The FeAl-based {{intermetallic}} alloys are {{of great}} interest because of their low density, low raw material cost, and excellent resistance to high-temperature oxidation, sulfidation, carburization, and molten salts. The applications based on these unique properties of FeAl require methods to melt and cast these alloys into complex-shaped castings and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>cast</b> tubes. This paper addresses the melting-related issues {{and the effect of}} chemistry on the microstructure and hardness of castings. It is concluded that the use of the Exo-Melt{trademark} process for melting and the proper selection of the aluminum melt stock can result in porosity-free castings. The FeAl alloys can be melted and cast from the virgin and revert stock. A large variation in carbon content of the alloys is possible before the precipitation of graphite flakes occurs. Titanium is a very potent addition to refine the grain size of castings. A range of complex sand castings and two different sizes of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>cast</b> tubes of the alloy have already been cast...|$|R
40|$|During the <b>centrifugal</b> {{continuous}} <b>casting</b> process, unreasonable casting parameters {{can cause}} violent level fluctuation, serious gas entrainment, and formation of frozen shell pieces at the meniscus. Thus, {{in the current}} study, a three-dimensional multiphase turbulent model was established to study the transport phenomena during <b>centrifugal</b> continuous <b>casting</b> process. The effects of nozzle position, casting and rotational speed on the flow pattern, centrifugal force acting on the molten steel, level fluctuation, gas entrainment, shear stress on mold wall, and motion of inclusions during <b>centrifugal</b> continuous <b>casting</b> process were investigated. Volume of Fluid model was used to simulate the molten steel-air two-phase. The level fluctuation and the gas entrainment during casting were calculated by user-developed subroutines. The trajectory of inclusions in the rotating system was calculated using the Lagrangian approach. The results show that during <b>centrifugal</b> continuous <b>casting,</b> {{a large amount of}} gas was entrained into the molten steel, and broken into bubbles of various sizes. The greater the distance to the mold wall, the smaller the centrifugal force. Rotation speed had the most important influence on the centrifugal force distribution at the side region. Angular moving angle of the nozzle with 8 ° and keeping the rotation speed with 60 revolutions per minute can somehow stabilize the level fluctuation. The increase of angular angle of nozzle from 8 to 18 deg and rotation speed from 40 to 80 revolutions per minute favored to decrease the total volume of entrained bubbles, while the increase of distance of nozzle moving left and casting speed had reverse effects. The trajectories of inclusions in the mold were irregular, and then rotated along the strand length. After penetrating a certain distance, the inclusions gradually moved to the center of billet and gathered there. More work, such as the heat transfer, the solidification, and the inclusions entrapment during <b>centrifugal</b> continuous <b>casting,</b> will be performed...|$|R

This paper offers developers ideas on how to enhance product and processes. For several years now the small wind industry has been expected to reach a tipping point with an increase in sales volume and a drop in production costs. This assumption is being analyzed in this paper and further saving potentials in small wind turbine production costs are outlined. Based on small wind market reports in several countries a global market analysis for small {{wind turbines}} in the range of 1 kW to 5 kW has been performed. From the findings a relevant set of manufacturers have been selected to study manufacturing methods and development trends. The learning curve model was applied to three manufacturers.

40|$|Testing of the {{susceptibility}} towards hydrogen {{induced stress}} cracking (HISC) for five 25 %Cr super duplex stainless steels (SDSS) under cathodic protection (CP) in seawater has been conducted. The materials were from pipes produced through different production methods; hot extrusion {{with and without}} subsequent cold drawing, manufactured from a forged bar and centrifugally cast. The testing {{was carried out in}} cortest proof rings on three test specimens pre-charged with hydrogen and one reference specimen without hydrogen until fracture occurred. Hydrogen measurements were conducted and the fracture surfaces were examined in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the embrittlement through thickness was indexed. The possibility of secondary cracking was also investigated using the SEM. In addition, the microstructures were examined using optical microscopy (OM) and assessed compared to the HISC testing results. The austenite spacing was also measured. The hydrogen measurements together with the presence of secondary cracking of all test materials confirmed HISC being the fracture mechanism. The test results indicated that all SDSS materials tested are susceptible to HISC, and that the hot extruded material with no cold deformation has a higher HISC resistance while centrifugally cast materials are more prone to HISC than the other production methods. The fracture surfaces of all hydrogen charged test materials showed features indicating a reduction in ductility due to HISC as well as both ductile and brittle fracture characteristics across the surfaces. The placement of the ductile and brittle features varied, and both could be found close to the centre and edges of the fracture surfaces. The fracture surfaces for the reference specimens showed mostly ductile fracture characteristics. The results from the HISC testing were discussed compared to available literature on the subject of HISC in SDSS, and the susceptibility of the materials from the different materials towards HISC were ranked from lowest to highest based on the overall test performance and measurements conducted. The ranking of production methods is as follows: hot extruded pipes > hot extruded pipes with subsequent cold drawing > forginged pipes > <b>centrifugal</b> <b>cast</b> pipes...|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the drop-forged crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>cast</b> metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|R
