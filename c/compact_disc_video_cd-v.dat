40|$|The {{main goal}} of our {{research}} was to establish {{the extent to which}} recordings on magnetic tapes and optical discs were incorporated into library materials offered by public libraries, which are located {{in the area of the}} municipal community of Ljubljana. Using the statistical summary books, issued by public libraries, we gathered and analysed the accretion, stocks and borrowing figures of monographic publications,audio cassettes, <b>compact</b> <b>discs,</b> <b>video</b> cassettes and CD-ROMs. The findings show that monographic publications are still the fundamental material of public libraries. Among audio-visual media, video cassettes represent the most extensive collection, followed in number by <b>compact</b> <b>discs,</b> audio cassettes and finally CD-ROMs. The results of the analysis of borrowed library material are totally consistent with the above stated order.

5000|$|Nearly all of {{the music}} sold in Indonesia today {{is in the form}} of {{pre-recorded}} cassettes, but music is also available on <b>compact</b> <b>disc,</b> <b>video</b> <b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> (VCD). and laser disc (LD). The latter two formats contain images as well as sounds, and are mainly used to accompany karaoke performance. While the traditional, court-derived styles of gamelan and wayang kulit have been frequently recorded, sales of popular music in Indonesia have increased dramatically with the emergence of the cassette tape. Centered in Jakarta, Indonesia's music industry defines popular music as either [...] "national" [...] or [...] "regional." [...] National genres, including Pop sunda, kroncong, dangdut, qasidah modern, rock, rap, country, jazz, disco, house and Hawaiian, generally feature lyrics in Indonesian (though sometimes in English) and are marketed mainly in the urban regions throughout the archipelago, both as audio cassettes and <b>compact</b> <b>discs.</b> Sales trends, both regionally and nationally, are shifting towards popular music, which, in contrast to the field recordings of regional styles, is almost entirely a product of recording studios. In financial terms, the present day music industry in Indonesia is small by world standards, but it is the largest in Southeast Asia. Although cassette tapes are still sold in large quantities, since 1997 these have been replaced more and more by VCDs. Audio CDs have never been big sellers, as their price is relatively high.|$|R

40|$|Why {{consumers}} shop via the Internet, is a {{frequently asked}} question. As yet, {{the impact of}} spatial variables on e-shopping has received little attention. In this paper we report our investigation of the spatial distribution of Internet users and online buyers in the Netherlands for the time period 1996 – 2001 {{and the impact of}} spatial variables (residential environment and shop accessibility) on e-shopping. Two hypotheses are tested empirically. The first is that e-shopping is a predominantly urban phenomenon, because new technology usually starts in centres of innovation (innovation-diffusion hypothesis). The second is that {{people are more likely to}} adopt e-shopping when their accessibility to shops is relatively low (efficiency hypothesis). Our findings indicate that Internet use and online buying are still largely urban phenomena in the Netherlands, but that there is a trend towards diffusion to the weakly urbanised and rural areas. Not only the innovation diffusion hypothesis, but also the efficiency hypothesis is confirmed by our findings. People living in a (very) strongly urbanised area have a higher likelihood of buying online, but people with a low shop accessibility buy more often online. The analysis also shows that the support for the two hypotheses depends on the type of product. Airline tickets are still mainly bought in very strongly urbanised areas, whereas <b>compact</b> <b>discs,</b> <b>videos,</b> DVDs, and clothing are bought relatively more often in weakly urbanised areas. In conclusion, geography seems to matter for e-shopping. ...|$|R
40|$|Wide-band audio coding {{algorithms}} {{have become}} very popular due to emerging digital audio applications for network, wireless and multimedia computing systems. Digital storage of audio signals, which results in reduced size and higher quality is commonplace in <b>compact</b> <b>discs,</b> digital <b>video</b> <b>discs</b> and has became a standard in most of audio/video portable electronic devices. Current state-of-the-art coding systems are application-specific. Although, {{it is hard to}} objectively measure quality across available audio codecs, it can be safely claimed that there is no generic codec that performs sufficiently well for all potential applications under all channel conditions. The state of the art audio systems are developed as a combination of several coding techniques and codec modes to meet all requirements. Therefore, there is a strong requirement to encode all types of signal using the same analysis model. In this proposal, our objective is to develop a novel wideband generic speech/audio coding technique that will take advantage of long temporal contexts. Unlike conventional state-of-the-art systems based on short-term processin...|$|R
50|$|Standard CDs have a {{diameter}} of 120 mm and can hold up to 80 minutes of audio (700 MB of data). The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 mm; they are sometimes used for CD singles or device drivers, storing up to 24 minutes of audio. The technology was later adapted and expanded to include data storage CD-ROM, write-once audio and data storage CD-R, rewritable media CD-RW, Super Audio CD (SACD), <b>Video</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Discs</b> (VCD), Super <b>Video</b> <b>Compact</b> <b>Discs</b> (SVCD), PhotoCD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced CD.
