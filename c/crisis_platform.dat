40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the design of}} a social media <b>crisis</b> mapping <b>platform</b> for decision making in natural disasters where tweets are analysed to achieve situational awareness during earthquake and tsunami events. A qualitative end user evaluation is undertaken on our first prototype system to get feedback from practitioners working in the field of hazard detection and early warning. Participating in our evaluation is the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI) and the Portuguese Institute for the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA). We conclude that social media crisis mapping is seen as a valuable data source by control room engineers, with update rates of 10 - 60 seconds and false positive rates of 10 - 20 % (general public incident reports) needed. Filtering crisis maps and statistical reports by social media platform and user type is desirable as different report sources have different credibility and response times...|$|R

We present Fathom, a natural language interface powered by topic models to help crisis counselors on Crisis Text Line, a new 911 -like crisis hotline that takes calls via text mes-saging. We apply a mixed-initiative labeled LDA model to analyze counselor-caller conversations and use them to power real-time visualizations aimed at mitigating counselor cognitive load. We discuss three key aspects of crisis coun-seling and why topic models are suitable for mining this phenomenon.

40|$|All rights reserved. During {{times of}} <b>crisis</b> microblogging <b>platforms</b> such as Twitter have played an {{important}} role as a communication channel to distribute information. Particularly, disaster-related tweets are valuable resources when tagged with their location for detecting unexpected events. However, they often contain different types of location and one of the main challenges is resolving the ambiguity involved in their locations. The process of identifying phrase portions in unstructured texts with possible spatial aspects and disambiguating these references by linking them to geographic coordinates is known as Geotagging. In the context of crisis management, this paper presents OzCT geotagger that automatically detects the location(s) mentioned in the content of tweets with three possibilities: definite, ambiguous and no-location. It also semantically annotates the tweet components utilizing existing and new ontologies. The OzCT geotagger has been recently deployed in a trial system of the OzCrisisTracker application. Experiments demonstrate that the precision and recall for detection of the definite locations against geotagging by human judgement are on average of 80 %. We also conclude that the accuracy of geographical focus of the OzCT geotagger is considerably higher than other systems. While existing geocoding systems have lower coverage for suburb and street focus, our approach detects suburbs in more than 60 % situations...|$|R

40|$|A "mid-Carnian" {{transgressive}} succession, {{developed between}} the Breno carbonate platform and the semiarid coastal carbonates-sabkhas facies of the S. Giovanni Bianco Fm., is {{recorded in the}} northern Bergamasc Alps. This episode {{is characterized by the}} presence of two stratigraphic markers:  a) Dark grey shales and siltstones ("Black Pelites"), considered previously as the northern closure of the Gorno-Lower S. Giovanni Bianco Fms., but re-interpreted as the western pinch-out of the Lozio Shale depositional system. The Early Carnian Lozio Shale was deposited first in the Valle di Scalve-Lozio trough and later covered the carbonate platform (Breno Fm.). b) Fossiliferous, open subtidal limestones, marls and burrowed marly limestones ("Bioclastic Horizon") of the northern Bergamasc Alps. The spreading of shales and siltstones represents the first transgressive stage of the last Carnian sequence in Lombardy, after the "mid- Carnian" (Julian substage) regional carbonate <b>platform</b> <b>crisis</b> (top of the Valcamonica Breno Fm.). The "Bioclastic Horizon" records the mfs represented by normal, open marine facies, identified and correlated throughout the Bergamasc Alps. Different petrographic and chemical characters between the Lozio Shale - "Black Pelites" and the Gorno-San Giovanni Bianco Fms. suggest different source areas: the former units are characterized by clasts derived from a metamorphic-intrusive area (placed northward and westward), whereas the latter units are characterized by prevailing volcaniclastic material. A climatic change (from arid to relatively humid conditions) may be invoked to explain the crisis of the "mid-Carnian" carbonate platforms in the western Southern Alps and the regional spreading of fine-grained terrigenous material.  </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{ultimate}} goal of the FuturICT Flagship is to understand and manage complex, global, socially interactive systems, {{with a focus on}} sustainability and resilience. Revealing the hidden laws and processes underlying societies constitutes the most pressing scientific grand challenge of our century. Integrating the three components of ICT, Complexity Science and the Social Sciences will lead to a paradigm shift, facilitating a symbiotic co-evolution of ICT and society. Data from our complex globe-spanning ICT system will be leveraged to develop models of techno-socio-economic systems. In turn, insight from these models will inform {{the development of a new}} generation of socially adaptive, self-organised ICT systems. FuturICT as a whole will act as a Knowledge Accelerator, turning massive data into knowledge and technological progress. FuturICT will create the scientific methods and ICT platforms needed to address planetary-scale challenges and opportunities in the 21 st century. Specifically, FuturICT will build a sophisticated simulation, visualization and participation platform, known as the Living Earth Simulator. This platform will power Observatories, to detect and mitigate <b>crises,</b> and Participatory <b>Platforms,</b> to support decision-making for policy-makers and citizens. In the Coordination Action Pilot Study which is running from May 2011 -April 2012, activities will take place to develop the scientific vision and roadmap, secure stakeholder commitment, establish the FuturICT legal and operational infrastructure, and build on our remarkable success in uniting previously fragmented research communities. The main aim of the activities throughout the project will be to refine the FuturICT vision and identify measureable milestones along the way. This will produce an ambitious large-scale, science-driven, visionary research initiative to promote and develop future research outcomes in ICT. Through these activities, the Coordination Action will allow Europe to grasp this unique opportunity for groundbreaking progress in science and ICT, with great impacts for society, governance and industry by launching the FuturICT Flagship in 2013...|$|R
40|$|A Geospatial Analysis of the Relationship between Environmental Drivers and Vector-Borne Diseases. Human {{health is}} profoundly {{affected}} by weather and climate. Environmental health {{is becoming a}} major preoccupation on a world-wide scale; there is a close correlation between a population’s state {{of health and the}} quality of its environment, considering many infectious diseases are at least partly dependent on environmental factors. When we talk about the environment, we realize that it includes and affects fields of action from our daily life. Earth observation from space, with validation from in situ observations, provide a greater understanding of the environment and enable us to monitor and predict key environmental phenomena and events that can affect our livelihoods and health. Even thought, the use of Earth observation is growing in usefulness {{for a wide variety of}} uses, it is extremely unlikely that Earth Observation will be able to detect infectious diseases directly. Instead, Earth observation can be used to detect high NDVI index (and possibly attribute the high surface chlorophyll concentration to a particular disease), and help predict the movement of the agents carrying vector-borne disease. Many diseases need certain temperature and moisture conditions to breed. The primary objective of analyzing environmental health risk and vulnerabilities is to support the Development Regions to strengthen their capacity to assess, visualize and analyze health risks and incorporate the results of this analysis in a health risk map for disaster risk reduction, emergency preparedness and response plans. At the same time, such an analysis applied in health, allows starting the collection and homogenization of baseline data, information and maps to help health authorities and decision makers to take informed decisions in times of <b>crises.</b> Informational Health <b>Platform</b> would be used for the integration of data coming from different sources in order to assess, analyze and map vulnerabilities and risks, contributing to the continuity of the decision process during the different phases of the emergency cycle. Decision support tools are based on creating health vulnerability platforms, which can be used first of all to evaluate the environmental conditions and to predict the possible risk of a disease infection in a given location, including variables as population densities, socio-economic issues, health indicators, accessibility to health care, land cover type, soil moisture and surface temperature. The fundamental purpose of this work is to reveal the necessity of establishing a quality framework for arguing on the connection between the environment and vector-borne disease transmission, supposing that on any kind of forecasting it is established the extent to which the past is likely to be an accurate guide for the future...|$|R
40|$|During the Late Triassic, {{a climate}} change {{known as the}} Carnian Pluvial Event (CPE) {{resulted}} in a major crisis for carbonate producers. In the western Tethys, the change in carbonate production led to a dramatic modification of depositional geometries. The steep clinoforms of the high relief pre-crisis carbonate platforms were replaced by low angle ramp geometries. A quantitative three dimensional modeling of the geometry of sedimentary bodies in the Cortina d'Ampezzo area (North-eastern Italy) formed before, {{during and after the}} Carnian crisis, coupled with facies analysis, was performed in order to investigate in detail how the changes in shallow water carbonate precipitation influenced the depositional geometries of carbonate platforms. Facies and depositional geometries suggest that after the demise of high-relief, microbial dominated carbonate platforms, a phase of intermediate sedimentation took place, in which microbial carbonate mounds and loose carbonate and terrigenous sediments coexisted. The subsequent evolution to a ramp is characterized by the onset of a tide-dominated environment. In the study area, the sedimentary succession developed in a marine strait connecting two small basins. Both ebb and flood paleocurrents are documented and their directions are in agreement with the strait orientation, as inferred from the paleogeographic position of relict high-relief carbonate platforms. Facies and sedimentary structures related to variations in the hydraulic regime have been observed, including planar cross stratification, herringbone cross stratification, flaser to wavy to lenticular bedding and cyclical alternations of mainly oolitic-siliciclastic vs. mainly bioclastic-muddy laminae. The peculiarity of this tidal system is that, differently from all other known cases, it did not develop in a tectonically confined submarine graben or canyon, but in a marine passage between relict high-relief carbonate platforms. Sedimentary facies analysis, coupled with geological three dimensional modeling, led also to constrain the sequence stratigraphy of this complex stratigraphic interval, in which the eustatic and climatic signals can be disentangled. The climate change predates the sea-level drop and caused the demise of the microbial-dominated high-relief carbonate platforms. A surface similar to a drowning unconformity was thus generated, even though a transgression was not taking place. Only small isolated microbial carbonate mounds survived the <b>crisis</b> of high-relief <b>platforms.</b> The complete disappearance of microbial carbonates (i. e. mounds) and the definitive switch of the shallow water carbonates to loose-sediment dominated ramps coincides with a subsequent sea-level drop. Thus the demise of the Upper Triassic microbial dominated high-relief platforms of the Dolomites can be interpreted as a two step process: at first a climatic event killed the km-scale high-relief platforms; later a drop in sea level led to the definitive disappearance of the microbial carbonates...|$|R

From December 15th,2007 its official name is Green Party of Albania. This movement joined environmental groups and environmental clubs representing environmental civil society. This political movement was created to give the alarm to ecological crisis we are going through. Since its inception it took several concrete steps for awareness and sensitization of the population to respond to this crisis. [...] "The Greens" [...] developed a political platform which provides alternatives and ways to be followed to overcome this ecological <b>crisis.</b> This political <b>platform</b> should be discussed with a wider number of people across the country.

Through their [...] "Greens" [...] react to environmental degradation and pollution and sensibilities public. For the Green Party therefore undertook a series of concrete actions for awareness and sensitization of the population such as: seminars, workshops, environmental conferences, distribution of posters, leaflets, territory cleaning activities and waste reduction, etc.. This activity found wide support in different layers of the population. It fell very noticeable was the young student which occupied an important part in all events. Soon [...] "Greens" [...] decided to be part of the European Green family. This new initiative policy required a strong commitment to make this [...] "Green Movement" [...] in a genuine political institution based on the principles of the European Green Party. On 13 October 2008, the Green Party become full member of the Green Party Europe.

40|$|PhDThis study investigates how actions – {{especially}} {{narratives and}} claims – {{of civil society}} advocates influenced electricity generation planning and hydropower project implementation, {{in the context of}} a democratising authoritarian state. To pursue this research agenda, I use a critical realist philosophy of science to ground a conceptual framework whose fundamental components consist of institutions, interests, and discourses. The research presents three case studies from Thailand, a nation-state with distinct authoritarian legacies, as well as significant economic and political dynamism in the late 20 th century. The cases step from macro to micro levels of analysis: (1) Electricity generation planning: an overview and critique of the social construction of peak power demand and supply options in Thailand, 1960 s– 2004. I focus on the rise of energy conservation advocacy in the early 1990 s, and the rise of more confrontational energy activism in the late 1990 s; (2) Pak Mun Dam: contention between EGAT, anti-dam villagers, and other state and civil society actors, 1989 – 2003; (3) Pak Mun Dam: analysis of how knowledge discourses shaped debates over fisheries and local livelihoods in the lower Mun river basin, 1999 – 2004. I pursue these cases in the larger context of Thai state–society relations, 1932 –early 2000 s: from the Khana Ratsadorn (People’s Party) and its founders’ increasingly authoritarian struggles to shape the state; through to the rise of civil society in the Indochina-war era; through the emergence of parliamentary politics and NGO evolution in the 1980 s and early 1990 s; to the Thai Rak Thai “money politics” party that emerged in 1998. Specific research questions focus on patterns and outcomes of state–society interaction, the role of lay and expert knowledge discourses in structuring conflict, and plausible causal connections between outcomes and concepts used in the conceptual framework. The study is based on fieldwork conducted between 2001 and 2005, with 18 months of intensive work concentrated in 2002 and 2004. Recurrent procedures consisted of collecting policy narratives and arguments and re-constructing actors’ interests (including those of leaders in organizations) via participant observation, interviews, and textual analysis. The thesis argues that anti-dam advocates influenced project implementation practices at Pak Mun Dam by forming social change networks, gaining contingent recognition as new political actors. Through innovative and disruptive action, through claims for transparency and justice, through mass performances of worthiness, unity, and commitment, and through the production of local knowledge, they helped set agendas. They triggered elite intervention, as well as reactive counter-mobilization and occasional violence. The escalation of uncertainty from unintended outcomes challenged elites – aided by deliberative exchanges – to reconsider unfavourable decisions, to reconsider their preferences, and to make concessions. At the same time, a number of events made the Assembly of the Poor, the main anti-dam movement organization, vulnerable to destabilizing action at the local and national levels. These include: the formation of competitive organizations in the lower Mun basin; complex and intractable issues (such as multiple rounds of compensation); and inability to take credit for championing the interests of vulnerable small farmers. Destabilizing interactions occurred particularly in the restricted media space of the post-financial and economic <b>crisis</b> years. Populist <b>platforms</b> put forward by Thai Rak Thai and Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra pre-empted the AOP’s influence. Sustainable energy advocates influenced practices of power system planning by teaching new techniques of energy conservation, and diffusing new norms. In the recent period, however, as some of them engaged in more contentious interaction, such as intervening in conflicts over new coal and hydroelectric power plants (in southern Thailand and Laos respectively) they disrupted dominant rationalities, and found themselves confronting some of the same core practices of a power-wielding bureaucracy and an authoritarian state, namely rhetorical strategies that police the boundaries of policy-relevant knowledge. The thesis, intended to contribute to social science methodology and theory, concludes with a critical appraisal of the conceptual framework. I suggest new research agendas for analysts interested in mechanisms of civil society advocacy in the context of democratising states...|$|R
