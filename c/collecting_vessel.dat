40|$|Lymphatic vessels play an {{essential}} role in intestinal lipid uptake, and impairment of lymphatic vessel function leads to enhanced adipose tissue accumulation in patients with lymphedema and in genetic mouse models of lymphatic dysfunction. However, the effects of obesity on lymphatic function have been poorly studied. We investigated if and how adipose tissue accumulation influences lymphatic function. Using a lymphatic specific tracer, we performed in vivo near-infrared (NIR) imaging to assess the function of <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessels</b> in mice fed normal chow or high-fat diet (HFD). Histological and whole mount analyses were performed to investigate the morphological changes in initial and the <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessels.</b> HFD was associated with impaired <b>collecting</b> lymphatic <b>vessel</b> function, as evidenced by reduced frequency of contractions and diminished response to mechanostimulation.

5000|$|A Tullgren funnel, {{also known}} as Berlese funnel or Berlese trap, is an {{apparatus}} used to extract living organisms, particularly arthropods, from samples of soil. The Tullgren funnel works by creating a temperature gradient over the sample such that mobile organisms will {{move away from the}} higher temperatures and fall into a <b>collecting</b> <b>vessel,</b> where they perish and are preserved for examination. The illustration shows how it works: a funnel (E) contains the soil or litter (D), and a heat source (F) such as an electric lamp (G) heats the litter. Animals escaping from the desiccation of the litter descend through a filter (C) into a preservative liquid (A) in a receptacle (B). This illustration is merely a schematic, since usually the soil sample will not be crumbled and poured into the funnel (this would inevitably lead to a high amount of soil particles in the preservation fluid requiring laborious work to sort out the soil organisms). In fact, the soil sample is placed on a mesh sieve that will allow the soil animals to pass but should retain most of the soil particles.|$|E
40|$|SummaryTo induce {{adaptive}} immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) migrate through afferent lymphatic vessels (LVs) to draining {{lymph nodes}} (dLNs). This process occurs in several consecutive steps. Upon entry into lymphatic capillaries, DCs first actively crawl into downstream <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels.</b> From there, they are next passively and rapidly {{transported to the}} dLN by lymph flow. Here, we describe a role for the chemokine CCL 21 in intralymphatic DC crawling. Performing time-lapse imaging in murine skin, we found that blockade of CCL 21 —but not the absence of lymph flow—completely abolished DC migration from capillaries toward <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> and reduced the ability of intralymphatic DCs to emigrate from skin. Moreover, we found that in vitro low laminar flow established a CCL 21 gradient along lymphatic endothelial monolayers, thereby inducing downstream-directed DC migration.

40|$|Only {{topographic}} and distributional {{data are}} available on the lymphatic outflow vessels of the human heart. Here we describe their structural and ultrastructural features. Fragments of the atria, ventricles and fat surrounding the major coronary branches were obtained from hearts of dilated cardiomyopathy patients. Serial semithin sections were observed under light microscopy and used for tridimensional reconstructions. Ultrathin sections were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Precollectors, the initial lymphatic outflow routes of the heart, are small valved vessels with irregular, discontinuous musculature. They originate in the subepicardial region from a network of epicardial, and from scattered myocardial absorbing lymphatic vessels and drain into the <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> accompanying the major coronary branches. <b>Collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> are larger but structurally similar to precollectors. Wall musculature is independent {{of the size of the}} vessel. Their ultrastructure is the same as that of precollectors. Endothelial cells have many Weibel-Palade bodies, cytoplasmic filaments and focal adhesions. The basement membrane is discontinuous and anchoring filaments are frequent and conspicuous. The subendothelial layer contains much elastin. Human heart <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> and precollectors may only be distinguished by their size. The scarcity of musculature suggests that lymph progression in this district is mainly ensured by cardiac revolutions. Their ultrastructural features are determined by adaptation to dynamic forces.

40|$|Summary: Lymph is {{the minute}} net volume of contending {{hydrostatic}} and osmotic capillary forces. It is built up extravasculary in tissues and reaches the intravasal space by definite lymph <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels,</b> which enter the venous System at the angulus venosus {{at the root}} of the neck. Sampling methods for lymph from individual tissues or from lymph <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> of man and various animals afe cited and the preparation of lymph for enzymatic analysis is described. The extracellular distribution and transport of enzymes is important for diag-nostic enzymology, because enzymes released from cells in continuous physiological processes, or after injury to the tissue, reach the intravasal space mainly via the lymphatics. This is evident from the high lymph-plasma ratios of diagnostically important enzymes. The type of enzyme transport (lymphatic or by direct interstitial-venous entry) depends on the heterogeneity of the capillary barrier characteristic of the different organs. The permeability is extremely high in liver, i. e. enzymes in hepatic lymph originale mainly from blood, which they have reached through the large openings in the sinusoidal endothelial lining; in contrast the permeability is extremely low in skeletal muscle, where lymphatic transport therefore predominates. The phenömenon of increased enzyme activities in plasma after physical exertion is explained by alterations of lymph flow. A table gives a survey of enzyme activities, lymph-plasma quotients, and lymph flow from lymph vessels of various tissues äs well äs from the lymph <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> of man and animals, with comments on the significance fo...|$|R
50|$|Most hydroceles {{appearing}} {{in the first year}} of life seldom require treatment as they resolve without treatment. Hydroceles that persist after the first year or occur later in life require treatment through open operation for removing surgically, as these may have little tendency towards regression. Method of choice is open operation under general or spinal anesthesia, which is sufficient in adults. General anesthesia is the choice in children. Local infiltration anesthesia is not satisfactory because it cannot abolish abdominal pain due to traction on the spermatic cord. If a testicular tumor is suspected, a hydrocele must not be aspirated as malignant cells can be disseminated via the scrotal skin to its lymphatic field. This is excluded clinically by ultrasonography. If a tumor is not present, the hydrocele fluid can be aspirated with a needle and syringe. Clear straw-colored fluid contains mostly albumin and fibrinogen. If the fluid is allowed to drain in a <b>collecting</b> <b>vessel,</b> it does not clot but can be coagulated if small amounts of blood come in contact with the damaged tissue. In long standing cases, hydrocele fluid may be opalescent with cholesterol and may contain crystals of tyrosine and a palpable normal testis confirms the diagnosis; other wise surgical exploration of testis is needed.|$|E
5000|$|The Sumerian written {{language}} and the associated clay tablets are among the earliest human writings. Scholarly works from the early 1800s onward have developed some facility translating the various Sumerian documents. Among these is a poem with the English title, [...] "A hymn to Ninkasi". The poem {{is a recipe for}} brewing beer. It can be argued that the art of brewing is broken down and explained in order to be passed down from generation to generation. Furthermore, the Hymn to Ninkasi is the oldest record of a direct correlation between the importance of brewing, and the responsibility that women had with regard to supplying both bread and beer to the household. Ninkasi is female, and the fact that a female deity was invoked in prayer with regards to the production of brewed beverages illustrated the relationship between brewing and women as a domestic right and responsibility. The repetitive nature suggests that it was used as a tool in order to pass down information as a way of learning. The poem from Circa 1800 BC explains that grain was converted into bappir bread before fermentation, and grapes as well as honey were added to the mix. The resulting gruel was drunk unfiltered, hence the need for straws. A translation from the University of Oxford describes combining bread, a source for yeast, with malted and soaked grains and keeping the liquid in a fermentation vessel until finally filtering it into a <b>collecting</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceLymphatic {{collecting}} vessels direct lymph {{into and}} from lymph nodes (LNs) and can become hyperpermeable {{as the result}} of a previous infection.

40|$|Introduction: Near-infrared (NIR) imaging {{has emerged}} as a novel imaging {{modality}} for assessing lymphatic function in vivo. While the technique has provided quantitative data previously unavailable, questions remain in regards to the spatiotemporal capabilities of the approach. We address three of the more important issues here using the rodent tail, {{one of the most widely}} utilized in vivo model systems in the lymphatic literature. Specifically we demonstrate 1) the transient vs. steady state response of lymphatics to tracer injection, 2) the functional characteristics of multiple <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> draining the same tissue space in parallel, and 3) the long-term consequences of fluorescent tracers on lymphatic function to repeated functional measurements. Methods: Rat tails were imaged with NIR and metrics of function were calculated for both <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> that drain the tail. A nitric oxide donor cream (GTNO) was applied to the tail. Additionally, two different NIR dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) and LI-COR IRDye 800 CW PEG, were utilized for function imaging at the time of initial injection and at 1, 2, and 4 week follow-up time points after which both draining lymph nodes were harvested. Results and Discussion: Significant differences were found between the two <b>collecting</b> <b>vessels</b> such that the vessel first showing fluorescence (dominant) produced enhanced functional metrics compared to the second vessel (non-dominant). GTNO significantly reduced lymphatic function in the non-dominant vessel compared to the dominant. ICG remained visible in the tail for 2 weeks after injection and was accompanied by significant losses in lymphatic function and enlarged draining lymph nodes. The Licor tracer also remained visible for 2 weeks. However, the dye produced significantly lower effects on lymphatic function than ICG, and lymph nodes were not enlarged at any time point, suggesting that this may be a more appropriate contrast agent for longitudinal lymphatic imaging...|$|R
