An accurate approximation for the mutual radiation impedance is defined between two circular cells, which can be used in large arrays to reduce computational complexity. Hence, a performance analysis of CMUT arrays can be accurately done with a circuit simulator.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{cell count}} showed {{the presence of}} about 20, 000 ganglion cells with associated satellite elements in the nodose ganglion in the monkey. Among these <b>closely</b> <b>packed</b> <b>cells,</b> at least one-third were substance P (SP) immunoreactive, ranging from faint or moderate to intense staining. Substance P immunoreactivity (SP-IR) was localised in the cell bodies and their long extending neurites. Ultrastructural study showed that SP-IR {{was not associated with}} any particular organelles or inclusions. A striking feature of the nodose ganglion was the occurrence of SP-positive pericellular arborisations associated with about 0. 5 % of the ganglion cells which were almost exclusively SP-negative. The pericellular arborisation displayed diverse morphological forms from a simple tortuous fibre to complex glomerular networks or plexuses encircling the soma of SP-negative ganglion cells. The varicose nerve fibres forming the pericellular arborisations appeared to terminate as 'boutons' contacting the soma of the ganglion cells. Electron microscopic study demonstrated the close spatial relation between the SP-IR profiles and the ganglion cell but there was no direct synaptic contact. In some instances, the SP-IR profiles containing agranular and dense-cored vesicles penetrated the cytoplasm of satellite cells, almost reaching the surface of the soma of the ganglion cell. The sources of origin of the nerve plexuses in the pericellular arborisation were either from the small and sparsely distributed jugular ganglion cells which were intensely SP-IR or from the intrinsic SP-IR nodose ganglion cells. The possibility that the efferent neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus could also contribute to the pericellular arborisation was also considered. The function of the pericellular arborisations {{may be related to the}} modulation of the SP-deficient ganglion cells with which they associate through the release of SP and probably by way of the satellite cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{losses of}} potato tubers in storage due to soft rot spoilage have emphasised {{the need for}} detailed studies of the entry and spread of the pathogen and {{the action of the}} defence mechanisms of the potato at an ultrastruotiiral level. The {{studies have shown that the}} tuber may be infected through fresh wounds or lenticels under conditions of high relative humidity, providing sufficient inoculum is present and, in the case of lenticels, the conditions before inoculation have been suitable. The effects of the environment on the physical barriers and consequently bacterial spread are complex. Observation of the formation of suberin and melanin at the infection interface hafe shown that the former may hinder bacterial spread: the role of the latter is more obscure. Light microscopy has shown that the pattern of initial colonisation is highly temperature dependant. Colonisation through lenticels is quicker at first than through fresh wounds probably due to the differences in anatomy, although quantitatively large amounts of inoculum are involved in the latter under most conditions. Once inside the tuber the bacterium spreads through the storage parenchyma as zoned colonies aligned in one direction during the early stages, but after the host cells have been macerated the cells of the pathogen become uniformly distributed between the pcl&tc cells. Vascular spread is less common, and the bacteria are enclosed in the xylem and phloem by the suberised, <b>closely</b> <b>packed</b> <b>cells</b> of the vascular parenchyma, although some pectolysis and subsequent melanin formation occurs outside the bundles for distances of up to 500 u. Tissue degradation involves the destruction of the cytoplasm, as well as the cell wall. Characteristically membrane rupture is associated with the enlargement of microbodies. Although cells containing calcium oxalate monohydrate are colonised intracellularly, the crystals do not appear to be utilised.

Differences between groups and between subgroups were tested with chi(2) Or Fisher's exact tests with Mann-Whitney U tests and with Student's t tests. Results. In the osteoarthritis group, the number of synovial intima cell layers was significantly higher, and fibrous intima matrix and fibrous subintima were found significantly more frequently than in the control group. Moreover, in the osteoarthritis group, intima cell hypertrophy in combination with a <b>closely</b> <b>packed</b> <b>cell</b> composition was found significantly more often in the first year of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas intima hyperplasia, fibrous intima matrix, dense surface material, and subintima elastic fibers were found significantly more frequently in the first 2 years of clinical signs and symptoms. Conclusions. The findings in this study suggest that osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint may initially result in synovial intima hyperplasia and cell hypertrophy, and subsequently in deposition of fibrous material in the intima matrix. Eventually, fibrosis of the subintimal tissue may occur in combination with degeneration and subsequent normalization of the synovial intima cell layer. Overall, fibrosis was the most characteristic feature of synovial membranes of osteoarthritic temporomandibular joints. In conclusion, the involvement of the synovial membrane in osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint is characterized by an early proliferative phase and a late fibrous phase. It appears that the intense and prolonged fibrous phase may not be a normal appropriate response to an initial insult but rather an aberrant counterproductive response...|$|R
40|$|A 59 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a large mediastinal mass. At thoracotomy, the mass was found tightly adherent to the esophageal wall and right lower lobe of the lung. Histological examination showed a solid tumor composed of <b>closely</b> <b>packed</b> nests of <b>cells</b> with clear and eosinophilic cytoplasm, which were strongly and diffusely positive for S 100 protein but negative for HMB 45 and Melan-A. The diagnosis of clear cell sarcoma was supported by demonstrating {{the presence of an}} EWS gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. There was no evidence that this lesion represented metastatic disease. To the best of our knowledge, primary mediastinal clear cell sarcoma has not been previously reported in the literature. We present the case and discuss the differential diagnosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
