In the past NASA has relied primarily on classical hand analyses, coupled with relatively large safety factors, for predicting maximum stresses in wind tunnel balances. Now, with the significant advancements in computer technology and sophistication of general purpose analysis codes, it is more reasonable to pursue finite element analyses of these balances. The <b>correlation</b> <b>studies</b> of the present analyses show very good agreement between the analyses and data measured with strain gages and therefore the studies give higher confidence for using finite element analyses to analyze and optimize balance designs in the future...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{considerable}} technical advance in MRI techniques, the optical resolution {{of these methods}} are still limited. Consequently, the delineation of cytoarchitectonic fields based on probabilistic maps and brain volume changes, as well as small-scale changes seen in MRI scans need to be verified by neuronanatomical/neuropathological diagnostic tools. To attend the current interdisciplinary needs of the scientific community, brain banks have to broaden their scope {{in order to provide}} high quality tissue suitable for neuroimaging- neuropathology/anatomy <b>correlation</b> <b>studies.</b> the Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Research Group (BBBABSG) of the University of São Paulo Medical School (USPMS) collaborates with researchers interested in neuroimaging-neuropathological <b>correlation</b> <b>studies</b> providing brains submitted to postmortem MRI in-situ. in this paper we describe and discuss the parameters established by the BBBABSG to select and to handle brains for fine-scale neuroimaging-neuropathological <b>correlation</b> <b>studies,</b> and to exclude inappropriate/unsuitable autopsy brains. We tried {{to assess the impact of}} the postmortem time and storage of the corpse on the quality of the MRI scans and to establish fixation protocols that are the most appropriate to these <b>correlation</b> <b>studies.</b> After investigation of a total of 36 brains, postmortem interval and low body temperature proved to be the main factors determining the quality of routine MRI protocols. Perfusion fixation of the brains after autopsy by mannitol 20 % followed by formalin 20 % was the best method for preserving the original brain shape and volume, and for allowing further routine and immunohistochemical staining. Taken to together, these parameters offer a methodological progress in screening and processing of human postmortem tissue in order to guarantee high quality material for unbiased <b>correlation</b> <b>studies</b> and to avoid expenditures by post-imaging analyses and histological processing of brain tissue.
