40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{clinical features}} of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in Chinese Han population. METHODS: Three hundred and sixteen hospitalized patients with IHPS from January 1998 to February 2010 were retrospectively reviewed, and data including patient's sex, onset age, other coexisting congenital defects, pyloric <b>circular</b> muscle <b>thickness</b> evaluated by ultrasonograph, serum electrolytes concentration, and results of arterial {{blood gas analysis}} on admission were collected. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: the duration between first onset and admission {{less than or equal to}} 10 days (early onset group), and more than 10 days (late onset group). The results of arterial blood gas and serum electrolyte concentration were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There were 271 males and 45 females in 316 patients; the onset age ranged between 1 and 351 (26. 5 ± 26. 6) days. The birth weight ranged between 1. 6 and 4. 5 (3. 23 ± 0. 44) kilograms; coexisting congenital defects were found in 65 cases (20. 6 %). Pyloric <b>circular</b> muscle <b>thickness</b> was 4 - 8 (5. 4 ± 1. 0) millimetres (mm). For the early onset group, the rates of hypokalemia, hypochloraemia and hypercapnia were significantly lower than those in the late onset group (18. 67 % VS 50 %, P< 0. 0001; 46. 03 % VS 71. 01 %, P =  0. 003; 56. 58 % VS 83. 44 %, P =  2. 17 × 10 (- 5); respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The symptom duration in Chinese Han population was longer than that in other populations. And as the prolongation of symptom duration, the incidence of acid-base imbalance increased significantly. Infants with persistent vomiting at the age of 3 ∼ 5 weeks after birth should be considered IHPS, and go to hospital as soon as possible in order to reduce the incidence of hypokalemia, hypochloraemia and hypercapnia, and avoid deterioration...|$|R

Material and Methods: Thirty New Zealand rabbits, which were divided into five groups, were used. <b>Circular</b> full <b>thickness</b> bone defects with a diameter of 1 cm diameter were created on both parietal bones. For the closure of defects, no material used in group 1, an autogenous bone graft was used in group 2, human-derived demineralized bone matrix (DBM) was used in group 3, beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) was used in group 4, and a combination of DBM and β-TCP was used in group 5.

The exact solutions for torsional vibrations in circular and annular plates are first reviewed. Then, an approximate method is developed to analyze torsional vibrations of <b>circular</b> plates with <b>thickness</b> steps. The method {{is based on}} an approximate plate theory for torsional vibrations derived from the variational principle following Mindlin’s series expansion method. Approximate solutions for the zeroth- and first-order torsional modes in the circular plate with one thickness step are presented. It is found that, within a narrow frequency range, the first-order torsional modes can be trapped in the inner region where the thickness exceeds that of the outer region. The mode shapes clearly show that both the displacement and the stress amplitudes decay exponentially away from the thickness step. The existence and the number of the trapped first-order torsional modes in a circular mesa on an infinite plate are determined as functions of the normalized geometric parameters, which may serve as a guide for designing distributed torsionalmode resonators for sensing applications. Comparisons between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements show close agreements in the resonance frequencies of trapped torsional modes. I...|$|R

The reductions are {{a function of the}} overburden pressure and plate size. A collapsive strain extending 4 times the plate diameter is observed upon wetting. Also the load step duration and the extent of effective wetting front have significant effects on the test results and interpretation; therefore, they should be considered in the planning, design, and analysis of plate load and full scale footing tests...|$|R

Following irradiation, slow healing and necrosis are the clinical manifestations of permanent vascular insufficiency. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR-C) and low-intensity laser therapy (LILT; LED Cluster) were studied for their efficacy in the healing of wounds in irradiated tissue because they are known to accelerate the healing process of wounds in non-irradiated tissues. Fourteen female albino rats were the subjects of this study. All 14 animals were irradiated individually with a Cobalt source. Post-radiotherapy, all 14 animals were observed {{for a period of}} 3 months to allow subcutaneous fibrosis to develop. At the end of 3 months, an excisional, full <b>thickness</b> <b>circular</b> wound of approximately 2 cm 2 was made to the irradiated tissue. In part 1 of the study, the animals belonging to the study group were treated with UVR, whereas in part 2, they were exposed to LILT until the wounds healed completely. In both study parts, the wounds of the animals belonging to the control and study groups were cleaned regularly with saline and betadine. The wounds were traced at each treatment session and the wound area was calculated in mm 2 using a Hipad Digitiser. In part 1 of the study, statistical analysis implied that UVR-C did not accelerate the healing process of irradiated tissue. Rather, the lesser average healing rate of the group treated with UVR-C pointed to a delay in the healing of irradiated tissues caused by UVR-C. In part 2, the study showed no difference in the rate of healing of wounds exposed to LILT compared to the wounds that did not receive laser treatment. In conclusion, this study suggests that while use of UVR-C and LILT may not benefit post-irradiation non-healing ulcers, use of UVR-C may actually retard the healing process...|$|R
40|$|The chloroform, {{methanol}} and aqueous extracts of the Guiera senegalensis and Kigelia africana, {{were tested}} for their antimicrobial activity against five standard bacteria,two standard Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis NCTC 8236 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923), three standard Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6380 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) {{and the two}} fungi (Aspergillus niger ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 7596), using the cup plate agar diffusion method. The aqueous and methanolic extracts of the two plants {{proved to be more}} effective against the bacteria and fungi tested than the chloroform extracts. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the most active extracts against the standard bacteria and fungi were determined using the agar plate dilution method. The antimicrobial activity of six reference drugs were determinated against the seven tested Gram positive,Gram negative bacteria and fungi and compared their activity with the activity of the tested plant extracts. The most active extracts against the standard bacteria were selected, and III then they were tested against 100 clinical isolates collected randomaly from the National Health Laboratory, Khartoum Educational Hospital and Omdurman Educational Hospital. Kigelia africana {{is one of the most}} widely used medicinal plants in Sudan, and is employed in numerous traditional preprations. In this study the wound healing effect of Kigelia africana fruit extract was investigated on open skin wound model on rats. 15 Swiss Wistar Albino rats of either sex weighing (80 - 100 gm) were used during the study Hair of the lower back and right flank of the animal was completely shaved. Full <b>thickness</b> <b>circular</b> excision wound 1 cm in diameter was made on the shaved area. Methanolic extract of Kigelia africana fruit was prepared. Ointment of 2 % (w/w) extract in polyethylene glycol was prepared. Fucidin ointment was used as standard healing agent; both ointments were applied twice daily. One trail was performed using three groups of rats. Treated groups were compared with non-treated groups. Healing was determined by reduction in the size of wound area. The results of this study confirmed that the 2 % Kigelia africana ointment is a potent healing agent even better than the tested Fucidin ointment...|$|R
