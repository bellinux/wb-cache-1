50|$|Fitted at {{the ends}} of the vehicle frames, one at each corner, the buffers are projecting, {{shock-absorbing}} pads which, when vehicles are coupled, are brought into contact with those on the next vehicle. The draw chain used between each pair of vehicles includes a screw which is tightened after coupling to shorten the chain and keep the buffers pressed together. Such is known as a 'screw coupling'. Historically, coupling chains were no more than that, a short length of heavy chain (typically three links long) with no adjustment. These would result in a 'loose-coupled train' in which the buffers of adjacent vehicles would only touch when the <b>coupling</b> <b>chain</b> was fully slack, such as when being pushed or going down hill.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} {{with a series of}} acrylate based side-chain liquid crystalline (LC) polymers. Previous studies have shown that these LC polymers have a preference for parallel or perpendicular alignment with respect to the polymer chain which depends on the length of the <b>coupling</b> <b>chain</b> joining the mesogenic unit to the polymer backbone. On the other hand, the dielectric relaxation of these side-chain LC polymers shows a strong relaxation associated to the mesogenic unit dynamics. For samples with parallel alignment, {{it was found that the}} dielectric relaxation of the nematic is weaker and broader than the relaxation of the isotropic. By contrast, for samples with perpendicular alignment, the isotropic to nematic transition reduces the broadening the relaxation and increases the relaxation strength.

40|$|The {{influence}} of cross-linking on the phase behaviour {{of a series}} of side-chain liquid crystalline elastomers has been studied. For samples cross-linked in the temperature range corresponding to the nematic phase, the phase transition was shifted compared to that observed when an identical sample was cross-linked in the isotropic phase. This shift represented a stabilisation of the nematic phase in the former case, in line with theoretical expectations. By utilising a novel, slow cross-linking method, which allows the polymer backbone to take up an equilibrium conformation prior to network formation, it proved possible to monitor the shifts in phase transition temperature {{as a function of the}} length of the methylene chain coupling the mesogenic units to the polymer backbone. The results obtained are related to the backbone anisotropy and indicate that the level of orientational order of the polymer in the nematic phase backbone increases with a reduction in the length of the <b>coupling</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary. In the {{conventional}} spheroidal and toroidal representation, the differential equations governing long-period free oscillations of the Earth’s fluid core form an infinitely coupled system. Because of the mathematical complexity, solutions {{of this system}} are customarily attempted by numerical integration. The approach, however, necessitates a severe truncation of the <b>coupling</b> <b>chain</b> and this, in turn, renders it difficult to interpret the results. An alternative approach is sought in this work. By invoking the ‘solenoidal flow ’ approximation which neglects the dilatation, and the ‘subseismic’ approximation which neglects the flow pressure respectively, we have succeeded in developing analytic solutions for the inertial and gravitational oscillations. This results in a significant simplification of the eigenvalue problem because the infinitely coupled system of differential equations is now reduced to an algebraic one. More importantly, the analytic solutions reveal immediately the roles played by the rotation and density stratification in core dynamics. We find that the inertial oscillations, which arise from th...|$|E

Then two non-integrable systems, two <b>coupled</b> <b>chains</b> and a next-nearest-neighbor <b>coupled</b> <b>chain,</b> are studied {{as a function of the}} coupling. We examine how the level spacing evolves from the Poisson distribution to the GOE distribution. Finally we consider the Haldane-Shastry $ 1 /r^{ 2 }$ model.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Theoretical and {{experimental}} {{evidence for the}} occurrence of multiple relaxation regimes in polymers far above the glass transition temperature is presented and interpreted {{in terms of the}} Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) stretched exponential expression. Intramolecular effects responsible for the observation of stretched exponential decay of correlation functions are discussed in relation to four different theoretical models: The kinetic Ising model of Glauber, the Shore-Zwanzig model of linear fluctuating dipoles, the Hall-Helfand model of bistable oscillators, and the dynamic rotational isomeric state model. A decrease in the KWW exponent is predicted with increasing intramolecular <b>coupling.</b> <b>Chain</b> connectivity appears as a major factor underlying the stretched exponential behavior observed in an intermediate time regime covering a time span of 2 - 3 orders of magnitude. In the short time limit, a single exponential decay of correlations is approached in all models. At long times, on the other hand, different KWW exponents are observed depending on the degree of intramolecular cooperativity. Results of depolarized Rayleigh scattering measurements by Tandem Fabry-Perot interferometry on poly(methylphenylsi 1 oxane) at high temperatures are observed to be insensitive to variations in temperature and concentration, which lends support to the notion that intramolecular interactions play a fundamental role in ascribing the apparent KWW behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structures and}} the ferromagnetic (FM) stability in In 2 O 3 : Fe (IFO) with additional Cu and oxygen vacancy (VO) doping {{have been investigated}} using first-principles calculations {{within the framework of}} density-functional theory. It is found that pure IFO has an antiferromagnetic ground state, but the existence of VO or with Cu codoping could lead to a weak FM coupling in IFO system for some special configurations. The stability of the ferromagnetism is greatly enhanced by the coexistence of VO and Cu codoping in IFO system. We demonstrate that the role of Cu ions is to act as superexchange mediators causing an indirect FM coupling between Fe cations through the hybridization of the Cu 3 d states with the O 2 p states. The delocalized hybridization consisted of Fe 3 d, O 2 p, and Cu 3 d is found to be very efficient to mediate the FM exchange interaction. In favor of the FM state, Cu ions prefer to locate adjacent to the Fe ions in order to form Fe 1 -O 1 -Cu-O 2 -Fe 2 <b>coupling</b> <b>chain.</b> The results of our calculations suggest the possibility of fabricating In 2 O 3 based transparent spintronics by (Fe, Cu) codoping in a reduced growth ambient...|$|E
40|$|Summary. If {{undertones}} (internal {{gravity waves}} in the Earth’s liquid outer core) exist then they occur at such long periods that the full theory of Earth dynamics in a rotating reference frame is required for their description. This theory has been so cumbersome to implement that very severe truncation of the traditional vector spherical harmonic expansions has been required, with the consequence that the results obtained have been noted less for their physical significance than for their technical achievement. By considering simplified models of the Earth’s core it is first demon-strated that, {{at least for the}} case of a non-rotating Earth, the effects of mantle structure and boundary rigidity on the undertone periods are minimal. Further, the combined effects of core compressibility and self-gravitation in a real Earth model can to a good approximation be replaced by a single para-meter, the Brunt-Vaisala buoyancy frequency, in a simple incompressible fluid model. On applying these simplifications to a rotating Earth model, the resulting equations of motion are then solved with a longer <b>coupling</b> <b>chain</b> than any used previously. This approach, based on the chain beginning with the spheroidal term S:, supports the hypothesis that the periods of the core undertones for a realistic rotating Earth model are crowded into a narrow band around 12 hr. ...|$|E

40|$|An L× ∞ {{system of}} odd number of <b>coupled</b> Heisenberg spin <b>chains</b> is studied using a {{degenerate}} perturbation theory, where L {{is the number}} of <b>coupled</b> <b>chains.</b> An effective chain Hamiltonian is derived explicitly in terms of two spin half degrees of freedom of a closed chain of L sites, valid in the regime the inter-chain coupling is stronger than the intra-chain coupling. The spin gap has been calculated numerically using the effective Hamiltonian for L = 3, 5, 7, 9 for a finite chain up to ten sites. It is suggested that the ground state of the effective Hamiltonian is correlated, by examining various variational trial states for the effective-spin chain Hamiltonian. 2 There is a growing interest in <b>coupled</b> <b>chains</b> of Hubbard-Heisenberg spin systems, following the experimental realization of coupled arrays of metal-oxide-metal ladder systems [1, 2]. A number of investigations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] of weakly-coupled Heisenberg spin chains have been carried out, in which the <b>coupling</b> between the <b>chains</b> is weaker than intra-chain coupling, and have provided a strong indication that a system of even number of chains can be understood in terms of a short-range resonating valence bond (RVB) picture, with spin gap and a finite spin-spin correlation length. Whereas a system of odd number of chains is gapless with power-law spin correlations, indicating that it is in the same universality class as a single spin chain. The framework for understanding the difference between even and odd numbered chains is the RVB picture[6, 8], which suggests that an even-numbered <b>coupled</b> <b>chain</b> system {{can be thought of as}} an integer spin chain exhibiting a Haldane spin gap, and an odd-numbered coupled system maps onto a half-odd integer spin chain.

Kinetic studies of ethanol coupling reactions on Cu{sub 0. 5 }Mg{sub 5 }CeO{sub x} and 1. 0 wt % K-Cu{sub 0. 5 }Mg{sub 5 }CeO{sub x} catalyst indicates that at similar steady-state acetaldehyde concentrations, the presence of K increases the rates of base-catalyzed aldol coupling reactions to acetone and butyraldehyde.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of architectural polymers with multiple reactive functionalities offers significant promise as platform technologies {{for development of}} nano-medicines that require hybrid biomolecule-nanomaterial components. However, there can often be a mismatch in compatibility between the conditions required for the coupling chemistry, while maintaining stability of the biomolecule. This leads to decreased yields and poor functional fidelity. In this report, we describe the {{synthesis of}} hyperbranched polymers, where reversible addition fragmentation chaintransfer (RAFT) polymerization is used to control chain molecular weight, end group functionality and the final size of the hyperbranched polymer. Through optimization of the reaction conditions, we demonstrate that branched polymers with controlled size can be synthesized.

Nonlinear dynamics {{of one of these}} chains when the rest of them are fixed is reduced to the well known Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) model.
