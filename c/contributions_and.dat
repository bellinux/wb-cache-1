40|$|Recently, {{competition}} among universities {{has a whole}} new face, and emphasis is given toward interdependence and interactive evolution between universities and regions. From this social perspective, universities should contribute to regional development by serving the regional society using results of intellectual work, and {{it is necessary for}} universities to accomplish social <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> regional cooperation strategically. One of the most important parts in strategic planning is that students participate in activities for social <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> regional cooperation. This paper presents a survey of the university students’ awareness on social <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> regional cooperation using several statistical methods and attempts to find factors which affect activities for social <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> regional cooperation using logistic regression analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{first section}} {{describes}} {{the historical development of}} <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> indemnity, from {{a contractual obligation}} to a court implied obligation followed by an expansion to various federally regulated fields. The second section investigates the ERISA fiduciary sections, their differences with traditional trust law, their legislative history, and the purposes of ERISA. The third section examines the position of the various federal courts on the issue of <b>contribution</b> or indemnity <b>and</b> their rationales, along with that of the commentators. Since ERISA generally does not permit actions against nonfiduciaries, this article excludes those opinions dealing with <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> indemnity between a fiduciary and a non-fiduciary, most of which appeared prior to the Supreme Court's pronouncement with respect to non-fiduciaries. The fourth section provides the solution pursuant to the Supreme Court's directive for finding <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> indemnity for a federal statute, finds that the statutory language does not support <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> indemnity, and shows that the solution of disallowing <b>contribution</b> <b>and</b> indemnity comports with the legislative history and the purposes of ERISA...|$|R

There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure. Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} work on Southampton's defences {{resulted in}} considerable improvements: {{by the late}} 14th century, the town was completely encircled by 2km (1.25 miles) of stone walls. Some existing buildings, including a dovecote, were reinforced and pressed into service {{as part of the}} defences. South Gate was built to protect the southern quays, with a wide archway, complete with parapets and machicolations. The building work proved very expensive, however, and despite the mayor and bailiffs enforcing <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> assistance from the citizens, Parliament had to be asked several times in the 1370s to assist by remitting arrears of taxes owed by Southampton.|$|E

They arrived back in Melbourne on 28 June, and his AIF appointment was terminated the following day. He contested the federal election {{as a candidate for}} the Nationalist Party of Australia on 13 December 1919. He achieved the greatest popular vote of any Victorian candidate for the Senate. Moreover, he repeated this success at the 1925 election. Although not naturally suited to life in the federal parliament, he made significant <b>contributions,</b> <b>and</b> was outspoken in his efforts to assist returned servicemen, particularly those with whom he had served. This outspokenness often took the form of arguing in the Senate in relation to the new legislation being brought before it, when such legislation involved the defence forces. At other times, he would personally champion the cause of those men who had been in his battalion.|$|E
5|$|In 1695 the French command {{found that}} the {{inhabitants}} of the areas occupied by the French army were reluctant to pay war <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> started to oppose an organized and growingly successful resistance. During the winter of 1694-1695, the inhabitants of Calella repelled a punishment force of 800 or 1,000 French soldiers from the Blanes garrison and killed between 60 or 100 of them. French troops were also harassed by Catalan militia forces, the miquelets, who laid ambushes to Noailles' forces from woods and heights. One of the most effective leaders of the miquelets was Captain Ramon de Sala i Saçala, the veguer of Vic, who achieved two victories over the French during the winter: on late December he overran a convoy on way to Hostalric, killing 25 French soldiers and taking 25 prisoners, and on 24 February he defeated a company of French dragoons at Navata, killing 7 of them and taking 28 prisoners and 32 horses.|$|E

5|$|McCreary {{was not as}} {{successful}} in securing reforms during the 1914 legislative session. He advocated a comprehensive workmen's compensation law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> expenditures, {{but the majority of}} legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, from whence it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying at the capitol – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed responsiveness to McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, school attendance for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist local school boards in adopting textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E

5|$|The flood had {{a massive}} effect on Fairbanks. Four people were killed, {{and the damage}} ran into the {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars. It helped push the city's remaining farm, Creamer's Dairy, into bankruptcy, and it forced the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital. Fairbanks residents responded to the problems with aplomb. The annual Tanana Valley State Fair was postponed but not canceled. Seven thousand dollars were raised to buy Creamer's Dairy and turn it into a bird sanctuary. KTVF, one of the few town businesses to have flood insurance, rebuilt its studio and became the first Fairbanks TV station to broadcast in color, four months after the flood. When two bond measures to build a government-run hospital were turned down by Fairbanks voters, residents raised $2.6 million from private <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> $6 million from the state and federal government to build Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Poland {{had become}} the home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as royal edicts guaranteeing Jewish safety and {{religious}} freedom, issued during the 13th century (Bolesław the Pious, Statute of Kalisz of 1264), contrasted with bouts of persecution in Western Europe. This persecution intensified following the Black Death of 1348–1349, when some in the West blamed {{the outbreak of the}} plague on the Jews. As scapegoats were sought, the increased Jewish persecution led to pogroms and mass killings in a number of German cities, which caused an exodus of survivors heading east. Much of Poland was spared from the Black Death, and Jewish immigration brought their valuable <b>contributions</b> <b>and</b> abilities to the rising state. The number of Jews in Poland kept increasing throughout the Middle Ages; the population had reached about 30,000 {{toward the end of the}} 15th century, and, as refugees escaping further persecution elsewhere kept streaming in, 150,000 in the 16th century. A royal privilege issued in 1532 granted the Jews freedom to trade anywhere within the kingdom. Massacres and expulsions from many German states continued until 1552–1553. By the mid-16th century, 80% of the world's Jews lived and flourished in Poland and in Lithuania; most of western and central Europe was by that time closed to Jews. In Poland–Lithuania the Jews were increasingly finding employment as managers and intermediaries, facilitating the functioning of and collecting revenue in huge magnate-owned land estates, especially in the eastern borderlands, developing into an indispensable mercantile and administrative class. Despite the partial resettlement of Jews in Western Europe following the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), a great majority of world Jewry had lived in Eastern Europe (in the Commonwealth and in the regions further east and south, where many migrated), until the 1940s.|$|E
