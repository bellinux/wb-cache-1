50|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>satis</b> (abbreviation qs or QS) is a Latin term {{meaning the}} amount which is enough. It has its origins as a {{quantity}} specification {{in medicine and}} pharmacology, where a similar term quantum sufficit has been used (abbreviated Q.S.). <b>Quantum</b> <b>satis</b> is also {{used in the same}} function in food regulations and food safety laws in the European Community (EC/EU).|$|R
50|$|While {{the letter}} Q in the 8th edition only listed the letter Q itself, the 11th edition also listed <b>quantum</b> <b>satis,</b> quenell, quilt and quisling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{specification}} of <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> for an ingredient essentially means [...] "Add {{as much of}} this ingredient as is needed to achieve the desired result, but not more." ...|$|R

50|$|In the European Union, {{the use of}} carmine {{in foods}} is {{regulated}} under the European Commission's directives governing food additives in general and food dyes in particular and listed under the names Cochineal, Carminic acid, Carmines and Natural Red 4 as additive E 120 {{in the list of}} EU-approved food additives. The directive governing food dyes approves the use of carmine for certain groups of foods only and specifies a maximum amount which is permitted or restricts it to the <b>quantum</b> <b>satis.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For example, European Union {{directive}} 94/36/EC (which {{regulates the}} use of food colors) explains in Article 2 (7): [...] "In the Annexes to this Directive 'quantum satis' means that no maximum level is specified. However, coloring matters shall be used according to good manufacturing practice at a level not higher than is necessary to achieve the intended purpose and provided {{that they do not}} mislead the customer". The words <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> are used with reference to a number of substances in the Annexes III and IV to the EU directive 94/36/EC.|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on microcrystalline wax (E 905) when used as a food additive. Microcrystalline wax (E 905) is authorised <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> as a surface treatment agent on non-chocolate confectionery, chewing gum and decorations, coatings and fillings, except fruit based fillings. It is also permitted as a surface treatment of melons, papaya, mango and avocado. The substance was evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1990 and 1995 and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the latest in 1995. The JECFA established a group ADI of 20 mg/kg bw/day for mineral oils, paraffins and microcrystalline waxes. The Panel noted that all mineral oil products accumulated in tissues in a dose- and time-dependent manner {{with the exception of}} microcrystalline waxes. The Panel concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity from microcrystalline wax (E 905). The Panel also considered that the available toxicity studies with mineral hydrocarbons, closely related from a chemical point of view with microcrystalline waxes, consistently reported no effects of concern associated with the intake of microcrystalline wax. The Panel further concluded that since no long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies with microcrystalline wax E 905 were available, no ADI could be established. The Panel also concluded that the conservative exposure estimates to microcrystalline wax (E 905) from its use at maximum permitted level (following <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> rules), resulted in a sufficient margin of safety compared to the NOAEL established by the Panel for the closely related high viscosity mineral oils, and therefore the use microcrystalline wax (E 905) as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern...|$|R
40|$|Monoglycerides are lipid based {{emulsifiers}} extensively {{used for}} their broad technical {{function in the}} food industry. Commercial monoglycerides are generally manufactured through chemical synthesis; however, lipolysis of triglycerides by lipase enzyme provides a biochemical pathway by which monoglycerides may be produced. This is particularly appealing for consumers for whom all natural and clean labelled food products are a particular driver. Accordingly, rather than replacing monoglycerides from formulations {{with other types of}} emulsifiers (and that may lack the requisite functionality), an alternative approach may be to develop a non-chemical and more natural pathway to produce the emulsifier, thereby allowing the particular monoglyceride functionality to be retained within products. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using lipase enzyme as a processing tool to synthesise polar lipids, namely monoglycerides, in situ of the manufacture of whippable food emulsions, such as cream and ice cream. This concept idea was initially proven viable through interfacial tension (IFT) measurements obtained using a straight-forward surface characterisation technique. R. miehei lipase was found to competitively bind at the interface of vegetable oils-water and that the adsorbed protein (sodium caseinate and whey protein isolate) or surfactant layer (lecithin and Tween 80) did not act as a barrier to lipase adsorption at the oil-water interface. IFT measurements were also able to demonstrate the progressive accumulation of polar lipids at the oil-water interface arising from lipolysis, and were additionally used to indicate how thermal treatment of the enzyme could be used to terminate activity. In considering how the requisite functionality could be achieved for whippable emulsion formulations, emulsion droplet size, type of emulsifiers used as well as lipase concentration were shown to be key variables by which the extent and rate of lipolysis could be manipulated and controlled. The results showed that formulation (emulsifier types and oil content) and processing conditions (Microfluidizer® pressure and number of passes) had significant effects on the emulsion droplet size. As part of controlling the extent of lipolysis, the conditions by which the reaction could be terminated were investigated by measuring the viability of R. miehei lipase against thermal treatment. Results showed that the R. miehei lipase was thermostable up to temperatures of 70 °C. Above this temperature, substantial reduction of the residual activity occurred. However, even elevated temperature of between 90 and 100 oC did not immediately inactivate the lipase, with heating for ~ 2 min required before activity was no longer detected. In terms of emulsion stability, the palm oil emulsion tested in this study was found to be thermostable up to 100 oC, thus allowing development of a thermalisation step that was able to inactivate the enzyme without compromising the stability of the emulsion. The shear stability analyses on lipolysed O/W emulsion showed the lipolysed emulsions were susceptible to shear-induced aggregation, and that the degree of aggregation could be manipulated as a consequence of controlling the extent of lipolysis through either enzyme concentration or holding time. The drastic increase in the viscosity curve between the nonlipolysed and lipolysed emulsion suggested that the shear–induced partial coalescence was primarily due to the lipolysis reaction and was not {{as a result of the}} high fat content (30 %). The findings elucidate the ability of the generated polar lipids in the emulsion to displace the existing sodium caseinate adsorbed layer, thus compromising emulsion stability upon shearing. The quantification of synthesised polar lipids from the triglyceride component of fat droplets by the lipolysis reaction showed a mixture of fatty acids, di- and mono-glycerides being produced. Palmitic acid was observed to be the main liberated fatty acids. While, monoolein and monopalmitin were the most prominent monoglycerides, with measured concentrations of 3. 755 ± 0. 895 and 1. 660 ± 0. 657 mg / g fat respectively after 15 min with lipase concentration of 50 mg /g fat. The relative concentration of polar lipids produced was found to be dependent on the lipase concentration as well as time of lipolysis. Furthermore, up to 30 min of lipolysis (concentration 50 mg /g fat) were seen to have no observable effect on the droplet size distribution of the emulsion suggesting that quiescently stable emulsions could be produced. The results show the importance of controlling reaction conditions (both enzyme concentration and reaction time) in order to provide requisite functionality without excessively destabilising emulsions such that droplet structuring can occur under quiescent conditions. The generation of monoglycerides <b>at</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> levels able to impart critical functionality was demonstrated in whipped cream and ice cream. The addition of R. miehei lipase at very low concentration of 5 mg /g fat was able to produce a rigid and stable whipped cream with overrun exceeding 100 %. However, good stability of the whipped cream over time was achievable with concentration above 10 mg /g fat. Similarly, ice cream made with the addition of 5 mg /g fat exhibited good melt stability and firmness. The findings proved the feasibility of in situ production of polar lipids, namely monoglycerides and fatty acids, in replicating the functionality imparted by commercial monoglycerides in whippable emulsions. Thus, the findings in this thesis offer an alternative biochemical pathway for the generation of polar lipids to that of commercially available monoglycerides, which are currently produced synthetically. The potential for using this approach as part of the processing step for food emulsion manufacture has also been demonstrated. The concept can be tailored for various emulsion based food products...|$|R

2500|$|The word quantum {{comes from}} the Latin quantus, meaning [...] "how great". [...] "Quanta", short for [...] "quanta of electricity" [...] (electrons), was used in a 1902 article on the {{photoelectric}} effect by Philipp Lenard, who credited Hermann von Helmholtz for using the word {{in the area of}} electricity. However, the word quantum in general was well known before 1900. It was often used by physicians, such as in the term <b>quantum</b> <b>satis.</b> Both Helmholtz and Julius von Mayer were physicians as well as physicists. Helmholtz used quantum with reference to heat in his article on Mayer's work, and the word quantum {{can be found in the}} formulation of the first law of thermodynamics by Mayer in his letter dated July 24, 1841. Max Planck used quanta to mean [...] "quanta of matter and electricity", gas, and heat. In 1905, in response to Planck's work and the experimental work of Lenard (who explained his results by using the term quanta of electricity), Albert Einstein suggested that radiation existed in spatially localized packets which he called [...] "quanta of light" [...] ("Lichtquanta").|$|R
