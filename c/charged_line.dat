5000|$|A {{transmission}} line circuit which circumvented the above problem, producing an output pulse {{equal to the}} power supply voltage V, was invented in 1937 by British engineer Alan Blumlein and is widely used today in PFNs. [...] In the Blumlein generator (animation, right), the load is connected in series between two equal length {{transmission line}}s, which are charged by a DC power supply at one end (note that the righthand line is charged through the impedance of the load). [...] To trigger the pulse, a switch short-circuits {{the line at the}} power supply end, causing a negative voltage step to travel toward the load. Since the characteristic impedance Z0 of the line is made equal to half the load impedance RL, the voltage step is half reflected and half transmitted, resulting in two symmetrical opposite polarity voltage steps which propagate away from the load, creating between them a voltage drop of V/2 − (−V/2) = V across the load. The voltage steps reflect from the ends and return, ending the pulse. As in other charge line generators, the pulse duration is equal to 2D/c, where D is the length of the individual transmission lines. [...] A second advantage of the Blumlein geometry is that the switching device can be grounded, rather than located in the high voltage side of the transmission line as in the typical <b>charged</b> <b>line,</b> which complicates the triggering electronics.|$|E

In Quantum Mechanics one such effect is the appearance of topological quantum phases in the wave functions of particles moving freely in multiply connected space-times the prototype of this effect being the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect [1], the appearance of a phase factor in the wave function of an electron which moves around a magnetic flux line. A similar effect is the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect [2] which is obtained from the AB effect by replacing the flux line and the electron by a <b>charged</b> <b>line</b> and a neutral particle with magnetic moment, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{properties}} of DNA, {{for example the}} elastic modulus, are of vital importance for its biological function. Previously, the modulus is mainly obtained by bending, stretching and twisting DNA using various techniques and tools. By applying vibrating mode scanning polarization force microscopy (VPSFM), deformations of DNA under ultra-small indentation forces can be measured and so the radial modulus can be computed. In this paper, modeling of the VPSFM measuring system is presented. The system is modeled as a spring-mass-damper oscillator under various force fields, such as van der Waals force, attractive electrical force and repulsive interactions between the tip and sample. The electrical polarization force is described by using uniformly <b>charged</b> <b>line</b> model and the DNA {{is considered to be}} a simple elastic rod. By numerically integrating the equation of tip motion, the contact force and the radial modulus of DNA under different deformation can be calculated. We found that in measuring radial modulus of DNA, the existence of substrate cannot be neglected, especially when the relative large deformation is reached...|$|E
40|$|The large {{electron}} affinity of InN, close to 6 eV {{and the largest}} of any III-V semiconductor, creates a strong driving force for native donor formation, both in the bulk and at surfaces and interfaces. Moreover, all InN surfaces, regardless of crystal orientation or doping, have been observed to have a surface accumulation layer of electrons, which interferes with standard electrical measurements. For these reasons, until recently, it was uncertain whether or not compensation by donor defects would prevent “real” p-type activity (i. e. existence of sufficiently shallow acceptors and mobile holes). A coordinated experimental approach {{using a combination of}} electrical (Hall effect) and electrothermal (Seebeck coefficient) measurements will be described that allows definitive evaluation of carrier transport in InN. In Mg-doped InN films, the sensitivity of thermopower to bulk hole conduction, combined with modeling of the parallel conducting layers (surface/bulk/interface), enables quantitative measurement of the free hole concentration and mobility. In undoped (n-type) material, combined Hall and thermopower measurements, along with a considering of the scattering mechanisms, leads to a quantitative understanding of the crucial role of <b>charged</b> <b>line</b> defects in limiting electron transport...|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of DNA {{or other}} polyelectrolyte molecules on charged membranes is a recurrent motif in soft matter and bionanotechnological systems. Two typical situations encountered are the deposition of single DNA chains onto substrates for further analysis, e. g., by force microscopy, or the pulling of polyelectrolytes into membrane nanopores, as in sequencing applications. In this paper, {{we present a}} theoretical analysis of such scenarios based on the self-consistent field theory approach, which allows us to address the important effect of charge correlations. We calculate the grand potential of a stiff polyelectrolyte immersed in an electrolyte in contact with a negatively charged dielectric membrane. For the sake of conciseness, we neglect conformational polymer fluctuations and model the molecule as a rigid <b>charged</b> <b>line.</b> At strongly charged membranes, the adsorbed counterions enhance the screening ability of the interfacial region. In the presence of highly charged polymers such as double-stranded DNA molecules close to the membrane, this enhanced interfacial screening dominates the mean-field level DNA-membrane repulsion and results in the adsorption of the DNA molecule to the surface. This picture provides a simple explanation for the recently observed DNA binding onto similarly charged substrates [G.

40|$|We {{provide a}} new {{approach}} to study the noncommutative effects on the neutral Dirac particle with anomalous magnetic or electric dipole moment on the noncommutative plane. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated by investigating the noncommutative corrections on the Aharonov-Casher and He-McKellar-Wilkens effects. This approach is based on the effective U(1) gauge symmetry for the electrodynamics of spin on the two dimensional space. The Seiberg-Witten map for this symmetry is then employed when we study the noncommutative corrections. Because the Seiberg-Witten map preserves the gauge symmetry, the noncommutative corrections can be defined consistently with the ordinary phases. Based on this approach we find the noncommutative corrections on the Aharonov-Casher and He-McKellar-Wilkens phases consist of two terms. The first one depends on the beam particle velocity and consistence with the previous results. However the second term is velocity-independent and then completely new. Therefore our results indicate it is possible to investigate the noncommutative space by using ultra-cold neutron interferometer in which the velocity-dependent term is negligible. Furthermore, both these two terms are proportional to the ratio between the noncommutative parameter θ and the cross section A_e/m of the electrical/magnetic <b>charged</b> <b>line</b> enclosed by the trajectory of beam particles.

The weak-coupling Poisson-Boltzmann theory, which applies when the coupling constant Gamma is small, is briefly recapitulated (the coupling constant is defined as Gamma = beta e^ 2 where beta is the inverse temperature, and e the counter-ion charge). The opposite strong-coupling limit (Gamma -> infinity) is treated by using a recent method based on an exact expansion around the ground-state Wigner crystal of counter-ions. The weak- and strong-coupling theories are compared at intermediary values of the coupling constant Gamma= 2 gamma (gamma= 1, 2, 3), to exact results derived within a 1 D lattice representation of 2 D Coulomb systems in terms of anti-commuting field variables. The models (density profile, pressure) are solved exactly for any particles numbers N at Gamma= 2 and up to relatively large finite N at Gamma= 4 and 6.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{fundamental}} aspects of electrostatics {{as a special}} case in Stueckelberg-Horwitz electromagnetic theory. In this theory, spacetime events x^μ(τ) evolve in an unconstrained 8 -dimensional phase space, interacting through five τ-dependent gauge fields induced by the current densities associated with their evolutions. The chronological time τ was introduced as an independent evolution parameter in order to free the laboratory clock x^ 0 to evolve alternately 'forward' and 'backward' in time according to {{the sign of the}} energy, thus providing a classical implementation of the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of pair creation/annihilation. The resulting theory differs in its underlying mechanics from conventional electromagnetism, but coincides with Maxwell theory in an equilibrium limit. After a brief review of Stueckelberg-Horwitz electrodynamics, we obtain the field produced by an event in uniform motion and verify that it satisfies the field equations. We study this field in the rest frame of the event, where it depends explicitly on coordinate time x^ 0 and the parameter τ, as well as spatial distance R. Calculating with this generalized Coulomb field, we demonstrate how Gauss's theorem and Stoke's theorem apply in 4 D spacetime, and obtain the fields associated with a <b>charged</b> <b>line</b> and a charged sheet. Finally, we use the field of the charged sheet to study a static event in the vicinity of a potential barrier.
