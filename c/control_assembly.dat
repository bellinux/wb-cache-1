40|$|ABSTRACT: A cell {{encapsulation}} device {{based on}} the principle of high-voltage dispersion technology was designed and constructed. The parameters that influenced the formation of cell microcapsules, such as; voltage, push speed, electrode distance, and syringe size were analyzed and optimized. Unlike the traditional cell microencapsulating devices, both of the electrodes were separated from the CaCl 2 solution in this device, which simplified the procedure of keeping the operation within a sanitary environment. Integrated adipose derived stem cell (ADSC) microcapsules with smooth surface and consistent diameter distribution were prepared. After 1 -week in culture as a microcapsule and 3 days assembled in a construct, the ADSCs maintained a high viability and significant proliferation that established a favorable basis for the <b>controlled</b> <b>assembly</b> of cell microcapsules.

5000|$|Being {{much shorter}} than the {{predominant}} multiple units, electric locomotives can suffer from a problem known as [...] "gapping" [...] - becoming marooned between supplies at breaks in the electrical supply and snatching at the couplings whilst moving as they come {{on and off the}} power. The latter places undue stress on couplings and has been known to cause separations of a train. Raworth overcame this by having a motor-generator set (booster) with a large flywheel on the shaft between the two. The traction current, instead of feeding the traction motors directly through the <b>control</b> <b>assembly,</b> powered a large motor which turned a shaft with the flywheel and fed into the generator. The output of the generator could be combined with the 3rd rail power to reduce or boost the voltage applied to the traction motors. With the generator output polarity reversed, the <b>control</b> <b>assembly</b> could deliver around 1200 V DC by combining the generator output with the 650 V from the 3rd rail to give positive 650 V and negative 500-600 V - leading to the nickname [...] "boosters". The flywheel ensured the generator continued to turn whilst no current was available from the 3rd rail, thus ensuring a continuous supply to the traction motors.|$|E

With {{the myriad}} of tools available tomanipulate DNA 1, there is great potential for using DNA as a generic instead of a genetic material. Although much {{progress has been made}} in DNA computing 2 – 4 and DNA nanotechnology 5 – 19, the full achievement of DNA-based materials has not yet been realized. As almost all DNA molecules are either linear or circular, to rationally construct DNA materials one must first create additional shapes of DNA as basic building blocks. In addition, these DNA building blocks must be readily incorporated into larger structures in a controlled manner. Here, we show the <b>controlled</b> <b>assembly</b> of dendrimer-like DNA (DL-DNA) from Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA).
