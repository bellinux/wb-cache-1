5|$|In the {{election}} of 2010, Republicans took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> chambers of the Minnesota legislature {{for the first time}} in 38 years and, with Mark Dayton's election, the DFL party took the governor's office {{for the first time in}} 20 years. Two years later, the DFL regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> houses, and with Governor Dayton in office, the party had same-party <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990. Two years later, the Republicans regained control of the Minnesota House in the 2014 election, and in 2016, the GOP also regained control of the State Senate.|$|E
5|$|As the {{economic}} situation in the state improved {{in the second half}} of the 1820s, the Old Court supporters regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> houses of the General Assembly. They abolished the New Court and restored the Old Court to power. In an 1829 case, the Court nullified decisions rendered by the New Court. In a 1935 case, the Court struck all the New Court cases from Kentucky common law.|$|E
5|$|Having <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the Chancellorship and the Grand Hetman office, Zamoyski {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} people in the country, having obtained both the power of Grand Hetman (commander in chief of the armed forces) and that of chancellor, combined for the first time in the hands of one person. He was responsible for much of the Polish internal and foreign policies. He is considered to be one of the most prominent statesmen in Polish history.|$|E

5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> {{houses of}} Congress from the Democrats {{for the first}} time since the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E

In 2007, ISC bought out its partners in the company to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> tracks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the state}} {{legislative}} elections of 1830, the ascendent Whig Party gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> {{houses of the}} General Assembly. Rowan's strict adherence to Jeffersonian democracy and leadership of the New Court faction during the court controversy of the 1820s had put him at odds with Whig founder Henry Clay. By this time, however, not even Rowan's fellow Democrats endorsed his re-election. Henry Clay was elected instead.|$|E

40|$|The well–known {{principle}} of the direct torque control applied mainly to squirrel–cage induction motor drives can be generalized and applied to other machines, quantities, converters and systems. These are: other AC machines (double–fed induction and permanent magnet synchronous machine), active and reactive power, direct power <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the line side converter, direct <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the converters in a DC link inverter. These new fields are investigated in this paper generally and their application to the components of a wind generator practically. The limits of the direct torque control in salient–pole permanent magnet synchronous generator are given. A solution is given for the stability problem of the double–fed induction generator. The systems are investigated by simulation, the results show the excellent performance <b>of</b> the proposed <b>controls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} whether traffic policemen exposed to urban pollutants and psycho-social stressors may be at risk of modifications in serum levels of immunoglobulins G antibodies (IgG Ab) against Herpes Simplex Virus (type 1) (HSV- 1) compared with controls. Traffic policemen were matched by sex, age, working life and drinking habits (less than two glasses of wine or beer per day) with controls, after excluding the subjects with the principal confounding factors (smoking habit, use of paints, solvents, pesticides and drinking habits). Were included in the study 125 traffic policemen (54 men and 71 women) with outdoor activity and 125 controls (54 men and 71 women) with indoor activity. Mean levels of IgG Ab against HSV- 1 were significantly higher in traffic policemen <b>of</b> <b>both</b> sexes compared with <b>controls.</b> The frequency <b>of</b> workers with IgG Ab against HSV- 1 levels higher than our normal laboratory values, was significant in traffic policemen compared with <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> sexes. The distributions of IgG Ab against HSV- 1 levels in traffic policemen compared with <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> sexes were significant. The authors hypothesise an effect of the working activity in traffic policemen on serum levels of IgG Ab against HSV- 1 compared to controls...|$|R
5|$|Although Desha {{was clearly}} {{aligned with the}} Relief faction, the faction's leader was John Adair, {{a veteran of the}} War of 1812 whose {{popularity}} was augmented because of his very public defense of the Kentuckians who served under him at the Battle of New Orleans against charges of cowardice by Andrew Jackson. Adair won a close election with 20,493 votes, besting William Logan's 19,947 votes, Desha's 12,418 votes, and Anthony Butler's 9,567 votes. Relief partisans also secured <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. Much debt relief legislation was passed during Adair's term, but as his term neared expiration, the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down one popular and expansive debt relief law as unconstitutional, ensuring that debt relief would again be the central issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election.|$|E
5|$|At the 1910 election, Labour gained sixteen {{additional}} {{seats to}} hold a total of forty-two of the seventy-five House of Representatives' seats, and all eighteen Senate seats up for election {{to hold a}} total of twenty-two out of thirty-six seats. This gave Labour <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> upper and lower houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry, Australia's first elected federal majority government, Australia's first elected Senate majority, and the world's first Labour Party majority government. The 113 acts passed {{in the three years}} of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period. The 1910–13 Fisher government represented the culmination of Labour's involvement in politics, and was a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s, under John Curtin and Ben Chifley.|$|E

5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|Clay, though embittered {{by another}} of his many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> houses of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E

5|$|In the 15th century, Novgorodians {{started to}} {{establish}} permanent settlements on the peninsula. Umba and Varzuga, the first documented permanent settlements of the Novgorodians, {{date back to}} 1466. Over time, all coastal areas {{to the west of}} the Pyalitsa River had been settled, creating a territory where the population was mostly Novgorodian. Administratively, this territory was divided into Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were governed by a posadnik from the area of the Northern Dvina. The Novgorod Republic lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> of these volosts to the Grand Duchy of Moscow after the Battle of Shelon in 1471, and the republic itself ceased to exist in 1478 when IvanIII took the city of Novgorod. All Novgorod territories, including those on the Kola Peninsula, became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.|$|E

Three Republican state representatives who had voted with the Democrats to organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority in both the short and long term elections. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders complained to the United States Senate, which took no action against Hanna. McKisson lost a re-election bid as mayor in 1899; Hanna remained a powerful figure in the Senate until his death in 1904.|$|E
