5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local alignment.|$|E
5|$|A graph {{is formed}} by a {{collection}} of vertices and edges, where the vertices are structureless objects that are connected in pairs by edges. In the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex.|$|E

30|$|Knotting {{inside the}} airway makes {{anastomosis}} easier, especially in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep operative field. Here, the three knots placed {{inside of the}} airway at the anastomotic site did not cause any airway trouble during the postoperative course. This technique would be more reliable in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep operative field in the mediastinum and in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more complicated anastomosis.|$|R

5|$|For {{the general}} <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> line {{terminated}} in some arbitrary impedance it is usual {{to describe the}} signal as a wave traveling down the line and analyse it in the frequency domain. The impedance is consequently represented as a frequency dependant complex function.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> driven wheel, a torque must {{be applied}} to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, {{of which there are}} many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
