40|$|With 12 {{figures in}} the text) A series of Ophisaurus apodus was filmed while {{traversing}} plane surfaces, fields of nails and pins at different spacings, and channels of different diameter. Small individuals can practise slow lateral undulation on very rough surfaces, but with increased speed, all shift to slide-pushing, using either constrained bends of the body or very wide swings of the tail. In fields ofclosely-spaced pins, they travel by undulation, often pushing at {{a limited number of}} sites and pulling and pushing the trunk among these.

The activity behavior {{was found to be}} rather complex and different from that observed using benzylamine as substrate. The enzyme is fully active after 3 min incubation at temperatures up to 60 °C, while at higher temperatures it shows an S-shaped irreversible decrease of the activity with aT 50 of about 70 °C. The dependence of the kinetic parameterskcatandKmon temperature was also studied in the range 5 – 66 °C, measuring the initial rates of oxidation of spermidine. The Arrhenius plot ofkcatshows a <b>continuous</b> <b>bend</b> in the thermal stability range of the enzyme. This nonlinearity is due to the dramatic change ofkcatactivation entropy (from + 11 eu at 8 °C, to − 31 eu at 50 °C) and indicates thatkcatis a composite constant, involving two or more successive steps characterized by different kinetic parameters. In the case of the ratiokcat/Km, which for natural substrates of bovine serum amine oxidase was shown that its dependence on ionic strength gives information on the influence of electrostatic field onk 1 (Stevanatoet al.

Effects of experimental conditions like speed and bending angle have been studied in particular. The results illustrate an essential aspect of incremental sheet forming (ISF) : localized deformation. The actual bending radius is the most important influencing factor and this turns out to be controlled by both the pulling force and the bending angle (depth setting). Material thickness had only a minor effect. The maximum elongation before fracture of mild steel was significantly better than that of aluminium. The material is subjected to additional repetitive bending; this does affect material behaviour in general.

40|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (ISF) has {{attracted}} considerable research interests owing to its unique advantages. Double side incremental forming (DSIF) was proposed to further improve the forming accuracy and material formability. Compared with conventional sheet forming technologies, ISF provides greater process flexibility and achieves an enhanced formability. At the same time, however, ISF has exhibited {{a far more}} complicated material deformation behavior for formability enhancement. It is now widely acknowledged that the material deformation during ISF consists of stretching, bending, and shearing with cyclic effects. <b>Continuous</b> <b>bending</b> under tension (CBT) testing method was proposed by Emmens et al. [1], which proved the cyclic stretch-bending effect for formability enhancement in single point incremental forming (SPIF). However, limited research had been reported to investigate the material deformation mechanism leading to the formability improvement in DSIF. An analytical model of a new material test method, Tension Under Bending and Compression (TUBC), is proposed in this study to investigate the material deformation leading to the formability enhancement in DSIF. Under TUBC condition, a specimen is stretched by the pulling force on both ends, while multiple rollers, {{in contact with the}} strip on both sides, move backward and forward continuously to create both cyclic bending and compression loading at a localized area. The analytical model is used to investigate the maximum stable elongations under TUBC condition. Key test variables, bending depth and compressive force, imposed by the rollers, are introduced to consider the effects of <b>continuous</b> <b>bending,</b> compression, and contact between rollers and workpiece. From the results obtained, it is clear that bending and compression have determinant effects on the formability enhancement of DSIF. However, the results show varied degrees of sensitivity of formability to different test variables. The findings correlate well with experimental observations and help to explain the formability enhancement of DSIF...|$|E
