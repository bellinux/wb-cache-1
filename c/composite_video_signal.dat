25|$|Commodore {{sold the}} C64 {{not only through}} its network of {{authorized}} dealers, but also through department stores, discount stores, toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in RF modulator and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the Atari 2600. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 can also output a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> (avoiding the RF modulator) that can be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC output capability also includes separate luminance/chroma signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) S-Video, for connection to the Commodore 1702 monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal. Aggressive pricing of the C64 is considered {{to have been a}} major catalyst in the North American video game crash of 1983. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 rebate in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone that traded in another video game console or computer. To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a Timex Sinclair 1000 for as little as $10 with purchase of a C64, so the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; Timex Corporation departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a price war with the major home computer manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to the exit from the field of Texas Instruments and other smaller competitors.|$|E

When analog and/or digital data is combined with <b>video</b> <b>signals,</b> the resulting configuration is a video instrumentation system. Two examples of video instrumentation systems are described in this paper. The TV Display Generator accepts four independent analog signals, modulated IRIG B serial time code, three different standard <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> and several digital control signals. The analog and time code signals are digitized and inserted into the <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> input <b>signals</b> for recording and display.

Its use as a connector for <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> is extremely common, but provides poor impedance matching. RCA connectors and cable are also commonly used to carry S/PDIF-formatted digital audio, with plugs colored orange to differentiate them from other typical connections.|$|R

50|$|A {{composite}} monitor is any analog {{video display}} that receives input {{in the form}} of an analog <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> to a defined specification. A <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> encodes all information on a single conductor; a composite cable has a single live conductor plus earth. Other equipment with display functionality includes monitors with more advanced interfaces and connectors giving a better picture, including analog VGA, and digital DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort; and television (TV) receivers which are self-contained, receiving and displaying video RF broadcasts received with an internal tuner. Video monitors are used for displaying computer output, closed-circuit television (e.g. security cameras) and other applications requiring a two-dimensional monochrome or colour image.|$|E

50|$|A <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> {{generator}} {{is a type}} {{of signal}} generator which outputs predetermined video and/or television oscillation waveforms, and other signals used in the synchronization of television devices and to stimulate faults in, or aid in parametric measurements of, television and video systems. There are several different types of <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> generators in widespread use. Regardless of the specific type, the output of a video generator will generally contain synchronization signals appropriate for television, including horizontal and vertical sync pulses (in analog) or sync words (in digital). Generators of <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> (such as NTSC and PAL) will also include a colorburst signal as part of the output.|$|R

50|$|The mini-VGA {{connector}} {{can also}} be used for video output.

50|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> {{can easily}} be {{directed}} to any broadcast channel simply by modulating the proper RF carrier wave with it. Most home analog video equipment record a signal in (roughly) composite format: LaserDiscs store a true composite signal, while consumer videotape formats (including VHS and Betamax) and lesser commercial and industrial tape formats (including U-Matic) use modified composite signals (generally known as color-under). On playback, these devices often give the user the option to output the baseband signal or to modulate it onto a VHF or UHF frequency compatible with a TV tuner (i.e., appearing on a selected TV channel). The professional television production uncompressed digital video videocassette format known as D-2 (video) directly records and reproduces standard NTSC <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signals,</b> using PCM encoding of the analog signal on the magnetic tape.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> is {{actually}} the video information superimposed on blanking. The total level of the <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> (blanking + video) is 1000 mV. This level can also be given in IRE units such that the level difference reserved for video information is 100 IRE units. So white corresponds to 100 IRE units and blanking level corresponds to 0 IRE units. The level of black is 0 IRE units {{in the case of}} CCIR System B and CCIR System G (European systems) and 7.5 IRE units in the case of CCIR System M (American system). So, while there is no difference between the black and the blanking levels in most systems they differ by 50 mV. in system M. (When defined in terms of voltage difference, 7.5 IRE units is almost equal to 50 mV.) ...|$|E

It also generates a monochrome <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> and combined sync. The A3000 uses one Vidiot each for 15 kHz video and for 31 kHz (Amber) output. AGA Amigas use off-the-shelf DACs.|$|E

50|$|In <b>composite</b> <b>video,</b> the <b>signals</b> co-exist on {{different}} frequencies. To achieve this, the luminance signal must be low-pass filtered, dulling the image. As S-Video maintains the two as separate signals, such detrimental low-pass filtering for luminance is unnecessary, although the chrominance signal still has limited bandwidth relative to component video.|$|R
50|$|Both the PAL and the NTSC system use a {{quadrature}} amplitude modulated subcarrier {{carrying the}} chrominance information {{added to the}} luminance <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> to form a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> baseband <b>signal.</b> The frequency of this subcarrier is 4.43361875 MHz for PAL and NTSC 4.43, compared to 3.579545 MHz for NTSC 3.58. The SECAM system, on the other hand, uses a frequency modulation scheme on its two line alternate colour subcarriers 4.25000 and 4.40625 MHz.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{sync signal}} {{processing}} for asynchronously digitized <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> is presented. A simplified matched filter for sync extraction and a linear prediction method for sync pulse filtering improves image stability significantly {{in comparison with}} a conventional phase-locked-loop (PLL) approach.

A suitable hardware realization as an FIR-structure (Finite Impulse Response) simplifies the linear prediction and analytical computation of the filter coefficients. Relaxed time constraints suggest a serial, area-reduced implementation of the filter structures. 1.
