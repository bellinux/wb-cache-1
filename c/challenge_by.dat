5|$|In 2005, a Stanford robot won the DARPA Grand <b>Challenge</b> <b>by</b> driving {{autonomously}} for 131 {{miles along}} an unrehearsed desert trail. Two years later, {{a team from}} CMU won the DARPA Urban <b>Challenge</b> <b>by</b> autonomously navigating 55 miles in an Urban environment while adhering to traffic hazards and all traffic laws. In February 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.|$|E
5|$|A major {{crisis for}} the {{plutonium}} program occurred in July 1943, when Emilio Segrè's group confirmed that plutonium {{created in the}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained high levels of plutonium-240. Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of plutonium in a gun-type nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory met the <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> designing and building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} Steinitz {{publicly}} spoke of retiring, but {{changed his mind}} when Emanuel Lasker, 32 years younger and comparatively untested at the top level, challenged him. Lasker had been earlier that year refused a non-title <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> fellow German, Dr. Siegbert Tarrasch, {{who was at the}} time the world's most dominant tournament player.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, Vandervelde {{became the}} POB's first {{president}} but increasingly found his internationalism and reformism <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> {{a new generation}} of Belgian socialists. During the Spanish Civil War, Vandervelde's desire to intervene was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> Henri de Man and Paul-Henri Spaak.|$|R

5|$|Mangosuthu Buthelezi remains {{leader of}} the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) despite a <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> former IFP {{chairperson}} Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi, who formed the National Freedom Party (NFP) after her feud with Buthelezi. The NFP and IFP split {{the vote in the}} Zulu-dominated KwaZulu-Natal province in the previous local government elections, each getting an even share of the vote, while the ANC continued to dominate the former IFP stronghold.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} also blighted {{somewhat}} by injury, as Brown missed {{most of the}} second half of the season due to a broken leg sustained in a <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> Hearts midfielder Julien Brellier. He therefore missed the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat against Hearts, but he featured in the last Edinburgh derby of the season, coming on as a substitute in a 2–1 win for Hibs. Brown agreed a new contract with Hibs in March 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{downloadable}} content The Warpath Campaign was criticised by Game Watcher for not integrating {{into the}} original campaign and for only adding {{a few new}} units. Concerns were also voiced about the difficulty curve, though the reviewer felt the DLC provided players a <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> playing as the technologically backward Native Americans against the European interlopers.|$|E

5|$|The sixth {{match was}} an open <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> Deuce 'n Domino to any tag team for the WWE Tag Team Championship, which was {{accepted}} by Jimmy Snuka and Sgt. Slaughter. Snuka and Slaughter controlled most of the match; however, Deuce 'n Domino got the win after Deuce pinned Snuka. After the match, Deuce 'n Domino attacked Snuka and Slaughter until Tony Garea and Rick Martel came into the ring to assist Snuka and Slaughter.|$|E
5|$|Trinity, who was {{accompanied}} by The New York Connection (NYC) pairing of Johnny Swinger and Glenn Gilberti, fought an unknown opponent in an open <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> Trinity in the fifth bout. Jacqueline Moore made her TNA debut and answered the challenge. During the match, NYC interfered on Trinity's behalf by distracting Moore to allow Trinity to perform the Fall from Grace from the top rope to gain the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disruption}} to Banksia nomenclature {{occurred in}} 1891, when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. {{on the grounds}} that Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg had already penned the name Banksia to describe a different genus of plant, and hence Banksia J.R.Forst & G. Forst took precedence and rendered Banksia L.f. (i.e. as used by Linnaeus) invalid. Kuntze transferred all Banksia taxa to the new name Sirmuellera; thus B.dentata became Sirmuellera dentata (L.f.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge failed, as did a similar <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> James Britten in 1905. Britten proposed the generic name Isostylis, republishing B.dentata as Isostylis dentata (L.f.) Britten. In 1940 Banksia L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges.|$|E

5|$|As {{the time}} went past 90 minutes, {{an injury to}} Kevin Richardson held up play. TV cameras showed Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon telling his team-mates there was one minute remaining. The injury itself meant there would, in fact, be two minutes and 39 seconds of injury time played. Liverpool adopted time-wasting tactics, {{including}} an unnecessary backpass from McMahon to Grobbelaar. In the second minute of injury time, Arsenal launched their final attack. A Barnes run was intercepted by Richardson, and he passed the ball back to his goalkeeper John Lukic. Lukic bowled the ball out to Dixon, his long ball to Alan Smith was flicked on, finding Michael Thomas charging through the midfield. Thomas evaded a <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> Nicol and raced into the penalty area, slipping the ball past the advancing Grobbelaar to score Arsenal's second.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was forced}} to {{shoulder}} more responsibility in the batting order now that Bradman had retired and Sid Barnes took an extended break. The youngest player in the team, Harvey rose to the <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> establishing several Australian records. His Test figures of 660 at 132.00 was the most runs on a Test tour of South Africa by a visiting batsman, surpassing Len Hutton's previous mark by 83 runs, as were his 1,526 first-class runs at 76.30 and eight centuries on tour. His eight first-class centuries on one South African tour equalled the efforts of Denis Compton, Len Hutton and Arthur Morris.|$|E
5|$|Having, it is believed, {{purchased}} the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius {{was granted a}} ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe. In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' Tractatus de Globis. On 31 October 1598, despite a legal <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years. He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection. Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown {{by a number of}} legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it.|$|E

5|$|Hélio Castroneves, the {{defending}} champion of the Indy Japan 300, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Wheldon gained the lead from Castroneves on lap 44 and led {{for more than half}} of the 200 laps, but a pit stop with 14 laps remaining forced him to relinquish the top position. Kanaan took the lead because of a late pit stop by Dixon, and held off a late <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> Wheldon to secure first place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Clements faced Republican state {{attorney}} general Eldon S. Dummit. While Clements managed to keep the Democrats united following the primary, Dummit had fractured the Republicans by attacking the administration of sitting Republican governor Simeon S. Willis and his preferred successor during the Republican primary. Dummit mounted a meager <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> citing Clements' opposition to the Taft-Hartley Act, {{but this was not}} very effective. Dummit had replaced his campaign manager from the primary election, and when the ousted manager turned against him in the general election, it sounded the death knell for his campaign. Clements won the election by a vote of 387,795 to 287,756. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House to accept the governorship.|$|E
5|$|On the February 24 {{episode of}} Raw, Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman voiced their {{complaints}} about Lesnar {{not being in}} the WWE World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Instead, the Authority offered Lesnar a contract to face anyone else at WrestleMania. They were interrupted by a returning Undertaker, who confronted Lesnar. While Lesnar signed the contract for a match at WrestleMania with The Undertaker as his opponent, The Undertaker accepted Lesnar's <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> stabbing Lesnar with a pen and chokeslamming him through a table. This set up a match where Lesnar would attempt to break the Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania.|$|E

5|$|The Democratic primary for the 2010 United States Senate {{election}} in Pennsylvania {{took place on}} May 18, 2010, when Congressman Joe Sestak defeated incumbent Arlen Specter, {{which led to the}} end of Specter's five-term Senatorial career. Just {{prior to the start of}} the primary campaign, after serving in the Senate as a Republican for 29 years, Specter had switched to the Democratic Party in anticipation of a difficult primary <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> Pat Toomey; Sestak was ultimately defeated by Toomey in the general election. Political observers and journalists described the race between Specter and Sestak as one of the bitterest and most watched of all the 2010 primary elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{in favour of}} West Ham's bid was unanimous, although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue. Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> Tottenham and Leyton Orient, with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing {{less than a mile}} away from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and put them out of business. Both clubs' appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011. On 3 March 2011, West Ham's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and Mayor of London Boris Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the pyramid}} and {{mortuary}} temple of Nyuserre's mother, Khentkaus II, had begun during her husband's rule but was {{stopped in the}} tenth year of his reign, at which point only the pyramid core was still uncased. After a delay of 12 years, Nyuserre Ini restarted the building work, and expended much effort in completing {{the majority of the}} construction. The motivation for this might have been to legitimise his rule following the premature death of Neferefre and the possible <b>challenge</b> <b>by</b> Shepseskare.|$|E
