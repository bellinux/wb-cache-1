Gossard {{was asked}} to join Green River {{in order to allow}} Arm to {{concentrate}} exclusively on singing. By the time the band finished the recording of its debut EP, <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>Down,</b> Turner decided to leave the group, citing his distaste with Ament and Gossard's heavy metal leanings. He was replaced by Ament's former Deranged Diction bandmate, Bruce Fairweather.|$|E
500|$|Contrary to speculation, Henderson's {{refusal to}} officially retire {{had not been}} delaying his {{eligibility}} for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period {{has been based on}} major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, [...] "I believe today, and people say I’m crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them... they can always ring my phone and I'll <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{the band}} Green River {{released}} their debut EP <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>Down,</b> which is cited {{by many as}} being the very first grunge record. Another seminal release {{in the development of}} grunge was the Deep Six compilation, released by C/Z Records in 1986. The record featured multiple tracks by six bands: Green River, Soundgarden, Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, and The U-Men. For many of them it was their first appearance on record. The artists had [...] "a mostly heavy, aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore". The recording process was low-budget; each band was given four hours of studio time. As Jack Endino recalled, [...] "People just said, 'Well, what kind of music is this? This isn't metal, it's not punk, What is it?' [...] People went 'Eureka! These bands all have something in common.'" [...] Later that year Bruce Pavitt released the Sub Pop 100 compilation and Green River's Dry As a Bone EP as part of his new label, Sub Pop. An early Sub Pop catalog described the Green River EP as [...] "ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation". Sub Pop's Bruce Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman, inspired by other regional music scenes in music history, worked to ensure that their label projected a [...] "Seattle sound", reinforced by a similar style of production and album packaging. While music writer Michael Azerrad acknowledged that early grunge bands like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Tad had disparate sounds, he noted [...] "to the objective observer, there were some distinct similarities." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{released}} the EP <b>Come</b> <b>on</b> <b>Down</b> in 1985 and followed {{it up with}} Dry As a Bone in 1987, the first release from Sub Pop records. The band's only full-length studio album, Rehab Doll, was released in 1988. In-fighting within the band led to the group's break-up during the recording of Rehab Doll. A stylistic division had developed between Ament and Gossard on one side, and Arm on the other. Ament and Gossard wanted to pursue a major-label deal, while Arm wanted to remain independent, viewing the duo as being too careerist. The band achieved a considerable local reputation in Seattle and had a significant influence on the genre later known as grunge, with Green River being described as [...] "arguably the first grunge band." ...|$|E
