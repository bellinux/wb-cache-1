5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} by far the main {{contributor}} to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains at least 73 known <b>carcinogens,</b> including benzopyrene, NNK, 1,3-butadiene and a radioactive isotope of polonium, polonium-210. Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking (70% for women). Smoking accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases.|$|E
5|$|While in most {{countries}} industrial and domestic <b>carcinogens</b> have been identified and banned, tobacco smoking is still widespread.

5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to <b>carcinogens</b> and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Monomethylhydrazine, {{as well as}} its {{precursors}} methylformylhydrazine and gyromitrin and raw Gyromitra esculenta, {{have been}} shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals. Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from Gyromitra esculenta, and it is not known if the potential <b>carcinogens</b> can be completely removed by parboiling.|$|E
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide <b>carcinogens</b> that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may {{escape to the}} nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} {{is presented to}} the assessment of <b>carcinogen</b> risks in which the dominant effect of <b>carcinogen</b> exposure is life shortening and the impact falls both on those individuals who would have gotten cancer without the <b>carcinogen</b> exposure {{as well as the}} new cancer cases. This analysis is based on the interaction of age-specific tumor incidence rates and population survival in terms of age-specific mortality rates without the induced risk from <b>carcinogen</b> exposure. The analysis yields estimates for lifetime probability of developing cancer, average lifespan lost by the entire population, the average age of cancer occurrence, and the average lifespan loss of cancer cases. The approach utilizes the animal response data to assign, to the existing human cancer occurrence, and equivalent dose of the same <b>carcinogen</b> which is under consideration in terms of risk evaluation. The approach has the advantages of keying the estimates of <b>carcinogen</b> risks to those which already exist in the environment, advoiding large extrapolations from animal data, and encompassing the variability in susceptibility and <b>carcinogen</b> exposure in humans...|$|R

5|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports {{an increased risk}} of lung cancer from indoor air pollution related to the burning of wood, charcoal, dung or crop residue for cooking and heating. Women who are exposed to indoor coal smoke have about twice the risk and a number of the by-products of burning biomass are known or suspected <b>carcinogens.</b> This risk affects about 2.4billion people globally, and is believed to account for 1.5% of lung cancer deaths.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known <b>carcinogens,</b> were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be <b>carcinogens,</b> {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
