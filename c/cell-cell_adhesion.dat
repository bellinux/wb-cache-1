25|$|<b>Cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> {{complexes}} {{are essential}} {{for the formation of}} complex animal tissues. β-catenin is part of a protein complex that form the so-called adherens junctions. These <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> complexes are necessary for the creation and maintenance of epithelial cell layers and barriers. As a component of the complex, β-catenin can regulate cell growth and adhesion between cells. It may also be responsible for transmitting the contact inhibition signal that causes cells to stop dividing once the epithelial sheet is complete. The E-cadherin – β-catenin – α-catenin complex is weakly associated to actin filaments. Adherent junctions thus form a dynamic, rather than a stable link to the actin cytoskeleton.|$|E

40|$|The F-actin binding protein adducin {{plays an}} {{important}} role in plasma membrane stability, cell motility and cell-cell junctions. In this study, we demonstrate that alpha-adducin is mainly localized in the nucleus of sparsely cultured epithelial cells, whereas it is localized at cell-cell junctions when the cells are grown to confluence. Disruption of <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> induces a nuclear translocation of alpha-adducin. Conversely, alpha-adducin is redistributed to the cytoplasm and cell-cell junctions in the process of establishing <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions.</b> We identify that alpha-adducin contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in its COOH-terminal tail domain and a nuclear export signal in its neck region. The phosphorylation of alpha-adducin at Ser 716 that is immediately adjacent to the NLS appears to antagonize the function of the NLS. Moreover, we show that depletion of alpha-adducin has adverse effects on <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> and, to our surprise, cell proliferation. The impaired cell proliferation is associated with mitotic defects characterized by disorganized mitotic spindles, aberrant chromosomal congregation/segregation and abnormal centrosomes. Taken together, our results not only reveal the mechanism for alpha-adducin to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, but also highlight a potential role for alpha-adducin in mitosis...|$|R

Second, elevated Eph levels may disrupt <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> via cadherin, known to alter expression and localisation of Eph receptors and ephrins, which is known to further disrupt cellular adhesion, a key feature of metastatic cancers. Third, Eph activity may alter cell matrix interactions via integrins by the sequestering of signaling molecules following Eph receptor activation, as well as providing potential adherence via ephrin ligand binding following metastasis.|$|E
40|$|In this study, I {{used the}} serum-free MCDB 153 culture system to {{investigate}} calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. Treating normal human keratinocytes with high extracellular calcium concentrations (1 mM) increased {{the proportion of}} cells expressing differentiation-specific proteins. I showed {{that this was not}} caused by calcium-induced cell-cycle arrest, nor was it a consequence of stratification. However, the expression of differentiation-specific proteins was preceded by the formation of cadherin-mediated <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions.</b> The likely importance of the cadherin-mediated adhesions in initiation the differentiation program was confirmed in two ways. Firstly, clustering cell-surface E-cadherin in low extracellular calcium using monoclonal antibodies increased the proportion of keratinocytes expressing differentiation-specific proteins. Secondly, suppressing the formation of cadherin-mediated <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> using synthetic peptide analogous to the cadherin recognition domain attenuated the calcium-induced expression of differentiation-specific proteins. These data are consistent with a role for the cadherin-mediated <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> in initiating the keratinocyte differentiation program in response to calcium in vitro. A second aspect of this project involved an investigation of the role played by the Src-family of protein tyrosine kinases at calcium-induced cadherin-mediated adherens junctions. The ubiquitously expressed members of this family, c-Src, Fyn and c-Yes were localised to the cadherin-mediated adhesions formed in response to high extracellular calcium. Treating adherent keratinocytes maintained in low extracellular calcium with a specific Src kinase inhibitor, PD 162531, induced the assembly of cadherin-mediated <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> leading to the formation of contiguous groups of cells similar to those seen in response to high extracellular calcium. The data presented are consistent with a role for the Src kinases in regulating adherens junction turnover but do not exclude a role also in modulating aspects of differentiation...|$|R

40|$|The Ras target AF- 6 {{has been}} shown to serve as one of the {{peripheral}} components of <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions,</b> and is thought to participate in cell- cell adhesion regulation downstream of Ras. We here purified an AF- 6 - interacting protein with a molecular mass of ~ 220 kD (p 220) to investigate the function of AF- 6 at <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions.</b> The peptide sequences of p 220 were identical to the amino acid sequences of mouse Fam. Fam is homologous to a deubiquitinating enzyme in Drosophila, the product of the fat facets gene. Recent genetic analyses indicate that the deubiquitinating activity of the fat facets product plays a critical role in controlling the cell fate. We found that Fam accumulated at the cell-cell contact sites of MDCKII cells, but not at free ends of plasma membranes. Fam was partially colocalized with AF- 6 and interacted with AF- 6 in vivo and in vitro. We also showed that AF- 6 was ubiquitinated in intact cells, and that Fam prevented the ubiquitination of AF- 6. These results indicate that AF- 6 forms a complex with and serves as one of the substrates for Fam, and suggest that the degradation of peripheral components of <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> may be regulated by Fam...|$|R
25|$|The {{segments}} N-terminal and far C-terminal to the ARM domain do not adopt any {{structure in}} solution by themselves. Yet these intrinsically disordered regions {{play a crucial}} role in beta-catenin function. The N-terminal disordered region contains a conserved short linear motif responsible for binding of TrCP1 (also known as β-TrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase – but only when it is phosphorylated. Degradation of β-catenin is thus mediated by this N-terminal segment. The C-terminal region, on the other hand, is a strong transactivator when recruited onto DNA. This segment is not fully disordered: part of the C-terminal extension forms a stable helix that packs against the ARM domain, but may also engage separate binding partners. This small structural element (HelixC) caps the C-terminal end of the ARM domain, shielding its hydrophobic residues. HelixC is not necessary for beta-catenin to function in <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesion.</b> On the other hand, it is required for Wnt signaling: possibly to recruit various coactivators. Yet its exact partners among the general transcription complexes are still unknown. Notably, the C-terminal segment of β-catenin can mimic the effects of the entire Wnt pathway if artificially fused to the DNA binding domain of LEF1 transcription factor.|$|E

The normal protein is not sedimentable; meaning that it cannot be separated by centrifuging techniques. Its function is a complex issue that continues to be investigated. PrPC binds copper (II) ions with high affinity. The significance of this finding is not clear, but it is presumed to relate to PrP structure or function. PrPC is readily digested by proteinase K and can be liberated from the cell surface in vitro by the enzyme phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which cleaves the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycolipid anchor.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundEpithelial tissues undergo {{extensive}} collective movements during morphogenesis, repair, and renewal. Collective {{epithelial cell}} migration requires the intercellular coordination of <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> {{and the establishment}} of anterior-posterior polarity, while maintaining apical-basal polarity, but how this is achieved at the molecular level is not well understood. ResultsUsing an RNA interference-based screen to identify Rho family GTPase regulators required for the collective migration of human bronchial epithelial cells, we identified myosin-IXA (gene name: Myo 9 a). Depletion of myosin-IXA, a RhoGAP and actin motor protein, in collectively migrating cells led to altered organization of the actin cytoskeleton and tension-dependent disruption of <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions,</b> followed by an inability to form new adhesions resulting in cell scattering. Closer examination revealed that myosin-IXA is required during the formation of junction-associated actin bundles soon after cell-cell contact. Structure-function analysis of myosin-IXA revealed that the motor domain is necessary and sufficient for binding to actin filaments, whereas expression of the RhoGAP domain partially rescued the cell scattering phenotype induced by myosin-IXA depletion. Finally, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensor revealed a significant increase in Rho activity at nascent cell-cell contacts in myosin-IXA depleted cells compared to controls. ConclusionWe propose that myosin-IXA locally regulates Rho and the assembly of thin actin bundles associated with nascent <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> and that this is required to sustain the collective migration of epithelial cells...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the case}} of a herpes virus, initial {{interactions}} occur when two viral envelope glycoprotein called glycoprotein C (gC) and glycoprotein B (gB) [...] bind to a cell surface particle called heparan sulfate. Next, the major receptor binding protein, glycoprotein D (gD), binds specifically to at least one of three known entry receptors. These cell receptors include herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), nectin-1 and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate. The nectin receptors usually produce <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesion,</b> to provide a strong point of attachment for the virus to the host cell. These interactions bring the membrane surfaces into mutual proximity and allow for other glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope to interact with other cell surface molecules.|$|E
2500|$|Glycosylation is {{the process}} by which a {{carbohydrate}} is covalently attached to a target macromolecule, typically proteins and lipids. [...] This modification serves various functions. [...] For instance, some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated. [...] In other cases, proteins are not stable unless they contain oligosaccharides linked at the amide nitrogen of certain asparagine. The influence of glycosylation on the folding and stability of glycoprotein is twofold. Firstly, the highly soluble glycans may have a direct physicochemical stabilisation effect. Secondly, N-linked glycan mediate a critical quality control check point in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Glycosylation also plays a role in <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> (a mechanism employed by cells of the immune system) via sugar-binding proteins called lectins, which recognize specific carbohydrate moieties. Glycosylation is an important parameter in the optimization of many glycoprotein-based drugs such as monoclonal antibodies. Glycosylation also underpins the ABO blood group system. It is {{the presence or absence of}} glycosyltransferases which dictates which blood group antigens are presented and hence what antibody specificities are exhibited. This immunological role may well have driven the diversification of glycan heterogeneity and creates a barrier to zoonotic transmission of viruses. [...] In addition, glycosylation is often used by viruses to shield the underlying viral protein from immune recognition. A significant example is the dense glycan shield of the envelope spike of the human immunodeficiency virus.|$|E

40|$|Collective {{migration}} {{is a critical}} biological process that involves the coordinated migration {{of a group of}} cells connected via adherens junctions. These <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> are regulated by intracellular and extracellular calcium, and require controlled turnover {{in order to maintain the}} structural integrity of migrating cell sheets. In single fish keratocytes, intracellular calcium signaling via stretch-activated calcium channels facilitates migration by regulating cytoskeletal contractility and cell-substratum adhesion turnover. The role of calcium signaling in collectively migrating keratocyte sheets remains unknown. In this study, we investigate the effects of modulating the frequency of calcium transients in goldfish keratocyte sheets, using EGTA and Thapsigargin, on sheet morphology and cohesiveness. We also use varying serum concentrations and Gadolinium to investigate the role of serum and stretch-activated calcium channels, respectively, in the production of calcium transients and in the maintenance of sheet cohesiveness. We find that calcium transient frequencies diminish in the presence of EGTA, Thapsigargin, and Gadolinium, or in serum-free medium. These results suggest that, in keratocyte sheets, calcium transients occur via stretch-activated channels and require both extracellular calcium and intracellular calcium stores, as well as serum. Sheet area and cohesiveness decrease in Thapsigargin-treated cells, and sheet cohesion is reduced in cells treated with EGTA and serum-free medium. This suggests that keratocyte sheets require calcium transients for maintaining <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions.</b> We propose that serum and stretch-activated channels work in concert to regulate fluctuations in cytoskeletal contractility, thus facilitating the controlled turnover of adherens junctions needed to maintain <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> during collective migration...|$|R

40|$|Syk, a non-receptor {{tyrosine}} kinase, {{has been}} characterized recently as a tumor supressor in breast cancer whose expression is inversely correlated with malignancy. However the molecular mechanism by which Syk functions as a tumor suppressor is far from well defined. The interactions of a cell with neighboring cells and with the extracellular matrix (ECM) largely define the ability of tumor cells to become increasingly more malignant and to metastasize. This study attempts to elucidate in more detail the specific ways in which Syk regulates <b>cell-cell</b> and cell-ECM <b>adhesions.</b> ^ Here I report that active Syk promotes <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> while inhibiting cell motility. Syk was found to partially localize at cell-cell contacts in breast epithelial cells. Moreover, Syk recruits the adhesion proteins cortactin and vinculin to cell-cell contacts, where Syk physically interacts with cortactin. Furthermore, Syk can directly phosphorylate cortactin and enhance cortactin 2 ̆ 7 s phosphorylation in cells. Syk helps maintain breast tissue integrity by increasing <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions.</b> ^ The expression of Syk also inhibits cell motility. Vinculin is recruited from focal adhesions to adherens junctions when Syk is expressed in cells. However, Syk also inhibits the motility of cells lacking E-cadherin. In cell spreading on fibronectin, Syk partially relocalizes to the cell edge and colocalizes with F-actin. Upon engagement of integrins with antibodies or fibronectin, Syk is activated and induces additional protein phosphorylation. These data suggest that Syk participates in an integrin-stimulated signaling pathway to regulate cell motility. Furthermore, tyrosine 342 {{and the ability of}} Syk to traffic into the nucleus were found to be required for the signaling and for suppression of cell motility. The expression of Syk modifies the structure of the microtubule network, affecting cell spreading, cell size, the stability of microtubules to depolymerization and the rate of microtubule repolymerization. Syk co-localizes and associates with γ-tubulin in centrosomes. Interestingly Syk increases the expression of γ-tubulin. These data suggest that Syk modulates <b>cell-cell</b> <b>adhesions</b> and suppresses cell motility by participating in an integrin-stimulated signaling pathway coupled to changes in the microtubule network. ...|$|R
