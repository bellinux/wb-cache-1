5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and combined sewer overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the stormwater flowing into the stream is associated with a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>system</b> in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E

In dry weather, the CSS is able to convey all flows to the wastewater treatment facility. During periods of heavy rainfall, however, the capacity of the CSS may be exceeded and an untreated combination of sewage and storm water may discharged directly into a nearby receiving water. These overflow instances are called <b>Combined</b> <b>Sewer</b> Overflows, or CSOs. CSOs contain untreated domestic, industrial, and commercial wastes. Contaminants include suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), oils and grease, toxics, nutrients, floatables, pathogenic microorganisms and other pollutants. CSOs often contribute to exceedances of water quality standards and can result in threats to public health, aquatic species, and aquatic habitat. Under the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ’s CSO Control Policy, discharge permits issued to communities with CSSs are expected to include “nine minimum controls. ” The nine minimum controls are measures that can reduce the magnitude, frequency and impacts of CSOs without significant construction or expense.

40|$|International audienceThe {{dimensionless}} M(V) curves {{indicating the}} distribution of pollutant mass vs volume in stormwater discharges are used to compare pollutant discharges from different rainfall events and catchments. The M(V) curves are very variable and dispersed for each pollutant and {{for a series of}} rainfall events in a given catchment. From the analysis of 197 rainfall events in 12 separate and <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>systems,</b> the following results can be extracted: - in separate <b>sewer</b> <b>systems,</b> 80 % of the total pollutant mass is transported in the first 74 % of the total volume for 50 % of the rainfall events; - in <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> <b>systems,</b> 80 % of the total pollutant mass is transported in the first 79 % of the total volume for 50 % of the rainfall events. The characteristics of the M(V) curves depend on the pollutant, the site, the rainfall event and the functioning of the <b>sewer</b> <b>system.</b> No general multi-regression relationships can be established to explain their shape and their variability because of the complexity of the phenomena involved and the multiplicity of influencing factors. A new definition of the first flush is derived from the analysis of the M(V) curves, allowing a non-ambiguous quantification of a phenomenon which, up to now, was presented in a principally descriptive or qualitative manner. It is assumed that there is a significant first flush if at least 80 % of the total pollutant mass is transported in the first 30 % of the volume discharged during rainfall events. Previous definitions proposed by other authors are discussed with regard to the treatment of stormwater discharges. However, the concept of the first flush can not be used alone to establish a reliable methodology to design treatment facilities. Additional knowledge and information are necessary. From this point of view, the analysis of experimental M(V) curves is appropriate to base a design methodology which takes into account the intrinsic variability of the phenomena.
