5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> deep layer of regolith.|$|E
5|$|Eros Bendato ("Eros Bound"; 1999) {{is a large}} bronze head by {{sculptor}} Igor Mitoraj. Located on {{the corner}} of Eighth and Market streets, the statue lays sideways on a slanted granite circle, which is <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> steady stream of water.|$|E

5|$|Triton's south {{polar region}} is <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> highly {{reflective}} cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers.

These include unimproved calcareous grassland, scrubland and coppiced woodland including field maple and Ash. The range of habitats {{are home to}} many species of invertebrate.

5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> younger layer of rock.|$|E
5|$|An {{excavation}} led by Professor Glyn Daniel in 1937 {{identified the}} site as a chambered long barrow. However, more recently, long barrows have {{been defined as}} having long earthen mounds with wooden internal structures, whereas chambered tombs, while also being <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> long mound, have internal chambers built of stone. No long barrows with wooden internal structures {{have been identified in}} southeast Wales, perhaps because long barrows were usually built where there was no suitable stone.|$|E
5|$|Before {{settlers}} arrived, {{the land}} that became known as Forest Park was <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Douglas-fir forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into donation land claims filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep slopes and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} a {{parsable}} grammar is introduced. A definition of cover is provided which is a generalization of a well-known definition of cover. With this new definition of cover we prove that every parsable grammar is <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> LR(1) grammar or, if the language is prefic-free, <b>by</b> <b>a</b> strict-deterministic grammar. A consequence of this result is that every LR(k) grammar is <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> LR(1) or a strict deterministic grammar...|$|R
5|$|Croatia has a {{universal}} health care system, whose roots {{can be traced back}} to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen. The population is <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2012, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0billion kuna (€2.8billion). Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare.|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E
5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
