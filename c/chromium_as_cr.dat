40|$|There {{is a great}} {{interest}} for multilayer hard coatings because they exhibit enhanced properties resulting from their nanostructuration. Such coatings are frequently constituted of carbide and nitride and are generally deposited under very low pressure by plasma and PVD processes. These vacuum techniques enable the growth of heterostructures with nanometric thick individual layers and sharp interfaces, which are two requirements for advanced performances. However, both to develop more economical processes and {{with the goal of}} continuous deposition applications, the CVD processes operating under atmospheric pressure are particularly attractive. In this paper we show that the combination of pulsed direct liquid injection and the use of metalorganic precursor (DLI-MOCVD) is a promising route for the growth of nanostructured multilayer coatings under atmospheric pressure. Chromium metal as well as chromium carbide and nitrides monolithic coatings have been deposited at 773 K by this process using liquid solution of bis(benzene) <b>chromium</b> <b>as</b> <b>Cr</b> molecular precursor. Then, CrCx/CrN nanostructured multilayer coatings with a bilayer period as low as 50 nm have been grown.

Using the differential technique allowed us to obtain an unprecedented low level of scatter in our analysis, with standard deviations as low as 0. 05 dex, and mean errors as low as 0. 05 dex for [X/Fe]. By expanding our metallicity range with precise abundances from other works, {{we were able to}} precisely constrain Galactic chemical evolution models in a wide metallicity range (- 3. 6 < [Fe/H] < - 0. 4). The agreements and discrepancies found are key for further improvement of both models and observations. We also show that the LTE analysis of Cr II is a much more reliable source of abundance for <b>chromium,</b> <b>as</b> <b>Cr</b> I has important NLTE effects. These effects can be clearly seen when we compare the observed abundances of Cr I and Cr II with GCE models. While Cr I has a clear disagreement between model and observations, Cr II is very well modeled. We confirm tight increasing trends of Co and Zn toward lower metallicities, and a tight flat evolution of Ni relative to Fe. Our results strongly suggest inhomogeneous enrichment from hypernovae. Our precise stellar parameters results in a low star-to-star scatter (0. 04 dex) in the Li abundances of our sample, with a mean value about 0. 4 dex lower than the prediction from standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis; we also study the relation between lithium depletion and stellar mass, {{but it is difficult to}} assess a correlation due to the limited mass range. We find two blue straggler stars, based on their very depleted Li abundances. One of them shows intriguing abundance anomalies, including a possible zinc enhancement, suggesting that zinc may have been also produced by a former AGB companion.

Dietary treatments per kg of feed were as follows: 0 (CT), 0. 3 mg/kg (T 1), 0. 6 mg/kg (T 2) and 0. 9 mg/kg (T 3) Cr (in the form of CrMet; as-fed basis), and each treatment was replicated five times with 8 to 10 pigs per replicate pen. During the 28 d of the experiment, both the ADG and the ADFI increased linearly (p< 0. 05) {{as the level of}} dietary Cr increased. The F/G ratio decreased linearly (p< 0. 05). As dietary Cr increased, loin muscle areas (linear, p = 0. 013) and average backfat thickness (linear, p = 0. 072) decreased. Shear force (linear, p = 0. 070) and Commission Internationale de I’Éclairage (CIE) redness (quadratic, p = 0. 028) were increased.

The main sources of water contamination include industrialization (chemical industries, e.g. petrochemical, metal plating, paper and pulp, food, leather tanning, pharmaceutical, coal, textile, etc.), municipal wastewater, agricultural activities (use of pesticides and herbicides in agriculture, etc.) and other environmental and global changes (Zhou et al. 2015; Yao et al. 2016 a; Trujillo-reyes et al. 2014). Water pollution from heavy metals is a major concern especially in developing countries and Malawi is not an exception. The discharge of effluents containing heavy metals into water resources is a serious pollution problem which affects the quality of water supply.

Increasing concentrations of these metals in the water poses a serious threat to humans as they are non-degradable and toxic.

Concerning renal cell carcinoma, several heavy metals have been implicated as risk factors, namely cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). Herewith, we investigated the presence and distribution of heavy metals in samples of renal cell carcinoma, as well as adjacent renal tissue (control samples), in patients submitted to radical or partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. Samples from renal tumour and adjacent renal tissue were processed and observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with X-Ray Microanalysis (SEM-XRM), in order to detect and quantify heavy metals in situ, using the JEOL JSM- 6301 F microscope. Our results revealed {{a significant difference in}} the composition of heavy metals between the renal adjacent tissue (control) and the tumour tissue. No heavy metal particles were detected in the adjacent (control) tissue, by this technique, but the presence of heavy metals such <b>as</b> <b>chromium</b> (<b>Cr),</b> iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) were detected among other particles which could be seen in the tumour tissue samples. Our results might suggest a possible role of heavy metals in the oncogenic pathway of renal cell carcinoma. However, there is controversy regarding this topic: 1 - Is this anomalous sequestration of heavy metals just an epiphenomenon or is this a hint of a causal mechanism? 2 - Can heavy metals be used as biomarkers with potential diagnostic or prognostic interest? For example, could they be used to improve the diagnostic value of renal biopsy in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|High optical {{concentrations}} without excess heating in {{a stationary}} {{system can be}} achieved with a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC). Neodymium (Nd) and ytterbium (Yb) are excellent infrared LSC materials: inexpensive, abundant, efficient, and spectrally well-matched to high-performance silicon solar cells. These rare earth ions are reasonably transparent to their own radiation and capable of generating high optical concentrations. Neodymium's and ytterbium's disadvantage is their relatively poor absorption overlap with the visible spectrum. Transition metals such <b>as</b> <b>chromium</b> (<b>Cr),</b> titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V) have broadband absorption covering the visible and near-infrared and can efficiently sensitize neodymium and ytterbium through a non-radiative energy transfer process. Chromium, titanium, and vanadium containing glasses were fabricated using a custom designed glass making furnace. The optical properties including molar absorption coefficient, photoluminescence spectrum, and energy transfer characteristics were investigated to determine the suitability for LSC applications. Glasses containing Cr or V co-doped with Nd or Yb demonstrated energy transfer from the transition metal to the rare earth, a fundamental step toward integration into a LSC. Titanium co-doped glasses did not exhibit photoluminescence or energy transfer. Chromium co-doped glasses exhibit both forward and backward energy transfer. Vanadium holds the best promise as a sensitizer for LSC applications. by Nicholas John Thompson. Thesis (S. M.)
