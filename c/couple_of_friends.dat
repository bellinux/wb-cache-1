5|$|Cross Days follows Yuuki Ashikaga, a bespectacled young lad whose {{withdrawn}} {{school life}} goes awry when his affection for two girls begins to affect his relationships {{with his friends}} and peers.

In ten days, he saw 55 films at the festival, and Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves was the film that influenced him the most.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} founded December 8, 1987, when a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> at the University of Virginia joined {{together}} and said, [...] "Hey, let's sing other people's songs without instruments, and wear robes {{while we do}} it." [...] The group's history has taken them {{all around the world}} and allowed them to record several studio albums in what they refer to on their album inserts as [...] "Hullabasound".|$|E
2500|$|A nominal {{group is}} widely {{regarded}} as synonymous to noun phrase in other grammatical models. However, there are two major differences between the functional notion of a nominal group and the formal notion of a noun phrase that must be taken into account. Firstly, the coiner of the term, Halliday, and some of his followers draw a theoretical distinction between the terms group and phrase. Halliday argues that [...] "A phrase is different from a group in that, whereas a group is an expansion of a word, a phrase is a contraction of a clause". Halliday borrowed the term group from the linguist/classicist Sydney Allen. In the second place, the functional notion of nominal group differs from the formal notion of noun phrase because the first is anchored on the thing being described whereas the second is anchored on word classes. For that reason, one can analyse the nominal groups some friends and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> very similarly in terms of function: a thing/entity quantified in an imprecise fashion; whereas one must recognise some friends as being a simple noun phrase and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> as being a noun phrase embedded in another noun phrase (one noun phrase per noun). In short, these notions are different even if formalists do not perceive them as different.|$|E

LaMarche's {{childhood}} was filled with his [...] "own little world of cartoons and sixties television". It was not until his sophomore year of high school that he learned of the popularity his talent for mimicry could garner him. This realization came from a coincidental performance in a high school [...] "variety night" [...] when a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> urged him to enter. The act he performed at the variety night was [...] "celebrities as waiters" [...] which he actually used all the way up until the end of his stand-up career.|$|E
2500|$|Her friend's {{attitude}} immediately {{takes on}} a more threatening quality as a sudden lunar eclipse happens above them but before he can do anything he is confronted by Timbaland and SoShy's characters. [...] He tells them that this time he's brought a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends,</b> and the vampire and the cat man appear to back him up only for {{the three of them}} to be frightened away by much larger crowd that Timbaland summons. [...] The woman caught between the two sides looks down to see that her circular birthmark is glowing and looks like the eclipse, and the necklace worn by the vampire who was staring at her in the club.

60|$|The officer turned white; {{and would}} have burst out into a violent answer, had not a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> at his elbow begged him to {{restrain}} himself. The boy evidently meant nothing; besides, {{he was only a}} boy, and what could be done with him? Besides which, again, one of them put in, though he was only a boy, he looked an awkward customer. This latter argument weighed more with the lieutenant than any other.|$|E
6000|$|Valentin remained, {{and the two}} men, {{in their}} {{respective}} places, sat {{out the rest of}} the performance, which was also enjoyed by Mademoiselle Nioche and her truculent admirer.

60|$|Whatever {{they wanted}} to do, they did. They saw a few people--Dorothy, whose guest she was {{supposed}} to be, and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> of Skrebensky, young Oxford men, who called her Mrs. Skrebensky with entire simplicity. They treated her, indeed, with such respect, that she began to think she was really quite of the whole universe, of the old world {{as well as of the}} new. She forgot she was outside the pale of the old world. She thought she had brought it under the spell of her own, real world. And so she had.|$|E
6000|$|One day I took a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> from New York upstairs, {{who wished}} to be {{introduced}} to the President. It was after the hour for business calls, and we found him alone, and, for once, at leisure. Soon after the introduction, {{one of my friends}} took occasion to indorse, very decidedly, the President's Amnesty Proclamation, which had been severely censured by many friends of the Administration. Mr. S----'s approval touched Mr. Lincoln. He said, {{with a great deal of}} emphasis, and with an expression of countenance I shall never forget: [...] "When a man is sincerely penitent for his misdeeds, and gives satisfactory evidence of the same, he can safely be pardoned, and there is no exception to the rule!" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had only}} one more {{adventure}} on the train. Between Hartford and Springfield the train-boy came shouting with an armful of literature, and dropped a sample into a slumbering gentleman's lap, and the man woke up with a start. He was very angry, and he and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> discussed the outrage with much heat. They sent for the parlour-car conductor and described the matter, and were determined to have the boy expelled from his situation. The three complainants were wealthy Holyoke merchants, and {{it was evident that}} the conductor stood in some awe of them. He tried to pacify them, and explained that the boy was not under his authority, but under that of one of the news companies; but he accomplished nothing.|$|E

60|$|On {{the day of}} his {{departure}} from Urbino, he had ridden as far as Cagli, and halted at the house of the noble Messer Valdicampo. This had been placed at his disposal, and there he proposed to lie the night. They had supped--the Duke, de' Alvari, Gismondo Santi, MessÃ©r Valdicampo, his wife and two daughters, and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends,</b> potential citizens of Cagli, whom he had invited, that they might witness the honour that was being done his house. It waxed late, and the torpor that ensues upon the generous gratification of appetite was settling upon the company when Armstadt--Gian Maria's Swiss captain--entered and approached his master with the air of a man who is the bearer of news. He halted a pace or two from the Duke's high-backed chair, and stood eyeing Gian Maria in stupid patience.|$|E
6000|$|... as Dibdin has it. Now, look at {{the facts}} yourself, sir," [...] {{continued}} the stranger, with a recklessness half true, half assumed to escape from the malady of thought. [...] "I don't want to boast, sir; I only want to show you that I have some practical reason for wearing as my motto--'Never say die.' I have had the cholera twice, and yellow-jack beside: five several times I have had bullets through me; I have been bayoneted and left for dead; I have been shipwrecked three times--and once, as now, I was the only man who escaped; I have been fatted by savages for baking and eating, and got away with a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> only a day or two before the feast. One really narrow chance I had, which I never expected to squeeze through: but, on the whole, I have taken full precautions to prevent its recurrence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Johnson {{quotes from}} Spence a legend, that Prior, after {{spending}} {{an evening with}} Harley, St. John, Pope, and Swift, would go off and smoke a pipe with a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> of his, a soldier and his wife, in Long Acre. Those who have not read his late excellencyâ€™s poems should be warned that they smack not {{a little of the}} conversation of his Long Acre friends. Johnson speaks slightingly of his lyrics; but with due deference to the great Samuel, Priorâ€™s seem to me amongst the easiest, the richest, the most charmingly humorous of English lyrical poems.(111) Horace is always in his mind, and his song, and his philosophy, his good sense, his happy easy turns and melody, his loves, and his Epicureanism, bear a great resemblance to that most delightful and accomplished master. In reading his works, one is struck with their modern air, as well as by their happy similarity to the songs of the charming owner of the Sabine farm. In his verses addressed to Halifax, he says, writing of that endless theme to poets, the vanity of human wishesâ€” ...|$|E
