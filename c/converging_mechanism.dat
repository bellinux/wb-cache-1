Additionally, recent findings have also implicated mTORC 1 signaling abnormalities in a subset of nonsyndromic ASD, suggesting that defective mTORC 1 pathway may be a potential <b>converging</b> <b>mechanism</b> in ASD pathology across different etiologies. However, the mechanistic evidence for a causal link between aberrant mTORC 1 pathway activity and ASD neurobehavioral features varies depending on the ASD form involved. In this review, we first discuss six monogenic ASD-related syndromes, including both classical and potentially novel mTORopathies, highlighting their contribution {{to our understanding of the}} neurobiological mechanisms underlying ASD, and then we discuss existing evidence suggesting that aberrant mTORC 1 signaling may also play a role in nonsyndromic ASD...|$|E

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} {{is caused}} by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, leading to altered ion transport, chronic infection, and excessive inflammation. Here we investigated regulation of CFTR in airway cell monolayers by adenosine, adenosine receptors, and arachidonic acid. Our studies demonstrate that the A 2 B adenosine receptor is expressed at high levels relative to the other adenosine receptor subtypes, with a characteristic low-affinity profile for adenosine-stimulated CFTR Cl− currents in both Calu- 3 cells and CFBE 41 o- airway cell monolayers stably transduced with wild-type CFTR. The levels of adenosine found in sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis with moderate to severe lung disease stimulated apical prostaglandin release in Calu- 3 and CFBE 41 o- cells, implicating adenosine regulation of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activity. A 2 B adenosine receptor and arachidonic acid stimulation produced CFTR-dependent currents in airway monolayers and increased cAMP levels that were sensitive to cyclooxygenase inhibition. Arachidonic acid demonstrated dual regulation of CFTR, stimulating CFTR and Cl− currents in intact airway monolayers, and potently inhibiting PKA-activated Cl− currents in excised membrane patches. Cl− currents produced by arachidonic acid were sensitive to inhibition of PKA, cyclooxygenase, and 5 -lipoxygenase. Together, the results provide a <b>converging</b> <b>mechanism</b> to link regulation of CFTR and airway cell inflammation through adenosine and adenosine receptors...|$|E
30|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known how}} {{different}} general anesthetics that function as gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor agonists, alpha adrenergic receptor agonists, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists, dopamine receptor antagonists and opioid receptor agonists operate to achieve the common function of reversible loss of consciousness (Kennedy and Norman 2005; Brown et al. 2011; Kopp et al. 2009). Even though the concept of degeneracy whereby consciousness is produced by many mechanisms was introduced (Århem et al. 2003), {{it is not known}} how and where they block the neurobiological mechanism for consciousness. In this context, it is thought that the primary reason for not understanding the <b>converging</b> <b>mechanism</b> that leads to loss of consciousness is the lack of knowledge about the physiological process of consciousness (Århem et al. 2003; Beecher 1947). Once a framework for consciousness becomes available from neurobiological mechanisms, it should be able to explain a common mechanism of anesthetics. The lipophilic property of the anesthetics provides a common platform since various receptors upon which different anesthetics act are located within the lipid membranes. It is also known that the hydrophobic anesthetic molecules incorporated within the membrane can change the conformation of the receptor molecules and alter their function (Rosenberg et al. 1975; Miller and Pang 1976; Haydon et al. 1977; Trudell 1977; Vanderkooi et al. 1977; Franks and Lieb 1978). However, it is not known how the observed alteration in the functions of different types of receptors is associated with the common function of blocking consciousness.|$|E

The attention has been brought mainly to the study of lessons from the United States, Great Britain and France. Some other studies explore Russia (and former USSR), Ireland, Israel and Japan among others, while not many have sought to explain how the armed forces of states committed to fight against a long-lasting insurgency in a non-international armed conflict, amidst constrained economies and particular social and cultural settings, have undertaken the endeavour to innovate, emulate and adapt. The present dissertation explores three case studies featuring evidence of innovation, emulation and adaptation in Colombia, in which ‘defence ownership’ is introduced as the overarching concept identified as an enabler of military change in a developing country dealing with a non-international armed conflict.

In human normal primary keratinocytes and in colon and ovary carcinoma cells we obtained evidences for: (i) a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation without toxicity or apoptosis; (ii) a transition from a proliferative mesenchymal morphology to cell-specific differentiated structures; (iii) a noticeable increase in cell-cell and cell-substratum junctions; (iv) a relocation of the oncogenic beta-catenin at the cell-cell junctions; (v) inhibition of microtubules aggregation; (vi) upregulation of differentiation-related genes including p 53, heat shock protein 27 gene, N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1, E-cadherin, and downregulation of cyclooxygenase- 2; (vii) inhibition of c-Src tyrosine kinase.

The CAP has been recently restyled. In October 2011, the European Commission first released the CAP reform proposal (COM(2011) 625 / 3). The CAP 2014 - 2020 encompasses a revision of the first pillar policy and some novelties within the second pillar policy. In Italy, the reform also includes the introduction of uniform payments (regionalisation) with partial <b>converge</b> <b>mechanism</b> (so-called “Irish model”).

Here, we review the main alterations of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) within {{the central nervous system}} and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in order to discuss the intriguing observation that elements of the peripheral ECS mirror central dysfunctions of endocannabinoid signaling. As a consequence, elements of blood ECS might serve as novel, non-invasive diagnostic tools of several neurological disorders, and targeting the ECS might be useful for therapeutic purposes. In addition, we discuss the appealing working hypothesis that the presence of type- 1 cannabinoid receptors on the luminal side, and that of type- 2 cannabinoid receptors on the abluminal side of the blood-brain barrier, could drive a unidirectional transport of AEA in the luminal [...] > abluminal direction (i. e., from blood to brain), thus implying that blood may be a reservoir of AEA for the brain. On this basis, it can be expected that an unbalance of the endogenous tone of AEA in the blood may sustain a similar unbalance of its level within the brain, as demonstrated in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, depression and headache...|$|R
40|$|Besides its {{well-known}} regulatory role on circadian rhythm, the pineal gland hormone melatonin {{has other}} biological functions and a distinct metabolism in various cell types and peripheral tissues. In different tissues and organs, melatonin {{has been described}} {{to act as a}} paracrine and also as an intracrine and autocrine agent with overall homeostatic functions and pleiotropic effects that include cell protection and prosurvival factor. These latter effects, documented in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies, are sustained through both receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms that control detoxification and stress response genes, thus conferring protection against a number of xenobiotics and endobiotics produced by acute and chronic noxious stimuli. Redox-sensitive components are included in the cell protection signaling of melatonin and in the resulting transcriptional response that involves the control of NF-B, AP- 1, and Nrf 2. By these pathways, melatonin stimulates the expression of antioxidant and detoxification genes, acting in turn as a glutathione system enhancer. A further and <b>converging</b> <b>mechanism</b> of cell protection by this indoleamine described in different models seems to lie in the control of damage and signaling function of mitochondria that involves decreased production of reactive oxygen species and activation of the antiapoptotic and redox-sensitive element Bcl 2. Recent evidence suggests that upstream components in this mitochondrial route include the calmodulin pathway with its central role in melatonin signaling and the survival-promoting component of MAPKs, ERK 1 / 2. In this review article, we will discuss these and other molecular aspects of melatonin signaling relevant to cell protection and survival mechanisms...|$|E

Perturbations of the DISC 1 functions lead to behavioral changes in animal models, which are relevant to psychiatric conditions in patients. In this work, we have expressed the human DISC 1 gene in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and performed a genetic screening for the mutations of psychiatric risk genes that cause modifications of DISC 1 synaptic phenotypes at the neuromuscular junction. We found that DISC 1 interacts with dnrx 1, the Drosophila homolog of the human Neurexin (NRXN 1) gene, in the development of glutamatergic synapses. While overexpression of DISC 1 suppressed the total bouton area on the target muscles and stimulated active zone density in wild-type background, a partial reduction of the dnrx 1 activity negated the DISC 1 –mediated synaptic alterations. Likewise, overexpression of DISC 1 stimulated the expression of a glutamate receptor component, DGLURIIA, in wild-type background but not in the dnrx 1 heterozygous background. In addition, DISC 1 caused mislocalization of Discs large, the Drosophila PSD- 95 homolog, in the dnrx 1 heterozygous background. Analyses with a series of domain deletions have revealed the importance of axonal localization of the DISC 1 protein for efficient suppression of DNRX 1 in synaptic boutons. These results thus suggest an intriguing <b>converging</b> <b>mechanism</b> controlled by the interaction of DISC 1 and Neurexin in the developing glutamatergic synapses...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE Substantial clinical, pathological, {{and genetic}} overlap exists between {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). TDP- 43 inclusions {{have been found in}} both ALS and FTD cases (FTD-TDP). Recently, a repeat expansion in C 9 orf 72 was identified as the causal variant in a proportion of ALS and FTD cases. We sought to identify additional evidence for a common genetic basis for the spectrum of ALS-FTD. METHODS We used published genome-wide association studies data for 4, 377 ALS patients and 13, 017 controls, and 435 pathology-proven FTD-TDP cases and 1, 414 controls for genotype imputation. Data were analyzed in a joint meta-analysis, by replicating topmost associated hits of one disease in the other, and by using a conservative rank products analysis, allocating equal weight to ALS and FTD-TDP sample sizes. RESULTS Meta-analysis identified 19 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in C 9 orf 72 on chromosome 9 p 21. 2 (lowest p = 2. 6 × 10 (- 12)) and 1 SNP in UNC 13 A on chromosome 19 p 13. 11 (p = 1. 0 × 10 (- 11)) as shared susceptibility loci for ALS and FTD-TDP. Conditioning on the 9 p 21. 2 genotype increased statistical significance at UNC 13 A. A third signal, on chromosome 8 q 24. 13 at the SPG 8 locus coding for strumpellin (p = 3. 91 × 10 (- 7)) was replicated in an independent cohort of 4, 056 ALS patients and 3, 958 controls (p = 0. 026; combined analysis p = 1. 01 × 10 (- 7)). INTERPRETATION We identified common genetic variants in C 9 orf 72, but in addition in UNC 13 A that are shared between ALS and FTD. UNC 13 A provides a novel link between ALS and FTD-TDP, and identifies changes in neurotransmitter release and synaptic function as a <b>converging</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the pathogenesis of ALS and FTD-TDP...|$|E

40|$|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 23 (SCA 23) {{is caused}} by {{missense}} mutations in prodynorphin, encoding the precursor protein for the opioid neuropeptides a -neoendorphin, Dynorphin (Dyn) A and Dyn B, leading to neurotoxic elevated mutant Dyn A levels. Dyn A acts on opioid receptors to reduce pain in the spinal cord, but its cerebellar function remains largely unknown. Increased concentration of or prolonged exposure to Dyn A is neurotoxic and these deleterious effects are very likely caused by an N - methyl- D -aspartate-mediated non-opioid mechanism as Dyn A peptides were shown to bind NMDA receptors and potentiate their glutamate-evoked currents. In the present study, we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying SCA 23 -mutant Dyn A neurotoxicity. We show that SCA 23 mutations in the Dyn A-coding region disrupted peptide secondary structure leading {{to a loss of}} the N-terminal a -helix associated with decreased j -opioid receptor affinity. Additionally, the altered secondary structure led to increased peptide stability of R 6 W and R 9 C Dyn A, as these peptides showed marked degradation resistance, which coin- cided with decreased peptide solubility. Notably, L 5 S Dyn A displayed increased degradation and no aggregation. R 6 W and wt Dyn A peptides were most toxic to primary cerebellar neurons. For R 6 W Dyn A, this is likely because of a switch from opioid to NMDA- receptor signalling, while for wt Dyn A, this switch was not observed. We propose that the pathology of SCA 23 results from <b>converging</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of loss of opioid-mediated neuroprotection and NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity...|$|R

By providing information that prices alone cannot, product labeling {{has the potential to}} enable customers to respond to the “green” attributes of a product, allowing the preferences of customers and other stakeholders to influence company decisions con-cerning energy efficiency or other environmentally desirable objectives. Despite the potential for both producers and consumers to gain from better information, voluntary product labeling schemes addressing energy efficiency have not emerged in the absence of government intervention. Voluntary public poli-cies to label products have shown significant potential to in-fluence producer and consumer decisions. However, the me-chanics of these programs and the industry dynamics they produce remain largely unexplored. This paper describes two voluntary labeling programs in order to illustrate two different mechanisms that have become common archetypes in voluntary initiatives. <b>Converging</b> <b>mechanisms</b> lead all targeted firms to adopt a similar, desired behavior.

40|$|Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an {{inherited}} disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism presenting with lifethreatening cerebral oedema and dysmyelination in affected individuals. Treatment requires life-long dietary restriction and monitoring of branched-chain amino acids to avoid brain injury. Despite careful management, children commonly suffer metabolic decompensation {{in the context}} of catabolic stress associated with non-specific illness. The mechanisms underlying this decompensation and brain injury are poorly understood. Using recently developed mouse models of classic and intermediate maple syrup urine disease, we assessed biochemical, behavioural and neuropathological changes that occurred during encephalopathy in these mice. Here, we show that rapid brain leucine accumulation displaces other essential amino acids resulting in neurotransmitter depletion and disruption of normal brain growth and development. A novel approach of administering norleucine to heterozygous mothers of classic maple syrup urine disease pups reduced branched-chain amino acid accumulation in milk as well as blood and brain of these pups to enhance survival. Similarly, norleucine substantially delayed encephalopathy in intermediate maple syrup urine disease mice placed on a high protein diet that mimics the catabolic stress shown to cause encephalopathy in human maple syrup urine disease. Current findings suggest two <b>converging</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of brain injury in maple syrup urine disease including: (i) neurotransmitter deficiencies and growth restriction associated with branchedchain amino acid accumulation and (ii) energy deprivation through Krebs cycle disruption associated with branched-chain ketoacid accumulation. Both classic and intermediate models appear to be useful to study the mechanism of brain injury and potential treatment strategies for maple syrup urine disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: T cell {{production}} of RANKL, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), and other cytokines in inflammatory {{processes such as}} rheumatoid arthritis or secondary to conditions such as estrogen deficiency stimulates osteoclast activity, which leads to bone resorption and bone loss. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the effects of interleukin- 15 (IL- 15), a master T cell growth factor whose role in bone remodeling remains unknown. METHODS: We used mice lacking the IL- 15 receptor (IL- 15 Ralpha(-/-)) to investigate the effects of IL- 15 on osteoclast development, T cell and dendritic cell activation in vitro and in vivo, bone mass, and microarchitecture in intact and ovariectomized (OVX) mice. RESULTS: In wild-type (WT) animals, IL- 15 and RANKL provided a costimulatory signal for osteoclast development. Spleens from IL- 15 Ralpha(-/-) mice contained few c-Kit+ osteoclast precursors, and the expression of NF-ATc 1 and the osteoclastogenic response to RANKL were impaired. In addition, dendritic cell-dependent and T cell-dependent mechanisms of osteoclast activation, including RANKL and IFNgamma production, were impaired in IL- 15 Ralpha(-/-) mice. In turn, IL- 15 Ralpha(-/-) T cells failed to stimulate WT osteoclasts, whereas WT T cells failed to stimulate IL- 15 Ralpha(-/-) osteoclasts. Compared with WT mice, both intact and OVX IL- 15 Ralpha(-/-) mice had significantly greater bone mineral density and microarchitecture, including a higher trabecular bone volume fraction and cortical thickness. The numbers of osteoclasts on the bone surface as well as markers of bone turnover were significantly decreased in IL- 15 Ralpha(-/-) mice. CONCLUSION: In the absence of IL- 15 signaling, several <b>converging</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of osteoclastogenesis are inhibited, both directly and indirectly, through T cells, which leads to a high bone mass phenotype.

Our results concern the law of the so-called non-conformist urns, and answer in the asymptotic sense one of the open questions from the above mentioned paper. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} how {{secondary}} users can share the spectrum in a distributed fashion based on imitations. We propose an imitative spectrum access mechanism, where each secondary user estimates its expected throughput based on local observations, and imitates the channel selection of another user who achieves a higher throughput. We {{show that the}} imitative spectrum access <b>mechanism</b> <b>converges</b> to an imitation equilibrium, where no beneficial imitation can be further carried out on the time average. Numerical results show that {{when the number of}} users is large, the imitative spectrum access <b>mechanism</b> can <b>converge</b> to a Nash equilibrium, which is a special case of the imitation equilibrium.

40|$|Despite diverse origins, {{cellular}} fusion <b>mechanisms</b> <b>converge</b> at {{a pathway}} of phospholipid bilayer fusion. In this mini-review, we discuss how proteins can mediate {{each of the}} three major stages in the fusion pathway: contact, hemifusion, and the opening of an expanding fusion pore. the essential stages of the pathway will be first described for lipid bilayers, and then for biological membranes with an empha sis on the mechanisms by which proteins may drive each stage. An alternative pathway (Breckenridge and Almers, 1987; Jackson and Chapman, 2006), featuring a proteinaceous gap junction–like fusion pore, is discussed in Chernomordik and Kozlov (2005).

S. utility functions that include Scarf (1960) 's second example as a special case and shows {{by the use of}} numerical methods that (i) a Walrasian price adjustment <b>mechanism</b> <b>converges</b> to an equilibrium with very high probability and (ii) the weak axiom in revealed preference for market excess demands is satisfied with high probability, but the gross substitutability is rarely satisfied. Also, this paper suggests a possible interpretation of a Walrasian price adjustment that is based on the observations of experiments done by Anderson, Plott, Shimomura and Granat (2000) ...|$|R
