40|$|Floating-priced {{convertible}}s, {{known as}} "death spirals," are privately held convertible securities with a conversion price {{set at a}} discount from the average of past stock prices in a look-back period. The issuance of floating-priced convertibles is followed by significant negative abnormal returns. Two alternative hypotheses are explored. The "faulty contract hypothesis" argues that the contract design encourages short-selling by the convertible holders and other professional short sellers. The selling pressure and the conversion below fair value triggers a permanent decrease in the share price that generates a "death spiral. " The "lastresort financing hypothesis" argues that the stock price declines because the stock is overvalued {{at the time of}} the issue. Consistent with the faulty contract design hypothesis, the <b>conversion</b> <b>discount</b> is the most important predictor of long-term performance. Consistent with the last-resort financing hypothesis, issuers experience a significant decline in post-issue operating profitability relative to benchmark firms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a structural credit risk {{model of a}} bank that issues deposits, shareholders' equity, and fixed or floating coupon bonds {{in the form of}} contingent capital or subordinated debt. The return on the bank's assets follows a jump-diffusion process, and default-free interest rates are stochastic. The equilibrium pricing of the bank's deposits, contingent capital, and shareholders' equity is studied for various parameter values haracterizing the bank's risk and the contractual terms of its contingent capital. Allowing for the possibility of jumps in the bank's asset value, as might occur during a financial crisis, has distinctive implications for valuing contingent capital. Credit spreads on contingent capital are higher the lower is the value of shareholders' equity at which conversion occurs and the larger is the <b>conversion</b> <b>discount</b> from the bond's par value. The effect of requiring a decline in a financial stock price index for conversion (dual price trigger) is to make contingent capital more similar to non-convertible subordinated debt. The paper also examines the bank's incentive to increase risk when it issues different forms of contingent capital as well as subordinated debt. In general, a bank that issues contingent capital has a moral hazard incentive to raise its assets' risk of jumps, particularly when the value of equity at the conversion threshold is low. However, moral hazard when issuing contingent capital tends to be less than when issuing subordinated debt. Because it reduces effective leverage and the pressure for government bailouts, contingent capital deserves serious consideration as part of a package of reforms that stabilize the financial system and eliminate "Too-Big-to-Fail.

30|$|Following Winther and Achtenhagen (2008, p. 100), {{based on}} a {{systemic}} understanding of operational sub-processes and their reconstruction from real company data in real professional situations, commercial competence {{is defined as the}} ability to make business decisions and to validate them. From a theoretical and instructive perspective, one can distinguish between domain-linked (dl) and domain-specific (ds) facets of commercial competence, as proposed by Gelman and Greeno (1989). The domain-linked category refers to the notion of key vocational abilities, such as knowledge that is general but also relevant for solving vocational or professional problems. Domain-linked content is related to the general skills (mostly linguistic and mathematical) that are relevant in (commercial) occupational practice (Klotz et al. 2015); it differs from the content of the general education sector in its emphasis on professional relevance to economic areas. By way of an example, we might cite the understanding or reading of simple mathematical algorithms (e.g., the rule of three to calculate currency <b>conversions</b> or <b>discounts).</b> Domain-specific content includes specific sets of rules and a practical knowledge of a professional community, exclusively in commercial professions (Klotz and Winther 2016; Oates 2004; Winther et al. 2016 a).|$|R
40|$|The {{creative}} {{plan and}} statute of the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic {{prepared by the}} Englishman Sir Otto Niemeyer, established immediate and mediate functions. Among the first mentioned and which justified its rapid creation were: to adjust the volume of credit and the consequent demand for money, assuming {{the functions of the}} <b>Conversion</b> Bank, re <b>discount</b> commission and exchange control; to exercise a supervision over the other deposit banks, conserving their last cash reserves and government credit balances, apart from the intervention in the foreign debt; and to act as correspondent or agent for the other central bank. Among the second is included the intervention in the definite stability of the peso, since it was not timely to endeavour to do so immediately due to the international conclusion existing at that tim...|$|R

The proposition that sexual orientation can be changed therapeutically is widely questioned, and there is concern that such therapies reinforce social devaluation of homosexuality and bisexuality. At the same time, conservative religious individuals wish to seek treatment appropriate to them, which may include attempting to change or control sexual orientation. The ethical questions and clinical and social implications of this complex issue are discussed. Guidance to practitioners interested in this issue is offered, including references to policies of the American Psychological Association. When homosexuality was declassified as a treatable mental disorder nearly 30 years ago, it was assumed by many that the popularity of treatments intended to change sexual orientation would come to an end. At that time, treatments intended to change homosexual orientation, known as sexual orientation <b>conversion</b> therapy, were <b>discounted</b> by organized psychology and psychiatry as {{the last vestiges of}} an antiquated, prejudicial view of homosex-uality. Although conversion therapies are marginalized in main...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} basis for and magnitudes of discount factors based {{on the characteristics of}} greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) offsets that are applied to the GHGE reduction projects, concentrating on agricultural projects. Theoretical approaches to discount factors, estimation and incorporation of discount factors procedures are developed. Discount factors would be imposed by credit purchasers due to noncompliance with regulatory program of the credits with GHG program including consideration of shortfall penalties and limited durations. Discount factors are proposed for (i) additionality, (ii) leakage, (iii) permanence, and (iv) uncertainty. Additionality arise when the region where an AO project is being proposed would have substantial adoption of the AO practice in the absence of GHG programs (business as usual GHGE offset). Leakage arises when the effect of a program is offset by an induced increase in economic activity and accompanying emissions elsewhere. The leakage effect depends on demand and supply elasticities. Permanence reflects the saturation and volatility characteristics of carbon sequestration. Carbon is stored in a volatile form and can be released quickly to the atmosphere when an AO practice is discontinued. The permanence discount depends on the project design including practice continuation after the program and the dynamic rate of offset. Also, consideration of multiple offsets is important. Uncertainty arises due to the stochastic nature of project quantity. The uncertainty discount tends to be smaller the larger the size of the offset contract due to aggregation over space and time. The magnitude of these discounts is investigated in Southeast Texas rice discontinuation study. The additionality and the leakage discounts are found {{to play an important role}} in case of rice lands conversion to other crops but less so for pasture conversions and yet less for forest <b>conversions.</b> The permanence <b>discount</b> is important when converting to other crops and short rotation forestry. When all discounts are considered, rice lands conversion to forest yields claimable credits amounting to 52. 8 % ~ 77. 5 % of the total offset. When converting rice lands to pasture, the claimable credits 45. 1 % ~ 64. 2 %, while a conversion of rice lands to other crops yields claimable credits 38. 9 % ~ 40. 4 %...|$|R
