5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the presence of different objects.

5|$|The low status of—and {{subsequent}} discrimination against—women in India <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> many cultural norms.

5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. found two equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E

In 1156 Henry II of England, a member of the House of Anjou, took the castle from his brother Geoffrey after he had rebelled for a second time.

5|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two-decades of Free State rule in the Congo. Populations always fluctuate over time and notable shifts, known as demographic crises, are well-attested in pre-industrial societies. Noted examples include the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. It is argued that {{the reduction in the}} Congo was atypical and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate. Estimates {{of the size of the}} overall population decline (or mortality displacement) remain disputed but range between two and 13 million.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include {{a portrait of the}} priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a striking resemblance to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the United States {{government}} {{listed the}} southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live {{mostly in the}} Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in {{the population in the}} past ten years. These deaths <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> declines in Chinook salmon.|$|E
5|$|Mount Elbert is {{composed}} largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, {{as well as}} bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{damage from}} the storm totaled {{approximately}} $7 million, of which about $4 million <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the destruction of crops, notably rice and cotton. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941. The exercise was designed to test US troop training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II. The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result. Hundreds of military aircraft were forced to move inland for shelter.|$|E
