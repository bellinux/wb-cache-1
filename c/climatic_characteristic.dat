40|$|The scaling {{technique}} in calculating Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) has specific properties, {{which is considered}} in details, in this study. The Palmer scaling method contains a physically-based weighting factor called <b>climatic</b> <b>characteristic</b> coefficient, K. This factor, is the ratio of average moisture demand to average supply in a regional water balance, whose related coefficients and involved equation parameters should be calibrated according to any special case study. Therefore, in this study, the generalizing procedure of obtaining K-value with no dependency on particular area, in addition to some modifications in the process was analytically developed. The generalized procedure has an appropriate potential for various purposes such as; correctly identifying analytical K-formula, simplifying its application, recognizing its limitations and moreover {{it can be used}} in other researches for developing its advantages.

Low temperature and humidity (LTH) stress during soybean maturation in the field promotes pre-harvest mildew, resulting in damage to different organs of soybean fruits to different extents, but relatively little information on the resistance mechanisms in these fruits is available. Therefore, to understand the metabolic responses of soybean fruits to field mold (FM), the metabonomic variations induced by LTH were characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR), and the primary metabolites from the pod, seed coat and cotyledon of pre-harvest soybean were quantified. Analysis of FM-damaged soybean germplasms with different degrees of resistance to FM showed that extracts were dominated by 66 primary metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids and sugars. Each tissue had a characteristic metabolic profile, indicating that the metabolism of proline in the cotyledon, lysine in the seed coat, and sulfur in the pod play important roles in FM resistance. The primary-secondary metabolism interface and its potential contribution to FM resistance was investigated by targeted analyses of secondary metabolites. Both the seed coat and the pod have distinct but nonexclusive metabolic responses to FM, and these are functionally integrated into FM resistance mechanisms...|$|E

In this study, twelve monthly water balance models with different structures and various {{degree of complexity}} are compared in 153 catchments with different climatic conditions in China. Generally, the GR 5 M model has the best performance, followed by the GR 2 M and WBM model. We investigate the relations between model performance and catchment characteristics and find that the <b>climatic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a catchment {{is the most important}} factor impacting model performance. The models have better performance in wet catchments than in dry catchments. Large differences of model performance exist in dry catchments and model users should pay attention to model selection in dry catchments. In addition, we analyze the model performances among different models and conclude that increasing the model complexity does not guarantee a better model performance. Simple models can achieve comparable or even better performance than complex models, For the monthly simulation of hydrological processes, a two-parameter model is sufficient to achieve a good result. Moreover, by comparing the impacts of evapotranspiration simulation and runoff generation simulation on model performance, we find that evapotranspiration simulation has limited influence on the model performance. We suggest model builders focus on runoff generation process rather than evapotranspiration process to improve the performance of a monthly hydrological model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

Although {{it is well}} known that the frequent occurrence of dense fog is a common <b>climatic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of cloud forests around the world, it is poorly understood how fog processes shape and influence these ecosystems. Our study focuses on the physical character-istics of fog and quantifies the fogwater input to elfin cloud forest using direct eddy covariance net flux measurements during a 43 -day period in 2002. We used an ultrasonic anemometer-thermometer in combination with a size-resolving cloud droplet spectrometer capable of provid-ing number counts in 40 droplet size classes at a rate of 12. 5 times per second. Fog occurred during 85 % of the time, and dense fog with a visibility < 200 m persisted during 74 % of the period. Fog droplet size depended linearly on liquid water content (r 2 = 0. 89) with a volume-weighted mean diameter of 13. 8 µm. Due to the high frequency of occurrence of fog the total fogwater deposition measured with the eddy covariance method and corrected for condensation and advection effects in the persistent up-slope air flow, averaged 4. 36 mm d− 1, rainfall during the same period was 28 mm d− 1.

Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} the water stored in this seasonal snow cover is the primary source not only of river discharge but also groundwater recharge and plant available water during the growing season. Although the recorded interannual variability of snow cover is quite large, ongoing changes in climate, combined with accelerating rates of forest disturbance from insects, fire, and drought, differentially are affecting the amount, timing, and partitioning of snow cover to an extent not captured in the instrumental record. A critical knowledge gap exists in predicting how these concurrent changes in climate and vegetation in topographical complex mountain environments will affect future water resources both for society and for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This presentation addresses that knowledge gap through a meta analysis recent work on snowpack dynamics, runoff generation, catchment biogeochemistry, and ecosystem productivity from seasonally snow-covered forests along a gradient of snow depth and duration in the Intermountain West. Observations include long-term SNOTEL monitoring stations, CZO, LTER, and USDA observations of landsurface-atmosphere water and carbon exchange, and post disturbance observations from recently burned forests, and areas of extensive insect-induced forest mortality.

The <b>climatic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of extreme precipitations over shortterm intervals is an object of study in the watershed of Lake Maggiore, the second largest freshwater basin in Italy (located in the north-west of the country) and an important resource for tourism, fishing and commercial flower growing. The historical extreme rainfall series with high-resolution from 5 to 45 min and above: 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h collected at different gauges located at representative sites in the watershed of Lake Maggiore, have been computed to perform regional frequency analysis of annual maxima precipitation based on the Lmoments approach, and to produce growth curves for different return-period rainfall events. Because of different rainfallgenerating mechanisms in the watershed of Lake Maggiore such as elevation, no single parent distribution could be found for the entire study area. This paper concerns an investigation designed to give a first view of the temporal change and evolution of annual maxima precipitation, focusing particularly on both heavy and extreme events recorded at time intervals ranging from few minutes to 24 h and also to create and develop an extreme storm precipitation database, starting from historical sub-daily precipitation series distributed over the territory.

40|$|Rehabilitation of post-mining {{sites in}} semi-arid/subtropical environments of eastern Australia {{have a general}} {{objective}} to establish specific types of native vegetation communities as defined in mine closure plans and {{in relation to the}} specific biotic and abiotic requirements of such communities. Critical for the success of rehabilitation is the availability of water and hence the <b>climatic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of this geographical region which is defined by a number of weather-bound factors (e. g. potentially erratic rainfall and periods of drought and flooding). However, specific estimates of climate suitability are seldom incorporated into current mined land rehabilitation design. To address this, our analysis combined various broad-scale climatic parameters (i. e. primarily relating to rainfall) to assess bioregional suitability-susceptibility within the context of plant early-establishment in the objective of informing rehabilitation schemes as to the inherent environmental challenges influencing both short- and long-term ecological development. Following our survey of available climate data, we derived site suitability-susceptibility indexes (that are otherwise currently not available within rehabilitation schemes) and compared the performance of 9 mine site locations in which our Centre has been engaged in environmental monitoring (Weipa, Mt. Isa, Ernest Henry, Eromanga, Kidston, Curragh, Tarong, North Stradbroke Island, and Newnes Plateau). More specifically, the sites were ranked from most-to-least suitable and compared with natural vegetation patterns (as estimated by the mean NDVI). Overall, it was determined that regular rainfall and relatively short periods of water-deficit are key characteristics of climate suitability (as found among the relatively more temperate coastal-hinterland sites), whereas high rainfall variability and (or) prolonged seasonal drought are primary characteristics of unsuitability (as found among the arid central inland sites). Conceptual and practical considerations are provided which could inform rehabilitation schemes as to the inherent environmental challenges influencing both short- and long-term ecological development...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTrophic cascade {{hypotheses}} {{predict that}} fish {{will affect the}} structure and biomass of pelagic plankton communities. In order to investigate trophic cascade effects from fish down to phytoplankton, whole-lake studies were performed in five hypertrophic (mean total phosphorus (TP) concentrations higher than 1000 mgm− 3) shallow lakes located in the Pampa Plain. The main <b>climatic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of this region is the alternation between periods of drought and flood, with corresponding changes of lake depth and conductivity of lake water. All lakes were studied from April to December 2000. Samples were taken of their physical and chemical characteristics and biotic communities, focusing on the zooplankton community. Fish were manipulated in four lakes (Capurro, Longinotti, Vedia 1, Vedia 2), while the fifth (Lake Vedia 3) was left undisturbed as a reference system. High abundance of planktivorous minnows (Jenynsia multidentata and Cheirodon interruptus) dominated the fish community in the reference lake. In the manipulated lakes, fish stocks were largely reduced in late autumn (May). During winter, Capurro, Longinotti and Vedia 1 were stocked with a visual planktivore, the pampean silverside (Odontesthes bonariensis, Atherinidae). Fish stocking was 24, 33 and 19 kgha− 1, respectively. In contrast, no fish were stocked in Lake Vedia 2. Following fish removal, large Daphnia appeared in these lakes and grazed intensively on the phytoplankton. In contrast, no Daphnia {{were found in the}} reference lake (Vedia 3). The stocking of O. bonariensis in lakes Capurro, Longinotti and Vedia 1 led to a decrease in the percentage of large cladocerans and a rise in the phytoplankton biomass:TP ratio. Moreover, the lakes mentioned were stocked with different quantities of silversides over different periods of time. These differences were reflected temporarily in the plankton dynamics, affecting mainly larger sized zooplankton. Nevertheless, the presence of Daphnia was short lived in the lake where fish had been removed and no O. bonariensis were stocked. Competition for resources and recruitment of remaining fish probably caused a collapse in the zooplankton biomass. Our results support the idea that fish predation on zooplankton and its effect on phytoplankton is very intense in small pampean lakes. Fish removal was short lived, however. This could be because in small pampean lakes fish recolonization is favored, and minnows are highly prolific. Moreover, if manipulation of the trophic structure of lakes is undertaken in the pampean region, high nutrient loading from the watershed, climate and hydrology should also be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|The {{transferability}} of {{the regional}} climate model REMO with a standard setup over {{different regions of the}} world has been evaluated. The study is {{based on the idea that}} the modeling parameters and parameterizations in a regional climate model should be robust to adequately simulate the major <b>climatic</b> <b>characteristic</b> of different regions around the globe. If a model is not able to do that, there might be a chance of an “overtuning” to the “home-region”, which means that the model physics are tuned in a way that it might cover some more fundamental errors, e. g., in the dynamics. All simulations carried out in this study contribute to the joint effort by the international regional downscaling community called COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX). REMO has been integrated over six CORDEX domains forced with the so-called perfect boundary conditions obtained from the global reanalysis dataset ERA-Interim for the period 1989 to 2008. These six domains include Africa, Europe, North America, South America, West Asia and the Mediterranean region. Each of the six simulations was conducted with the identical model setup which allows investigating the transferability of a single model to regions with substantially different climate characteristics. For the consistent evaluation over the different domains, a new evaluation framework is presented by combining the Köppen-Trewartha climate classification with temperature-precipitation relationship plots and a probability density function (PDF) skill score method. The evaluation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of simulated precipitation and temperature, in comparison to observational datasets, shows that REMO is able to simulate the mean annual climatic features over all the domains quite reasonably, but still some biases remain. The regions over the Amazon and near the coast of major upwelling regions have a significant warm bias. Wet and dry biases appear over the mountainous regions and East Africa, respectively. The temperature over South America and precipitation over the tundra and highland climate of West Asia are misrepresented. The probable causes leading to these biases are discussed and ideas for improvements are suggested. The annual cycle of precipitation and temperature of major catchments in each domain are also well represented by REMO. The model has performed well in simulating the inter- and intra-seasonal characteristics of different climate types in different regions. Moreover, the model has a high ability in representing the general characteristics of different climate types as measured by the probability density function (PDF) skill score method. Although REMO seems to perform best over its home domain in Europe (domain of development and testing), the model has simulated quite well the climate characteristics of other regions with the same set of parameterization options. Therefore, these results lead us to the conclusion that REMO is well suited for long-term climate change simulations to examine projected future changes in all these regions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceKey {{climatic factors}} {{influencing}} {{the transport of}} pesticides to drains and to depth were identified. <b>Climatic</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as the timing of rainfall in relation to pesticide application may be more critical than average annual temperature and rainfall. The fate of three pesticides was simulated in nine contrasting soil types for two seasons, five application dates and six synthetic weather data series using the MACRO model, and predicted cumulative pesticide loads were analysed using statistical methods. RESULTS: Classification trees and Pearson correlations indicated that simulated losses in excess of 75 th percentile values (0. 046 mgm− 2 for leaching, 0. 042 mgm− 2 for drainage) generally occurred with large rainfall events following autumn application on clay soils, for both leaching and drainage scenarios. The amount and timing of winter rainfall were important factors, whatever the application period, and these interacted strongly with soil texture and pesticide mobility and persistence. Winter rainfall primarily influenced losses of less mobile and more persistent compounds, while short-term rainfall and temperature controlled leaching of the more mobile pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous <b>climatic</b> <b>characteristics</b> influenced pesticide loss, including the amount of precipitation {{as well as the}} timing of rainfall and extreme events in relation to application date.
