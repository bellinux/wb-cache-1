5000|$|The phone has a {{very high}} feature list for its time of release. It had three built in games and support for more by downloads. The three games which were bundled with the phone were Mozzies, which was awarded the title of best mobile game in 2003, Typegun, which was a game made for acquainting users to the keypad layout, and Sitris, a Tetris version with {{multiplayer}} support (via Bluetooth). In Mozzies, the Camera is used to detect the motion. So you have to position the gun on the flying mosquitoes which are superimposed on the video feed from the camera. The objective is to shoot down the mosquitoes by moving the phone around and clicking when you are aiming correctly. The phone also has {{a good number of}} connectivity options from Bluetooth to IrDA. It can also be used as a Fax Machine by connecting it to an appropriate device like a computer through the software provided. The File Manager allows sending and receiving of various files over either infrared or bluetooth. The phone has two shortcut keys on its side. One is used to start the camera and click pictures, while the other {{can be used to make}} a voice <b>command</b> <b>driven</b> call or start the voice memo. There is a built in picture editor which allows modification of images taken by the camera or any other type of image present on the phone. The phone has a few organizer capabilities. There are applications to take down short notes, a To-Do List, a scheduler application with reminders and a converter to convert currency and different measuring units.The mobile has been popular because of a Linux port to this mobile called [...] "Linux on SX1".|$|E
40|$|XPI is a table driven {{parameter}} interface which greatly simplifies both <b>command</b> <b>driven</b> {{programs such}} as BROWSE and XIMAGE as well as stand alone single-task programs. It moves all of the syntax and semantic parsing of commands and parameters out of the users code into common code and externally defined tables. This allows the programmer to concentrate on writing the code unique to the application rather than reinventing the user interface and for external graphical interfaces to interface with no changes to the <b>command</b> <b>driven</b> program. XPI also includes a compatibility library which allows programs written using the IRAF host interface (Mandel and Roll) to use XPI {{in place of the}} IRAF host interface...|$|E

40|$|In many situations, {{embedded}} menus {{represent an}} attractive {{alternative to the}} more traditional explicit menus, particularly in touchtext, spelling checkers, language-based program editors, and graphics-based systems. When compared to <b>command</b> <b>driven</b> systems, computer menu systems are appealing because they reduce memorization of commands, reduce training, and structure the user’s decision making. Menus can be categorized as either embedded or explicit (Koved, 1984), the difference being {{the context in which}} the menu items are presented...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} simplify and {{optimize}} {{the operation of}} our home made torque magnetometer we created a new software system. The architecture is based on parallel, independently running instrument handlers communicating with a main control program. All programs are designed as <b>command</b> <b>driven</b> state machines which greatly simplifies their maintenance and expansion. Moreover, as the main program may receive commands {{not only from the}} user interface, but also from other parallel running programs, an easy way of automation is achieved. A program working through a text file containing a sequence of commands and sending them to the main program suffices to automatically have the system conduct a complex set of measurements. In this paper we describe the system's architecture and its implementation in LabVIEW. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Rev. Sci. Inst...|$|E
40|$|Differential {{geometric}} {{system and}} control theory {{is used to}} develop a new dynamic system feedback technique for robot task space commands. The nonlinear robot arm system is feedback-linearized and simultaneously is output-decoupled by an appropriate nonlinear feedback and nonlinear coordinate transformation. On the joint space level, the scheme only <b>commands</b> <b>drive</b> forces or torques or their equivalent quantities addressed to the joint drives. An important property of the technique is that the planned and commanded task space trajectory together with its time derivatives directly drive the robot arm through a linear system model. A method for task space motion planning matching the requirements of the new scheme is briefly presented. The implications of the new technique for second and third order model robot arms with and without force feedback measuremnts and for two or more dynamically cooperating robot arms are discussed...|$|R

Now mourn thy fatal search, for since wise heaven More ill than good to mortals does dispense, It is not safe to have too quick a sense.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} the WD740GD {{had over}} its predecessor was Tagged Command Queuing, {{a feature that}} had previously been available only in SCSI <b>drives.</b> <b>Command</b> queuing resulted in a notable increase in the WD740GD's multi-user performance—a key discipline where its predecessor failed compared to SCSI <b>drives.</b> However, enabling <b>command</b> queuing on the WD740GD resulted in a performance decrease in single-user scenarios. It is worth noting that , only a few SATA controllers could fully support <b>command</b> queuing. This <b>drive</b> became immensely popular in high-end gaming systems because of these features.|$|R

40|$|The use of Electro-encephalography (EEG) for Brain Computer Interface (BCI) {{provides}} a cost-efficient, safe, portable {{and easy to}} use BCI for both healthy users and the disabled. This paper will first briefly review some of the current challenges in BCI research and then discuss two of them in more detail, namely modeling the "no command" (rest) state and the use of control paradigms in BCI. For effective prosthetic control of a BCI system or when employing BCI as an additional control-channel for gaming or other generic man machine interfacing, a user should not be required to be continuously in an active state, as is current practice. In our approach, the signals are first transduced by computing Gaussian probability distributions of signal features for each mental state, then a prior distribution of idle-state is inferred and subsequently adapted during use of the BCI. We furthermore investigate the effectiveness of introducing an intermediary state between state pro babilities and interface <b>command,</b> <b>driven</b> by a dynamic control law, and outline the strategies used by 2 subjects to achieve idle state BCI control...|$|E
40|$|Stata is a <b>command</b> <b>driven</b> program. It is {{a general}} purpose {{statistical}} software package which is used by people of different backgrounds and professional disciplines. Most STATA users, however, are non-physicians. Since it is used by people of all fields, most training programs offered are geared towards programmers and non-physicians. Although STATA has simple commands, these {{may be difficult for}} non-programmers to utilize. Generally, physicians are familiar with clicking rather than writing commands. To teach Emergency Medicine (EM) residents, we developed a teaching approach using "pull-down" menus. Emphasis was on teaching how to enter and import data. During the EM research rotation, residents were introduced to the STATA software, in addition to research methods. We also developed a manual explaining the basic operations of STATA. We observed that for EM residents, it was easy to learn and use "pull-down" menus. Providing introduction of Stata prior to data entry improved the accuracy of data recording and facilitated data analysis. It also provided EM residents experience in order to navigate STATA following the completion of the research rotation. Although basic functions of STATA can be learnt via this method, we feel {{that it is necessary to}} develop a training program which addresses the needs of physicians. ...|$|E
