5|$|Base animals {{selected}} for the two-stage grading up process to any EU herd book purebred class require a minimum of 3/4 Limousin content. Graded up females using the two-stage process then become eligible for entry into the main section of all EU herd book purebred classes as initial registration (or T.I.) Limousins when they reach 15/16 Limousin content. They are then legally identified as Limousin (i.e. 100% Limousin) – the breed code 34 often substitutes for the word Limousin in French discussions and reports on <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding.</b>|$|E
5|$|European Union law (EU law) has {{prescribed}} {{the structure}} of and relationships between all European cattle herd books since 1977. However, {{it was not until}} 2007 that the French Limousin Herd Book began a process of restructuring to comply with relevant EU regulations, directives and decisions. EU law affecting stud <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding</b> in Europe derives principally from an EU objective to achieve free movement of goods between member countries, and to address farmer and consumer protectionist and interventionist actions that oppose the principles of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Intervention by member countries in their agricultural sectors poses an obstacle to free trade in European countries, which EU legislation, among other things, attempts to address.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, {{the region}} was {{repopulated}} by Orthodox Bulgarians, beginning in the 1720s. In 1737–1738, the sultan amnestied the rebels and permitted {{the return of the}} insurgents' property in 1741, though none of the former residents is known to have returned. In the 1720s–1730s, Chiprovtsi had only 12 inhabited houses; by the 1750s, those had reached 150. The Orthodox Chiprovtsi Monastery had been reestablished in 1703 by a certain Zhivko who took the ecclesiastical name of Zoticus. As the interrupted mining was apparently not continued after the uprising and the international trade links had been severed, the locals switched to <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding,</b> agriculture, fur trade and later carpet weaving as their main occupation.|$|E

5|$|Porter {{edited the}} Constellation, a {{newspaper}} in New York City that published humorous stories. Porter became interested in sports, and concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, Porter published {{the first issue of}} a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The Spirit of the Times. Porter imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at Spirit of the Times failed quickly, and Porter sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the Traveller, and the Spirit was combined with the Traveller as the Traveller and Spirit of the Times. During the brief period that Porter operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When Porter sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New-Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 Porter purchased the Traveller and Spirit of the Times and renamed the newspaper back to Spirit of the Times, returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. Porter focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as <b>cattle</b> <b>breeding,</b> farm methods, books of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the need for different cut-off points, according to animal age and the purpose of testing, for two of the most widely used serological techniques in bovine neosporosis, IFAT and a crude antigen ELISA (Civtest®, HIPRA). Therefore, the population reference sera used were defined using a combination of multiple criteria such as epidemiological/clinical and histopathological parameters and an immunoblot test. Firstly, foetuses and <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle</b> (heifers and cows) were considered as separate subpopulations for serological evaluation. Secondly, cut-off points for each serological technique (IFAT and ELISA) according to age group (foetuses and <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle)</b> and the different practical applications (detection of infection and abortion) were calculated following the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Cut-off points were defined, for IFAT and ELISA for aborted <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle</b> and for IFAT alone in the case of the foetuses, assuming an equivalent cost of false positive and negative results. In infected <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle,</b> for IFAT and ELISA and in foetuses for ELISA, two possible cut-off values were obtained, one for a maximum sensitivity and one for a maximum specificity and the intervals of unclear results were defined. In this case, a cut-off value for equal sensitivity and specificity was also estimated. When cut-off points for infected <b>breeding</b> <b>cattle,</b> 1 : 100 - 1 : 250 for IFAT and 0. 306 - 0. 451 for ELISA were applied to a target population, optimal and similar negative and positive predictive values together with similar apparent and true prevalence results were observed suggesting the possibility of using both tests interchangeably...|$|R
