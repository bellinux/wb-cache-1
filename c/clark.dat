Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of <b>Clark</b> to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and <b>Clark</b> awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. <b>Clark</b> tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, <b>Clark</b> takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and <b>Clark</b> also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E

40|$|The paper compares Feinstein’s and <b>Clark’s</b> {{consumer}} price and real wage indices for the British industrial revolution. The sources for their weights and component price series are evaluated. While some of <b>Clark’s</b> innovations are improvements, {{many of his}} changes degrade the price index. A new price index is developed using the best components of <b>Clark’s</b> and Feinstein’s. This index is much closer to Feinstein’s than to <b>Clark’s.</b> The implied growth in real wages is also close to Feinstein’s and contradicts <b>Clark’s</b> ‘optimistic’ view of rising working class living standards during the industrial revolution...|$|R
