5|$|After {{two years}} of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in the mid-term {{elections}} in 1994, {{for the first time}} in forty years.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1796 {{was the first}} contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously; however, during his presidency, deep philosophical {{differences between the two}} leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – regarding domestic economic policy and U.S. foreign policy caused a rift between them, and led to the founding of the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. Thus, when Washington announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate for a third term, an intense partisan struggle for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> and the presidency began.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{victory in}} the Revolution, there were many {{proposals}} to build a monument to Washington. After his death, Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the national capital, but the decision was reversed when the Democratic-Republican Party (Jeffersonian Republicans) took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1801. The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become {{the symbol of the}} Federalist Party; furthermore the values of Republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men. They also blocked his image on coins or the celebration of his birthday. Further political squabbling, along with the North-South division on the Civil War, blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century. By that time, Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South, and memorials to him were no longer controversial.|$|E

25|$|The Mexican Constitution {{states that}} the President must be inaugurated by taking the oath <b>of</b> office before <b>Congress</b> in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. The PRD {{opposition}} had threatened to not allow Calderón to take {{the oath of office}} and be inaugurated as president. Ahead of claims that the PRD would disrupt the precedings, the PAN took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress's</b> main floor three days before the inauguration was scheduled.|$|R
50|$|Argentina held {{national}} {{parliamentary elections}} on 26 October 1997. This election {{was the second}} time of the peronist Justicialist Party defeated since 1985, while Justicialist Party maintained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Congress.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{election}} of 2006 {{was a call}} to change– not merely to change the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear {{about the need for}} a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{conservative}} Republicans took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{and opened}} investigations into communist infiltration {{of the federal}} government under Roosevelt. Congressman Richard Nixon accused Alger Hiss, a senior State Department official, of being a Soviet spy. Based on the testimony of Whittaker Chambers, an ex-Communist who became a leading anti-Communist and hero to conservatives, Hiss was convicted of perjury.|$|E
25|$|The Democrats {{gained control}} of the Senate, and had {{complete}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> having taken over the House in 1875. Hayes vetoed bills from the Democrats that outlawed the Republican Enforcement Acts; however, with the military underfunded, Hayes could not adequately enforce these laws. Blacks remained involved in Southern politics, particularly in Virginia, which was run by the biracial Readjuster Party.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, the PRI re-gained {{plurality}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Mexican <b>congress.</b> This is {{the first}} time congress will be controlled by the PRI since the first initial victory by the opposing party PAN in the year 2000.|$|R
50|$|In March 2017, {{opposition}} leaders branded President Nicolas Maduro a dictator after the Maduro-aligned Supreme Court - {{which had been}} overturning most National Assembly decisions since the opposition took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Congress</b> - took over the functions <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> pushing a lengthy political standoff to new heights. However, the Supreme Court quickly backed down and reversed its decision on 1 April 2017.|$|R
25|$|He was reelected in 1940, with Claude Pepper campaigning with him. Guffey {{was less}} {{influential}} after the Republicans took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Congress</b> and reversed {{some of the}} laws helping labor unions, eventually passing the Taft-Hartley Act after Guffey was defeated by Governor Edward Martin {{by a wide margin}} in 1946.|$|R
25|$|In 1916, Kellogg {{appeared}} before Congress and {{testified that the}} Bureau Indian affairs was a corrupt and inefficient administration. She advocated a bill introduced by Senator Harry Lane from Oregon that would abolish the Bureau of Indian Affairs {{and replace it with}} a commission, under direct <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> to consist of three men selected from among five nominees chosen by a council of Indians.|$|E
25|$|With the {{election}} of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, the Radicals had <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> {{the party and the}} army and attempted to build a solid Republican base in the South using the votes of Freedmen, Scalawags and Carpetbaggers, supported directly by U.S. Army detachments. Republicans all across the South formed local clubs called Union Leagues that effectively mobilized the voters, discussed issues and when necessary fought off Ku Klux Klan (KKK) attacks. Thousands died on both sides.|$|E
25|$|Gillmor was {{the ranking}} Republican on the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee. He also {{served on the}} Energy and Commerce Committee, and chaired its Environment and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee until the Republicans lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{following}} the 2006 elections. In 2006, Gillmor served {{as a member of}} a bipartisan reform task force on ethics and congressional mailing practices. He was a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership.|$|E
25|$|In November 2000, amid growing {{allegations}} {{of fraud and}} corruption within his administration, Fujimori agreed to hold new elections in 2001, and not to stand as a candidate. While he was attending the APEC forum in Brunei, Fujimori's party lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Congress.</b> Fujimori then flew to Japan, where he submitted his resignation and claimed Japanese citizenship.|$|R
50|$|The Federalists were {{strongest in}} New England, but also had {{strengths}} {{in the middle}} states. They elected Adams as president in 1796, when they <b>controlled</b> both houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> the Presidency, eight state legislatures and ten governorships.|$|R
50|$|The Republicans {{gained a}} net of 12 seats from the Democrats and gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Senate, 53 - 46 - 1. Majority and {{minority}} leaders Robert Byrd and Howard Baker exchanged places. This election {{marked the first}} time since 1954 that the Republican Party <b>controlled</b> either house <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> Despite large gains, Republican Senate candidates lost the popular vote.|$|R
25|$|Johnson {{was rewarded}} with an electoral {{landslide}} in 1964 against conservative Barry Goldwater, which broke the decades-long <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> by the Conservative coalition. However, the Republicans bounced back in 1966 and elected Richard Nixon in 1968. Nixon largely continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited; conservative reaction would come {{with the election of}} Ronald Reagan in 1980. Meanwhile, the American people completed a great migration from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained economic expansion.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, the Republicans made an {{unexpected}} comeback, and Roosevelt's efforts to purge the Democratic Party {{of his political}} opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> outvoted the urban liberals, and halted the expansion of New Deal ideas. Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities. In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, {{while the rest of}} the North favored Willkie 52%-48%.|$|E
25|$|Panic of 1873 created one of {{the worst}} and longest {{depressions}} in American history, seriously affecting every aspect of the economy and bringing the railroad expansion to a halt. The New York Stock Exchange closed for ten days. Of the country's 364 railroads, 89 went bankrupt, a total of 18,000 businesses failed between 1873 and 1875, unemployment reached 14% by 1876, during a time which became known in Britain as the Long Depression. Politically, the Democrats took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1874, the election of 1876 was deadlocked.|$|E
40|$|Republicans <b>control</b> {{both houses}} <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{as well as}} the presidency. Control means accountability, and large federal budget deficits do not {{harmonize}} with the Republican self-image of fiscal prudence. Thus, one of the top agenda items this spring and summer will be how to reduce the federal budget deficit...|$|R
50|$|The 1810 United States {{elections}} {{occurred in}} the middle of Democratic-Republican President James Madison's first term, during the First Party System. Members of the 12th United States Congress were chosen in this election. During the 12th Congress, Louisiana joined the union. Democratic-Republicans continued to <b>control</b> both chambers <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Roosevelt won 57% of {{the popular}} vote and carried all but six states. Historians and {{political}} scientists consider the 1932–36 elections to be realigning elections. Roosevelt's victory was enabled by the creation of the New Deal coalition, small farmers, the Southern whites, Catholics, big city political machines, labor unions, northern African Americans (southern ones were still disfranchised), Jews, intellectuals, and political liberals. The creation of the New Deal coalition transformed American politics and started what is called the [...] "New Deal Party System" [...] or (by political scientists) the Fifth Party System. Between the Civil War and 1929, Democrats had rarely <b>controlled</b> both houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> and had won just four of seventeen presidential elections; from 1932 to 1979, Democrats won eight of twelve presidential elections and generally <b>controlled</b> both houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|R
25|$|After law school, Coulter {{served as}} a law clerk, in Kansas City, for Pasco BowmanII of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. After a short time working in New York City in private practice, where she {{specialized}} in corporate law, Coulter left {{to work for the}} United States Senate Judiciary Committee after the Republican Party took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1994. She handled crime and immigration issues for Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan and helped craft legislation designed to expedite the deportation of aliens convicted of felonies. She later became a litigator with the Center for Individual Rights.|$|E
25|$|Congress has alternated between {{periods of}} {{constructive}} cooperation and compromise between parties known as bipartisanship and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting known as partisanship. The period after the Civil War {{was marked by}} partisanship {{as is the case}} today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades but that an alternation of <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.|$|E
25|$|The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 set maximum hours (44 per week) {{and minimum}} wages (25 cents per hour) for most {{categories}} of workers. Child labour of {{children under the}} age of 16 was forbidden, children under 18 years were forbidden to work in hazardous employment. As a result, the wages of 300,000 people were increased and the hours of 1.3million were reduced. It was the last major New Deal legislation that Roosevelt succeeded in enacting into law before the Conservative Coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats won <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> that year. While he could usually use the veto to restrain Congress, it could block any Roosevelt legislation it disliked.|$|E
50|$|After the {{election}} of Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1992, the Republican Party, led by House Republican Minority Whip Newt Gingrich campaigning on a Contract With America, were elected to majorities to both houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in the Republican Revolution of 1994. It {{was the first time}} since 1952 that the Republicans secured <b>control</b> <b>of</b> both houses <b>of</b> U.S. <b>Congress,</b> which, {{with the exception of the}} Senate during 2001-2002, was retained through 2006. This capture and subsequent holding <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> represented a major legislative turnaround, as Democrats <b>controlled</b> both houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> for the forty years preceding 1995, with the exception <b>of</b> the 1981-1987 <b>Congress</b> in which Republicans controlled the Senate.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, {{when the}} Republican Party gained {{majority}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Congress,</b> Bliley was elected Chairman of the House Commerce Committee, {{a position he}} held for six years. He was a principal author of several important laws including the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, {{also known as the}} [...] "Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act".|$|R
2500|$|After the {{election}} of Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1992, the Republican Party, led by House Republican Minority Whip Newt Gingrich campaigning on a [...] "Contract with America", were elected to majorities to both Houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in the Republican Revolution of 1994. It {{was the first time}} since 1952 that the Republicans secured <b>control</b> <b>of</b> both houses <b>of</b> U.S. <b>Congress,</b> which {{with the exception of the}} Senate during 2001–2002 was retained through 2006.

25|$|When Congress {{arrived in}} the new capital, they passed the Organic Act of 1801 to officially {{organize}} the District of Columbia and placed the entire federal territory, including the cities of Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria, under the exclusive <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> Further, the unincorporated territory within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington {{to the east of}} the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west. It included all of the present Arlington County, plus part of what is now the independent city of Alexandria. This Act formally established the borders of the area that would eventually become Arlington but the citizens located in the District were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, thus ending their representation in Congress.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{presence}} of candidates for the Pinu and the PDCH on the November 1981 ballot, {{it was clear that}} the election would be essentially a two-party affair between the PLH and PNH. On November 29, 1981, a total of 1,214,735 Hondurans, 80.7 percent of those registered, voted, giving the PLH a sweeping victory. Suazo Córdova won 636,392 votes (52.4 percent), the PNH 491,089 votes, and 48,582 votes were divided between the Pinu and the PDCH. The PLH also took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> winning forty-four seats; the PNH, thirty-four; the Pinu, three; and the PDCH, one. The PLH also won 61 percent of the municipal councils. Suazo Córdova was inaugurated as president of Honduras in January 1982, ending nearly a decade of military presidents.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's {{attacks on}} Wilson helped the Republicans win <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in the off-year {{elections}} of 1918. He declined {{a request from}} New York Republican to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's Fourteen Points, calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany. He was cautiously optimistic about the proposed League of Nations, but had reservations about its impact on United States sovereignty. Roosevelt was popular enough to contest the 1920 Republican nomination, but his health was broken by 1918 due to the lingering effects of malaria. His family and supporters threw their support behind Roosevelt's old military companion, General Leonard Wood, but Taft supporter Warren G. Harding defeated Wood on the tenth ballot of the 1920 Republican National Convention.|$|E

The party governed all states until 1989 and <b>controlled</b> both chambers <b>of</b> <b>congress</b> until 1997. As of 2017, the PRI has continued an uninterrupted {{hold of the}} governorship in five states: Coahuila, Colima, Campeche, Hidalgo and the State of Mexico.|$|R
5|$|When Harding {{joined the}} U.S. Senate, the Democrats <b>controlled</b> both houses <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> and {{were led by}} President Wilson. As a junior senator in the minority, Harding {{received}} unimportant committee assignments, but carried out those duties assiduously. He was a safe, conservative, Republican vote.
