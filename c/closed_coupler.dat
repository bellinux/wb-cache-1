40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} the probe-tube microphone and its use in measuring sound pressure in the ear canal. Specifically the paper studies the free field and the coupler calibrations of several probe-tube microphones with tubes of different sizes and determines which characteristics of a probe tube are necessary for accurate measurements in both a free field and in a <b>closed</b> <b>coupler...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} parametric study {{investigating the}} relative {{influence of the}} various microphone parameters affecting the <b>closed</b> <b>coupler</b> reciprocity measurements while computing the sensitivity of reference standard microphones using the well known MP. EXE program used by National Metrology Institutes of various countries. A design of experiments perspective using L (9) (3 (4)) orthogonal array and analysis of variance (ANOVA) method is presented for LS 1 P and LS 2 P microphones. The relative importance of microphone parameters on its sensitivity is evaluated in terms of percentage contribution using ANOVA methodology. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reciprocity}} {{calibration method}} uses two microphones acoustically {{connected by a}} coupler, a cylindrical cavity closed at each end by the diaphragms of the transmitting and receiving microphones. The acoustic transfer admittance of the microphones is the well-known pressure reciprocity calibration method using <b>closed</b> <b>couplers.</b> This reciprocity (microphones, electrical circuits, and acoustic coupler) and for determining the parameters that govern th...|$|R
40|$|We report {{significant}} {{advances in}} the development of simple all-fiber, tunable acousto-optic spectral filters based on null <b>couplers.</b> <b>Close</b> to ideal device performance characteristics have been obtained for the first time through improved control of the coupler uniformity. Furthermore, using a double pass arrangement, we demonstrate filter bandwidth reduction and improved side-lobe suppression of - 20 dB. The double pass configuration is also shown to double the frequency shifts obtainable from such device...|$|R
30|$|Figures 15 and 16 {{illustrate}} the general {{idea of the}} loading mechanism based on two candidate technologies to be investigated during the development phase. Moreover, the figure shows {{the position of a}} UV <b>coupler</b> <b>close</b> {{to the end of the}} guiding linear Paul trap. The 200 nm light used for the phase grating will also be used in the loading mechanism to discharge the test particles. Finally, an important part of the loading mechanism is a collimated IR beam (1 mm waist) used to propel the particles to the trapping region on top of the optical bench. The same beam will be used at the end of each measurement to dispose of the test particle. We estimate the technological readiness to be TRL  3.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{traditional}} white - red - dark blue colour scheme {{used on the}} TCDD HT65000 high-speed train sets, a white - turquoise - grey colour scheme has been selected for the livery of these trains. The appearance of the TCDD HT80000 is closer {{to that of the}} '2nd generation' Velaro trains (e.g. Eurostar E320) as opposed to the look of older Velaros like the ICE 3M, that have the lights <b>closer</b> to the <b>coupler,</b> as opposed to the newer position against the windscreen surrounds, although if you look more closely this is the fourth stage of evolution which can be seen on the outside with the new Velaro. The door windows are larger, square windows, as opposed to the airplane style oval windows on older Velaro models. All electrical equipment is covered, that also enhances aerodynamics.|$|R
40|$|Lizard {{ears are}} clear {{examples}} of two-input pressure-difference receivers, {{with up to}} 40 -dB differences in eardrum vibration amplitude in response to ipsi- and contralateral stimulus directions. The directionality is created by acoustical coupling of the eardrums and interaction of the direct and indirect sound components on the eardrum. The ensuing pressure-difference characteristics generate the highest directionality of any similar-sized terrestrial vertebrate ear. The aim {{of the present study}} was to measure the gain of the direct and indirect sound components in three lizard species: Anolis sagrei and Basiliscus vittatus (iguanids) and Hemidactylus frenatus (gekkonid) by laser vibrometry, using either free-field sound or a headphone and coupler for stimulation. The directivity of the ear of these lizards is pronounced in the frequency range from 2 to 5  kHz. The directivity is ovoidal, asymmetrical across the midline, but largely symmetrical across the interaural axis (i. e., front–back). Occlusion of the contralateral ear abolishes the directionality. We stimulated the two eardrums with a <b>coupler</b> <b>close</b> to the eardrum to measure the gain of the sound pathways. Within the frequency range of maximal directionality, the interaural transmission gain (compared to sound arriving directly) is close to or even exceeds unity, indicating a pronounced acoustical transparency of the lizard head and resonances in the interaural cavities. Our results show that the directionality of the lizard ear is caused by the acoustic interaction of the two eardrums. The results can be largely explained by a simple acoustical model based on an electrical analog circuit...|$|R
