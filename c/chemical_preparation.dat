2500|$|Chemical {{digestion}} {{follows a}} number of steps. [...] Initially the only chemical treatment used by researchers was treatment with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to remove humic substances; defloculation was accomplished through surface treatment or ultra-sonic treatment, although sonification may cause the pollen exine to rupture. The use of hydrofluoric acid (HF) to digest silicate minerals was introduced by Assarson and Granlund in 1924, greatly {{reducing the amount of}} time required to scan slides for palynomorphs. Palynological studies using peats presented a particular challenge {{because of the presence of}} well-preserved organic material, including fine rootlets, moss leaflets and organic litter. This was the last major challenge in the <b>chemical</b> <b>preparation</b> of materials for palynological study. Acetolysis was developed by Gunnar Erdtman and his brother to remove these fine cellulose materials by dissolving them. In acetolysis the specimen is treated with acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid, dissolving cellulistic materials and thus providing better visibility for palynomorphs.|$|E

60|$|Here ends {{my list of}} examples, {{in modern}} and ancient times, of a rite which deserves, though it {{probably}} will not receive, the attention of science.

The worst of it was that I had inserted a detonator and affixed a fuse, feeling quite secure in doing so, because I invariably locked the door and carried the key in my pocket.|$|E
