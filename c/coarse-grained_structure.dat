Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their mineralogy. The word [...] "granite" [...] comes from the Latin granum, a grain, {{in reference to the}} <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>structure</b> of such a holocrystalline rock. Strictly speaking, granite is an igneous rock with between 20% and 60% quartz by volume, and at least 35% of the total feldspar consisting of alkali feldspar, although commonly the term [...] "granite" [...] is used to refer to a wider range of coarse grained igneous rocks containing quartz and feldspar.|$|E
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{attraction of}} magnesium alloys lies in their extraordinarily good machining properties, in which respect they are superior even to screwing brass. The power required in cutting them is small, and extremely high speeds (5000 ft per min in some cases) may be used. The best cutting tools have special shapes, but the tools for machining other metals can be used, although somewhat lower efficiency results. When magnesium is cut at high speed, the tools should be sharp {{and should be}} cutting at all times. Dull, dragging tools operating at high speed may generate enough heat to ignite fine chips. Since chips and dust from grinding can therefore be a fire hazard, grinding {{should be done with}} a coolant, or with a device to concentrate the dust under water. The magnesium grinder should not be used also for ferrous metals, since a spark might ignite the accumulated dust. If a magnesium fire should start, it can be smothered with cast-iron turnings or dry sand, or with other materials prepared especially for the purpose. Water or liquid extinguishers should never be used, because they tend to scatter the fire. Actually, it is much more difficult to ignite magnesium chips and dust than is usually supposed, and for that reason they do not present great machining difficulties. The special techniques that must be used in fabricating magnesium (working, casting, and joining) add considerably to the manufacturing cost. In selecting between aluminium and magnesium or a given part, the base cost of the metal may not give much advantage to either, but usually the manufacturing operations make magnesium more expensive. [...] There is, perhaps, no group of alloys where extrusion is more important than it is to these, since the comparatively <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>structure</b> of the cast material makes most of them too susceptible to cracking to work by other means until sufficient deformation has been imparted to refine the grain. Therefore, except for one or two soft alloys, machining is invariably a preliminary step before other shaping processes.|$|E
40|$|Dynamics {{can provide}} deep {{insights}} into the functional mechanisms of proteins and protein complexes. For large protein complexes such as GroEL/GroES with more than 8, 000 residues, obtaining a fine-grained all-atom description of its normal mode motions can be computationally prohibitive and is often unnecessary. For this reason, coarse-grained models have been used successfully. However, most existing coarse-grained models use extremely simple potentials to represent the interactions within the <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>structures</b> and as a result, the dynamics obtained for the <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>structures</b> {{may not always be}} fully realistic. There is a gap between the quality of the dynamics of the <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>structures</b> given by all-atom models and that by coarse-grained models. In this work, we resolve an important question in protein dynamics computations [...] how can we efficiently construct coarse-grained models whose description of the dynamics of the <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>structures</b> remains as accurate as that given by all-atom models? Our method takes advantage of the sparseness of the Hessian matrix and achieves a high efficiency with a novel iterative matrix projection approach. The result is highly significant since it can provide descriptions of normal mode motions at an all-atom level of accuracy even for the largest biomolecular complexes. The application of our method to GroEL/GroES offers new {{insights into the}} mechanism of this biologically important chaperonin, such as that the conformational transitions of this protein complex in its functional cycle are even more strongly connected to the first few lowest frequency modes than with other coarse-grained models...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in the {{theoretical}} prediction of RNA folding is the prediction of loop structure from the sequence. RNA loop free energies are dependent on the loop sequence content. However, most current models account only for the loop length-dependence. The previously developed "Vfold" model (a coarse-grained RNA folding model) provides an effective method to generate the complete ensemble of coarse-grained RNA loop and junction conformations. However, {{due to the lack}} of sequence-dependent scoring parameters, the method is unable to identify the native and near-native structures from the sequence. In this study, using a previously developed iterative method for extracting the knowledge-based potential parameters from the known structures, we derive a set of dinucleotide-based statistical potentials for RNA loops and junctions. A unique advantage of the approach is its ability to go beyond the the (known) native structures by accounting for the full free energy landscape, including all the nonnative folds. The benchmark tests indicate that for given loop/junction sequences, the statistical potentials enable successful predictions for the <b>coarse-grained</b> 3 D <b>structures</b> from the complete conformational ensemble generated by the Vfold model.

40|$|Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) with a bimodal {{harmonic}} structure, {{which is}} defined as a <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>structure</b> surrounded by a network structure of fine grains, was fabricated using powder metallurgy to improve both the strength and ductility. The microstructure of the sintered compacts was characterized using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The areal fraction of the fine-grained structure in the harmonic structure tended to increase with the milling time. Tensile tests and four-point bending fatigue tests at a stress ratio of 0. 1 were performed in air at room temperature. The tensile strength, 0. 2 % proof stress and fatigue limit of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy with harmonic structure tended to increase as the areal fraction of the fine-grained structure increased. In contrast, elongation decreased due to the formation of a high areal fraction of the fine-grained structure (79. 0 %), which resulted in a reduction of the fatigue life with a low cycle regime. Thus, titanium alloy with high strength, ductility and fatigue resistance can be formed by optimization of the milling conditions. Furthermore, the mechanism for fatigue fracture of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy with a harmonic structure is discussed with respect to fractography and crystallography.

30|$|Despite {{the success}} of RNA {{secondary}} structure prediction for simple, short RNAs, the problem of predicting RNAs with long-range tertiary folds remains. Furthermore, RNA 3 D structure prediction is hampered {{by the lack of}} the knowledge about the tertiary contacts and their thermodynamic parameters.

40|$|The {{information}} hiding philosophy of object-oriented programming encourages localizing data structures within objects rather than sharing data globally across different classes of objects. This emphasis on local data leads naturally to fine-grained data abstractions, particularly in scientific simulations involving large collections of small, discrete physical or mathematical objects. This paper {{focuses on a}} subset of such simulations where dynamically reconfigurable links bind the objects together. It is demonstrated that fine-grained data structures reduce the complexity of local operations on the data at the potential expense of increased global operation complexity. Two metrics are used to describe data structures: granularity {{is the number of}} instantiations required to cover the data space, whereas extent is the continuously traversable length of the data along a given direction. These definitions are applied to two abstractions for simulating the turbulent motion of quantum vortices in superfluid liquid helium.

The contribution of individual modes and groups of modes are investigated for their effects on all residues in each loop by using Fourier analyses.

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{knowledge-based}} {{potential function}} {{is a powerful}} method for protein structure evaluation. A variety of formulations that evaluate single or multiple structural features of proteins have been developed and studied. The performance of functions is often evaluated by discrimination ability using decoy structures of target proteins. A function that can evaluate <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>structures</b> is advantageous from many aspects, such as relatively easy generation and manipulation of model structures; however, the reduction of structural representation is often accompanied by degradation of the structure discrimination performance. Results We developed a knowledge-based pseudo-energy calculating function for protein structure discrimination. The function (Discriminating Function using Main-chain Atom Coordinates, DFMAC) consists of six pseudo-energy calculation components that deal with different structural features. Only the main-chain atom coordinates of N, C α, and C atoms for the respective amino acid residues are required as input data for structure evaluation. The 231 target structures in 12 different types of decoy sets were separated into 154 and 77 targets, and function training and the subsequent performance test were performed using the respective target sets. Fifty-nine (76. 6 %) native and 68 (88. 3 %) near-native (α RMSD) targets in the test set were successfully identified. The average C α RMSD of the test set resulted in 1. 174 with the tuned parameters. The {{major part of the}} discrimination performance was supported by the orientation-dependent component.
