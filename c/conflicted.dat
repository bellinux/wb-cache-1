40|$|The {{title of}} this paper is The <b>Conflict</b> of Protagonist in Sidney Sheldon’s “If Tomorrow Come”. The matters {{relevant}} to the <b>conflicts</b> of the protagonist examined in this paper are the protagonist’s social <b>conflict,</b> psychological <b>conflicts,</b> and physical <b>conflicts.</b> The theory which is used to analyze the data is the theory about <b>conflict.</b> The theoretical concepts about the <b>conflict</b> are primarily taken from Bill Whiters and Keami’s ‘The <b>Conflict</b> and Communication Activity Book’ (2003). In this book, <b>conflict</b> is described as the <b>conflict</b> happen when what we want is different from what we can have. The theory used the concepts about the <b>conflict</b> are also taken from Kenney.

40|$|In this {{longitudinal}} study, we {{contribute to}} the contingency models of intragroup <b>conflict</b> by examining the moderating role of coping strategies {{in the evolution of}} <b>conflict</b> over time. We conceptualize coping strategy as a configural group property and focus on whether task <b>conflict</b> evolves into relationship <b>conflict</b> (<b>conflict</b> transformation) and on whether relationship <b>conflict</b> perpetuates over time (<b>conflict</b> escalation). We use a multilevel model to test the way in which individual <b>conflict</b> perceptions interact with other members’ coping strategies to influence the level of intragroup <b>conflict</b> at later stages. The results indicate that (a) the interaction between task <b>conflict</b> and problem-focused coping decreases the chances that task <b>conflict</b> transforms into relationships <b>conflict</b> and (b) the interaction between relationship <b>conflict</b> and emotion-focused coping decreases and the interaction between relationship <b>conflict</b> and problem-focused coping increases the chances that relationship <b>conflict</b> escalates over time.
