5000|$|In Italy, {{national}} police issue gun licenses to those {{over the age}} of 18 without criminal records, who are not mentally ill or known substance abusers, who can prove competence with firearm safety. A shooting sports license permits transporting unloaded firearms and firing them in designated shooting ranges. A hunting license allows holders to engage in hunting with firearms. A concealed carry license permits a person to carry a loaded firearm in public, and requires proving a [...] "valid reason" [...] to do so (e.g.: a security guard or a jeweler at risk of robbery). The number of firearms an individual may own and retain in their home is limited to three common handguns, six sporting handguns or long guns, an unlimited number of hunting long guns, and eight historical firearms (manufactured before 1890).

Owners of handguns, and any other firearm, under a <b>collector's</b> <b>license,</b> may exceed limits and own an unlimited number of handguns, but may not own ammunition for them and may not use them under any situation.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of DeSimone's efforts to {{organize}} the G.I. Joe <b>collectors,</b> Hasbro <b>licensed</b> DeSimone's G.I. Joe Collectors Club.

After Hasbro began collaborating with DeSimone, Hasbro executives {{realized that there was}} an untapped market of nostalgic collectors who had grown up on the original G.I. Joe and who wanted more. During the 1980s, the prices of vintage toys and especially G.I. Joe had increased astronomically because the demand for vintage toys like G.I. Joe and Captain Action far outstripped the supply.

40|$|The {{marine life}} {{industry}} in Florida {{is defined as}} the harvest of live marine specimens (fish and invertebrate species including plants, live rock and sand, and small “critters”) for commercial use, primarily aquariums. This paper summarizes data collected on the industry since 1990, including total landings, revenues, and trends over time. Regional analysis shows where the primary collecting areas are located in Florida. Seasonal analysis shows when the majority of landings occur within the year. Statistics on the number of participants by type (i. e., collector versus wholesaler) provide insight into the size of the industry. Trends are evaluated in terms of changes across the 9 -year period from 1990 to 1998. In general, the number of <b>licensed</b> <b>collectors</b> has increased substantially, landings of fish and animal invertebrates peaked in 1994, angelfish dominated the fish landings, live rock dominated the invertebrate landings, and the average landings per trip have remained relatively constant.

5000|$|Canada {{had a gun}} {{registry}} {{during the}} Second World War, when all people were compelled to register their firearms {{out of fear of}} enemy subversion. This registry in Canada was discontinued after the war; however, all handguns (restricted) have been subject to registration since 1934. In addition, fully automatic firearms have been prohibited (with grandfathering exemptions to existing, <b>licensed</b> <b>collectors</b> of full-automatic weapons and theatrical users) since 1977. A Firearms Acquisition Certificate (FAC) was required to purchase any firearm since its implementation in 1977, although additional restrictions applied for handguns (restricted - 1934) and fully automatic firearms (prohibited −1977). To obtain an FAC, no training was required until the Canadian Firearms Safety Course and Test program (non-restricted, restricted, or combined courses/tests) was created as a prerequisite in Bill C-17 in 1991. This formal training, once common in families and even schools, has been credited with the marked reduction of accidents involving the improper handling of firearms. Under bill C-17 (1991), and subsequent legislation and/or orders in council, short-barreled handguns and those firing [...]25 ACP and [...]32 ACP ammunition, and all handguns with a barrel length under 105mm (~4.1"), with the exception of certain guns typically used in shooting competitions, were added to the list of prohibited firearms. In addition, a large reclassification of firearms was made to place many firearms with certain cosmetic and functional characteristics into the category and registration of 'restricted' or 'prohibited' firearms. Some classes of these firearms have also been subject to grandfathering provisions of the law to owners and collectors, including some limited allowances of willing/gifting certain prohibited firearms to a family member to preserve them for historic value as pre-1945 collectors pieces.|$|R

It then proceeds to state that the petitioner had for several years been engaged in working for hire in a public laundry in the City and County of San Francisco, and complied with all the laws of the United States and of California and the ordinances of the city and county except in washing at the hours mentioned; that the business of carrying on a laundry is a lawful one, in which a large number of the subjects of the Emperor of China have been and are engaged in the said city and county within the limits prescribed by the ordinance; that there have been for several years great antipathy and hatred {{on the part of the}} residents of that city and county against the subjects of China residing and doing business there; that such antipathy and hatred have manifested themselves in various ways and under various forms for the purpose of compelling the subjects of China to quit and abandon their business and residence in the city and county and state; that owing to that feeling, and not otherwise, and not for any sanitary, police, or other legitimate purpose, but in order to force those subjects engaged in carrying on the business of a laundry in the City and County of San Francisco to abandon the exercise of their lawful vocation and their only means of livelihood, the supervisors passed the ordinance in question; that the petitioner has been and is earning his living exclusively by working at washing and ironing for hire, and in order to gain a livelihood is obliged to work late in the night, and has no other lawful vocation; that on the first of January 1884, his employer paid the <b>license</b> <b>collector</b> of the city and county six dollars, the amount required by the ordinance to obtain a license to carry on the business of a laundry, and obtained from him a license to carry on the business at a designated place within the prescribed limits. The petition also avers that section four of the ordinance is in contravention of the provisions of the Burlingame Treaty and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that it deprives them of the equal protection of the laws.|$|R
