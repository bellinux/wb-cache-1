Some are connected to a cumulus congestus <b>cloud,</b> some to a cumuliform <b>cloud</b> and some to a cumulonimbus <b>cloud.</b> In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cloud</b> to air {{lightning}} is when lightning from a <b>cloud</b> hits air of {{a different}} charge.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cloud</b> to <b>cloud</b> {{lightning}} {{is rarely}} seen and {{is when a}} bolt of lightning arcs from one <b>cloud</b> to another.|$|E
50|$|Stratus cumulogenitus <b>clouds</b> {{occur when}} the base of cumulus <b>clouds</b> spreads, {{creating}} a nebulous sheet of stratiform <b>clouds.</b> This can also occur on nimbostratus <b>clouds</b> (stratus nimbostratogenitus) and on cumulonimbus <b>clouds</b> (stratus cumulonimbogenitus). Stratus fractus <b>clouds</b> can also form under the base of precipitation-bearing <b>clouds</b> and are classified as pannus <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
40|$|The more {{sensitive}} the observations, {{the more complex}} the gas in our Galaxy appears. Since the detection of neutral hydrogen in 1951, each new survey has revealed new structure. Using the GALFA-HI survey, we have discovered five populations of compact neutral hydrogen <b>clouds.</b> We began by developing a machine-vision algorithm to identify compact <b>clouds</b> in the GALFA-HI Data Release 1. Based on position, velocity, and linewidth we separated the 1964 identified <b>clouds</b> into five populations: galaxy candidates, high-velocity <b>clouds,</b> cold low-velocity <b>clouds,</b> warm low-velocity <b>clouds,</b> and warm positive low-velocity <b>clouds</b> in the third Galactic quadrant. We found that the dust properties of the compact <b>clouds</b> support our population definitions. Using both IRAS and the newly released Planck data, we found no dust detections in the high-velocity <b>clouds,</b> or the warm positive low-velocity <b>clouds</b> in the third Galactic quadrant. We claim that the third quadrant <b>clouds</b> are low-velocity halo <b>clouds.</b> The warm low-velocity <b>clouds</b> have a significantly greater dust-to-gas ratio than the cold low-velocity <b>clouds.</b> We interpret this {{as evidence that the}} warm <b>clouds</b> have an ionized component not present with the cold <b>clouds,</b> possibly because {{they are part of the}} Galactic fountain...|$|R
500|$|Cumulonimbus <b>clouds</b> are {{the final}} form of growing cumulus <b>clouds.</b> They form when cumulus {{congestus}} <b>clouds</b> develop a strong updraft that propels their tops {{higher and higher}} into the atmosphere until they reach the tropopause at [...] in altitude. Cumulonimbus <b>clouds,</b> commonly called thunderheads, can produce high winds, torrential rain, lightning, gust fronts, waterspouts, funnel <b>clouds,</b> and tornadoes.

5000|$|In Māori mythology, Tāwhirimātea (or Tāwhiri) is {{the god of}} weather, {{including}} {{thunder and}} lightning, wind, <b>clouds</b> and storms. He is a son of Papatūānuku (earth mother) and Ranginui (sky father). In his anger at his brothers for separating their parents, Tāwhirimātea destroyed the forests of Tāne (god of forests), drove Tangaroa (god of the sea) and his progeny into the sea, pursued Rongo and Haumia-tiketike till {{they had to take}} refuge in the bosom of their mother Papa, and only found in Tūmatauenga a worthy opponent and eternal enemy (Tregear 1891:499). To fight his brothers, Tāwhirimātea gathered an army of his children, winds and <b>clouds</b> of different kinds - including Apū-hau ("fierce squall"), Apū-matangi, Ao-nui, Ao-roa, Ao-pōuri, Ao-pōtango, Ao-whētuma, Ao-whekere, Ao-kāhiwahiwa, Ao-kānapanapa, Ao-pākinakina, Ao-pakarea, and Ao-tākawe (Grey 1971). Grey translates these as 'fierce squalls, whirlwinds, dense <b>clouds,</b> massy <b>clouds,</b> dark <b>clouds,</b> gloomy thick <b>clouds,</b> fiery <b>clouds,</b> <b>clouds</b> which preceded hurricanes, <b>clouds</b> of fiery black, <b>clouds</b> reflecting glowing red light, <b>clouds</b> wildly drifting from all quarters and wildly bursting, <b>clouds</b> of thunder storms, and <b>clouds</b> hurriedly flying on' (Grey 1956:5).|$|R

5|$|On a bluff {{overlooking}} Zack and <b>Cloud,</b> who had hitched {{a ride on}} a truck, Shinra operatives {{decide to}} ignore orders {{to wait for the}} Turks. One takes aim at the incapacitated <b>Cloud.</b> Zack jumps in front of <b>Cloud,</b> yelling at him to escape.|$|E
5|$|Shinra pursue Zack and <b>Cloud,</b> {{and catch}} up with them just outside Midgar. Leaving the still semi-conscious <b>Cloud</b> hidden away, Zack fights off an {{enormous}} number of Shinra troops, but is ultimately fatally wounded. <b>Cloud</b> manages to crawl to Zack's body after Shinra has left, and Zack, in his dying breath, bequeaths the Buster Sword to <b>Cloud,</b> as Angeal had done to him. <b>Cloud</b> then begins to walk to Midgar. The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII, as <b>Cloud,</b> his memories confused, claims to be a former SOLDIER.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{is in the}} Local Interstellar <b>Cloud</b> or Local Fluff. It {{is thought}} to be near the {{neighbouring}} G-Cloud but it is not known if the Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar <b>Cloud,</b> or if it is in the region where the Local Interstellar <b>Cloud</b> and G-Cloud are interacting. The Local Interstellar <b>Cloud</b> is an area of denser <b>cloud</b> in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.|$|E
500|$|Some {{cumuliform}} <b>clouds</b> {{have been}} discovered on most other planets in the solar system. On Mars, the Viking Orbiter detected cirrocumulus and stratocumulus <b>clouds</b> forming via convection primarily near the polar icecaps. The Galileo space probe detected massive cumulonimbus <b>clouds</b> near the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. Cumuliform <b>clouds</b> have also been detected on Saturn. In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft determined that cumulus <b>clouds</b> near Saturn's south pole {{were part of a}} cyclone over [...] in diameter.

50|$|Another method {{considered}} for producing the warm polar temperatures were polar stratospheric <b>clouds.</b> Polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> are <b>clouds</b> {{that occur in}} the lower stratosphere at very low temperatures. Polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> have a great impact on radiative forcing. Due to their minimal albedo properties and their optical thickness, polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> act similar to a greenhouse gas and traps outgoing longwave radiation. Different types of polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> occur in the atmosphere: polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> that are created due to interactions with nitric or sulfuric acid and water (Type I) or polar stratospheric <b>clouds</b> that are created with only water ice (Type II).|$|R

5|$|The {{liquid water}} density within a cumulus <b>cloud</b> {{has been found}} to change with height above the <b>cloud</b> base rather than being {{approximately}} constant throughout the <b>cloud.</b> At the <b>cloud</b> base, the concentration was 0grams of liquid water per kilogram of air. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of the <b>cloud.</b> The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top of the <b>cloud,</b> where it immediately dropped to zero again.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} a funnel <b>cloud</b> and a condensation funnel. According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a funnel <b>cloud</b> is any rotating <b>cloud</b> pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating <b>cloud</b> which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation funnel is a broad term for any rotating <b>cloud</b> below a cumuliform <b>cloud.</b>|$|E
5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus <b>cloud</b> cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the <b>cloud</b> cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus <b>cloud</b> cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other <b>cloud</b> types, as lack of cirrus <b>cloud</b> cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this <b>cloud</b> covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E

5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using <b>cloud</b> seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a <b>cloud.</b> This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of <b>cloud</b> physics and weather modification.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} records of upper air {{observations}} carried out at Syowa Station in East Antarctica in 1979,characteristic features of Antarctic <b>clouds</b> were surveyed. As a result, vertical structures of <b>clouds</b> were classified into four types. <b>Clouds</b> of type I are defined as <b>clouds</b> which are formed in a nearly moist adiabatic vertical temperature profile. <b>Clouds</b> of type II are defined as <b>clouds</b> which are formed when the temperature profile is isothermal in the lower layer. <b>Clouds</b> of type III are defined as <b>clouds</b> which form in a strong surface inversion layer. <b>Clouds</b> type IV are defined as <b>clouds</b> which form in an inversion layer at middle level. This paper describes {{the relationship between these}} <b>clouds</b> and the synoptic fields in July 1979 {{as an example of a}} winter season. Type I <b>clouds</b> are connected with synoptic scale disturbances, type II are connected with subsidence inversions, type III are connected with inversions formed from surface cooling, and type IV often occured before or after a disturbance passed through Syowa Station...|$|R
50|$|Stratus {{nebulosus}} <b>clouds</b> {{appear as}} a featureless or nebulous veil or layer of stratus <b>clouds</b> with no distinctive features or structure. They are found at low altitudes, and {{is a good sign}} of atmospheric stability, which indicates continuous stable weather. Stratus nebulosus may produce light drizzle, or flakes of snow. Stratus fractus <b>clouds</b> on the other hand, appear with an irregular shape, and forms with a clearly fragmented or ragged appearance. They mostly appear under the precipitation of major rain-bearing <b>clouds.</b> These are the nimbostratus <b>clouds,</b> and the cumulonimbus <b>clouds,</b> and are classified as pannus <b>clouds.</b> Stratus fractus can also form beside mountain slopes, without the presence of nimbus <b>clouds</b> (<b>clouds</b> that precipitate), and their color can be from dark grey to almost white.|$|R
5|$|In the PlayStation Portable game , <b>Cloud</b> is {{presented}} as a young Shinra infantryman who befriends Zack.

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that <b>Cloud</b> never qualified for SOLDIER, and instead enlisted as an infantryman in Shinra's army. During {{the mission to}} Nibelheim, <b>Cloud</b> served under Sephiroth and Zack, a SOLDIER 1st Class, hiding his identity from the townspeople out of embarrassment. Following Sephiroth's defeat of Zack at the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, <b>Cloud</b> took up Zack's sword, catching Sephiroth off guard and stabbing him. Zack urges <b>Cloud</b> to kill Sephiroth after Sephiroth emerges alive, but when <b>Cloud</b> pursues him, he is run through by Sephiroth's sword. <b>Cloud,</b> to Sephiroth's shock, summons the strength to grab hold of the blade and lift Sephiroth off the ground, tossing him into a Mako vat below. <b>Cloud</b> and Zack are then imprisoned by Shinra's lead scientist, Hojo, for experimentation. Zack later escapes with <b>Cloud,</b> bringing him {{to the outskirts of}} Midgar before Shinra soldiers gun Zack down. Due to exposure to Mako radiation and the injection of Jenova's cells, in addition to the shame stemming from his personal failures, Cloud's mind fabricated a story blending together his own memories with accounts of Zack's heroics, creating a false personality. After piecing back together his identity, <b>Cloud</b> resumes his role as leader. At the game's conclusion, Sephiroth reappears in Cloud's mind a final time, but he is defeated in a one-on-one fight.|$|E
5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep.
