50|$|On 28 August 2012 {{there was}} a serious {{incident}} when police were called because of people reportedly {{on the roof of}} Wisbech District Hospital. Two local officers of the Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Wisbech Policing Team answered the <b>call.</b> <b>On</b> <b>arrival</b> they found one of the hospital's doctors had been assaulted by the group. As the two officers split up to search the hospital, one of the suspects, a woman armed with an axe, returned to the hospital making threats to kill, one police officer tackled the woman, disarming her and restraining her on the floor. Her colleague joined her and assisted in detaining the woman until help arrived.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} steady state {{behaviour}} of an M/G/ 1 retrial queue with non-persistent customers and two phases of heterogeneous service and different vacation policies. If the primary <b>call,</b> <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> finds the server busy, it becomes impatient {{and leaves the}} system with probability (1 - α) and with probabilityα, it enters into an orbit. The server provides preliminary first essential service (FES) and followed by second essential service (SES) to primary arriving calls or calls from the retrial group. On completion of SES the server may go for ith(i= 1, 2, 3,…,M) type of vacation with probability iβ (i= 1, 2, 3, [...] .,M) or may remain in the system to serve the next call, if any, with probability 0 β where ∑ = =Mi i 0 1 β. The steady state queue size distribution of number of customers in retrial group, expected number of customers in the retrial group and expected waiting time of the customers in the orbit are obtained. Some special cases are also discussed. A numerical illustration is also presented...|$|E

50|$|A {{doctor was}} <b>called</b> <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> at Denton and {{he arrived at}} the police station three hours later. He spent three or four minutes with the accused but was unable to {{complete}} his examination because he found his patient “un-cooperative”. He left Patterson lying naked on a cold stone floor and recommended that he be taken to Strangeways Prison Hospital. When he learned later that evening that this would not be possible he neither visited nor made any recommendation that Patterson be taken to some other hospital. At the inquest this doctor confirmed that he had failed to notice over thirty wounds to Patterson’s body (he saw wounds only to the face and head) that twelve other witnesses testified they had seen that day. The Coroner confessed himself “amazed” that a police doctor called to see a man who had spent the day lying naked on a concrete floor moaning and incoherent left him to remain in that condition without even suggesting that he be covered with a blanket or given a mattress. During {{the rest of the day}} his condition deteriorated and he suffered incontinence but was left by the police naked and injured on a bare stone floor lying in his own feces. Later that evening he was found dead in his cell. After six days in custody it was only after death that he was finally given a mattress and a blanket.|$|R
5000|$|Red Dwarf {{receives}} a distress {{call from a}} crashed spaceship, the Nova 5. As usual, Rimmer (Chris Barrie) claims this to be aliens. But according to the on-board service mechanoid that sent the distress call, Kryten (David Ross), the ship contains lifeforms of a much less hostile nature — three female crew members. The Red Dwarf crew boldly spruce themselves up {{to respond to the}} <b>call.</b> However, <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> the gang are shocked to find the droid character Kryten has been looking after, clothing and feeding three skeletons ever since the crash, and have been that way for centuries. Kryten however, takes some convincing. How will he cope now? What will he do? After all, he is programmed to serve on the human race (as he explains, [...] "I serve, therefore I am"). In the end, Lister (Craig Charles) takes pity on him and brings Kryten back to Red Dwarf.|$|R

40|$|Time {{synchronisation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and fundamental middleware services for wireless sensor networks. However, there is an apparent disconnect between existing time synchronisation implementations and the actual needs of current typical sensor network applications. To address this problem, we formulate a set of canonical time synchronisation services distilled from actual applications and propose a set of general application programming interfaces for providing them. We argue that these services can be implemented using a simple time-stamping primitive <b>called</b> Elapsed Time <b>on</b> <b>Arrival</b> (ETA) and we provide two such implementations. The Routing Integrated Time Synchronisation (RITS) is an extension of ETA over multiple hops. It is a reactive time synchronisation protocol that can be used to correlate multiple event detections at one or more locations to within microseconds. Rapid Time Synchronisation (RATS) is a proactive timesync protocol that utilises RITS to achieve network-wide synchronisation with microsecond precision and rapid convergence. Our work demonstrates that it is possible to build high-performance timesync services using the simple ETA primitive and suggests that more complex mechanisms may be unnecessary to meet the needs of many real world sensor network applications...|$|R

40|$|Presence {{technology}} {{is going to}} be an integral part of the next generation of communication technology. It can eliminate telephone tag between two parties (caller and callee), which will increase productivity of the parties and reduce unnecessary bandwidth usage of unwanted calls. In this paper, we propose a Willingness Estimator that computes willingness level of a callee for receiving calls from a specified caller. By knowing the willingness value of the callee the caller can decide on proceeding with the call or not. The proposed Willingness Estimator is tested with real mobile user data, and these results are highly accurate. We measure willingness based <b>on</b> <b>calling</b> patterns (<b>arrival</b> time, location, day) of a caller to a callee and this could serve as one of the future presence based services. The results can be used in telecommunication networks such as PSTN, Cellular networks, and Voice over IP networks...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> to hospital after out-of-hospital-cardiac arrest (OHCA) with the primary outcome of mortality, in the targeted temperature management (TTM) trial. Methods The TTM trial randomized 939 patients to TTM at 33 or 36 °C for 24 h. Patients were categorized according to their recorded body temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> and also categorized to groups of patients being actively cooled or passively rewarmed. Results OHCA patients having a temperature ≤ 34. 0 °C <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> at hospital had a significantly higher mortality compared to the OHCA patients with a higher temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival.</b> A low body temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> {{was associated with a}} longer time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and duration of transport time to hospital. Patients who were actively cooled or passively rewarmed during the first 4 h had similar mortality. In a multivariate logistic regression model mortality was significantly related to time from OHCA to ROSC, time from OHCA to advanced life support (ALS), age, sex and first registered rhythm. None of the temperature related variables (included the TTM-groups) were significantly related to mortality. Conclusion OHCA patients with a temperature ≤ 34. 0 °C <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> have a higher mortality than patients with a temperature ≥ 34. 1 °C <b>on</b> <b>arrival.</b> A low temperature <b>on</b> <b>arrival</b> is associated with a long time to ROSC.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{increasingly}} sophisticated workforce management tools, a significant gap remains between {{the goal of}} effective staffing and the present difficulty predicting the stochastic demand of inbound calls. We have investigated the hypothesized nonhomogeneous Poisson process model of modem pool callers of the University community. In our case, we tested if the arrivals could be approximated by a piecewise constant rate over short intervals. For each of 1 and 10 -minute intervals, based on the close relationship between the Poisson process and the exponential distribution, the test results did not show any sign of homogeneous Poisson process. We have examined the hypothesis of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process by a transformed statistic. Quantitative and graphical goodness-of-fit tests have confirmed nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Further analysis on the intensity function revealed that linear rate intensity was woefully inadequate in predicting time varying arrivals. For sinusoidal rate model, difficulty arose in setting the period parameter.

To avoid social problems during the winter period Anvhar has initiated a planet wide series of mental and physical games called the Twenties. The novel starts with Brandd winning the Twenties. As he recovers from the games Brandd meets Ihjel, a previous winner of the Twenties, who asks him to join a mission on the desert planet of Dis. The ruling class of Dis, the magter, have threatened to transport cobalt bombs onto a neighbouring planet if they refuse to surrender. As a result the planet is being blockaded and under threat of a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
