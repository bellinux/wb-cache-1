Once communications have been established, the communicating parties mutually decide if another mode would better suit the <b>current</b> <b>propagation</b> conditions. The possible number of tones {{that can be}} chosen are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 with higher numbers of tones giving more data redundancy but slower throughput and lower numbers of tones giving faster throughput {{at the cost of}} less redundancy. Available bandwidths for Olivia are 125 Hz, 256 Hz, 512 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000 Hz with wider bandwidths giving faster throughput and narrower bandwidths giving slower throughput. The most commonly used combinations are 4/125, 8/250, 8/500, 16/500, 16/1000, and 32/1000.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} that examine the initial development of an axisymmetric gravity current have been carried out. The experiments highlight {{the growth of a}} ring vortex that dominates the dynamics of the gravity <b>current's</b> early time <b>propagation.</b> In particular, the experiments show three distinct stages of early time development that have previously been described as the "initial phase" of a gravity current. The first phase of the early time development is dependent on the fractional depth of the lock release, followed by a secondary phase wherein the frontal speed is approximately constant and a third phase of reducing speed. The second phase of the gravity <b>current's</b> <b>propagation</b> comes to an abrupt end with the breakdown of the ring vortex at a clearly defined position. All of the experimental results show the development of a complex flow field where the generation and collapse of a ring vortex dominate the gravity <b>current's</b> early time <b>propagation.</b> The complexity of the flow field and the dependence of the propagation speed on the presence of the ring vortex in the head of the gravity current highlights the unsuitability of shallow-water modeling for axisymmetric lock releases at early time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Turbidity {{currents}} {{resulting from}} underwater earthquakes that cause slumps and bring mud into suspension {{are common in}} the ocean. The 1929 Grand Banks earthquake, which generated a large turbidity current, {{is of particular interest}} because, as the current advanced, all the submarine telegraph cables situated downslope were broken in sequence. Since the location and breakage times are known. these successive breakages provided a unique set of observations of the <b>current’s</b> downhill <b>propagation</b> speed. They show that the <b>current’s</b> <b>propagation</b> rate was drastically reduced as it advanced toward the abyssal plain. The dramatic reduction in speed has been previously attributed to (i) the natural reduction in the bottom slope which occurs as one approaches the abyssal plain; (ii) settling of the mud out of suspension, which reduces the density at the current; and (iii) bottom‘friction. In the present paper, a new and powerful alternative to the above explanations is proposed. It is suggested that, since the observed migration of the current lasts for about 10 -l 5 h, the rotation of the earth could dramatically alter both its path and structure. Using exact solutions of the nonlinear shallow water equations, it is shown that due to the earth’s spin; the initial downhill migration is severely altered within hours after the earthquake...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Engineering {{return stroke}} models can be {{categorized}} either as current generation (traveling current source type) mod-els or <b>current</b> <b>propagation</b> (transmission line type) models. The current generation models are described among other parame-ters by a corona current distributed along the channel. Recent studies {{show that there is}} equivalence between the models of cur-rent generation and <b>current</b> <b>propagation</b> types. Due to this equiv-alence, any engineering return stroke model of current propaga-tion type can be described in terms of an equivalent corona cur-rent per unit channel length. The measurements conducted within 10 – 500 m from triggered lightning flashes show that the electric field of subsequent return strokes at these distances flattens within 15 µs or so. In this paper, the constraints imposed by this feature on the temporal and spatial variation of the equivalent corona current are investigated. The results show that in order for the close fields to flatten within 15 µs or so, the equivalent corona current, should be bipolar and the corona current wave shape at late times should be identical to that of the longitudinal current time derivative. This is in contrast to most of the engineering models of current generation type, in which the corona current is assumed to be unipolar.

40|$|Harmonic {{voltages}} and {{currents in}} electrical systems, when present {{to a certain}} degree, represent not only a power quality problem {{but they are also}} strongly associated with the electrical system overall losses and they are arguably a source of instability and a safety concern. Mitigating harmonics distortion across the entire system by actively reducing harmonic <b>currents</b> <b>propagation</b> is an effective way of coping with these issues and can be dealt with the injection of a compensating current waveform with an active filter installed at a given bus. This paper shows how, by shaping the compensating current waveform in an optimal way, the overall electrical system harmonic distortion can be optimally reduced in a cost effective manner with a minimum size of the compensating device. The process of shaping this optimal compensating current is shown by how its components are defined by the optimization algorithm using the phase and amplitude of each harmonic as degrees of freedom in the process of finding the optimal waveform. A marine vessel distribution grid is used as representative example to prove the concept. Copyright c 2015 SCITEPRESS (Science and Technology Publications, Lda. ...|$|R
