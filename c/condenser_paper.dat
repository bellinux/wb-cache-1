Mathematical modelling offers the opportunity to test the performance of systems under different operating conditions and with alternative refrigerants. Dynamic models allow comparison of both transient and steady state behaviour and this is of particular importance for liquid chillers since these systems can operate under transient conditions for long periods. This paper covers the development of a general dynamic model for the simulation of liquid chillers. Brief descriptions of the system component models are given, including a semihermetic reciprocating compressor and thermostatic expansion valve as well as a shell-and-tube evaporator and <b>condenser.</b> The <b>paper</b> demonstrates the application of the model to simulate the performance of a liquid chiller retrotted with a range of alternative refrigerants.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{previous}} papers {{the authors}} demonstrated that significant energy savings {{can be achieved}} in air-conditioning {{through the use of}} a hybrid plant in which a vapor-compression inverse cycle is integrated with an air dehumidification system working with hygroscopic solution and hydrophobic membrane. The advantage of this system lies in the fact that the refrigeration device operates at a higher evaporation temperature than that of a traditional system, in which dehumidification is achieved through condensation. In the proposed hybrid system the supplied air is simultaneously cooled and dehumidified in an air-solution membrane contactor. The LiCl solution is cooled by means of a vapor-compression inverse cycle. The solution is regenerated in another membrane contactor by exploiting the exhaust air and the heat rejected by the <b>condenser.</b> The <b>paper</b> reports a study of the steady-state behavior of the system in summer climatic conditions on varying some significant climatic parameters, such as the latent load of the conditioned space and the outdoor and indoor relative humidity.

It is important to reduce the environmental impact further in the sensitive Artic, and {{this can be done}} with a waste heat recovery system (WHRS). Low heat sink temperatures increase the WHRS thermal efficiency substantially and the cold Arctic air presents an attractive opportunity at the cost of increased power consumption due to air moving through the <b>condenser.</b> This <b>paper</b> investigates the exploitation of the forward movement of a container ship navigating in the Arctic Circle and density-change induced flow as means of moving air through the condenser in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) unit to reduce the fan power required.
