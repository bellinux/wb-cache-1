5000|$|Glossolalia or {{speaking}} in tongues {{is a phenomenon}} in which people appear to speak in languages unknown to them. One definition used by linguists is the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily <b>comprehended</b> <b>meaning,</b> in some cases as part of religious practice {{in which it is}} believed to be a divine language unknown to the speaker. Glossolalia is practiced in Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity as well as in other religions. The term derives from glōssais lalein, a Greek phrase used in the New Testament meaning [...] "to speak in or with tongues other languages" [...] ( [...] , [...] ).|$|E
40|$|Task based {{language}} teaching has gained favor among both second language teachers and researchers {{over the last}} decade. Arguments {{for the value of}} a "focus on fonn" and attention to forms in input have also been made by several SLA researchers, thus pointing to a role for grammar instruction in classroom SLA. It is suggested here that the use of communicative and meaningful classroom tasks can focus learners' attention on grammatical forms in input and, thus, facilitate their acquisition This proposal differs from other recent treatments of communicative grammar instruction in its emphasis on the following areas: 1) "closed" rather than "() pen" tasks; 2) comprehension-based before production-based tasks; 3) grammatical targets which have clear form-meaning relationships. Thus, while the proposal is more narrow in scope than some other treatments, it is much more specific: i. e., it proposes tasks in which communicative outcomes can be predicted and manipulated in advance by the designer and in which grammatical form and meaning are tightly linked. Such tasks are similar to those used to test learners' language processing capabilities in psycholinguistic research, though here they are used for pedagogical purposes. Examples include tasks covering a wide range of syntactic categories and functions. ln conclusion, we argue for an approach to designing tasks which incorporates: 1) a cognitive perspective on SLA and language processing, 2) insights from research on communicative task design from second language research, and 3) methods of measuring language development from psycholinguistics and inter 1 anguage variation studies. By combining these with language teachers' careful observations of their students' problems in comprehending and being <b>comprehended,</b> <b>meaning</b> and communicative tasks for grammar pedagogy can be designed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem and proposes an {{alternative}} epistemological foundation for the canonical model approach, which {{is not based on}} common sense but on a solid mathematical information principle. The thesis is developed that logic programming can be understood as a natural and general logic of inductive denitions. In particular, logic programs with negation represent non-monotone inductive denitions. It is argued that this thesis results in an alternative justication of the well-founded model as the unique intended model of the logic program. In addition, it equips logic programs with an easy to <b>comprehend</b> <b>meaning</b> that corresponds very well with the intuitions of programmers.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{comprehend}} speech, listeners have to combine low-level phonetic {{information about the}} incoming auditory signal with higher-order contextual information. Unlike native listeners, nonnative listeners perceive speech sounds {{through the prism of}} their native language, which sometimes results in perceptual ambiguity in their second language. Across four experiments, both behavioral and electrophysiological, this dissertation provides evidence that such perceptual ambiguity causes words to become temporarily indistinguishable. To <b>comprehend</b> <b>meaning,</b> nonnative listeners disambiguate words through accessing their semantic, syntactic and morphological characteristics. Syntactic and semantic cues produce a stronger context effect than morphological cues in both native and nonnative groups. Thus, although nonnative representations may differ in that they may lack phonological specification, the mechanisms {{associated with the use of}} higher-order contextual information for meaning resolution in auditory sentence comprehension are essentially the same in the native and nonnative language...|$|R
