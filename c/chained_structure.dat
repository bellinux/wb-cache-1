These <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> are comprised of 2 – 12 addimers residing in the troughs of neighboring substrate dimer rows. The <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> extend along equivalent h 130 i directions across the substrate dimer rows in a zigzag fashion, giving rise to kinked and straight segments. We measure a kink-to-straight ratio of nearly 2 : 1. This ratio corresponds to a free energy difference of 17 ± 4 meV, favoring the formation of kinked segments. The <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> convert to compact epitaxial islands at elevated temperatures (P 90 °C). This conversion suggests that the <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> are a precursor for compact island formation on the SiGe wetting layer. We digitally process filled- and empty-state STM images to distinguish <b>chain</b> <b>structures</b> from compact islands. By monitoring the populations of both species over time, the chain-to-island conversion rates are measured at substrate temperatures ranging from 90 to 150 °C.

40|$|The single-chip crosspoint-queued (CQ) switch is a {{self-sufficient}} switching architecture enabled by state-of-art ASIC technology. Un-like {{the legacy}} input-queued or output-queued switches, {{this kind of}} switch has all its buffers placed at the crosspoints of input and output lines. Scheduling is also performed inside the switching core, and does not rely on instantaneous communications with in-put or output line-cards. Compared with other legacy switching architectures, the CQ switch has the advantages of high through-put, minimal delay, low scheduling complexity, and no speedup re-quirement. However, since the crosspoint buffers are small and seg-regated, packets may be dropped {{as soon as one}} of them becomes full.

We also design scheduling algorithms to maintain the correct packet order caused by multi-path switching.

In the first part evidence is provided showing that the simulation evoked by language is rather detailed and it activates a specific kind of affordances, that is stable and canonical affordances rather than variable ones; in the case of tools this simulation activates function rather than manipulation. When possible, the simulation prepares for a specific action; when the situation is uncertain predictions are advanced in parallel in preparation of many possible situations. The second part of the chapter discusses how language reflects some characteristics of action organization. Evidence is illustrated indicating that the goal-derived and <b>chained</b> <b>structure</b> of action is reflected in language. The simulation is influenced both by the overall action goal and by the kinematics of actions; the latter is relevant only if it leads to a different interpretation of the action as a whole. However, language modulates how these aspects influence the motor system.

40|$|The cloud, in {{the past}} few years, has become the {{preferred}} platform for hosting web applications. Many of these web applications store their data in a distributed cloud storage system, which greatly simplifies application development and provides increased availability and reliability. However, with increasing user demand for web applications, these cloud storage systems often become the performance bottleneck. To address the cloud's performance demands, many storage system features, such as strong consistency and transactional support, are often omitted in favour of performance. Nonetheless, transactions remain necessary to ensure data integrity and application correctness. In this thesis, we introduce CrossStitch, which is an efficient transaction processing framework for distributed key-value storage systems. CrossStitch supports general transactions, where transactions include both computation and key accesses. It is specifically optimized for short-lived transactions that are typical of cloud-deployed web applications. In CrossStitch, a transaction is partitioned into a series of components that form a transaction chain. These components are executed and the transaction is propagated along the storage servers instead of being executed on the application server. This <b>chained</b> <b>structure,</b> in which servers only communicate with their immediate neighbours, enables CrossStitch to implement a pipelined version of two-phase commit to ensure transactional atomicity. CrossStitch is able to eliminate a significant amount of setup overhead using this structure by executing the transaction and the atomic commit protocol concurrently. Therefore, CrossStitch provides low latency and efficient transactional support for cloud storage systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that CrossStitch is a scalable and efficient transaction processing framework for web transactions...|$|E
