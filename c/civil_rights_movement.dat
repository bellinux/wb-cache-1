5|$|After meeting Fannie Lou Hamer in {{the summer}} of 1964 and hearing her {{experiences}} in the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement,</b> Blackwell decided to join the SNCC. As a project director for the SNCC, she organized voter registration drives across Mississippi. Later that year, she became a member on the executive committee of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which provided a party for voters that SNCC had been registering to vote. In late August she and 67 other activists left Mississippi to represent the MFDP at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in an attempt to get the MFDP seated as delegates. They were unsuccessful in getting seats, but the move brought the party and the Mississippi <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> into the public eye.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movements</b> {{relied on}} the {{technique}} of civil resistance, using nonviolent methods to achieve their aims. In some countries, struggles for <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> were accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and even armed rebellion. While <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movements</b> over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of <b>civil</b> and political <b>rights,</b> the process was long and tenuous in many countries, {{and many of these}} movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.|$|R

5|$|The <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> has {{influenced}} and informed {{the feminist movement}} and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>movement</b> had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E

5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement,</b> organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Movement</b> and opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E
