5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new <b>computed</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

It allows to analyze an image stack from <b>computed</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> of lungs (thorax) and, at the same time, to mark all pathologies on images and report their characteristics. The reporting process is normalized - radiologists cannot describe pathological changes with their own words, but can only use some terms from a specific vocabulary set provided by the software. Consequently, a normalized radiological report is automatically generated. Furthermore, MIAWARE software is accompanied with an intelligent search engine for medical reports, based on the relations between parts of the lungs. A logical structure of the lungs is introduced to the search algorithm through the specially developed ontology. As a result, a deductive report search was obtained, which may be helpful for doctors while diagnosing patients’ cases. Finally, the MIAWARE software can be considered also as a teaching tool for future radiologists and physicians...|$|E
40|$|Background: Head {{injury is}} a common {{traumatic}} condition seen in Kenya. Among the head injury patients seen at the Aga Khan University Hospital Nairobi, minor head injury patients are the highest proportion of non–fatal trauma patients. Minor head injury is described as witnessed loss on consciousness, definite amnesia or witnessed disorientation in a patient with a GCS score of 13 – 15 who has suffered a traumatic event. There has been considerable disagreement about the indication for a <b>Computed</b> <b>Axial</b> <b>Tomography</b> <b>Scan</b> of the Head (CT-head) in {{the large number of}} patients clinically classified as minor. The Canadian CT Head Rule was derived as a sensitive decision rule on the use of CT with the aim to standardize and improve the management of patients with minor head injury. The rule comprised of five high risk factors and two moderate risk factors(Appendix 1).

The patient underwent uneventful repairs of both the abdominal aortic aneurysm and the multiple aneurysms of the right arm. Pathologic evaluation was significant for medial fibrosis of the arterial wall with decreased and disordered elastin fibers. Review of the previously reported cases in children indicate the upper extremity arteries are involved in 92 % of patients, the aortoiliac region in 92 % of patients, and the renal/mesenteric vessels in 77 % of cases. Lower extremity and cerebrovascular arteries are involved to a lesser extent. Children with peripheral aneurysms should have pan-angiography performed before treatment is begun.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Refractory or {{recurrent}} sepsis {{in patients}} with endocarditis may be from splenic abscess. The purpose of this review is to assess this relationship. METHODS: Of 564 patients treated for documented endocarditis between 1970 and 1990, splenic abscesses developed in 27 patients. The {{mean age of the}} 18 men and nine women was 37 years. Etiologic factors included street drugs, dental abscess, and rheumatic fever. Symptoms included fever, myalgia, chills, and dyspnea; the prodrome averaged 2 weeks. Typical signs were heart murmur, left lower-lobe infiltrate, and leukocytosis. Splenomegaly was found in three patients. All patients had valve lesions, which involved the aortic valve alone in 10 patients, the mitral valve alone in eight patients, and multiple valves in nine patients. RESULTS: A splenic defect on computed axial tomographic scan was diagnosed correctly as an abscess in 10 patients, was indeterminant in three patients, and was incorrectly called an infarct in four patients. Thirteen patients died. All 10 patients treated without splenectomy died, including five patients who underwent valvular replacement. In contrast, only three of 17 patients treated by splenectomy with (11 patients) or without (six patients) valvular surgery died. CONCLUSIONS: Splenic abscess often accompanies endocarditis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Chronic {{pancreatitis}} (CP) is {{a chronic}} condition associated with pancreatic fibrosis. A small subgroup {{of patients with}} CP develop enlargement {{of the head of}} the pancreas (EHP). This study examined some of the mechanisms that may lead to the development of EHP. SUMMARY BACKGROUND: The c-erb B- 2 protooncogene encodes a 185 -kDa transmembrane growth factor receptor (p 185) that regulates cell growth and differentiation. METHODS: The authors analyzed c-erb B- 2 expression in samples obtained from the head of the pancreas from 26 patients with CP (5 women, 21 men) using immunohistochemical and molecular technique. A diagnosis of CP with EHP was made when the vertical pancreatic head diameter was greater than 4 cm (14 patients), as determined by contrast-enhanced <b>computed</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan.</b> Pancreatic tissues from 15 healthy organ donors served as control subjects. RESULTS: In all patients without EHP and in the healthy control subjects, p 185 immunoreactivity was present at low levels. In contrast, strong p 185 immunoreactivity was observed in acinar and ductal cells in all patients with EHP. By in situ hybridization, c-erb B- 2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) grains were expressed at high levels in patients with CP with EHP in both ductal and acinar cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a 4. 5 -fold increase (p < 0. 001) in c-erb B- 2 mRNA levels in patients with EHP compared with patients without EHP and healthy control subjects. Southern blot analysis did not reveal c-erb B- 2 gene amplification or rearrangement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the c-erb B- 2 is not overexpressed in most patients with CP. However, its overexpression in patients with CP with EHP suggest that c-erb B- 2 may contribute to the pathophysiologic processes that lead to pancreatic head enlargement...|$|E
30|$|A 31 -year-old Caucasian female with no {{significant}} past medical history developed significant {{weight loss and}} progressive, positional dyspnea during the third trimester of her second pregnancy. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a normal pregnancy but bilateral ovarian cystic masses were noted and felt to reflect luteal cysts. At 34  weeks, she had a rupture of membranes and underwent a cesarean section. She {{was found to have}} significant ascites and large bilateral ovarian masses. Cytologic analysis of the ascites did not reveal any malignant cells. Postoperatively, her dyspnea worsened. A non-contrast <b>computed</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> revealed a large right pleural effusion, a large amount of ascites, and bilateral ovarian masses (17.7 [*]×[*] 14.4  cm on the right and 16 [*]×[*] 10  cm on the left). With a suspicion for a primary ovarian neoplasm, she then underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathologic analysis of the ovarian tissue revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma consistent with a metastatic pancreaticobiliary cancer. A serum CA 19 - 9 level was elevated to 258.8  U/mL. After recovery from her surgery, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed a hypermetabolic (SUV 9.18) pancreatic tail mass encasing the celiac axis measuring 3.3 [*]×[*] 5.5  cm. She was also found to have a hypermetabolic (SUV 15.88) sclerotic lesion of the left iliac bone, and biopsy of this lesion confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This PET scan, which was performed prior to initiation of systemic therapy, also revealed resolution of her ascites and her pleural effusion. She then began systemic therapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, achieving a modest radiographic response and a decrease in her CA 19 - 9 level from 258.8  U/ml at diagnosis to 61  U/ml after 6  months of treatment. Due to progressive neuropathy, therapy was then changed to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, which she has tolerated well. At the time of this report, she is doing well on therapy 10  months after diagnosis with minimal symptoms. Neither the ascites nor the pleural effusions have reaccumulated to date.|$|E

This study was undertaken to test whether specimen-matched cutting blocks based on <b>computed</b> <b>axial</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) <b>scans</b> could provide accurate rotational alignment of the femoral component. MethodsCT scans of five fresh frozen full leg cadaver specimens, equipped with infrared reflective markers, were used to produce a specimen-matched femoral cutting block. Using those blocks, the bone cuts were made to implant a bi-compartmental femoral component. Rotational alignment of the components in the horizontal plane was determined using an optical measurement system and compared with all relevant rotational reference axes identified on the CT scans. ResultsAverage rotational alignment for the bi-compartmental component in the horizontal plane was 1. 9 ° (range 0 °– 6. 3 °; standard deviation 2. 6 °). One specimen that showed the highest deviation from the planned alignment also featured a completely degraded medial articular surface. ConclusionsThe CT-based specimen-matched cutting blocks achieved good rotational alignment accuracy except for one specimen with badly damaged cartilage. In such cases, imaging techniques that visualize the cartilage layer might be more suitable to design cutting blocks, as they will provide a better fit and increased surface support. status: publishe...|$|R
