50|$|The {{architectural}} design for Ubiquity 0.1.3 {{was focused on}} separating functions into well-defined objects, an idea borrowed from the design of commands in the Archy project. The browser window functionality was separated into per-window and global objects. The per-window command manager object mediated between the context menu, <b>command</b> <b>entry</b> and natural-language parser objects and the commands themselves. The global objects marshall application-wide services such as built-in command feeds. Efforts to localize Ubiquity into different languages have also been made.|$|R

50|$|Fully {{automated}} parking systems operate {{much like}} robotic valet parking. The driver drives {{the car into}} an APS <b>entry</b> (transfer) <b>area.</b> The driver and all passengers exit the car. The driver uses an automated terminal nearby for payment and receipt of a ticket. When driver and passengers have left the <b>entry</b> <b>area,</b> the mechanical system lifts the car and transports it to a pre-determined parking space in the system. More sophisticated fully automated APS will obtain the dimensions of cars on entry in order to place them in the smallest available parking space.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{design a}} V 2 V-based fast handoff scheme using IP address passing for VANETs in this thesis. The {{proposed}} scheme allows a leaving {{vehicle in the}} exit area to pass an IP address which has been identified by the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure to the vehicles in the <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> directly. In addition, the leaving vehicle in the exit area can also pass an IP address to the vehicles in the middle area {{if there is no}} vehicles in the <b>entry</b> <b>area.</b> Therefore, our scheme can reduce the use of DHCP to obtain an IP address. Because DAD results in the largest delay of the whole DHCP procedure, our scheme can thus improve the utilization of IP address, reduce the time of acquiring an IP address, and reduce the whole handoff time. ...|$|R

In 1956, the division was again reorganized, this time to the designation as the 108th Division (Institutional Training). Under the U.S. Army Reserve Transformation of 2005, the 108th was reorganized to is current structure as the 108th Training <b>Command</b> (Initial <b>Entry</b> Training (IET)).

View and approaches to solving the city is described by four prominent authors: Jan Gehl - city for people, Christian Norberg Schultz - genius loci, Camillo Sitte - artistic principles of creation and Kevin Lynch - the city's image. From their perspective, the city is based on inspiring conclusions from which I come for the next part of this work, which {{deals with the}} model territory - the city of Poděbrady and defining theirs <b>entry</b> <b>areas.</b> Of these, we selected two examples in which are processed architectural study...|$|R

40|$|Teams of robots offer {{potential}} {{reductions in}} risk for rescuers and improved rescue rates for {{search and rescue}} in collapsed buildings and other restricted environments. However, one aspect of deployment of such teams that is often overlooked is the initial entry of the robots into the building. If many robots enter the building from the same entrance, {{they are likely to}} interfere with each other and dramatically slow the initial phase of exploration. In this paper, we use a low fidelity simulation to evaluate several approaches to overcoming this initial congestion and identify heuristics that might allow the robots to most quickly clear the <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> and begin their actual mission. Our results show that unless the exits to the initial <b>entry</b> <b>area</b> are small, over a wide range of parameters, the most effective technique was for every robot to move {{in the direction of the}} longest open space it senses. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. An experiment {{was conducted to}} determine whether a continuous speech recognition system would reduce the SH- 60 B Airborne Tactical Officer's taskload. The experiment made use of a Verbex Series 5000 speech recognizer. Ten subjects entered 45 commands frequently used by the Airborne Tactical Officer via two input methods: continuous voice and keying. The experiment was successful and demonstrated that continuous speech recognition is an effective means of reducing the Airborne Tactical Officer's taskload. This thesis discusses the research methodology, reviews and analyzes the data collected, and draws conclusions about the feasibility of incorporating a continuous speech recognition system for <b>command</b> <b>entry</b> in the SH- 60 B helicopter.
