25|$|The {{rack rail}} design used {{is one of}} Marsh's own inventions, using a ladder-like rack with open bar rungs engaged by {{the teeth of the}} <b>cog</b> <b>wheel.</b> This system allows snow and debris to fall through the rack rather than lodging in it. A similar design called the Riggenbach rack system was invented by {{engineer}} Niklaus Riggenbach in Switzerland at about the same time. The Swiss Consul to the United States visited Marsh while constructing the railway up Mount Washington, and his enthusiastic reports persuaded the Swiss government to commission Riggenbach to build the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn on Rigi Mountain, which opened on May 21, 1871.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel {{application of}} Low Coherence Interferometry (LCI) in measurements of characteristic parameters as circular pitch, foot diameter, heads diameter, in extremely small <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> (<b>cogged</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter lower than θ= 3 mm and module m = 0. 15) produced from metal and ceramics. The most interesting issue concerning small diameter <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> occurs during their production. The characteristic {{parameters of the}} wheel depend strongly on the manufacturing process and while inspecting small diameter wheels the shrinkage during the cast varies with the slight change of fabrication process. In the paper the LCI interferometric Twyman- Green setup with pigtailed high power light emitting diode, for <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> measurement, is described. Due to its relatively big field of view the whole wheel can be examined in one measurement, without the necessity of numerical stitching. For purposes of small <b>cogged</b> <b>wheel’s</b> characteristic parameters measurement the special binarization algorithm was developed and successfully applied. At the end the results of measurement of heads and foot diameters of two <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> obtained by proposed LCI setup are presented and compared with the results obtained by the commercial optical profiler. The results of examination of injection moulds used for fabrication of measured <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> are also presented. Additionally, the value of <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> shrinkage is calculated as a conclusion for obtained results. Proposed method is suitable for complex measurements of small diameter <b>cogged</b> <b>wheels</b> with low module especially {{when there are no}} measurements standards for such objects...|$|R

Macpherson (b. 1854, Ontario, Canada), a civil {{engineer}} from Cornell University and a newcomer to Pasadena (1885), proposed a steam driven <b>cog</b> <b>wheel</b> train to reach the crest via Mount Wilson. It wasn't until he {{was introduced to the}} millionaire Thaddeus S. C. Lowe (arrived in Pasadena 1890) that a fully funded plan could be put into action. The two men visited Colorado to view the mountain railway to Pike's Peak. Lowe was impressed with the trolley car systems in the city and thought that should be the way to go. This would make the Mount Lowe Railway the only electric traction rail line ever to be put into scenic mountain railway service.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{designed}} his own interrupter circuit {{for delivering}} shocks to patients from a voltaic cell through an induction coil. [...] Previously, the interrupter {{had been a}} mechanical device requiring the physician to turn a <b>cog</b> <b>wheel</b> or employ an assistant to do so. [...] Bird wished to free his hands to apply the electricity more exactly to the required part of the patient. [...] His interrupter worked automatically by magnetic induction at a reasonably fast rate. [...] The faster the interrupter switches, the more frequently an electric shock is delivered to the patient; {{the aim is to}} make the frequency as high as possible.Morus, pp. 250–251 ...|$|E

He first called the hybrid invention an [...] "air bicycle", that navigated through the air like driving a bicycle. He later named it a [...] "gas kite", an [...] "aerial velocipede", an [...] "aerial bicycle", [...] and ultimately a [...] "sky-cycle." [...] The propeller acted like a screw of a boat and propelled the airship forward and up with the backward air current generated. It {{could go to a}} thousand feet, be maneuvered, and brought back at will by the rider. Myers' wife was an expert in sky-cycling.|$|E

500|$|The Middleton Railway, {{founded in}} 1758, {{is the oldest}} {{continuously}} working railway in Britain to be established by an Act of Parliament; the first such act in England. The railway, owned by Charles Brandling, (1733–1802) was a horse drawn wooden waggonway linking the collieries at Middleton to Cassons Close near Leeds Bridge in the centre of Leeds. In 1810 John Blenkinsop, Brandling's agent at Middleton, was looking for cheaper ways of moving coal to Leeds. He designed the rack railway and Matthew Murray built the first Middleton Railway locomotive, [...] "Salamanca", at his Round Foundry in Holbeck. The locomotive's first run, reported in The Leeds Mercury on 27 June 1812, was [...] "witnessed by thousands of spectators and crowned a complete success....". Three more locomotives were built. The Middleton Railway locomotives had a toothed <b>cog</b> <b>wheel</b> which meshed into a rack {{on the side of}} the rail, as it was felt this would provide the engines with a better grip when hauling coal wagons.|$|E

2500|$|Another, more accurate, {{measurement}} {{of the speed of}} light was performed in Europe by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating <b>cog</b> <b>wheel</b> was placed {{in the path of the}} light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin. [...] Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000m/s.|$|E
