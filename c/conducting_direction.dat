The dynamical matrix is obtained with remarkably high precision from the density-density correlation function in the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation. A renormalization group analysis shows that at T= 0, as the partial filling factor Δν≡ν-ν moves away from 1 / 2, the anisotropic conducting state may undergo quantum phase transitions: stripes may get pinned along their <b>conducting</b> <b>direction</b> by disorder, or may lock into one another to form a two-dimensional crystal.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to almost all anisotropic superconductors, the {{upper critical field}} of URu$_{ 2 }$Si$_{ 2 }$ is larger when the field is oriented along the less <b>conducting</b> <b>direction.</b> We present a study of resistivity and Seebeck coefficient extended down to sub-Kelvin temperature range uncovering a singular case of anisotropy. When the current is injected along the c-axis URu$_{ 2 }$Si$_{ 2 }$ behaves as a low-density Fermi liquid. When it flows along the a-axis, even in presence of a large field, resistivity remains T-linear down to T$_{c}$ and the Seebeck coefficient undergoes a sign change at very low temperatures. We conclude that the characteristic energy scale is anisotropic and vanishingly small in the basal plane. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

The project aims to investigate methods and identify best practices of leadership, <b>conducting</b> and musical <b>direction</b> employed in community music ensembles. It also aims to evaluate the benefits of participation in community music ensembles, particularly how that influence musicians’ performance and their music teaching practices. This research project studies three community orchestras and one big band, of which I am, or have recently been, a member. The research employs multiple qualitative methods: interviews with the conductor/musical director of each ensemble, surveys of musicians in each ensemble through a questionnaire, and focus group discussions with the students of a third year university Ensemble Direction and Arranging subject I teach. Case study observation has also been conducted during my participation as double bassist or pianist in each concert series, and reported through evocative narrative autoethnography. Implications for music education include increased awareness {{and understanding of the}} influence of community music participation on music teaching and the integration of good musical direction and performance practices into pedagogy. The research findings will inform university music and music/education curricula and can be applied to implement effective teaching strategies in the development of vocational skills of musical leadership, <b>conducting,</b> musical <b>direction</b> and ensemble performance. This should facilitate the transition for graduates into professionals like secondary school teachers, conductors of community music ensembles and musical directors of their own bands...|$|R

40|$|The {{infrared}} spectra of the non-traditional superconductors share certain common features. The {{lack of a}} gap signature at 2 Δ and the residual conductivity are the consequence of a d-wave order parameter. The high T_c materials, the organic conductors and the heavy Fermion materials have a strong mid-infrared absorption band which {{can be interpreted as}} strong coupling of the carriers to electronic degrees of freedom which leads to a breakdown of the Fermi liquid picture.

A rear facet (RF) regenerating light has an inclination angle that {{is larger than}} 0 degree and smaller than 90 degrees based on an active laser layer (LS) at an angle that is equal to 0 degree. The active monitor diode layer is arranged {{in an area of}} the rear facet below the active laser layer between two n-p- or p-n-semiconductor layers, where the laser diode is switched in a <b>conducting</b> <b>direction</b> and a monitor diode (MD) is switched in a blocking direction for the current. USE - Used as a transmitter for laser light in diplexer-chip for a passive optical network, in a laser structure e. g. buried hetero-structure-distributed feed back (BH-DFB) -laser structure and p-n-p laser structure, and in an optical transmitting module. ADVANTAGE - The laser diode is switched in the <b>conducting</b> <b>direction</b> and the monitor diode is switched in the blocking direction for the current, thus switching the laser and monitor diodes over a common branch, without mutually influencing the laser and monitor diodes. The diode facilitates marginal additional costs during manufacture of the laser diode by the parallel monolithic integration of the monitor diode and large module compactness to achieve space saving opposite to an optical series connection of the laser and monitor diodes. The laser diode is designed in such a manner that the monitor diode works temperature-independently in each laser design, thus generating reliable measuring signal in the area of optimal absorption. The diode can be implemented in different design types in a cost-effective manner. The inclination angle of the rear facet is larger than 0 degree and smaller than 90 degrees based on the active laser layer in the angle that is equal to 0 degree, thus directing the laser light occurring in the rear facet and reflecting the light {{in the direction of the}} substrate layer, and hence avoiding regenerations in the active laser layer...|$|E
