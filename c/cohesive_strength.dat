2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil <b>cohesive</b> <b>strength</b> in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E

There were many varieties of the Roman vault, whether continuous or intersected, such as those employed over the corridors on the Colosseum and the theatre of Marcellus, but in these cases the springing of the vault was above the summit of the arches of the main front, so that there was no intersection; on the other hand, over the corridors were either elliptical or semicircular, or over the staircases rising vaults, all of which were more difficult to construct; there were also numerous solutions of vault over circular halls, of which that of the Pantheon is the most important example, having a diameter of , and over the hemicycles, which were sometimes of great size; that known as Canopus in Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli had a diameter of , and was vaulted over with a series of ribs, between which were alternating rampant flat and semicircular webs and cells; in the same villa and in Rome were octagonal halls with various other combinations of vault. Another type of vault not yet referred to is that of the Tabularium arcade where the Cloister vault was employed.

[...] And in the sense in which it may be said that we all in Europe are Christians that is true enough. To many of us Socialism is merely an emotion. An emotion is much and is also less than nothing. It is the initial impulse. The real Socialism of to-day is a religion. It has its dogmas. The value of the dogma does not consist in its truthfulness, and M. Anatole France, who loves truth, does not love dogma.

Laboratory results have lead to fundamental theoretical developments (such as poroelasticity, or rate and state-variable friction) that have found widespread application. This paper presents results from laboratory experiments that help constrain these theories. Data from triaxial deformation experiments on quartz sand aggregates are used to illustrate stress-dependent behavior of poroelastic parameters (e. g. the Biot-Willis and Skempton coefficients). Calculations for these coefficients show systematic variations as effective stress increases, {{in a manner consistent}} with measured compressibilities of the aggregate. Data from shear experiments show that frictional strength varies systematically with time and temperature. At temperatures below 450 oC, shear zones exhibit greater <b>cohesive</b> <b>strengths</b> as the time of stationary contact increases (hence, positive healing rates). For conditions exceeding 450 oC, shear zone strength is seen to decrease with contact time (negative healing rates). The results from both volumetric compaction and frictional shear experiments are well described by poroelasticity as well as rate and state-variable friction. The combination of these constitutive relations may provide a powerful tool that can be used in numerical models that couple thermal, mechanical, hydraulic, and temporal processes – as occur in geothermal systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Fault intersections are a {{geometric}} complexity {{that frequently}} occurs in nature. Here {{we focus on}} earthquake rupture behavior when a continuous planar main fault has a second fault branching off of it. We use the finite element (FE) method to examine which faults are activated and how the surrounding material responds for both elastic and elastic–plastic off-fault descriptions. Compared to an elastic model, a noncohesive elastic–plastic material, intended to account for zones of damaged rock bordering maturely slipped faults, will inhibit rupture on compressional side branches and promote rupture of extensional side branches. Activation of extensional side branches can be delayed and is triggered by continued rupture propagation on the main fault. We examine the deformation near the branching junction and find that fault opening is common for elastic materials, especially for compressional side branches. An elastic–plastic material is more realistic because elevated stresses around the propagating rupture tip and at the branching junction should bring the surrounding material to failure. With an elastic–plastic material model, fault opening is inhibited {{for a range of}} realistic material parameters. For large <b>cohesive</b> <b>strengths,</b> opening can occur, but with material softening, a real feature of plastically deforming rocks, opening can be prevented.

There-fore, {{they provide a}} natural bridge between strength-based models and energy-based models for fracture, allowing delamination to be described by a single framework that covers a range of applications for which the strength or energy criteria alone might not be sufficient. In this paper, the relationships between cohesive-zone models and fracture models based on strength or energy are discussed. A mixed-mode formulation of cohesive-zone models {{has been used to}} investigate a number of issues related to the delamination of interfaces. It has been shown that linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) provides an excellent de-scription of mixed-mode delamination, beyond the limits where LEFM would usually be thought to be appropriate. In particular, the concept of a nominal phase angle, calculated from stress-intensity factors is very robust. Compressive normal stresses on interfaces can be accommodated by the finite thickness of cohesive-zone models, resulting in increased levels of nominal toughness. The length scale naturally associated with cohesive zones al-lows them to describe mixed-mode fracture of interfaces with a modulus mismatch across them. Cohesive-zone models have also been used to explore the phenomenon of crack de-flection at interfaces. The results of these calculations appear to be more consistent with strength-based models of deflection, rather than with energy-based models. They indicate that the strength ratio between the <b>cohesive</b> <b>strengths</b> of the interface and substrate {{play an important role in}} determining whether crack deflection or propagation occurs. 1...|$|R
