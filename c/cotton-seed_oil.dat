60|$|Helena we visited, {{and also}} a town I had not heard of before, it being of recent birth--Arkansas City. It was born of a railway; the Little Rock, Mississippi River and Texas Railroad touches the river there. We asked a {{passenger}} who belonged there what sort of a place it was. 'Well,' said he, after considering, and with the air of one who wishes to take time and be accurate, 'It's {{a hell of a}} place.' A description which was photographic for exactness. There were several rows and clusters of shabby frame-houses, and a supply of mud sufficient to insure the town against a famine in that article for a hundred years; for the overflow had but lately subsided. There were stagnant ponds in the streets, here and there, and a dozen rude scows were scattered about, lying aground wherever they happened to have been when the waters drained off and people could do their visiting and shopping on foot once more. Still, it is a thriving place, with a rich country behind it, an elevator in front of it, {{and also a}} fine big mill for the manufacture of <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil.</b> I had never seen this kind of a mill before.|$|E

You see, there's just one little wee speck, essence, or whatever it is, in a gallon of <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil,</b> that give it a smell, or a flavor, or something--get that out, and you're all right--perfectly easy then to turn the oil into any kind of oil you want to, and there ain't anybody that can detect the true from the false. Well, we know how to get that one little particle out--and we're the only firm that does. And we turn out an olive-oil that is just simply perfect--undetectable!

40|$|CYCLOPROPENOID {{fatty acids}} found in Sterculia joetida oil and in <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil</b> have been {{reported}} to cause pink discoloration in cold-stored eggs (Masson et al., 1957; Shenstone and Vickery, 1956), to disturb the ratios of saturated to unsatu-rated fatty acids (Evans et al., 1961), and to decrease hatchability in eggs (Schneider et al., 1961; Kemmerer et al., 1965). These findings indicate that such fatty acids would likely affect egg production and egg quality.

40|$|The vapor {{pressure}} {{of a series}} of edible oils (soybean oil, rape seed oil, <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil,</b> safflower oil, rice wax and sesami oil) were measured in a temperature range of 250 ℃ to 330 ℃ by using an assembly of U-tube mercury manometer and vacuum pump. It was tried to apply the Riedel’s type equation (Riedel, 1945 a, b) to the measured results to obtain relationship between the {{vapor pressure}} and the temperature. The results obtained could be summarized, as follows : 1) The vapor pressure increased with increasing temperature. Soybean oil, rape seed oil, <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil</b> and rice was showed sigmoid curves which had a inflection point at about 290 ℃. In the case of Sesami oil the curve had the constant value in a range from 280 ℃ to 300 ℃. Only in safflower oil the curve showed simple exponential type. 2) Generally, vapor pressure estimates using the integral of the Clausius-Clapeyron’s equation assuming constant evaporation heat. But for these sigmoid type curves it is clear that such equation could ‘not express the curves. Thus the Riedel’s type equation with 4 parameters was introduced, the data of each oil were fitted to the equation by the leasts squares method as follows : In Pvp=A+B*T^ +C. lnT+D*T^ 6 (3) The results agreed well with the experimental results and their standard deviations were in the range of 0. 3026 [...] 0. 9043 kPa. The latent heat of evaporation could be estimated from eq. (3). Further, the other thermal characteristics were measured...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel {{production}} from cotton-seed cake (CSC) and the pretreatment {{of the remaining}} biomass for dark fermentative hydrogen production was investigated. The direct conversion to biodiesel with alkali free fatty acids neutralization pretreatment and alkali transesterification resulted in a biodiesel with high esters content and physicochemical properties fulfilling the EN-standards. Blends of <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil</b> methyl esters (CME) and diesel showed an improvement in lubricity and cetane number. Moreover, CME showed good compatibility with commercial biodiesel additives. On the basis of conversion of the remaining CSC to sugars fermentable towards hydrogen, the optimal conditions included removal of the oil of CSC and pretreatment at 10 % NaOH (w/w dry matter). The extreme thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus showed good hydrogen production, 84 – 112 % of the control, from NaOH-pretreated CSC and low hydrogen production, 15 – 20 % of the control, from the oil-rich and not chemically pretreated CSC, and from Ca(OH) 2 -pretreated CSC...|$|E
40|$|LTHOUGII the {{cholesterol}} {{content of}} the diet has been considered to have a rela-tively unimportant influence on cholesterol-emia in man, recent evidence {{suggests that it is}} a significant hypercholesterolemic factor. Several efforts to prove this effect, in which crystalline cholesterol was used, have been es ’ ‘ But it appears that cho-lesterol in diets containing a good amount of certain fats 46 or of lipoprotein complexes 7 is well absorbed by man and produces hyper-cholesterolemia.

40|$|Q I N C E certain yolk {{ingredients}} have ^ Been {{shown to}} diffuse into the whites during cold storage of cottonseed oil eggs, the question arose {{as to whether}} the pink color of the whites of such eggs could be (1) diffused normal yolk pigments, (2) the natural pigment of whites, riboflavin, modified by diffused yolk constituents, or, (3) some cottonseed oil pigment, de-posited in the yolk {{as a result of its}} con-sumption in feed and later diffused into the whites during storage. To investigate these possibilities the following experi-ments were conducted. EXPERIMENTAL Absorption spectra of a normal white from a fresh egg and a normal-appearing white and pink white from stored <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil</b> eggs are presented in Figure 1.

40|$|The {{present study}} is a modest attempt to analyse {{industrial}} location in Sudan, and to explain existing location patterns and industrial localization. Future industrial location trends are examined {{in the light of}} past and present development. The commitment to non-industrialisation in Sudan during the colonial regime has had a pronounced impact on the post independence spatial distribution of industry. Thus investment policies and development in the pre-independence period are investigated with reference to the set objectives and prevailing opportunities in Chapter Two. Private capital investment was insignificant compared with the public sector which was under taking 'commercial plantation' and infrastructural capital outlay. However, business and trade was the domain of private entrepreneurship. Public and private sectors were nonetheless complementary to each other and their activities were co-ordinated in what is termed the 'charter government system'. Structural transformation and economic growth (Chapter Three) is seen as a manifestation of this co-ordination and partnership. Planned non industrialisation, 'growth through trade', and primary export base are all attributed to the development endeavour of this period. An industrial location theory specific to developing countries is expounded in the Prime Base theory (Chapter Pour). Localization of industry according to this theory seems inevitable in many other prime bases of developing countries. In the second part, Sudan's industrial activity is investigated within the context of contemporary urban and regional development. In Chapter Five the spatial organisation of the industrial activity in the Prime Base is analysed in some detail, and the regional distribution and pattern of industry in Sudan is examined in Chapter Six. The emergence of secondary bases is seen as part of the economic process, and could be developed to realise industrial regionalisation. Chapter Seven is a case study of <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil</b> to test existing localization as against the 'theoretical optimum' according to classical location theory. Chapter Eight analyses human and natural resources in relation to regional development and future prospects for industrial location. Some suggestions are offered, and policy issues are raised in the concluding remarks...|$|E
40|$|Glyoxysomes in cotyledons {{of cotton}} (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) {{seedlings}} enlarge dramatically within 48 h after seed imbibition (Kunce, C. M., R. N. Trelease, and D. C. Doman. 1984. Planta (Berl.). 161 : 156 - 164) to effect mobilization of stored <b>cotton-seed</b> <b>oil.</b> We {{discovered that the}} membranes of enlarging glyoxysomes at all stages examined contained a large percentage (36 - 62 % by weight) of nonpolar lipid, nearly {{all of which were}} triacylglycerols (TAGs) and TAG metabolites. Free fatty acids comprised the largest percentage of these nonpolar lipids. Six uncommon (and as yet unidentified) fatty acids constituted the majority (51 %) of both the free fatty acids and the fatty acids in TAGs of glyoxysome membranes; the same six uncommon fatty acids were less than 7 % of the acyl constituents in TAGs extracted from cotton-seed storage lipid bodies. TAGs of lipid bodies primarily were composed of palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids (together 70 %). Together, these three major storage fatty acids were less than 10 % of both the free fatty acids and fatty acids in TAGs of glyoxysome membranes. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) constituted a major portion of glyoxysome membrane phospholipids (together 61 % by weight). Pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments in vivo clearly demonstrated that 14 C-PC and 14 C-PE were synthesized from 14 C-choline and 14 C-ethanolamine, respectively, in ER of cotyledons, and then transported to mitochondria; however, these lipids were not transported to enlarging glyoxysomes. The lack of ER involvement in glyoxysome membrane phospholipid synthesis, and the similarities in lipid compositions between lipid bodies and membranes of glyoxysomes, led us to formulate and test a new hypothesis whereby lipid bodies serve as the dynamic source of nonpolar lipids and phospholipids for membrane expansion of enlarging glyoxysomes. In a cell-free system, 3 H-triolein (TO) and 3 H- PC were indeed transferred from lipid bodies to glyoxysomes. 3 H-PC, but not 3 H-TO, also was transferred to mitochondria in vitro. The amount of lipid transferred increased linearly with respect to time and amount of acceptor organelle protein, and transfer occurred only when lipid body membrane proteins were associated with the donor lipid bodies. 3 H-TO was transferred to and incorporated into glyoxysome membranes, and then hydrolyzed to free fatty acids. 3 H-PC was transferred to and incorporated into glyoxysome and mitochondria membranes without subsequent hydrolysis. Our data are inconsistent with the hypothesis that ER contributes membrane lipids to glyoxysomes during postgerminative seedling growth. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
