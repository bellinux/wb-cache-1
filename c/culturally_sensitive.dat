25|$|Multiculturalism – Although the {{theoretical}} foundations of psychology {{are rooted in}} European culture, {{there is a growing}} recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of acculturation can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more <b>culturally</b> <b>sensitive</b> and effective way.|$|E

While many of the issues discussed in ecotheological works have included consequences for food production and eating habits, these themes were often not explicitly discussed. The reasons for this are interesting and complex. issues related to food have been <b>culturally</b> very <b>sensitive</b> and have manifold connections to religiosity. in regard to the discussion about the rights and value of animals, controversies have been seen to arise between ecotheology and ‘animal theology’. Recently, a new interest has arisen in the themes of food, eating, and Christian theology, which has resulted in a new field of litera-ture which could be called the ‘theology of eating’.

Latinos en Camino al Exito Universitario {{is an example of}} a cul-turally responsive program delivered out of a university counseling center as part of the training for multicultural competency for interns. Participants were 30 middle and high school students with supplementary parental involvement. Although outcome data were limited, positive outcomes included increased knowledge and confidence about college and precollege experiences. This article discusses how the program was devel-oped, from recruitment to implementation, and how it was designed to meet the unique needs of Latino youth. Latinos en Camino al Exito Universitario (Latinos on the Path to Higher Education) was a grassroots <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>sensitive</b> program designed to promote the pursuit of higher education among Latino youth. Research clearly suggests that Latino students face numerous barriers to obtaining postsecondary education, including lack of information on the college process and lack of adult support and guidance (Immerwhar, 2003).

The purpose of this phenomenological study was to gain more understanding and insight of these communities through the conceptualizations of historical trauma (HT) and posttraumatic growth (PTG) theories. The central research question for this study examined how indigenous Pacific Island 3 rd-generation adults described and perceived their experiences of intergenerational HT and potential growth. This study utilized a purposeful and criterion sample of 10 indigenous Pacific Island adults, between 18 - 32 years old, who participated in a project over 10 years ago.
