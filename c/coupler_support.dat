40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{optical properties}} of a semiconductor-doped glass (SDG) channel waveguide were {{measured on a}} picosecond time-scale; namely, fluence-dependent changes in the absorption and the refractive index {{as well as the}} relaxation time of the nonlinearity. Slower, thermally-induced changes in the refractive index were also observed. The saturation of the changes in the absorption and the refractive index with increasing optical fluence is explained using a plasma model with bandfilling as the dominant mechanism. The fast relaxation time of the excited electron-hole plasma (20 ps) is explained using a surface-state recombination model. A figure of merit for a nonlinear directional coupler fabricated in a material with a saturable nonlinear refractive index is presented. The measured nonlinear change in the refractive index of the SDG saturates below the value required to effect fluence-dependent switching in a nonlinear directional coupler. Experiments with a channel-waveguide directional <b>coupler</b> <b>support</b> this prediction. However, absorption switching due to differential saturation of the absorption in the two arms of the directional coupler was observed...|$|E

The <b>coupler</b> <b>supports</b> an electrical field gradient of ~ 1 kV/m around the rf window ceramic with 500 kW through power, a VSWR of 1. 1 and an overall frequency bandwidth of 100 MHz.

40|$|We study light-beam {{propagation}} in a nonlinear coupler with an asymmetric double-channel waveguide and derive various analytical {{forms of}} optical modes. The {{results show that}} the symmetry-preserving modes in a symmetric double-channel waveguide are deformed due to the asymmetry of the two-channel waveguide, yet such a <b>coupler</b> <b>supports</b> the symmetry-breaking modes. The dispersion relations reveal that the system with self-focusing nonlinear response supports the degenerate modes, while for self-defocusingmedium the degenerate modes do not exist. Furthermore, nonlinear manipulation is investigated by launching optical modes supported in double-channel waveguide into a nonlinear uniform medium. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concept of}} coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) {{is for the}} first time taken a step farther to propose the more complicated case of coupled-resonator directional couplers, by analyzing the phenomenon of propagation in two parallel chains of microring resonators. Using the method of transfer matrices it is shown that the infinite <b>coupler</b> <b>supports</b> even and odd supermodes that satisfy frequency-shifted replicas of the familiar CROW dispersion equation as well as modified periodic Floquet conditions. Depending on the relative coupling strengths between neighboring resonators in the same chain and between the two chains, the frequency bands of the supermodes can overlap or be completely separated, resulting, in the latter case, to a complete bandgap around the central resonance frequency of the microrings. Three frequency windows, corresponding to totally different properties of directional coupling, are defined through this band-overlap mechanism along the increased total bandwidth of the coupler. These predictions are fully confirmed in the response of the realistic finite-length version of the considered coupler which is also analyzed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The European X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL), the {{research}} facility currently {{under construction in}} the Hamburg area, Germany, {{is based on a}} superconducting linear accelerator that brings electrons to almost the speed of light. The linear accelerator consists of 100 accelerating cryomodules (CMs) operating at the temperature of 2 K. The thermal performances of the accelerator CMs are a key element to determine the heat load budget, the required capacity and the cost of the XFEL refrigerating system and to guarantee its efficient operation. The measurement of the thermal performances of the CMs is also an important step in the qualification of the CMs during the series production. This paper describes the thermal performance analysis of the European XFEL prototype cryomodules. The analysis takes into account all the main contributors (multilayer insulation, current leads, power <b>couplers,</b> <b>support</b> posts, and cavities) to the static and dynamic heat loads at various cryogenic temperature levels. Existing empirical databases are reviewed and used to evaluate the heat transfer through the multilayer insulation and numerical simulations are developed to investigate the heat loads generated from the different CM components...|$|R

40|$|The single-star {{optical network}} {{is limited in}} size by the {{available}} power budget. When the network size exceeds the number of connections a star <b>coupler</b> can <b>support,</b> it becomes necessary to use multiple passive star couplers to implement the network. The cost of a multi-star optical network {{is determined by the}} number of fiber connections per station and the number of star couplers in the network. To reduce the cost of the network, it’s desirable to use as less fiber connections per station and star couplers as possible. In this paper, we consider two multi-star implementations of of single-hop networks, and discuss how to implement them with least cost. any incoming light signals is evenly split into N weaker signals, one for each output port. A transmission from one station to another station is accomplished by tuning a transmitter of the sending station and a receiver of the receiving station to the same wavelength. Note that several transmissions can be carried out simultaneously as long as those transmitters are using different wavelengths...|$|R
