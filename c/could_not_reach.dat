5|$|A {{key issue}} facing Kenya was a border dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region {{and claimed that}} it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta refused to accede to their demands, insisting that the land remain Kenyan. In June 1962 Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> an agreement.|$|E
5|$|After 1147, {{however, the}} {{relations}} between the two leaders became friendlier. By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad, whose sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily. Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor, Conrad died in 1152, and despite repeated attempts, Manuel <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> an agreement with his successor, Frederick I Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|At 13:30 Gay {{ordered the}} 8th Cavalry Regiment to {{withdraw}} its men off Ka-san. Gay {{believed he had}} insufficient forces to secure and hold it and that the North Koreans had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery and mortar fire. However, Holley <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> anyone in D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Crucible {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, it was {{proposed}} that the annual Apple Cup between the Seattle-based Huskies and the Pullman-based Cougars be hosted at CenturyLink Field for sixyears beginning in 2010. The two programs <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> an agreement on how to divide tickets. Pullman's business community had expressed concerns that playing the game away from the area would be detrimental to the local economy.|$|E
5|$|John Surratt stood {{trial in}} Washington in 1867. Four {{residents}} of Elmira, New York, claimed {{they had seen}} him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) {{on the day of}} the assassination. The jury <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> a verdict and John Surratt was released.|$|E

5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{response of the}} British was a two-hour cannon barrage at the heights, which had no effect because the British guns <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> the American guns at such height. After {{the failure of the}} barrage, Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must be removed from the heights if they were to hold Boston. They planned an assault on the heights; however, due to a storm the attack never took place, and the British elected instead to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, Jinnah {{had come}} to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, {{demanding}} a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the British Royal Navy {{was charged}} with {{limiting}} the passage and operations of the French Navy, French merchant ships and French privateers. To achieve this objective, the Royal Navy imposed a system of blockades on French ports, especially the major naval bases at Toulon and Brest. This stranglehold on French movement off their own coastline seriously affected the French colonies, including those in the West Indies, as their produce <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> France and supplies and reinforcements <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> them without the risk of British interception and seizure. These islands provided excellent bases for French ships to raid the British trade routes through the Caribbean Sea: in previous conflicts, the British had countered {{the threat posed by}} French West Indian colonies by seizing them through force, such as Martinique, which had been previously captured by armed invasion in 1762 and 1794. An attempt in 1780 was defeated by a French battle squadron at the Battle of Martinique. By 1808 there were no French squadrons at sea: any that left port were eliminated or driven back in a series of battles, culminating at the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The fleet that was destroyed at Trafalgar had visited Martinique the year before and was the last full scale French fleet to visit the Caribbean {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Zardari relented, and the {{coalition}} agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf's impeachment by drafting a charge-sheet against him. The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law. He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and {{the coalition}} selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned {{in order to avoid}} impeachment. Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition could not agree on a decision. The coalition also <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> a united stance {{on the future of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1944 a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) F-13 Superfortress {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} by an Allied aircraft over the Tokyo region of Japan since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942. This photo reconnaissance sortie was highly successful, with the aircraft's crew taking thousands of photographs which were later used to plan many air raids on Japan during the final months of World War II. Attempts by Japanese air units and anti-aircraft gun batteries to destroy the F-13 failed, as the available fighter aircraft and guns <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> the high altitude it operated at.|$|E
5|$|Perlman, a {{frequent}} collaborator with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, {{said in a}} 2009 AMC Networks featurette that Alien Resurrection was his only film in which he feared for his life. During the filming of the underwater scene, Perlman struggled with the aquatic set and nearly drowned because he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> its openings. In a character-breaking occurrence, Perlman nearly compromised a shot of Sigourney Weaver making a basket from behind but editor Hervé Schneid was able to remove Perlman's reaction from the scene. In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney interprets Johner and Number 8 as monogamous animals, with a weaker, aggressive male unsuccessfully attempting to seduce a stronger female.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation {{spread to}} other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an {{alliance}} of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E

5|$|This time, the Burmese king {{received}} the imperial envoys but still refused to submit. The Burmese chronicles {{say that the}} king was so insulted {{that he had the}} envoys executed. But both Burmese inscriptional evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed. At any rate, the imperial envoys did not get back to Yunnan in due time. The newly formed Yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation, but the delegation <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route.|$|E
5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, as {{reported}} by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> her due to the intensity of the storm. As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong building standards, keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E
5|$|Ajax {{opened the}} scoring {{in the third}} minute when Cees de Wolf, who was making his debut for Ajax, scored. A throw-in by Cruyff was headed into the air, Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came to collect the ball. Realising he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> it, he moved back towards his goal, but de Wolf outjumped defender Chris Lawler to head {{the ball into the}} Liverpool goal. The {{conditions}} were so poor, that the crowd celebrated in stages. Those closest to the goal celebrated immediately, while those {{at the other end of}} the stadium reacted to these celebrations. Liverpool striker Hunt had a chance to score in the 12th minute, but his shot was saved by Ajax goalkeeper Gert Bals. Following the goal Ajax continued to attack, midfielder Sjaak Swart ran past three Liverpool players before passing the ball to Klaas Nuninga, whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence. However, Lawrence dropped the ball near Johan Cruyff, who scored to give Ajax a 2–0 lead.|$|E
