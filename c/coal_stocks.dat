5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{extends from}} parts of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire in the west, to Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen in the east, and the rather smaller North Wales Coalfield {{underlies}} parts of Flintshire and Denbighshire. Vast quantities of coal were mined in Wales during the Industrial Revolution and the earlier {{part of the}} twentieth century, after which <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> dwindled and the remaining pits became uneconomical as foreign coal became available at low prices. The last deep pit in Wales closed in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Initially, some of {{the coal}} carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made {{a proposal for a}} canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.|$|E
5|$|From Madras, Müller had {{originally}} intended to rendezvous with his colliers off Simalur Island in Indonesia, but instead {{decided to make a}} foray to the western side of Ceylon. On 25 September, Emden sank a pair of British merchantmen and two days later, captured the collier Buresk, which was carrying a cargo of high-grade coal. A German prize crew went aboard Buresk and she was thereafter used to support Emdens operations. Later that day, the German raider sank two more British vessels. Low on fuel, Emden proceeded to the Maldives to coal. She arrived there on 29 September and remained for a day while her crew replenished her <b>coal</b> <b>stocks.</b> The raider then cruised the routes between Aden and Australia and between Calcutta and Mauritius for two days without success. Emden thereafter steamed to Diego Garcia for engine maintenance and to rest her crew.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey {{sailed to}} the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17 August, {{returning}} to the Kansong area where for four days she provided harassing fire by night, and broke up counterattacks by day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the Changjon area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{approached}} Port Stanley, {{the capital}} of the Falklands, early on the morning of 8 December; the British quickly spotted them, and raised steam to go out and meet them. Von Spee initially thought the smoke clouds to be the British burning their <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> to prevent the Germans from seizing them. Upon realizing the presence of the powerful British squadron, he broke off the attack and turned to flee. The British quickly steamed out of the harbor in pursuit. By 12:55, the battlecruisers had caught up to the retreating Germans, and opened fire on Leipzig, the last ship in the German line, though she was not hit. Von Spee ordered the light cruisers to detach and flee while Scharnhorst and Gneisenau turned on their pursuers, in the hope that he could cover their escape. In response, Sturdee sent his cruisers to chase down Nürnberg, Dresden, and Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|The four cruisers then {{departed}} {{the central}} Pacific, bound for Chile. On 13 August {{the captain of}} the Emden, Commodore Karl von Müller, persuaded Spee to detach his ship for commerce raiding. The ships again coaled after their arrival at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 20 August. On 6 September Spee detached Nürnberg, along with the tender Titania, to cut the British cable system at Fanning Island. The cruiser flew a French ensign to deceive the defenders, and succeeded in destroying the station on 7 September. Nürnberg then rejoined the fleet at Christmas Island. later that day. In order to keep the German high command informed of his activities, Spee sent Nürnberg on 8 September to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. Spee chose the ship because the British were aware she had left Mexican waters, and so her presence in Hawaii would not betray the movements of the entire East Asia Squadron. She was also ordered to contact German agents to instruct them to prepare <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> in South America for the squadron's use. Nürnberg brought back news of the Allied conquest of the German colony at Samoa.|$|E

25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{the island was}} {{considered}} important because it protected the passage into Keppel Harbour. Plans to fortify the island {{as part of the}} defence plan for Singapore were drawn up as early as 1827, but few fortifications actually materialised until the 1880s, when the rapid growth of the harbour led to concern over the protection of <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> against enemy attack. The forts built on the island were Fort Siloso, Fort Serapong, Fort Connaught and the Mount Imbiah Battery.|$|E
25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} occurs naturally within some environments {{as part of}} {{the rock}} weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from <b>coal</b> <b>stocks,</b> coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage.|$|E
25|$|The NCB was {{encouraged}} to gear itself toward reduced subsidies in the early 1980s. After a strike was narrowly averted in February 1981, pit closures and pay restraint led to unofficial strikes. The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at Cortonwood Colliery, {{which led to the}} NUM's Yorkshire area's sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The union strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample <b>coal</b> <b>stocks,</b> to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM's failure to hold a strike ballot, which enabled a minority to keep working and kept other unions from supporting it.|$|E

Spee was under the incorrect impression that the Falkland Islands were undefended. The British had detached a pair of battlecruisers, [...] and , and four cruisers, under the command of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee, to track down Spee's squadron and defeat it in return for Coronel.|$|E
500|$|On 8 March, Dresden was {{drifting}} in dense fog when lookouts spotted Kent, which also had her engines off, about [...] away. Both ships immediately raised steam, and Dresden escaped after a five-hour chase. The strenuous effort depleted her <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> and overtaxed her engines. Lüdecke decided that his ship {{was no longer}} operational, and determined to have his ship interned to preserve it. The following morning, she put into Más a Fuera, dropping anchor in Cumberland Bay at 8:30.

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Breslau and Goeben were to interdict French transports transferring troops from Algeria to France. On 3 August 1914, Souchon's two ships were steaming off Algeria; shortly after 06:00, Breslau bombarded the embarkation port of Bône while Goeben attacked Philippeville. The attacks caused minimal damage, however, and Souchon quickly broke off and returned to Messina to replenish his <b>coal</b> <b>stocks.</b> Although the British were not yet at war with Germany, the two British battlecruisers [...] and [...] shadowed the German ships while en route to Messina. After partially replenishing Goebens coal on the 5th, Souchon arranged to meet a collier in the Aegean. Goeben and Breslau left port the following morning bound for Constantinople, pursued by the British Mediterranean Fleet.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 December, Spee held a conference with the ship commanders aboard Scharnhorst to {{determine}} their next course of action. The Germans had received numerous fragmentary and contradictory reports of British reinforcements in the region; Spee and two other captains favored {{an attack on the}} Falkland Islands to destroy the British wireless station there, while three other commanders argued {{that it would be better}} to bypass the islands and attack British shipping off Argentina. Spee's opinion carried the day and the squadron departed for the Falkland Islands at 12:00 on 6 December. The ships arrived off the Falkland Islands two days later; Gneisenau and Nürnberg were delegated for the attack. As they approached, observers aboard Gneisenau spotted smoke rising from Port Stanley, but assumed it was the British burning their <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> to prevent the Germans from seizing them. As they closed on the harbor, [...] shells from the elderly battleship , which had been beached as a guard ship, began to fall around the German ships, which prompted Spee to break off the attack. As Spee withdrew, Sturdee quickly got steam up in his ships and sortied to chase the Germans.|$|E
500|$|Upon commissioning, both {{ships of}} the class were {{assigned}} to the German East Asia Squadron, with Scharnhorst serving as Admiral Maximilian von Spee's flagship. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were regarded as well-trained vessels; both ships won awards for their excellence at gunnery. At the start of World War I, the two ships were in the Caroline Islands on a routine cruise; the rest of von Spee's squadron was dispersed around the Pacific. The declaration of war by Japan on Germany convinced von Spee to consolidate his force with the cruisers [...] and [...] from the American station, and head for Chile to refuel. The flotilla would then attempt to return to Germany via the Atlantic Ocean. Admiral von Spee also intended to attack the three British cruisers under the command of Admiral Christopher Cradock, and any British shipping encountered. On 22 September, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau approached the island of Papeete in French Polynesia with the intention of seizing the coal stockpiled in the harbor. The ships conducted a short bombardment that resulted in the sinking of the old gunboat [...] However, von Spee feared that the harbor had been mined, and decided to avoid the risk. The French had also set fire to the <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> to prevent the Germans from using the coal.|$|E
50|$|General Concha {{was built}} at the naval {{shipyard}} Esteiro at Ferrol in Spain, working order #169. She had an iron hull with bow ram, a single funnel, and a light schooner rig. She was the first ship of a class of four gunboats ordered by Admiral Francisco de Paula Pavía y Pavía during his third term as Ministro de Marina (Minister of the Navy). The design was made in Spain. The keel was laid down on 1 May 1882 and the ship was launched on 28 November 1883. The 600 hp engine with two boilers was constructed by La Maquinista Terrestre y Maritima SA in Barcelona at a final cost of 312,000 pesetas and was constructed directly aboard the ship, after being towed from Ferrol to Barcelona by merchant vessel José Pérez. Bunker <b>coal</b> <b>stock</b> capacity was 70-80 tons having an average consumption of 10 tons per day.|$|R
5|$|In late 1994, {{the power}} station was flooded to a foot deep of sea water, after a freak high tide and strong winds. This {{led to a}} sea defence system being {{constructed}} to protect the building. The problems came about because of the temporary closure of Ellington Colliery. Tipped waste from the colliery had {{been used as a}} coastal defence measure, but as the colliery had closed, waste was no longer being tipped. The colliery was reopened by RJB Mining, and in July 1999 the station ensured the future of the colliery by signing a contract with RJB Mining to be provided with 3,000,000 tonnes of coal from Ellington Colliery and opencast mines in Northumberland, over the course of three years. The colliery closed for good in 2005, leading to problems with coastal defence again, threatening the station's <b>coal</b> <b>stocking</b> area. This required a £2.5 million new coastal defence scheme be put in place, involving the use of large rocks as a defence wall.|$|R
500|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} specifically to burn coal from the Northumberland coalfields. The neighbouring Ellington Colliery originally fed coal directly to the power station using a conveyor belt from its Bewick Drift Mine, situated [...] from the station. Within a year of the power station opening, 3,000 men were employed between the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries, producing over two million tons of coal a year, the majority of it being sold to the power station. In 1994, Ellington Colliery connected underground with Lynemouth Colliery, but coal continued to be taken straight to the power station's coal sorting area using conveyor belts. This supply was supplemented by coal from local opencast mines. However, Ellington Colliery was forced to close when it flooded in January 2005. The station burned the colliery's remaining <b>coal</b> <b>stock</b> after it closed, and since then coal has been sourced from opencast mines in Northumberland and Scotland, but now {{a small amount of}} import is necessary.|$|R
