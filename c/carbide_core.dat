40|$|Reactors {{utilizing}} a highly energetic neutron spectrum, often termed fast reactors, offer large fuel utilization improvements over the thermal reactors currently used for nuclear energy generation. Conventional fast reactor deployment has been hindered by the perceived {{need to use}} plutonium as fuel, coupling the commercial introduction of fast reactors to the deployment of large-scale thermal reactor used fuel reprocessing. However, the future of used fuel treatment in the United States is highly uncertain, creating a bottleneck for the introduction of fast reactor technology. A strategy centered around using uranium-fueled fast reactor cores in a once-through mode-a uranium startup fast reactor (USFR) -decouples fast reactor commercialization from fuel reprocessing and enables transition to a recycle mode once the technology becomes available and economic. The present work investigates the optimal strategy for recycling spent fuel from once-through sodium cooled fast reactors (SFRs), by analyzing the performance of various designs. A range of acceptable transitions are described and their economic, breeding, nonproliferation, and safety performance are characterized. A key finding is that the burnups of all cores were limited by the allowable fluence to the cladding {{rather than by the}} <b>core</b> reactivity. The <b>carbide</b> <b>cores</b> achieve fluence-limited burnups 15 - 25 % greater than the comparable metal cores, though the metal cores can be optimized via decrementing the fuel volume fraction to reach fluence-limited burnups within 10 % of the <b>carbide</b> <b>cores.</b> The removal of minor actinides from the recycled fuel has a minimal impact on the achievable burnups of both types of fuels, decreasing the fluence-limited burnup by less than half a percent in all cases. Similarly, long-term storage of the USFR fuel had minimal impact on the achievable burnups of all cores, decreasing the fluencelimited burnup by no more than 2 % in all cases. Levelized fuel costs were in the range of 5. 98 mills/kWh to 7. 27 mills/kWh for the <b>carbide</b> <b>cores,</b> and 6. 81 mills/kWh to 7. 57 mills/kWh for the optimized metal cores, which is competitive with fuel costs of current LWRs and once-through SFRs. The metal and <b>carbide</b> multicore <b>cores,</b> made using slightly more than one once-through SFR core, functioned as slight fissile burners with fissile inventory ratios (FIRs) near 0. 9. The uranium+ cores, made using one oncethrough SFR core plus natural uranium makeup, functioned in a fissile self-sustaining mode with FIRs near unity. All cores discharged fuel that was less attractive for weapon use than that of an LWR. The <b>carbide</b> <b>cores</b> had maximum sodium void worths in the range of $ 2. 81 -$ 2. 86, approximately half the worth of the metal cores, which were in the range of $ 4. 97 -$ 5. 14. Carbide and metal multicore cores possessed initial reactivities in the range of 15, 000 pcm, requiring either multi-batch staggered reloading or control system modifications to achieve acceptable shutdown margins. The uranium+ <b>carbide</b> and metal <b>cores</b> achieved acceptable shutdown margin with the nominal control configuration and the single-batch reloading scheme. The overall conclusion is that USFR spent fuel is readily usable for recycle. by Joshua Richard. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Sodium Fast Reactors {{are one of}} {{the three}} {{candidates}} of GEN-IV fast reactors. Fast reactors {{play an important role in}} saving uranium resources and reducing nuclear wastes. Conventional fast reactors rely on transuranic fuels from reprocessing facilities, which are not available in the U. S. Thus, deployment of fast reactors requires decoupling from reprocessing facilities. This motivates the design and deployment of Uranium Startup sodium Fast Reactors (USFR) on a once-through fuel cycle in order to facilitate the transition to fast reactors by reducing their plant costs and increase capacity factor. Three different fuel types including uranium carbide (UC), metal (UZr) and uranium oxide (UO₂) are investigated and analyzed using the ERANOS code for potential use in USFR designs. A key enabling factor is use of high-albedo MgO or Zr reflectors in place of fertile blankets to reduce uranium enrichment and improve non-proliferation resistance. The different compositions in different fuel types result in different neutronic performance. The softer spectrum and lower allowable fuel volume fractions of oxide fuel have shorter fuel cycle length due to reactivity constraints, whereas fast neutron fluence plays an important role in determining the fuel cycle length in metal cores due to the harder spectrum. Moderators are deliberately added in the metal fuels to lower the fast neutron fluence. <b>Carbide</b> <b>cores</b> have a slightly harder neutron spectrum than oxide cores and a larger achievable fuel volume fraction. USFRs using all three fuel types (UC, U 0 2 and UZr) have lower fuel cycle cost (6. 27, 6. 09 and 5. 77 mills/kWhe) and comparable uranium consumption (0. 50, 0. 55, and 0. 53 kgNatU/MWde) compared with typical LWRs (6. 39 nills/kWhe and 0. 53 kgNatU/MWde). All USFR designs have maximum neutron fluence below 5 E 23 n/cm². All three USFR designs have pressure drop below 0. 7 MPa and maximum temperature below the limit for each fuel type. Both carbide and metal fuel have excellent passive safety performance. It is concluded that the USFR approach is a competitive way to accelerate fast reactor development. by Tingzhou Fei. Thesis (Ph.

The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, is a loop type, sodium cooled fast reactor. Its main aim is to provide experience in fast reactor operation, large scale sodium handling and to serve as a test bed for irradiation of fast reactor fuels & materials. FBTR was built on the lines of the French Rapsodie-Fortissimo reactor, with modifications to make it a generating plant. FBTR went critical on 18 th Oct 1985 with a small core of 22 fuel subassemblies of a unique, high Pu <b>carbide</b> fuel. The <b>core</b> was rated for 10. 5 MWt. The TG was rolled and synchronized to the grid in July 1997. Reactor power was progressively increased by enlarging the core, to reach 18. 6 MWt. Several challenges in reactor operation came on the way, which were successfully overcome. A large number of modifications were carried out to improve the plant performance. The reactor coolant used (Sodium) is highly reactive when exposed to atmosphere and also becomes highly active on exposure to neutron radiation. These properties of sodium make it essential to handle it carefully and safely within a leak tight containment. During course of operation of the reactor, a number of sodium laden components viz. pumps, valves, cold traps, Rupture discs, level probes, shielding plugs, control rod drive mechanisms, experimental assemblies, piping etc. are required to be removed for various maintenance, modification and replacement jobs.

With targets consisting of 6 [*]mm aluminum oxide ceramic and 6 [*]mm aluminum backing, complete penetration occurred in each test with 7. 62 [*]mm tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>core</b> AP ammunition at an impact velocity of 940 [*]m/s. In contrast, with ceramic tiles of 20 [*]mm thickness on 13 [*]mm steel backing, no penetration of the ceramic occurred at the impact of a 7. 62 [*]mm ball round at 840 [*]m/s. Four different types of adhesive (high-strength till high-flexible) were tested in both configurations. The elongation of the adhesive layer, the deformation of the metallic backing and the failure of the ceramics were observed by means of a high-speed camera during the projectile/target interaction. The results of the ballistic tests showed that a higher fracture strain caused a larger deformation of the backing compared to adhesives, which exhibit a high tensile strength and low fracture strains. The experimental results indicate that the damage behavior of the ceramic/metal composites depends on the absolute elongation of the adhesive layer. This can be controlled either by the thickness or the stiffness of the bonding layer...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{parametric}} {{study was}} performed for four core designs of Sodium Fast Reactors (SFRs) {{in two different}} sizes: the large core of 3600 MWth with oxide or carbide fuel, and the medium core of 1000 MWth with oxide or metallic fuel. The Monte Carlo code SERPENT is chosen in the simulations, and the following global safety parameters are calculated {{at the beginning and}} end of cycle: - core multiplication factor; - sodium void worth; - Doppler constant; - effective delayed neutron fraction; - control rod worth; - average nuclide concentrations for end of equilibrium cycle; - radial power distribution. The calculated results show that the four cores remain slightly supercritical through the whole equilibrium cycle, with the multiplication factors being close to unity. The sodium void worth increases as the burnup is taking place. The Doppler constants are quite different for the four cores, ranging from - 1. 2 (EOC of metallic core and BOC of <b>carbide</b> <b>core)</b> to - 2. 1 (BOC of oxide core). The effective delayed neutron fractions are similar for all the four cores. The control rod worth for the medium cores is much higher than that of the large cores, due the greater ratio of control assemblies to driver assemblies in in the medium cores. The data of average nuclide concentrations at EOC indicate that the transuranics conversion ratios in the large cores are greater than those in the medium cores. Over time the power tends to increase in the inner core and keeps constant or decreasing in the outer core. The library of cross sections appears to have a significant impact on the simulated results. This implies the importance of having the right data for the cross sections...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports {{some studies}} of {{interfacial}} systems for biomedical applications. Nanosystems for Self Lighting Photo Dynamic Therapy (SLPDT) of cancer have been characterized from the growth {{steps up to}} the in vitro tests. At the same time, from a more fundamental point of view, aggregation and spontaneous fluctuation dynamics in interfacial model systems has been investigated. Several complementary techniques are employed for a comprehensive characterization of nanostructures (i. e. SEM, TEM, AFM) and for the study of their optical properties (i. e. microfluorescence, epifluorescence). Farther, for this cutting-edge research, state-of-the-art techniques have been employed: for instance, i) singlet oxygen production was excited by irradiation with a 6 MeV Linac; ii) mechanical properties of delicate Langmuir monolayers have been measured by ad-hoc developed techniques; iii) spontaneous fluctuation dynamics was characterized by synchrotron X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS). The thesis begins reporting investigations on molecular layers of porphyrins deposited by Supersonic Molecular Beam Deposition (SuMBD) as idealized interfaces to comprehend the more complex nanosystem i. e. porphyrinated core-shell nanowires constituted by a silica coating around a silicon <b>carbide</b> <b>core.</b> The latter are developed and studied for SLPDT applications. SLPDT is the evolution of the standard PDT to the treatment of deep tumors; the porphyrins locally activated by nanowires -suitably excited by X-rays- react with the oxygen molecules present in tissues, generating cytotoxic singlet oxygen. In this framework, besides nanowires, other nanostructures have been synthesized to pursue the maximum efficiency i. e. core-shell nanoparticles based on CeF 3 surrounded by an oxide cladding. CeF 3 is a very efficient scintillator converting X-ray photons in visible light while the oxide cladding allows many easy functionalization processes for biocompatibility and targeting. At the same time, some model interfacial systems have been investigated: firstly, a Langmuir network of hydrophobic gold nanoparticles at air/water interface to understand aggregation processes and to study the evolution of the dynamics at nanoscopic scale. Furthermore, a Langmuir mixed monolayer of lipid and silica nanoparticles has been investigated as a model system for the interactions between hydrophilic nanoparticles and a simple model of cell membrane. It is expected that studies like those presented here shall prove useful to understand the behavior of nanostructures in interaction with bio-interfaces and shall pave the way for novel applications...|$|E
