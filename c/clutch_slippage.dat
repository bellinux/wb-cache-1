50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate on}} the {{principle}} that engagement only needs to occur at a certain rate to be efficient and that engaging at a quicker rate can damage the drive train components of an automobile. Engaging the drive train to the engine too quickly can damage drive train parts, including the transmission, differential, half shafts, axles, and CV joints. Engaging the drive train too slowly can damage the clutch friction disc and cause <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generic approach to fault diagnosis of heavy duty machines that combines signal processing, statistics, machine learning, and case-based reasoning for on-board and off-board analysis. The used methods {{complement each other}} in that the on-board methods are fast and light-weight, while case-based reasoning is used off-board for fault diagnosis and for retrieving cases as support in manual decision making. Three major contributions are novel approaches to detecting <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage,</b> anomaly detection, and case-based diagnosis that is closely integrated with the anomaly detection model. As example application, the proposed approach {{has been applied to}} diagnosing the root cause of <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage</b> in automatic transmissions...|$|E
50|$|Introduction - Of all the {{electromagnetic}} clutches, the tooth clutches provide {{the greatest amount}} of torque in the smallest overall size. Because torque is transmitted without any <b>slippage,</b> <b>clutches</b> are ideal for multi stage machines where timing is critical such as multi-stage printing presses. Sometimes, exact timing needs to be kept, so tooth clutches can be made with a single position option which means that they will only engage at a specific degree mark. They can be used in dry or wet (oil bath) applications, so they are very well suited for gear box type drives.|$|R
40|$|Construction {{equipment}} companies continuously {{upgrade their}} products to meetcustomer demands, staying competitive with market challenges as well as improving sales and profits. With increased complexities in heavy duty machines today, up-time is considered {{an important aspect of}} the construction equipment business because it reduces warranty and service cost, while increasing sales and overall customer satisfaction. Therefore, a substantial amount of research is directed towards the development of intelligent machines which are capable of automatically monitoring the health of different components in the machine. Heavy duty construction equipment is often equipped with automatic transmissions, with multiple disc wet clutches, transferring torque from the engine to the gearbox enabling automatic gear ratio changes. The wet clutches in Volvo Construction Equipment vehicles may be considered as a crucial component of the driveline and failure may result in costly downtime. The frictional characteristics of wet clutches are crucial for the ultimate performance because they define clutch slip time during engagement. Furthermore, a wet clutch is considered to have failed when it can no longer transmit the desired torque. The level of torque transfer in wet clutches is controlled by the generated friction. Hence, <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage</b> is the result of diminishing frictional characteristics of wet clutches. Accurately monitoring slippage in wet clutches provides an indication of the health of the clutch material. However, many of the factors that influence the frictional characteristics of the wet clutch are only possible to measure in a test rig and not in actual machines. In this thesis the gap in condition monitoring of automatic transmission clutchesin an actual machine is addressed. A methodology for monitoring the health of the clutch material on-board the machine using the available CAN-bus signals via an on-board Data Stream Management System (DSMS) has been developed. The feature extraction methods utilized in the condition monitoring are based on Moving Average Square Value Filtering (MASVF) and a measure of the fourth order statistical properties of the CAN-bus signals implemented as continuous queries over data streams. Results show that the feature extraction methods provide an indication of <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage</b> deviations. This thesis also includes an investigation of <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage</b> detection from driveline vibrations based on spectrogram and spectral Kurtosis methods.

40|$|After a brief {{description}} of the most important “automatic” solutions, this paper explores the advantages of automated manual ones, particularly in the dual-clutch transmission (DCT) configuration. This mechanical architecture offers gear shifts without interruption of power (the so-called “torque gap”), by applying the engine torque to one clutch just as the engine torque is being disconnected from the other one. The result is jerk-free gear change with the same driving style found in a conventional automatic combined with the efficiency of a manual transmission. It is as smooth as the most automatics, but more economical; it is as easy to drive as a standard auto, faster and more responsive than even the sportiest manual gearbox. The two clutches are engaged alternatively in different speeds and power transmission continues during a shift through the control of <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage.</b> This outstanding design allows automakers to achieve what previously had seemed impossible: to improve both comfort and sportiness, whilst at the same time fulfilling the essential requirement of reducing fuel consumption. Historical evolution, future market forecast and recent patents complete the paper, while recent modelling approaches and proposed control strategies are referenced...|$|E
40|$|U-section {{steel sheet}} piles {{are one of}} the largest {{structural}} sections available and are a popular product for constructing large retaining walls throughout Europe and Asia. U-section piles have been widely used throughout the 20 th Century. However, in recent years their bending strength has been an issue of uncertainty because they are connected together by interlocking joints located along the pile wall centreline. As the piles resist bending moments, inter-pile movement can significantly increase bending stresses. When this occurs, the wall is said to have exhibited reduced modulus action, also known as <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage.</b> U-shaped piles are normally driven in pairs and the common interlock may be crimped or welded to prevent this inter-pile movement. The resulting pair of piles is asymmetric in cross-section and may exhibit a reduced bending strength due to oblique (biaxial) bending. The recently introduced Eurocode 3 Part 5 has taken this into account and applies a reduction factor to the bending strength. The work presented herein has been carried out to determine suitable values for the reduction factor. The work has involved the experimental testing 1 / 6 th scale U-piles and the research shows that freedom of lateral movement is essential to the development of oblique bending, and piles that are restrained against lateral movement will not exhibit significant oblique bending...|$|E
40|$|Large civil tiltrotors {{have been}} {{identified}} to replace regional airliners over medium ranges to alleviate next-generation air traffic. Variable rotor speed for these vehicles is required for efficient high-speed operation. Two-speed drive system research has been performed to support these advanced rotorcraft applications. Experimental tests were performed on two promising two-speed transmission configurations. The offset compound gear (OCG) transmission and the dual star/idler (DSI) planetary transmission were tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center variable-speed transmission test facility. Both configurations were inline devices with concentric {{input and output shafts}} and designed to provide 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 output speed reduction ratios. Both were designed for 200 hp and 15, 000 rpm input speed and had a dry shift clutch configuration. Shift tests were performed on the transmissions at input speeds of 5, 000, 8, 000, 10, 000, 12, 500, and 15, 000 rpm. Both the OCG and DSI configurations successfully perform speed shifts at full rated 15, 000 rpm input speed. The transient shifting behavior of the OCG and DSI configurations were very similar. The shift clutch had more of an effect on shifting dynamics than the reduction gearing configuration itself since the same shift clutch was used in both configurations. For both OCG and DSI configurations, low-to-high speed shifts were limited in applied torque levels in order to prevent overloads on the transmission due to transient torque spikes. It is believed that the relative lack of appreciable slippage of the dry shifting clutch at operating conditions and pressure profiles tested was a major cause of the transient torque spikes. For the low-to-high speed shifts, the output speed ramp-up time slightly decreased and the peak out torque slightly increased as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased. This was caused by slightly less <b>clutch</b> <b>slippage</b> as the clutch pressure ramp-down rate increased...|$|E
