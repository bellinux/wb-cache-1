5000|$|Close Relationships: It {{is often}} {{mentioned}} that worldview and self-esteem affect {{ways in which}} our fears of death are buffered with ABDT. <b>Close</b> <b>relationships</b> {{also serve as a}} regulator of these fears. Previous studies hinted at that <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> played a role in terror management, but they did not conceptualize, theoretically explain, or test the context of <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> in Terror Management Theories. <b>Close</b> <b>relationships</b> seem to be a product of natural selection because of their reproductive and survival benefits, having reproductive benefits contribute to the survival of people’s genes through their offspring. Therefore, <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> increase the likelihood of mating and brings about other survival skills like gathering food, finding shelter, environmental awareness, and protects offspring from dangers. Love and belongingness are ranked over those of esteem and self- actualization. The formation and maintenance of <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> have been recognized in both infants and adults as a source of regulating distress. It is also noted that self- esteem can also stem from <b>close</b> <b>relationships.</b> Based on these things it was assumed that formation and maintenance of <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> may serve as a death- anxiety- buffering mechanism.|$|R

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species' southwards colonisation from its native South Asia.

Even though {{this area has}} been extensively explored abroad, it has received little attention in the Czech Republic. We can see a certain paradox: While there are no standard methods of measuring or specifying relationship characteristics of the Czech population, foreign literature is abundant in theories on how <b>close</b> personal <b>relationships</b> work, offering methods of their measurement. These methods usually focus on a specific component of the relationship. Therefore, {{it has not been}} possible to fully meet the objectives of this thesis. The first objective was to perform a theoretical mapping of <b>close</b> <b>relationships,</b> which is not fully possible due to the limited extent of the thesis.

40|$|Relationships and {{sexuality}} following heart attack (MI) have been studied; nevertheless, {{little is known}} about the meaning of social support and relationships to health and well-being after an MI. To our knowledge, no qualitative studies have further investigated the phenomenon. In this study we explore the meaning of <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> {{and sexuality}} to women’s health and well-being following MI. Ten women were interviewed using a reflective lifeworld approach and phenomenological epistemology. The meaning of women’s <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> following an MI appears to be closely intertwined with their long-term health process; both health processes and the relationships are affected. Suffering after an MI can be compared to taking a fall in that <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> can become a safety net. <b>Close</b> <b>relationships</b> and sexuality are integrated into their lived bodies, and in that way have profound influence in their lifeworld experiences. Not all <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> are intimate; however, all <b>close</b> and meaningful <b>relationships</b> can provide power and strength to the women’s health processes. At the same time, these relationships also appear to drain energy and cause suffering...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that humans have a deep {{motivation}} to pursue and maintain <b>close</b> <b>relationships,</b> little research has examined social relationships from a motivational perspective. In the current paper, we argue that any model of <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> must simultaneously account for people’s tendencies to both approach incentives and avoid threats in <b>close</b> <b>relationships.</b> To that end, we review research stemming from Gable’s (2006) social and relationship model of motivation on both the antecedents {{and the consequences of}} approach and avoidance goal pursuit in the context of <b>close</b> <b>relationships.</b> We conclude with recommendations for future research in this area. The Centrality of <b>Close</b> <b>Relationships</b> <b>Close</b> <b>relationships</b> are a central component of the human experience throughout the life-span. The quality of <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> is intricately entwined with psychological health (e. g., Beach & O’Leary, 1993; Bersheid & Reis, 1998). Several studies have shown that relationships are an important – perhaps the most important – source of life satisfaction and emotional well-being (e. g., Biswas-Diener & Diener, 2001; Campbell, Converse, & Rodgers, 1976; Diener & Seligman, 2002). These empirical findings echo what people say when asked what currently gives their lives meaning or when asked to think back on their lives and what made them fulfilling (e. g., Klinger, 1977; Sears, 1977). Indeed, many theories of well-being view positive and fulfilling <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> as a necessary compo-nent of well-being (e. g., Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2008; Keyes, 1998; Ryff, 1995). However, even though <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> contribute substantially to psychological health, they can also be the source of considerable suffering and emotional pain. People often cite relationship conflicts and problems when they are asked what is going ‘‘wrong’’ in their lives (Veroff, Douvan, & Kulka, 1981) or as a reason for seeking psychotherapy (e. g., Pinsker, Nepps, Redfield, & Winston, 1985). Relationship problems also contribute to psychopathological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse (e. g. ...|$|R

Parental attachment was assessed through the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA: Armsden 2 ̆ 6 Greenberg, 1987), and hierarchical linear modeling allowed for calculations of the average and discrepancy of attachment to each adolescent’s parent dyad. Using the Experiences in <b>Close</b> <b>Relationships</b> Questionnaire (ECR: Brennan, Clark, 2 ̆ 6 Shaver, 1998), attachment style in emerging adulthood was evaluated in terms of the level of avoidance and anxiety in <b>close</b> <b>relationships.</b> While avoidance in <b>close</b> <b>relationships</b> was predicted by dyadic parental attachment, anxiety was not. Congruent with expectations, less avoidance was associated with stronger parent dyad attachments. Additionally, older age appeared to predict less avoidance in <b>close</b> <b>relationships.</b> These findings demonstrate the important contribution of adoptive parent-child relationships for later relationships...|$|R
