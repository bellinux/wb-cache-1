40|$|This study {{investigated}} which strategies children aged 5 - 15 years (N = 408) employ while performing a multitrial free recall test of semantically unrelated words. <b>Serial</b> <b>clustering</b> (i. e., a relatively passive strategy) is {{an index of}} the sequential consistency of recall order. Subjective clustering (i. e., a more active strategy) is based on similar word groupings in successive trials. Previously, Meijs et al. (2009) found {{that the level of}} (<b>serial</b> and subjective) <b>clustering</b> increases with age. At all ages, the level of <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> correlates positively with the ability to recall information on VLT trials. However, subjective clustering is more predictive of VLT performance than <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> after ≥ 3 trials, but only in children aged 8 +. Knowledge on how children organize words (based on, for example, sound or meaning) and how this relates to developmental stage is still lacking. This study revealed that the level of subjective clustering is primarily determined by the position of words in a VLT list. More specifically, primacy (i. e., recall of words 1 - 3 of the VLT list-whether recalled in the same order or reversed) and recency (i. e., recall of words 14 - 15) effects primarily determine level subjective organization over successive trials. Thus, older children still organize words based on the serial position of the VLT list and are much less likely to organize them based on any other feature of the words, for example, sound or meaning. This indicates that the most important information to be learned needs to be presented first or last, even in older children and even with repeated presentations. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Under {{particular}} large-scale atmospheric conditions, several windstorms {{may affect}} Europe {{within a short}} time period. The occurrence of such cyclone families leads to large socioeconomic impacts and cumulative losses. The <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> of windstorms is analyzed for the North Atlantic/western Europe. Clustering is quantified as the dispersion (ratio variance/mean) of cyclone passages over a certain area. Dispersion statistics are derived for three reanalysis data sets and a 20 -run European Centre Hamburg Version 5 /Max Planck Institute Version–Ocean Model Version 1 global climate model (ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM 1 GCM) ensemble. The dependence of the seriality on cyclone intensity is analyzed. Confirming previous studies, <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> is identified in reanalysis data sets primarily on both flanks and downstream regions of the North Atlantic storm track. This pattern is a robust feature in the reanalysis data sets. For the whole area, extreme cyclones cluster more than nonextreme cyclones.

Under future climate conditions (A 1 B scenario), the GCM ensemble indicates that <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> may decrease over the North Atlantic storm track area and parts of western Europe. This decrease is associated with an extension of the polar jet toward Europe, which implies a tendency to a more regular occurrence of cyclones over parts of the North Atlantic Basin poleward of 50 °N and western Europe. An increase of clustering of cyclones is projected south of Newfoundland.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{are many}} {{important}} clustering questions in computational biology {{for which no}} satisfactory method exists. Automated clustering algorithms, when applied to large, multidimensional datasets, such as flow cytometry data, prove unsatisfactory in terms of speed, problems with local minima or cluster shape bias. Model-based approaches are restricted by the assumptions of the fitting functions. Furthermore, model based <b>clustering</b> requires <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> for all cluster numbers within a user defined interval. The final cluster number is then selected by various criteria. These supervised <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> methods are time consuming and frequently different criteria result in different optimal cluster numbers. Various unsupervised heuristic approaches {{that have been developed}} such as affinity propagation are too expensive to be applied to datasets on the order of 10 6 points that are often generated by high throughput experiments. Results To circumvent these limitations, we developed a new, unsupervised density contour clustering algorithm, called Misty Mountain, that is based on percolation theory and that efficiently analyzes large data sets. The approach can be envisioned as a progressive top-down removal of clouds covering a data histogram relief map to identify clusters by the appearance of statistically distinct peaks and ridges. This is a parallel clustering method that finds every cluster after analyzing only once the cross sections of the histogram. The overall run time for the composite steps of the algorithm increases linearly by the number of data points. The clustering of 10 6 data points in 2 D data space takes place within about 15 seconds on a standard laptop PC. Comparison of the performance of this algorithm with other state of the art automated flow cytometry gating methods indicate that Misty Mountain provides substantial improvements in both run time and in the accuracy of cluster assignment. Conclusions Misty Mountain is fast, unbiased for cluster shape, identifies stable clusters and is robust to noise. It provides a useful, general solution for multidimensional clustering problems. We demonstrate its suitability for automated gating of flow cytometry data. </p...|$|R

RESULTS: The late positive deflection presumed to be associated with stimulus evaluation (P 300) was of lower amplitude and had a longer latency in the patients compared with controls of similar age and sex. We found correlations between P 300 amplitude and latency, and neuropsychological performance scores in patients. There were correlations between decreased P 300 amplitude and lower IQ and poorer memory performance, in particular, abnormal semantic clustering, discriminability and intrusion errors.

This study has investigated <b>serial</b> (temporal) <b>clustering</b> of extra-tropical cyclones simulated by 17 climate models that participated in CMIP 5. Clustering was estimated by calculating the dispersion (ratio of variance to mean) of 30 December-February counts of Atlantic storm tracks passing nearby each grid point. Results from single historical simulations of 1975 - 2005 were compared to those from historical ERA 40 reanalyses from 1958 - 2001 ERA 40 and single future model projections of 2069 - 2099 under the RCP 4. 5 climate change scenario. Models were generally able to capture the broad features in reanalyses reported previously: underdispersion/regularity (i. e. variance less than mean) in the western core of the Atlantic storm track surrounded by overdispersion/clustering (i. e. variance greater than mean) to the north and south and over western Europe. Regression of counts onto North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices revealed that much of the overdispersion in the historical reanalyses and model simulations can be accounted for by NAO variability. Future changes in dispersion were generally found to be small and not consistent across models. The overdispersion statistic, for any 30 year sample, is prone to large amounts of sampling uncertainty that obscures the climate change signal. For example, the projected increase in dispersion for storm counts near London in the CNRMCM 5 model is 0. 1 compared to a standard deviation of 0. 25. Projected changes in the mean and variance of NAO are insufficient to create changes in overdispersion that are discernible above natural sampling variations.

The generation of terms and their weights from the document text may vary, but the TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) method is popular for clustering applications [1]. The assumption is that the resulting document vector is a good overall representation of the original document. We note that the dimensionality of the document vectors is very high (potentially infinite), since a document could potentially contain any word (term). We also note that the vectors are sparse {{in the sense that}} most term weights have a zero value. We assume that each term not explicitly present in a particular document vector has a weight of zero. Document vectors are normalized. Clusters are also represented as a list of weighted terms. At any given time, a cluster’s term vector is equal to the average of all the document vector’s contained by the cluster. Cluster term vectors are truncated to the top K terms (those containing the highest term weights). Cluster term vectors are kept normalized. The objective of the algorithm is to partition the set of document vectors into a set of clusters, each cluster containing only those documents which are similar to each other with respect to some metric.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 38 - 43) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is {{a progressive}} and fatal brain disorder that {{is characterized by}} memory loss, behavioral change, and cognitive impairments resulting from neuronal degeneration. Declines in olfactory function occur early {{in the course of}} the disease and are evident before other cognitive impairments. Advancing age and possession of the [lower case epsilon] 4 isoform of the apolipoprotein E Gene (apoE) are risk factors for both AD and olfactory function impairment, yet it is likely that both environmental and genetic factors contribute to AD pathology. Stress is an environmental factor that impacts the aging process through physiological and psychological processes. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are hormones that are released during stress, and have been implicated as potentially important in the development of AD. Recent studies demonstrated an interactive impact of stress and apoE [lower case epsilon] 4 on cognitive impairment, but to date, no one has reported on the potential impact of stress and apoE [lower case epsilon] 4 on olfactory function. Elucidating the mechanisms of action that lead to impaired olfaction for those at risk for AD may help inform techniques for prevention and early detection of the disease. The current study examined the effect of stress and the apoE [lower case epsilon] 4 allele on olfactory learning and memory in 32 young and 32 older adults. Stress was operationally defined using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; subjective stress) and Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR; physiological stress). It was hypothesized that there would be (1) a main effect of stress on odor memory and learning, (2) an apoE by stress interaction such that individuals with at least one apoE [lower case epsilon] 4 allele would have a greater decline in olfactory scores as stress scores increased than individuals with no apoE [lower case epsilon] 4 allele, and (3) an age effect such that the stress and apoE interaction would be evident in older but not younger adults. Subjective stress improved performance on immediate recall across trials, short and long delay free recall, and odor identification. When participants were given cues after a delay, [lower case epsilon] 4 - older and younger adults improved odor recall as PSWQ scores increased, while [lower case epsilon] 4 + younger adults did not improve, and older [lower case epsilon] 4 + adults recalled less as PSWQ scores increased. Use of <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> was affected by CAR in those individuals who were CAR responders such that increasing CAR appeared to be associated with increasing use of <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> for [lower case epsilon] 4 - individuals, and with decreasing use for [lower case epsilon] 4 + adults. Recognition scores were not significantly affected by either stress measure. Taken together, these findings suggest that stress may affect olfactory memory differentially depending on apoE [lower case epsilon] 4 status. Some support was found to suggest that CAR may be associated with use of certain learning techniques for CAR responders, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings in larger samples...|$|R

As the HVLT-R is part of a widely used battery of cognitive functioning backed by the U. S. Federal Drug Administration as the accepted battery for use in pro-cognitive trials assessing cognitive-enhancing drugs in the related disorder schizophrenia, estimating the utility of its measures in BD is important. Forty-nine BD patients and 51 healthy controls completed the HVLT-R, which was scored for 13 variables of interest, across 4 indices: recall and learning, recognition, strategic organization, and errors. BD patients had greater difficulty in learning the HVLT-R word list compared to controls. They also demonstrated impairment in delayed recall/ recognition. There were no differences between the groups in terms of their slope of learning, retrieval index, retention percentage, semantic or <b>serial</b> <b>clustering,</b> errors, or level of retrieval. This pattern was consistent across symptomatic and euthymic patients. The HVLT-R has some utility in characterizing the component processes involved in memory function in BD, such that memory impairments appear to be attributable to deficient encoding processes during the acquisition phase of learning.

The traditional <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> algorithm has two problems {{and it is difficult}} to meet the needs of practical applications: the first one is that the speed of clustering is not fast enough and the efficiency is not high; the other one is that in the face of mass data, subject to the limits of memory capacity, it often cannot run effectively. This paper studied the traditional spectral clustering algorithm and designed efficient parallel spectral clustering algorithm. The strategy of parallel spectral clustering algorithm is to compute similar matrix and sparse according to data points segmentation; when computing eigenvectors, store the Laplacian matrix on the distributed file system HDFS, use distributed Lanczos to compute and get the eigenvectors by parallel computation; at last, in terms of the transposed matrix of eigenvectors, adopt the improved parallel K-Means cluster to obtain the clustering results. Through adopting different parallel strategies about each step of the algorithm, the whole algorithm gets linear growth in speed. The experimental results show that the proposed parallel spectral clustering algorithm is suitable for applying in mass data mining. We hope that the research achievements of this paper can provide inspiration and application value for subsequent research developers.|$|R
40|$|Given a {{very large}} moderate-to-high {{dimensionality}} dataset, how could one cluster its points? For datasets that don’t fit even on a single disk, parallelism is a first class option. In this paper we explore MapReduce for clustering this kind of data. The main questions are (a) how to minimize the I/O cost, {{taking into account the}} already existing data partition (e. g., on disks), and (b) how to minimize the network cost among processing nodes. Either of them may be a bottleneck. Thus, we propose the Best of both Worlds – BoW method, that automatically spots the bottleneck and chooses a good strategy. Our main contributions are: (1) We propose BoW and carefully derive its cost functions, which dynamically choose the best strategy; (2) We show that BoW has numerous desirable features: it can work with most <b>serial</b> <b>clustering</b> methods as a pluggedin clustering subroutine, it balances the cost for disk accesses and network accesses, achieving a very good tradeoff between the two, it uses no user-defined parameters (thanks to our reasonable defaults), it matches the clustering quality of the serial algorithm, and it has near-linear scale-up; and finally, (3) We report experiments on real and synthetic data with billions of points, using up to 1, 024 cores in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, our Yahoo! web is the largest real dataset ever reported in the database subspace clustering literature. Spanning 0. 2 TB of multi-dimensional data, it took only 8 minutes to be clustered, using 128 cores. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{looked at}} the {{relationship}} between the 27 indices on the California Verbal Learning Test - Children's Version (CVLT-C) and the 19 scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Test for Children - Third Edition (WISC-III). The sample consisted of 58 children, ages 6 - 16 from a clinical population. The subgroups with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Learning Disabilities (LD), and High Ability (HA) were compared to children with no clinical diagnosis (ND) on WISC-III Full Scale IQ, Verbal IQ, and Performance IQ; on CVLT-C Total Recall Trials 1 - 5; and on CVLC factors of Attention Span, Learning Efficiency, Free Delayed Recall, Cued Delayed Recall, and Inaccurate Recall. Twelve significant correlations were found between the CVLT-C and WISC-III including Full Scale IQ with Total Recall Trials 1 - 5, Discriminability, and False Positives; Verbal IQ with False Positives; Vocabulary with Total Recall Trials 1 - 5; Information with <b>Serial</b> <b>Cluster</b> Ratio; Digit Span with Total Recall Trials 1 - 5 and Discriminability; Processing Speed with Discriminability and False Positives; and Symbol Search with False Positives, all within the moderate range. In comparing clinical subgroups, children with ADHD did not differ significantly from those without a clinical diagnosis (ND) on any selected measures. Children diagnosed with learning disabilities were significantly lower on Total Recall Trials 1 - 5, Attention Span, and Cued Delayed Recall. Children with high abilities (HA) were significantly higher on WISC-III Full Scale IQ, Verbal IQ, Performance IQ, CVLT-C Total Recall Trials 1 - 5, Learning Efficiency, and Free Delayed Recall. This study empirically supported a positive relationship between memory processes and cognitive abilities while also confirming that each are a part of a larger cognitive process.

On {{the one hand}} we find a connection be-tween reflexive modules {{with respect to a}} cotilting (bi) module U and a notion of U-torsionless linear compactness. On the other hand we provide concrete examples of cotilting bimod-ules over linearly <b>compact</b> noetherian <b>serial</b> rings. Cotilting theory is a generalization of Morita duality in a sense that is analogous to that in which tilting theory is a generalization of Morita equiv-alence. Indeed, cotilting modules first appeared as vector space duals of tilting modules over finite dimensional algebras (see, e. g., [H, IV, 7. 8]), just as injective cogenerators are such duals of progenerators. Later, R. R. Colby [Cb 1] studied finitely generated cotilting bimodules over noetherian rings, proving that they induce finitistic generalized Morita dualities, similar to the finite dimensional algebra case. More recently, in [Cb 2] he investigated a more general class of representable dualities, namely (nonfinitistic) gen...|$|R
