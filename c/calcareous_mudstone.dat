25|$|Sedimentation in {{the basin}} started during the Middle to Late Eocene with the Macarao Formation and {{continued}} again during the Late Oligocene, when the Siamaná Formation, a sequence of conglomerates and thick carbonates, was deposited. Overlying the Siamaná Formation is the Early Miocene Uitpa Formation, a thick sequence of <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstone</b> interbedded with lithic sandstones. The Uitpa Formation is covererd by the Miocene Jimol and Castilletes Formations, composed mostly of lithic sandstones and mudstones, that are in certain areas highly fossiliferous. The last phase of preserved sedimentation {{is represented by the}} Pliocene Ware Formation, defined in 2015 by Moreno et al.|$|E
60|$|In a {{formation}} so highly variable in mineralogical nature, any division not founded on fossil remains, must be extremely arbitrary: nevertheless, the beds below the last conglomerate may, {{in accordance with}} all the sections hitherto described, be considered as belonging to the porphyritic conglomerate, and those above it to the gypseous formation, marked [E] in the section. The part of the valley in which the following beds are seen is near Potrero Seco. Bed 5, compact, fine-grained, pale greenish-grey, non- calcareous, indurated mudstone, easily fusible into a pale green and white glass. Bed 6, purplish, coarse-grained, hard sandstone, with broken crystals of feldspar and crystallised particles of carbonate of lime; it possesses a slightly nodular structure. Bed 7, blackish-grey, much indurated, <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstone,</b> with extraneous particles of unequal size; the whole being in parts finely brecciated. In this mass there is a stratum, twenty feet in thickness, of impure gypsum. Bed 8, a greenish mudstone, with several layers of gypsum. Bed 9, a highly indurated, easily fusible, white tuff, thickly mottled with ferruginous matter, and including some white semi-porcellanic layers, which are interlaced with ferruginous veins. This stone closely resembles some of the commonest varieties in the Uspallata chain. Bed 10, a thick bed of rather bright green, indurated mudstone or tuff, with a concretionary nodular structure so strongly developed that the whole mass consists of balls. I {{will not attempt to}} estimate the thickness of the strata in the gypseous formation hitherto described, but it must certainly be very many hundred feet. Bed 11 is at least 800 feet in thickness: it consists of thin layers of whitish, greenish, or more commonly brown, fine-grained, indurated tuffs, which crumble into angular fragments: some of the layers are semi-porcellanic, many of them highly ferruginous, and some are almost composed of carbonate of lime and iron with drusy cavities lined with quartzf-crystals. Bed 12, dull purplish or greenish or dark-grey, very compact and much indurated mudstone: estimated at 1,500 feet in thickness: in some parts this rock assumes the character of an imperfect coarse clay-slate; but viewed under a lens, the basis always has a mottled appearance, with the edges of the minute component particles blending together. Parts are calcareous, and there are numerous veins of highly crystalline carbonate of lime charged with iron. The mass has a nodular structure, and is divided by only a few planes of stratification: there are, however, two layers, each about eighteen inches thick, of a dark brown, finer-grained stone, having a conchoidal, semi-porcellanic fracture, which can be followed with the eye for some miles across the country.|$|E

TOC showed a negative correlation with OI, indicating that oxic marine bottom condition controlled TOC contents in this basin. Mixed Type II–III and Type III kerogen were predominantly recorded in the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene offshore sediments. Consequently, studied stratigraphic units in the Mannar Basin are more capable of generating gaseous than liquid hydrocarbons.|$|R

50|$|The Purbeck Group has {{a typical}} {{thickness}} of 77 to 186m in the Weald and {{is composed of}} predominantly bluish grey <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstones.</b> Limited developments of limestone, sandstone, siltstone, ironstone and evaporite minerals occur throughout the sequence. The Purbeck Group was deposited {{in an environment of}} braided rivers and muddy lagoons, which periodically dried out, resulting in the now economic deposits of gypsum being deposited in this area, The same beds outcrop on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset but there are difficulties in correlating the two exposures, which has led to increased study of these rocks. During their deposition the region lay at a latitude of about 30°N and thus experienced a tropical climate.|$|R
50|$|The Haynesville Shale is a lithological heterogeneous, often organic-rich, mudstone. The {{composition}} of these mudstones varies greatly depending on position on geographic location and stratigraphic position. They vary from <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstone</b> near the carbonate platforms and islands to argillaceous mudstone {{in areas where}} submarine fans prograded into the basin and diluted organic matter For example, the Haynesville Shale has been observed to vary in composition from 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent calcite in samples recovered from one oil and gas well. In that well, the Haynesville Shale consists of silty, argillaceous mudstones, silty, calcareous mudstones, and dolomitic mudstones and dolostones. The silty, argillaceous mudstones contain more than 30% silt-sized siliceous grains. The silt often occurs as laminations within these mudstones. In addition, the argillaceous matrix of such mudstones frequently contains numerous calcareous particles and stringers. The calcareous particles include coccoliths, bivalve, and gastropod fragments, and calcispheres. Organic matter {{in the form of}} amorphous kerogen coats the argillaceous material. Silty, calcareous mudstones contain more than 20% calcite. In these mudstones, the calcite occurs as silt-sized microfossil hash composed of fragmented fossils and carbonate mud. Where organic matter is low and silts are rare, the calcareous microfossil and carbonate mud has recrystallized. Possibly, further alteration of silty, calcareous mudstones has resulted {{in the formation of the}} dolomitic mudstones and dolostones. Both the silty, argillaceous mudstones and silty, calcareous mudstones often exhibit sparse to abundant, laminated pelletal fabrics.|$|E
30|$|The study area, {{located in}} the Qibei sub-sag of the Qikou Sag, is a Cenozoic rifted basin (Zhou et al. 2011). The Sha 2 member is the target zone for study and has a burial depth of 4, 100 – 5, 000  m, a {{reservoir}} (single layer) thickness of less than 12  m, and a lithology of sandstone, mudstone, <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstone,</b> and dolomite interbeds with unequal thicknesses. In recent years, high-yielding oil and gas wells in the Sha 2 member have been discovered in this area; thus, there is an urgent {{need to understand the}} reservoir distribution and sedimentary pattern. However, the predominant frequency of seismic data in this area is approximately 17  Hz; this resolution does not meet the demand for distinguishing thin interbed reservoirs less than 12  m thick. Moreover, due to the existence of <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstone,</b> it is also difficult to distinguish sandstone from <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstone</b> using the wave impedance absolute value. As a result, it is difficult to reflect the variation of the sedimentary reservoir by seismic slices. Therefore, the co-kriging and fractal theory-based lithology conversion technique and the seismic sedimentology research method for continental basins are utilized in this study to determine the spatial distribution and sedimentary features of the reservoirs.|$|E
30|$|Ekenkpon shale {{directly}} overlies the Mfamosing limestone. It is a black, highly fissile shale {{unit with}} minor but frequent intercalation of marls, <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstone,</b> and shell beds. According to Nyong and Ramanathan (1985), the deposition of this shale unit spans late Albian through Cenomanian to Turonian and represents two transgressive cycles.|$|E
50|$|Across {{the north}} central and {{northern}} North Sea, the Chalk Group {{is a major}} seal unit, overlying a number of blocks of reservoir rocks and preventing their fluid contents from migrating upwards. North {{of the line of}} the Mid-North Sea - Ringkobing - Fyn structural high, the Chalk Group is still recognisable in drilled samples, but becomes increasingly muddy northwards. North of the Beryl Embayment (59°30' N 01°30'E), the Chalk Group is a series of slightly to moderately <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstones</b> grouped under the name of the Shetland Group. With the exception of some thin sandy units in the inner Moray Firth, this sequence has neither source potential nor reservoir capacity and is not generally considered a drilling target. Its thickness and homogeneity does make it a common target for carrying out directional drilling manoeuvers.|$|R

The coal measures are preserved in the Buller Coalfield, the Heaphy River, Takaka, and Richmond.

40|$|Cretaceous {{complex in}} {{eastern part of}} the Intra-Sudetic Basin and Nysa Graben (SW Poland) is dominantly {{composed}} of sand-stones and <b>calcareous</b> <b>mudstones</b> and claystones, interpreted as a littoral-to-shelf succession which formed between the Upper Cenomanian and Santonian (Wojewoda, 1997). Its present thick-ness varies from about 350 m in the Góry Stoowe Mts. area up to 1200 m in the Nysa Trough. The thickness variation of the complex is due to differences in paleotopography of the Creta-ceous basin and its variable capability of sediment accommoda-tion in different parts, as well as to subsequent tectonic defor-mation and erosion. As a result of the latter, the complex is locally discontinuous, cut by faults and locally rotated up to vertical position or even overturned (Don B. and Don J., 1960, Don J., 1996). In the area studied, Cretaceous deposits overlie both crystalline and older sedimentary rocks...|$|R
