5000|$|An early {{application}} of the electric fence for livestock control was developed in 1936 - 1937 by New Zealand inventor Bill Gallagher. Built from a car ignition trembler <b>coil</b> <b>set,</b> Gallagher used the device to keep his horse from scratching itself against his car. Gallagher later started the Gallagher Group to improve and market the design. In 1962, another New Zealand inventor, Doug Phillips, invented the non-shortable electric fence based on capacitor discharge. This significantly increased the range an electric fence could be used from a few hundred metres to 35 km (~20 miles), and reduced the cost of fencing by more than 80%. The non-shortable electric fence was patented by Phillips and by 1964 was manufactured by Plastic Products, a New Zealand firm, under the name [...] "Waikato Electric Fence." [...] This idea was to replace ceramic with plastic insulators. A variety of plastic insulators are now used on farms throughout the world today.|$|E

The 100 T ND controlled power outer <b>coil</b> <b>set</b> consists of seven nested, mechanically independent externally reinforced coils. These coils, in combination, will produce a 47 T platform field in a 225 -mm diameter bore. Using inertial energy storage a synchronous motor/generator provides ac power to a set of seven ac-dc converters rated at 64 MW/ 80 MVA each. These converters energize three independent coil circuits to create 170 MJ of field energy in the outer <b>coil</b> <b>set</b> at the platform field of 47 T.

The autofrettage conditioning method will be used to pre-stress the coils and thereby limit conductor and reinforcement strains to the elastic range.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the magnetic force models of magnetic bearing in a flywheel energy storage system (FESS). The magnetic bearing is of hybrid type, with axial passive magnetic bearing (PMB) and radial hybrid magnetic bearing (HMB). For the PMB, a pair of ring-type Halbach arrays of permanent magnets are arranged vertically to support the rotor weight. For the HMB, a set of ring-type Halbach array is placed on the rotor side, which corresponds to <b>coil</b> <b>sets</b> on the stator side. The HMB can produce both attraction and repulsion forces on the radial direction, depending on the direction of the coil currents. It is found that the ring-type configuration and the differential winding scheme for <b>coil</b> <b>sets</b> can yield linear magnetic force models for both PMB and HMB. Based on the obtained magnetic force model, an integral sliding mode controller is designed for the stable rotor levitation in the radial direction.

Fast energy transients, {{incident}} on the DIII-D divertors due to Type-I edge localized modes (ELMs), are eliminated using small dc currents {{in a simple}} set of non-axisymmetric coils that produce edge resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP). In ITER similar shaped (ISS) plasmas, with electron pedestal collisionalities matched to those expected in ITER a sharp resonant window in the safety factor at the 95 percent normalized poloidal flux surface is observed for ELM suppression at q 95 = 3. 57 with a minimum width ï¿½q 95 of Â± 0. 05.
