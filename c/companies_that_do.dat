5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

25|$|Unions have {{recently}} been engaged in a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects.

25|$|Weber's {{theory can}} {{explain some of}} the causes for current movement, yet such {{discussion}} did not come from Weber himself. Weber found industrial activity the least expensive to produce. Least cost location then implies marketing the product at the least cost to the consumer, much like retailers attempt to obtain large market shares today. Economically, it is explained as one way to make a profit; creating the cheapest product for the consumer market leads to greater volume of sales and hence, greater profits. Therefore, <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not take the time to locate the cheapest inputs or the largest markets would not succeed, since their product costs more to produce and costs the consumer more.|$|E
25|$|Section 952 of Dodd–Frank {{deals with}} {{independent}} compensation committees {{as well as}} their advisors and legal teams. These provisions require the SEC to make national stock exchanges set standards for the compensation committees of publicly traded companies listed on these exchanges. Under these standards national stock exchanges are prohibited from listing public <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not have an independent compensation committee. To insure that compensation committees remain independent, the SEC is required to identify any areas that may create a potential conflict of interest and work to define exactly what requirements must be met for the committee to be considered independent. Some of the areas examined for conflicts of interest include other services provided by advisors, personal relationships between advisors and shareholders, advisor fees as a percentage of their company's revenue, and advisors' stock holdings. These provisions also cover advisors and legal teams serving compensation committees by requiring proxy statements to disclose any compensation consultants and include a review of each to ensure no conflicts of interest exist. Compensation committees are fully responsible for selecting advisors and determining their compensation. Final regulations covering issues surrounding compensation committees were implemented in June 2012 by the SEC and took effect in July 2012. Under these regulations the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ also added their own rules regarding the retention of committee advisors. These regulations were approved by the SEC in 2013 and took full effect in early 2014.|$|E

Most filings were to delay {{potentially}} infringing trademark applications so Monster could study them. Some were formal oppositions and about 30 resulted in lawsuits. Most lawsuits were settled with non-disclosed terms. Critics and defendants say that Monster is too aggressive in pursuing trademark protections against <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not have confusingly similar products and that it is trying to own a common word, not protect a brand. Monster representatives say they are doing what most [...] "premium" [...] brands do to protect their marks and that their products include things like clothes, mints and music.|$|E

[...] However, {{it appears that the}} law would oblige or empower (oblige in response to a complaint, empower if they believe warranted) the Ministers to investigate and report on any Canadian mining or oil company regardless of whether it was currently receiving support – so the potential sanction of government condemnation would apply to any extractive industry company, if one of the Ministers decides it is not acting consistently with the CSR guidelines.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the criticisms}} of the CAPM is that beta is derived from {{volatility}} of prices of publicly traded companies, which differ from non-publicly companies in liquidity, marketability, capital structures and control. Other aspects such as access to credit markets, size, and management depth are generally different, too. The rate build-up method also requires {{an assessment of the}} subject company's risk, which provides valuation of itself. [...] Where a privately held company can be shown to be sufficiently similar to a public company, the CAPM may be suitable. However, it requires the knowledge of market stock prices for calculation. For private <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not sell stock on the public capital markets, this information is not readily available. Therefore, calculation of beta for private firms is problematic. The build-up cost of capital model is the typical choice in such cases.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to traditional sex shops, which sell sex paraphernalia, {{there has also}} been an explosive growth of online adult toy companies that specialize in leather/latex gear and BDSM toys.

Today practically all suppliers of sex toys do offer items which originally found usage in the BDSM subculture. Padded handcuffs, latex and leather garments, as well as more exotic items like soft whips for fondling and TENS for erotic electro stimulation can be found in catalogs aiming on classical vanilla target groups, indicating that former boundaries increasingly seem to shift.|$|E
