He counted numerous foreign clients, among them Frederick II of Prussia, for whom was conceived Latz's grandest piece, a richly mounted clock, Augustus III, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, Count Heinrich von Brühl and Madame Elisabeth, Louis XV's favourite daughter, married to the Duke of Parma. At {{the time of his}} marriage in 1739, most unusually, the marriage contract was witnessed by two grand personages, Sister Marie-Gabrielle-Eléanor de Bourbon-Condé, abbess of the Abbaye Royale de Saint-Antoine, a princesse du Sang, and another abbess of a distinguished family, Jeanne de Rohan. Henry Hawley has suggested that such contacts would have provided a useful entrée at court.|$|R

5000|$|In 1753 Thomas Stretch {{erected a}} large clock dial and masonry <b>clock</b> <b>case</b> {{at the west}} end of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. That equipment, which resembled a giant tall clock (grandfather clock), had been removed in about 1830. The clock’s dials were mounted at the east and west ends of the main {{building}} connected by rods to the clock movement {{in the middle of the}} building. [...] The western end had a masonry structure designed to look like the <b>clock</b> <b>case.</b> The acquisition of the original clock and bell by the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly is closely related to the acquisition of the Liberty Bell. By mid-1753, the clock had been installed in the State House attic, but six years were to elapse before Thomas Stretch received any pay for it.|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} {{is likely to}} have been developed by English cabinet-makers in the 1660s, immediately after the Restoration of the monarchy, first being used on furniture such as the cocuswood cabinet on stand which bears the cipher of Queen Henrietta Maria, constructed in c.1661-65, and now at Windsor Castle. Early oyster veneered cabinets were invariably in cocus or kingwood. Contemporary longcase <b>clock</b> <b>cases</b> were similarly veneered.|$|R

Its accuracy was about a second per year.|$|R
25|$|Munroe {{became a}} {{journeyman}} {{in the shop}} {{for about six months}} after becoming twenty one years old, completing his apprenticeship. In 1800 he left and went to Concord, Massachusetts. There he worked for his older brothers, Daniel and Nathaniel, who were clockmakers. He passed his time by making <b>clock</b> <b>cases.</b> The brothers wrote in Munroe on a contract as a full partner in their business from 1801 though 1804.|$|R
50|$|The {{source of}} the clock's name is unknown. One myth is that the clock was meant to commemorate Ohio's {{admission}} to the Union as the 17th state because the shield {{on the front of}} the <b>clock's</b> <b>case</b> has seventeen stars in it. However, there is no record that shows the clock celebrates Ohio's statehood and the clock was ordered twelve years after Ohio became a state, at a time when there were already eighteen states.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{the first}} to equip a Bahnhäusle style <b>clock</b> <b>case</b> with a cuckoo {{mechanism}} in 1854. A milestone in the Black Forest clock history, after this cuckoo clocks became popular and marketed worldwide. Indeed, although the Bahnhäusle style creator, Friedrich Eisenlohr, had proposed a cuckoo clock in his 1850 original design, however it was not until 1854 when J. B. Beha became the first clockmaker who take it from drawing to reality.|$|R
5000|$|The clock {{dates back}} to the early fourteenth century, {{possibly}} around 1320. It is suggested that it was built by Peter Lightfoot, a Glastonbury monk [...] The <b>clock's</b> <b>case</b> was built in the Elizabethan era, but the face and dial are of a much greater age; the first documents relating to the clock concern repairs carried out in 1409.

Williams’ reply to our paper, “There’s Nothing to Beat a Backward Clock: A Rejoinder to Adams, Barker and Clarke,” {{is a further}} attempt to defend their counterexample against a range of objections. In this paper, we argue that, despite the number and length of footnotes, Williams is still wrong...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, a {{pendulum}} bob is a round flat disk, lens-shaped in section, but bobs in older clocks often have decorative carving and shapes {{characteristic of the}} type of clock. They are usually made of a dense metal such as iron or brass. Lead is denser, but is usually avoided because of its softness, which would result in the bob being dented during its inevitable collisions with the inside of the <b>clock</b> <b>case</b> when the <b>clock</b> is moved.|$|R
50|$|Similarly fine {{results could}} be {{achieved}} for lighting devices, such as chandeliers and candelabra, {{as well as for}} the ornamental metal mounts applied to <b>clock</b> <b>cases</b> and even to ceramic pieces. In the hands of the Parisian marchands-merciers, the precursors of decorators, ormolu or gilt-bronze sculptures could be used for bright, non-oxidizing fireplace accessories or for Rococo or Neoclassical mantel-clocks or wall-mounted clock-cases - a specialty of Charles Cressent (1685-1768) - complemented by rock-crystal drops on gilt-bronze chandeliers and wall-lights.|$|R
5000|$|Spelter, while {{sometimes}} used {{merely as a}} synonym for zinc, {{is often used to}} identify a zinc alloy. In this sense it might be an alloy of equal parts copper and zinc, i.e. a brass, used for hard soldering and brazing, or as an alloy, containing lead, that is used instead of bronze. In this usage it was common for many 19th-century cheap, cast articles such as candlesticks and <b>clock</b> <b>cases</b> and early 20th-century Art Nouveau ornaments and Art Deco figures.|$|R
