Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. More (1805), the Court {{held that}} the {{ordinary}} means of appeal, the writ of error, could not be utilized in criminal cases from the circuit courts.

5|$|Unlike {{the appellate}} {{provision}} of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appellate {{provision of the}} act of February 27, 1801 was not explicitly limited to civil cases (except insofar as it incorporated the former by reference).

In civil cases, although ordinary writs of error were authorized, the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> division remained important [...] because it permitted appeals without regard to the amount in controversy and interlocutory appeals. Inasmuch as the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> division permitted the Supreme Court some measure of control over its docket, it is a precursor to modern certiorari jurisdiction.|$|R
