Similarly, this paper asks: Are digital <b>computation</b> <b>design</b> tools inferior to analog tools? Is information missing from the digital design "signals"? What is analog computation and could new tools be developed that avoid digital compression, and allow designers to more clearly "hear" or experience the act of design?

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{intrinsic}} complexity of black-box Universally Composable (UC) secure computation based on general assumptions. We present a thorough study in various corruption mod-elings while focusing on achieving {{security in the}} common reference string (CRS) model. Our results involve the following: • Static UC secure <b>computation.</b> <b>Designing</b> the first static UC secure oblivious transfer protocol based on public-key encryption and stand-alone semi-honest oblivious transfer. As a corollary we obtain the first black-box constructions of UC secure computation assuming only two-round semi-honest oblivious transfer. • One-sided UC secure <b>computation.</b> <b>Designing</b> adaptive UC secure two-party computation with single corruptions assuming public-key encryption with oblivious ciphertext generation. • Adaptive UC secure <b>computation.</b> <b>Designing</b> adaptively secure UC commitment scheme assum-ing only public-key encryption with oblivious ciphertext generation. As a corollary we obtain the first black-box constructions of adaptive UC secure computation assuming only (trapdoor) simu-latable public-key encryption (as well as a variety of concrete assumptions). We remark that such a result was not known even under non-black-box constructions...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Master’s thesis was to find an {{integration}} {{framework and}} process between Cargotec Tampere’s main <b>design</b> <b>office</b> and locally situated <b>design</b> <b>offices.</b> The problem had been {{that there was no}} defined process to integrate the local small offices with the main global office at Tampere. Without a defined process and tools it is difficult to achieve good efficiency from the start. The thesis was made with qualitative constructive research methods. The three main research processes were literature review, interviews and two case studies inside Cargotec. For the literature review, three research areas were studied: global engineering networks, virtual teams and supplier integration. From those three areas a synthesis was developed, called the combined theoretical model for <b>design</b> <b>office</b> integration. The interviews covered approximately 15 different people. From the interviews the current situation of integration and the requirements for the practical framework were synthesized. The two case studies on Cargotec’s <b>design</b> <b>office</b> in China and a daughter company, MacGregor, are based on interviews with managers, whose job it was to manage and develop offshored <b>design</b> <b>offices.</b> They are presented as individual evidence on the difficulties and lessons learned. When researching and interviewing employees, it became clear that there were many problems with achieving good integration at Cargotec. First, {{there had to be a}} clear sense of what kind of capabilities the new office had. Second, what materials and training should Cargotec give to the new office to match the main office’s capabilities? To improve the situation, an integration framework and three tools were created. The framework and tools are derived from the combined theoretical model. The framework consists of three phases: Survey, Sharing and Verification. The survey phase defines the needs for a new <b>design</b> <b>office,</b> maps and evaluates the capabilities of the prospective <b>design</b> <b>office,</b> and evaluates the offshoring risks. For this, the phase two tools, called current state analysis and risk assessment, were developed. The sharing phase defines and shares all the materials and other resources that the host <b>design</b> <b>office</b> would need to get to the same level with the main <b>design</b> <b>office</b> regarding software, network, skills, material and product knowledge. For this phase, an Excel-tool called the integration package was developed. The last phase, verification, is meant to verify the results of the sharing phase by giving the new <b>design</b> <b>office</b> a pilot task, which tests the new office’s systems, knowledge and communication. The testing of the framework and its tools showed that they were mature enough to be used at Cargotec. /Kir 1...|$|R

A 5 leveled PM Maturity Model is developed to assess architectural <b>design</b> <b>offices.</b> current PM Maturity level. Maturity levels are assessed vis a semi-structured survey. 71 Members of the Association of Turkish Independent Architects (ATIA) participated to semi-structured survey to validate the model. A list of demographical questions was asked to draw the demographical picture of the architectural <b>design</b> <b>offices.</b> Both, maturity levels and demographical data are analyzed. The results of the assessment provide the necessary information for the architects to improve their PM processes and activities. Project Integration Management was highly mature among the other function areas and it. s followed by Project Scope Management. The least matured function area was the Project Risk Management. High correlation values between the number of staff and all PM function areas are also observed.
