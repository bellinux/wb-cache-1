The BEF was redeployed north to the Ypres area and in its wake followed the formations FPOs.

Myers stated that [...] "NatGeo and I have worked out an acceptable compromise.

5000|$|Criticisms {{of social}} media range from {{criticisms of the}} ease of use of {{specific}} platforms and their capabilities, disparity of information available, issues with trustworthiness and reliability of information presented, the impact of social media use on an individual's concentration, ownership of media content, {{and the meaning of}} interactions created by social media. Although some social media platforms offer users the opportunity to <b>cross-post</b> simultaneously, some social network platforms have been criticized for poor interoperability between platforms, which leads to the creation of information silos, viz. isolated pockets of data contained in one social media platform. However, it is also argued that social media have positive effects such as allowing the democratization of the Internet while also allowing individuals to advertise themselves and form friendships. Others have noted that the term [...] "social" [...] cannot account for technological features of a platform alone, hence the level of sociability should be determined by the actual performances of its users. There has been a dramatic decrease in face-to-face interactions as more and more social media platforms have been introduced with the threat of cyber-bullying and online sexual predators being more prevalent. Social media may expose children to images of alcohol, tobacco, and sexual behaviors. In regards to cyber-bullying, it has been proven that individuals who have no experience with cyber-bullying often have a better well-being than individuals who have been bullied online.|$|E
5000|$|MI5Victim (Mike Corley, a.k.a. Boleslaw Tadeusz Szocik) - {{paranoid}} user {{who goes}} through periods of binge posting, claiming that British intelligence has bugged {{his home and}} is sending people to follow him around and harass him. These allegations are often crossposted to newsgroups where his messages would be considered off-topic. This has led to claims that he suffers from paranoia. Since 1995 he has posted transcripts and snippets of conversations that he has recorded, citing it as evidence, sometimes years after the actual event. He has also claimed in his posts that television personalities are often talking about him in code and {{are part of the}} MI5 conspiracy. After applying the cui bono test, many people have found it difficult to understand why Corley should have been targeted by MI5 (given that he has no connections/affiliations which would make him of interest), and cannot see what possible benefit the security services could derive from such harassment, given that they have always had more pressing concerns, e.g. monitoring PIRA in the 1990s and later the threat posed by al-Qaeda. Corley will often <b>cross-post</b> [...] "examples" [...] of MI-5 victimizing him 20 or 30 posts at a time. He has been banned from posting through Google for his abuse of Usenet, and has been similarly bounced from most ISPs in England, an assertion which Corley rebutted in August 2012. In the past, his posts were relatively easy to filter out, due to his similar subject lines and email address. However, at the start of 2008, he began a series of posts that avoided filters through sporgery and by slightly varying his subject line of [...] "MI-5 Persecution", showing an ability to adapt. In 2007, the opera The Corley Conspiracy by Tim Benjamin and Sean Starke premiered at the Southbank Centre in London. Corley has his own web site on which he provides so-called evidence of the conspiracies against him. Corley has written a book about his [...] "experiences" [...] with MI5.|$|E
40|$|National audienceProfessional {{players in}} social media (e. g., big companies, politician, athletes, celebrities, etc) are intensively using Online Social Networks (OSNs) in order to {{interact}} with {{a huge amount of}} regular OSN users with different purposes (marketing campaigns, customer feedback, public reputation improvement, etc). Hence, due to the large catalog of existing OSNs, professional players usually count with OSN accounts in different systems. In this context, an interesting question is whether professional users publish the same information across their OSN accounts, or actually they use different OSNs in a different manner. We define as <b>cross-posting</b> activity the action of publishing the same information in two or more OSNs. This paper aims at characterizing the <b>cross-posting</b> activity of professional users across three major OSNs, Facebook, Twitter and Google+. To this end, we perform a large-scale measurement-based analysis across more than 2 M posts collected from 616 professional users with active accounts in the three referred OSNs. Then we characterize the phenomenon of <b>cross-posting</b> and analyse the behavioural patterns based on the identified characteristics...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose to}} use the {{community}} structure of Usenet for organizing and retrieving the information stored in newsgroups. In particular, we study the network formed by crossposts, messages that are posted to two or more newsgroups simultaneously.

We analyze this network to show that it is a small-world network with significant clustering. We also present a spectral algorithm which clusters newsgroups based on the <b>cross-post</b> matrix. The result of our clustering provides a topical classification of newsgroups. Our clustering gives many examples of significant relationships that would be missed by semantic clustering methods...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Chief {{executives}} (CEOs) {{have turned}} to blogging. This research asks: do CEO blogs attract commenters leading to genuine discussion and community building? Design/methodology/approach – The 30 most popular CEO blogs are analysed, community structure is graphically represented using social network analysis, measuring cohesion using connectedness. A review of content assesses whether richness and type of media affect community building. Findings – By modelling a CEO blog as an affiliation network the structure is exposed. Community cohesiveness is assessed using a measure of connectedness. The connectedness ranking differs from the original Technorati Rank (TR) although the top blog in both is the same. Community building relates more to external reputation, writing style or topicality than {{to the type of}} media used. Practical implications – CEO bloggers must engage commenters to build community. TR and connectedness scores measure different things but both affect community building. CEO blogs with high community scores post regularly, attract many comments and have an active core membership that bind the community. Top scoring CEO blogs build community and stimulate genuine discussion. Mid ranking blogs have little <b>cross-post</b> commenting and a fragmented network. Others attract few comments with low connectedness. “Wilderness” blogs may have no commenters. This suggests inefficient use of valuable CEO time. Because CEO credibility affects CEO blog success, a low-ranking blog depreciates CEO's reputation indicating little social capital. Originality/value – There is little research into CEO blogging, this research contributes to the understanding of CEO blogging and community building...|$|E
