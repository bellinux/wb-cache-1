5|$|Meanwhile, at TGS, {{it is time}} {{to renew}} Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) contract, and Jack decides to {{approach}} the matter <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> Tracy does not need the money he makes on the show. While negotiating Tracy's new contract, Jack mentions this fact, which comes as a shock to Tracy, who had never realized that he could survive financially without the income. After realizing that Tracy has quit the show, Jack {{must find a way to}} bring him back, after Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), complains to Jack about how unbearable his father is to have around the house. Meanwhile, in order to get attention for herself, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) decides to cut her hair for charity as a publicity stunt. Jenna makes an appearance on NBC's Today Show, where her haircut will be broadcast. Meredith Vieira asks Jenna's opinion on the news that Tracy has left TGS. At learning this, Jenna bails out on her haircut.|$|E

25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale as <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> possible. If there is no free flow valve, as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E
25|$|Berdan primers, {{with their}} off-center flash holes {{and lack of}} {{self-contained}} anvil, {{are more difficult to}} work with than the easily removed Boxer primers. The primers may be punctured and pried out from the rear, or extracted with hydraulic pressure. Primers must be selected <b>carefully,</b> <b>as</b> there are more sizes of Berdan primers than the standard large and small pistol, large and small rifle of Boxer primers. The case must also be inspected carefully to make sure the anvil has not been damaged, because this could result in a failure to fire.|$|E
25|$|Soon, all the {{opposition}} leaders {{called for the}} overthrow of Bhutto's regime. Political and civil disorder intensified, which led to more unrest. On 21 April 1977, Bhutto imposed martial law in the major cities of Karachi, Lahore and Hyderabad. However, a compromise agreement between Bhutto and opposition was ultimately reported. Zia planned the Coup d'état <b>carefully,</b> <b>as</b> he knew Bhutto had integral intelligence in the Pakistan Armed Forces, and many officers, including Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal Zulfiqar Ali Khan and Major-General Tajammul Hussain Malik, GOC of 23rd Mountain Division, Major-General Naseerullah Babar, DG of Directorate-General for the Military Intelligence (DGMI) and Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, were loyal to Bhutto.|$|E

25|$|Orthodox Christians {{who have}} {{committed}} sins but repent of them, and who wish to reconcile themselves to God and renew the purity of their original baptisms, confess their sins to God before a spiritual guide who offers advice and direction to assist the individual in overcoming their sin. Parish priests commonly function as spiritual guides, but such guides can be any person, male or female, who {{has been given a}} blessing to hear confessions. Spiritual guides are chosen very <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> this is a mandate that once chosen must be obeyed. Having confessed, the penitent then has his or her parish priest read the prayer of repentance over them.|$|E

In the next few days, {{some or all of the}} cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories, which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique that they are using to prolong this useless war. Unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's well-known humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives.|$|E
25|$|Further, the {{distinction}} between a legal system which utilizes judges as triers of both law and fact, {{as opposed to a}} system which incorporates jury trials, has been termed artificial. In a jurisdiction such as the United Kingdom, the same test applies to both jury and non-jury cases. Arguably in a non-jury legal system, there is more public interest in ensuring that judges remain accountable to the people. Hence, there should be greater freedom to discuss the manner in which judges carry out their functions. Finally, {{it has been said that}} the preference for the inherent tendency test because it allows the court to take action before the administration of justice is affected should be evaluated <b>carefully,</b> <b>as</b> it may have an undue chilling effect on speech.|$|E

25|$|The use of raptors in {{the hunting}} of wolves is {{primarily}} practised in Central Asia. The Kyrgyz people have traditionally used golden eagles, known as berkut, to hunt wolves. In the past, wolf pelts provided material for clothes {{crucial for the}} survival of the nomadic people in the severe colds. The eagles are used to immobilize the wolves by placing one foot {{at the back of the}} neck and another at the flank closer to the heart and lungs. Hunters usually only use eagles against pups, as an adult wolf can cripple in combat even a highly experienced eagle. Losing even one toe or talon will significantly lower the eagle's ability to tackle prey. Only a minor injury to the sinew of a foot may leave the eagle incapable of further hunting. As a wolf is capable of resisting even the best-trained bird, the falconer always keeps near, ready at the first opportunity to help the eagle. This is done <b>carefully,</b> <b>as</b> the wolf, sensing human presence, fights desperately to tear loose from the bird's talons, and the eagle can be severely injured. Because of the violent nature of their work, eagles trained to hunt wolves have shorter life spans.|$|E

500|$|From August 6, 1995, to September 2, 1995, Nintendo, in {{collaboration}} with the St.GIGA satellite radio network, began broadcasts of a substantially different version of the original The Hyrule Fantasy: Legend of Zelda for a Super Famicom peripheral, the Satellaview—a satellite modem add-on. The game, titled , was released for download in four episodic, weekly installments which were rebroadcast at least four times between the game's 1995 premier and January 1997. BS Zelda was the first Satellaview game to feature a [...] "SoundLink" [...] soundtrack—a streaming audio track through which, every few minutes, players were cautioned to listen <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> a voice actor narrator, broadcasting live from the St.GIGA studio, would give them plot and gameplay clues. In addition to the SoundLink elements, BS Zelda also featured updated 16-bit graphics, a smaller overworld, and different dungeons. Link was replaced by one of the two Satellaview avatars: a boy wearing a backward baseball cap or a girl with red hair.|$|E

500|$|Curtis {{stated that}} casting an actor to play Van Gogh was done <b>carefully,</b> <b>as</b> he {{wanted him to}} feel to the {{audience}} as Van Gogh, not [...] "like a bloke they’ve seen acting lots of other parts, in an orange wig". Tony Curran was ultimately cast as the part; Curtis called him a [...] "wonderful actor" [...] who [...] "really could not look more like" [...] Van Gogh. Curran, Smith and Gillan {{got to know each}} other very well, which Gillan hoped would be evident in their chemistry in the episode. Bill Nighy appears uncredited as the Musée d'Orsay's expert on Van Gogh. Nighy was rumoured to have been considered for the role of the Ninth Doctor when the show was revived. Campbell stated that they were [...] "very fortunate" [...] to have Nighy in the role, who he believed was someone people paid attention to, and the audience needed to pay attention to his character as he said facts which would become important later in the story.|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said it was [...] "an amazing episode, in which Homer {{actually}} has an argument with someone, rather than backing down. As he and his father drift further apart, so the family are at a loss at what to do. You can't help but feel sorry for Grampa as a piece of Simpson family history goes up in flames". Nate Meyers for Digitally Obsessed praised Dan Castellaneta's role in the episode and said: [...] "Dan Castellaneta's work as both Homer and Grampa Simpson in [...] is full of emotion and brilliant comic timing. Watch the closing scene <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> Homer returns to his childhood home, because Castellaneta gracefully dances between a tender father-son relationship and flat-out comedy". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said he [...] "didn’t remember this as a very good episode, but it actually turns out to be quite strong. The initial plot in which Homer and Marge can’t get it together offers plenty of funny moments, and the scenes in which Homer battles with his dad offer depth and much humor. It’s also hard to beat the children's fears of the reverse vampires".|$|E
500|$|Washington would {{normally}} have assigned {{the duties of}} advance guard to Daniel Morgan and his riflemen, but he had detached these to assist Horatio Gates {{in the defense of}} the Hudson River Valley against the advance of General John Burgoyne. [...] Since they were unavailable, he organized a light infantry corps consisting of 700 picked men from Continental Army regiments (including future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, who would go on to fight in the coming battle) and about 1,000 Pennsylvania and Delaware militia, and placed them under the command of Brigadier General William Maxwell. [...] These troops occupied Iron Hill and Cooch's Bridge. General Nathanael Greene advocated moving the entire Continental Army to this position, believing the Christina River to be a more defensible point, but Washington declined, instead ordering [...] Maxwell to monitor British movements and slow its advance {{while the rest of the}} army fortified the Red Clay Creek and Wilmington. [...] Maxwell's men were encamped on either side of the road leading south from Cooch's Bridge toward Aiken's Tavern (present-day Glasgow, Delaware) in a series of small camps designed to facilitate ambushes. [...] On August 28, Washington, atop Iron Hill, and Howe, on Gray's Hill, observed each other as they took stock of the enemy's position; one of the Hessian generals wrote, [...] "These gentlemen observed us with their glasses as <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> we observed them. [...] Those of our officers who know Washington well, maintained that the man in the plain coat was Washington." ...|$|E

He explained that the items were picked out <b>carefully,</b> <b>as</b> they were things he [...] "carr around every day". In the liner notes, Fiasco parodies drug dealing by replacing liquor with milk and cookies, and drive-by shootings by replacing guns with books.|$|E
2500|$|B. Barry Levy {{notes that}} the 16th century Rabbi Ibn Zimra recounted [...] "how he {{restored}} the scrolls to their original state" [...] and noted [...] "the importance of having textual consistency in the scrolls, because criticisms of how Jews preserved and transmitted the Torah text contained accusations that they willfully changed it." [...] Levy also suggests that [...] "Torah scrolls remain prized and frequently used ritual objects, and scribes have continually worked as <b>carefully</b> <b>as</b> possible to copy them, always holding dear the belief that they were producing as accurate and correct a text as they could. Unfortunately even this commitment and care could not guarantee a letter-perfect text".|$|E
