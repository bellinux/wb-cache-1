25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the cold-box process uses a binder that is {{hardened}} {{through the use}} of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. amine gas) or odorous (i.e. SO2), so special handling systems must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again. For example, a cold-box sand casting <b>core</b> <b>binder</b> is sodium silicate which hardens on exposure to carbon dioxide.|$|E

40|$|Background: Some {{foundries}} use the Hot Box method, {{which involves}} {{use of a}} nitrogen-containing binder system to produce cores for hollow castings. During the process, low molecular weight isocyanates such as isocyanic acid (ICA) and methyl isocyanate (MIC) are formed, which are potentially toxic. However, data regarding exposure to these agents, and their health effects, were sparse. Aims: The objectives of the studies were to characterise levels of exposure to low molecular weight isocyanates in Swedish foundries using Hot Box <b>core</b> <b>binders,</b> and their potential health effects, especially on {{the upper and lower}} airways. The specific questions addressed were as follows. What are the exposure levels to ICA and MIC in foundries using Hot Box <b>core</b> <b>binders,</b> and what symptoms are reported by the workers? Are there any signs of acute or residual effects on lung function? Have symptoms and lung function changed over time, and are there any associations between exposure and health parameters? Material and methods: The four Swedish foundries using Hot Box <b>core</b> <b>binders</b> were invited to participate in four studies. In Study I, individual exposure to ICA, MIC and formaldehyde in 64 foundry workers was assessed. In a parallel study (II), the respiratory symptoms and lung function of the same workers and 134 local referents were evaluated. Four years later, 43 exposed workers and 69 referents participated in a nasal examination. Their exposure to previously described agents complemented with total dust was measured (Study III). Study IV was a four-year follow-up of 70 subjects (25 exposed workers and 55 referents) assessed in Study II, aiming to relate changes in exposure to the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and lung function following improvements to the work environment. Results: Exposure levels of ICA (GM (geometric mean) 27 μg/m³), MIC (GM 5. 3 μg/m³) and formaldehyde (GM 120 μg/m³) at baseline were 50 % lower at follow-up. There was a high prevalence of ocular and respiratory symptoms at baseline and nasal symptoms had increased among the exposed workers at follow-up. However, lower airway symptoms were less frequently reported at follow-up. Dry nasal mucosa was observed among exposed workers. FEV 1 (the forced expiratory volume in 1 second) levels pre-shift were slightly reduced in the exposed group both at baseline and followup, but the small decrease in lung function over shift in the exposed group at baseline, was not observed at follow-up. However, the effects seemed to be small and not relevant on an individual level. Dose-response relationships were observed between the measured levels of ICA, MIC and formaldehyde and the nasal symptoms, but the nasal signs were only weakly associated with exposure estimates. Lung function findings were not significantly related to current exposure to ICA, MIC or formaldehyde. Conclusions: The nasal mucosa is a highly sensitive indicator of potentially harmful exposure to air pollution and the high prevalence of nasal symptoms and dry mucosa suggested a link with ICA, MIC and other airway irritants, such as formaldehyde and dust. This may indicate a persistent influence of the working environment, although exposure levels have fallen. The absence of lung function effects over shift and the decline in lower airway symptoms in the exposed group at follow-up indicate positive effects of the remedial measures undertaken since baseline. However, the slightly reduced FEV 1 levels pre-shift in the exposed group at follow-up suggests there may be a residual effect of previous exposure, which would be interesting to address in further studies. The nasal findings indicate that further improvement of the working environment in these foundries is required...|$|R

Rubber seeds were originally considered as a waste product but now they are used to feed livestock (Abdullah and Salimon 2009). Rubber seed contains a relatively higher oil content of 40 – 50  % (Junaid et al. 2014) and the rubber seed oil (RSO) was found to have properties similar to soya bean oil and linseed oil which are widely used in industrial applications. Therefore, RSO has now become an important raw material for many industries; as semidrying oil in the paint industry (Joseph et al. 2004), in soap manufacturing (Ohikhena 2006), as anti-malaria oil in medicines (Thomas et al. 1998) and as a <b>core</b> <b>binder</b> for factice preparation in engineering (Fernando 1971).|$|E

Waterglass-bound sands with small additions of bentonite showed good results, because residual compressive strength was significantly reduced compared to sands without additional to bentonite. Drying by microwave was more effective than hardening by CO_ 2. Reclaimed waterglass-bound sand could be used completely in the same system (monosystem) without problems. Some types of reclaimed sand systems with organic binders could only be used in the waterglass process, if they were dried by microwaves.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{introduces a}} new era for the fabrication of 3 D structures. AM, as an emerging and disruptive manufacturing technology, {{has the potential to}} be employed for fabrication of polymeric, metallic, and ceramic structures. Although AM is now being used for commercial applications, there are still many challenges in incorporating high-performance materials into these techniques and employing them to fabricate practical devices. For instance, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has interesting properties such as high specific surface area and lattice defects with tunable functional groups which make it ideal for different applications. However, there is still a substantial need to introduce reliable manufacturing techniques for RGO-based devices while attaining the utmost performance of graphene-based materials. In this study, a binder-jetting powder-bed AM technique has been employed to fabricate graphene-based structures and devices for energy storage and sensing applications. First, 3 D structures of graphene/hydroxyapatite (Hap) based composite with potential applications in bone-implantation were fabricated using AM technique. Hap suffers from lack of sufficient mechanical strength which has limited its application for practical use. The compressive strength of the 3 D printed structures were tested and the printing parameters were optimized to improve the mechanical behavior of the specimens. It was shown that at a layer thickness of 125 μm and <b>core</b> <b>binder</b> saturation level of 400 %, the mechanical strength of HG 4 structures with only 0. 4 wt. % of graphene oxide were 70 times more than that of HG 0 structures. Our next goal was to print pure graphene-based structures for energy and sensing applications. Hence, graphene oxide was first synthesized through Hummer’s method and then reduced it through thermal and chemical methods to compare their performance for energy applications. The as-obtained thermally and chemically reduced graphene-oxide based powder were both 3 D printed and studied accordingly. It was revealed that the gravimetric capacitance of thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) 3 D printed electrodes were 3 - 4 times higher than that of chemically reduced powder. Therefore, TRGO powder was selected for further studies and optimization. In order to improve the performance of 3 D printed TRGO based electrodes, a nano palladium dispersion was synthesized and injected into the electrodes after printing. TRGO based decorated with nano palladium particles showed an impressive capacitance of 265 F/g and 700 mF/cm 2 at 5 mV/s. This study can introduce a new potential application of AM for the fabrication of graphene-based supercapacitor devices. In addition, a graphene-based humidity sensing devices was also fabricated using powder-bed AM technique. The results obtained from this device were promising and demonstrated a great potential for the use of AM for manufacturing of graphene-based sensor devices...|$|E

40|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) is in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} the recently introduced AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) for new pavement sections. However, the vast majority of pavement work conducted by ODOT involves rehabilitation of existing pavements. Hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlays are the preferred rehabilitation treatment for both flexible and rigid pavements in Oregon. However, like new work sections, HMA overlays are also susceptible to fatigue cracking (alligator cracking and longitudinal cracking), rutting, and thermal cracking. Additional work was therefore needed to calibrate the design process for rehabilitation of existing pavement structures. 38 pavement sections throughout Oregon were included in this calibration study. A detailed comparison of predictive and measured distresses was made using the MEPDG released software Darwin M-E (Version 1. 1). It was found that Darwin M-E predictive distresses did not accurately reflect measured distresses, calling for a local calibration of performance prediction models was warranted. Four distress prediction models (rutting, alligator cracking, longitudinal cracking, and thermal cracking) of the HMA overlays were calibrated for Oregon conditions. A comparison was made between the results before and after the calibration to assess the improvement in accuracy of the distress prediction models provided by the local calibration. While the thermal cracking model could not be calibrated, the locally calibrated models of rutting, alligator cracking, and longitudinal cracking provided better predictions with lower bias and standard error than the nationally (default) calibrated models. However, there was a high degree of variability between the predicted and measured distresses, especially for longitudinal cracking, even after the calibration. It is believed that there is a significant lack-of-fit modeling error for the occurrence of thermal cracks. The Darwin M-E calibrated models of rutting and alligator cracking can be implemented, however, it is recommended that additional sites, which would contain more detailed inputs (mostly Level 1), be established and be included in the future calibration efforts and thus, further improve the accuracy of the prediction models. Recently, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has identified hot mix asphalt concrete (HMAC) pavements that have displayed top-down cracking within three years of construction. The objective of the study was to evaluate the top-down cracked pavement sections and compare the results with the non-cracked pavement sections. Research involved evaluating six surface cracked pavements and four non-cracked pavement sections. The research included extensive field and laboratory investigations of the 10 pavement sections by conducting distress surveys, falling weight deflectometer (FWD) testing, dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) testing, and coring from the cracked and non-cracked pavement sections. Cores were then subjected to a full laboratory-testing program to evaluate the HMAC mixtures and binder rheology. The laboratory investigation included dynamic modulus, indirect tensile (IDT) strength, and specific gravity testing on the HMAC <b>cores,</b> <b>binder</b> rheological tests on asphalt binder and aggregate gradation analysis. The FWD and DCP tests indicated that top-down cracked pavement sections were structurally sound, even some of the sections with top-down cracking showed better structural capacity compared to non-cracked sections. The study also found that top-down cracking initiation and propagation were independent of pavement cross-section or the HMAC thickness. The dynamic modulus testing indicated that cores from all the top-down cracked pavement sections except one section (OR 140) possessed stiffer mixtures than that of non-cracked pavement sections. All four non-cracked pavement areas were found to be exhibiting fairly high IDT strength, and low variability in IDT strength and HMAC density when compared to top-down cracked sections as indicated by the IDT strength tests and air void analysis. Asphalt binder rheological test result indicated that asphalt binders from all the top-down cracked sections except OR 140 showed higher complex shear modulus (stiffer binder) compared to non-cracked pavement sections. The study concluded that top-down cracking could be caused by a number of contributors such as stiffer HMAC mixtures, mixture segregation, binder aging, low HMAC tensile strength, and high variability in tensile strength or by combination of any...|$|R
40|$|A {{sandwich}} structure consisting of perlite composite foam as core and Brown paper as skin is developed and its flexural behaviour is studied in relation with properties of constituents and manufacturing variables of perlite composite foam core consolidated with sodium silicate binder by compaction. Tensile properties of Brown paper coated with binder {{were affected by}} sodium silicate content in diluted binder. The best performance of the Brown paper was found for strength and energy absorption when coated with undiluted binder. The {{sandwich structure}} was fabricated with the best performed Brown paper and perlite composite foam <b>cores</b> with various <b>binder</b> contents and compaction ratios. The performance of the sandwich structure for core shear strength, skin normal strength, and stiffness was similarly affected by manufacturing variables to those of perlite foam core. Load carrying capacity of perlite foam core reinforced with Brown paper for the sandwich structure was increased about 3 – 7 times the unreinforced one depending on how binder and compaction ratio are combined for manufacturing perlite foam core. The flexural failure of perlite composite foam core was initiated from the tension side of the flexural specimen. However, when the foam core was sandwiched with the Brown paper, the failure initiation site was shifted to the mid-plane of flexural specimen...|$|R
40|$|This thesis describes, in a {{manufacturing}} context, {{the development of}} new waterbased core technology for light alloys. Cores used for steel casting are made from fused silica and are removed using hot sodium hydroxide under refluxing (pressurising hot acids). However, aluminium and other light alloys are attacked by sodium hydroxide. Currently there is no good core system for aluminium and other light alloys. It is therefore desirable to find an alternative material/leaching agent combination for casting aluminium and other light alloys. The recent research review has shown that ceramic cores are mostly made by fused silica with different additives. The previous research has suggested using fused silica (different mesh size) as filling material and using magnesium oxide to control the slurry working life of core mixes. Calcium silicate assists core leaching in dilute acid. The plaster (calcium sulphate) in the form of proprietary plasters (Crystcal R, Fine Casting Plaster) is used to create bond and gives strength to the core. Lithium carbonate acts has an accelerator, improving the strengthening effect of the plaster in the <b>cores.</b> The <b>binder</b> (Ludox® AM) and water act (as added materials) to bind the composition Core compositions were made with different core trials to produce a core, which records suitable strength and quick leaching properties for light alloys. Core trials were individually mixed and poured into a wooden core box. Cores were pre-dried for twenty-four hours. Cores were fired to different temperatures for two hours, followed by two hours cooling. The cores were subjected to computerised three-point bend test to record the Modulus of rupture (MOR). The plain strain fracture toughness and Weibull parameters were calculated. The Weibull parameter was plotted using Minitab analysis software. Using the cores, gravity die casting process were carried out. The subsequent castings was dipped in diluted nitric, citric and acetic acid to leach out the core. Using different core compositions, core trials were mixed, poured, dried, tested and leached. The high amount of plaster in core trials records high MOR when cores were fired between 200 °- 400 ° C and the opposite result when fired between 600 °- 800 ° C. The different grade of plasters(CRP,FCP) do not influence the strength. One percent of magnesium oxide gives a very short working life. High amount of binder(Ludox® AM) in core produce strong cores. Workable MOR results can be obtained depending on composition allowing manual handling or a waxing process. The fracture toughness is typical of a brittle material, with matching Weibull parameters. The casting process suggests that the new materials are sufficiently refractory. The cores are leached out using diluted nitric, acetic and citric acid at rates compatible with commercial manufacture. This methodology has successfully produced a core using fused silica with plaster and magnesium oxide for aluminium and possibly for light alloys. Different core trials can be used depending on the specific industrial application relating to strength and removal with acid attacking the metal. Further work is needed to fine tune optimum leaching conditions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
