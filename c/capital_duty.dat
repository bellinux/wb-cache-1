40|$|Share {{premiums}} now {{constitute a}} substantial proportion of UK company equity but rarely featured on nineteenth century company balance sheets. This paper discusses when and why this changed {{and why the}} definition of the share premium account as company capital took nearly a century to reach the statute books. From 1855 to 1948 any surplus above par on issued shares could be treated at the directors' discretion, including appropriation for the payment of dividends. This freedom was removed in the Companies Act 1948 (s. 56), after the Cohen Committee recommended that share premiums should normally be treated as share capital and employed in a very limited range of transactions. The paper outlines the accounting and legal history of the share premium account and argues that the growth of share premiums was due to a tax avoidance loophole, open from 1889 to 1973, which permanently changed company practice on share issues after 1920. The effect of legal restrictions {{on the use of the}} share premium account is also addressed. One possible future consequence of the loss of economic significance of the nominal value of a share is the total abolition of both this and the share premium account by adoption of no par value (npv) shares, a change which has recently been adopted in Australia and is again under consideration in the UK.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the Human Resource community's ability to effectively manage its human <b>capital</b> (active <b>duty</b> officers) and to establish this as the foundation for value creation. In today's market, be it on Wall Street, Main Street or Army Navy Blvd., value creation is dominated by human capital and other intangible assets. Ironically, these most important assets are the least understood, least prone to measurement, and hardest to manage. Thus, an analysis for improvement using a systems control theory model provided an important step forward in the Navy's inability to better manage its human capital. An assessment was conducted through interviews of community managers, SME and participants, and a review of previous manpower studies. This research revealed critical control points whereby the HR community manager (OCM) could leverage considerable change within the system to gain the desired effects of the human resource succession-management plan. These control points were found through analysis of inputs, processes, and outputs pertaining to an HR officer's promotion, assignment, and education. This analysis showed the HR community manager could influence human resource career progressions through the education process. The management of Education Skill Requirements, and interaction with Naval Postgraduate School faculty, will ensure alignment and acquisition of knowledge, skills, and abilities.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Estate duty in South Africa is levied {{in terms}} of the Estate Duty Act since 1955. Estate duty is {{currently}} calculated at a flat rate of 20 % on the amount of which the net worth of an estate exceeds a primary rebate of R 3, 5 million. Statistics show that {{only a small percentage of}} estates in South Africa is taxable. Furthermore, many estate owners – particularly those whose estates are liable for estate duty – have the financial means to afford estate planning services to reduce estate duty. This reality has the effect that estate duty is paid by a very insignificant number of estates. Similar to estate <b>duty,</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax has the tax incentive of constituting vertical equity – creating the outcome that taxpayers with greater capability to pay taxes should be taxed more severely. Capital gains tax is also a tax payable (among other instances) at the death of an estate owner. This gives rise to double taxation. Further matters that need to be considered are constitutional justification of estate duty and the question whether the categories of current taxable estates correlate with the taxable estates envisaged by the legislator in 1955. In amending fiscal policy, it is useful to consider international trends. In countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada estate duty has been abolished. This phenomenon demonstrates that estate duty is not an essential element of a tax system. The aim of this study is to investigate the contribution of the abolishment of estate duty to South African tax law. Master...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to provide a roadmap and cost {{justification}} for Georgia Tech to create an Energy Management System (EnMS) and become certified for the ISO 50001 (2011) Energy Management Standard. The Standard provides guidance for organizations to integrate energy efficiency into their management practices, which would enable the Institute to establish the systems and processes necessary to continuously improve energy performance, thus increasing efficiency and reducing costs in a transparent and sustainable fashion. The paper is broken down into four main chapters: Chapter 1 includes an introduction that provides a background analysis and explains the ISO 50001 standard. Chapter 2 is primarily focused on case studies and has a brief list of organizations that have adopted the standard with their experiences and results. Many organizations that have implemented the standard have seen energy performance improvements of 15 - 20 %. Chapter 3 provides a road map that has step by step suggestions and recommendations for the Georgia Tech community to move forward with the process of implementing the standard. Chapter 4 includes a cost-benefit analysis for ISO implementation. The costs and benefits to the Institute from increased personnel time devoted to ISO administrative <b>duties,</b> <b>capital</b> expenditures for energy efficiency projects, and annual energy cost savings are estimated from 2013 to 2020. The net present values of costs and benefits are calculated for three different social discount rates, and benefit-cost ratios are presented to aid in the decision making process. The benefit-cost ratio for ISO 50001 implementation is over 2. 7 for all discount rates, which means the present value of the benefits outweighs that of the costs. William Drummon...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} general tax {{provisions}} and investment incentives in the Philippines to six other east-Asian economies-Malaysia, Indonesia, Lao, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. We calculate effective tax rates {{and find that}} general effective tax rates are relatively high in the Philippines, while investment incentives are comparable to those in neighboring countries. Tax holidays are most attractive for very profitable firms, creating redundancy, and for investment in short-lived assets. We also consider recently-proposed tax reforms that would replace tax holidays by a reduced corporate income tax rate or a low tax on gross receipts. The results suggest that this would result in stronger incentives to invest, while government revenue increases. Alternatively, replacing holidays with a general reduction in the corporate tax rate and offering accelerated depreciation will either not provide the same incentives or be very costly.

40|$|In 1994 {{the federal}} budget stimulated the {{cyclical}} upturn. The main factors shaping the budget proposal for 1995 are the accession to the EU, which increases the net deficit by some Sch 27. 5 billion, and the austerity package, which reduces the shortfall by about Sch 17 to 18 billion. The budget of 1994 was shaped primarily by changes introduced in {{the second stage of}} the tax reform. The elimination of the tax on industry and trade, the property tax, the <b>capital</b> death <b>duty,</b> the special tax on banks, as well as the increase in the general income tax credit from Sch 5, 000 to 8, 840 per year reduced the gross tax revenue ratio (in relation to GDP) from 24. 2 percent in 1993 to 23. 4 percent in 1994; this corresponds to a drop in revenues of close to Sch 19 billion. (The elimination of the tax on industry and trade was compensated by the rise in the general municipal charge on wages from 2 percent to 3 percent and the widening of the tax base. Thus, the municipalities did not experience a revenue loss.) To these effects must be added the stimulating effects of the increase in the business investment allowance (from 20 percent to 30 percent) for the period from February 1, 1993 to March 31, 1994. The revenue loss due to this measure will be felt in the budget only after some time. As far as the budget proposal for 1995 is concerned, Austria's accession to the EU is producing additional expenditures (payments to agriculture) and reduced revenues (payments to the EU budget and lower revenues from the value added tax), increasing the net deficit by Sch 27. 5 billion. Only a small part of this increase, however, will affect domestic demand, because the drop in the value added tax revenues has only liquidity effects and the payments to the EU budget are equivalent to transfer payments to foreign countries. The austerity package will cut expenditures in 1995 by more than Sch 10 billion, or about 1. 5 percent of GDP. Moreover, the increase in revenues from the hike in the mineral oil tax and in the pension contributions by civil servants totals about Sch 6 billion. In sum, the austerity budget proposed by the federal government will relieve the budget by some Sch 16 to 17 billion (0. 7 percent of GDP). Government expenditures on wages and salaries (including those of teachers employed by the provinces) will rise by 3. 6 percent in 1995; this rate is below the rate expected for the whole economy. If the increase in pension contributions is taken into account, civil servants cannot count on a rise in real income. The austerity package not only dampens the growth in wages and salaries, but also the growth in investment outlays and in expenditures on goods. The consolidation drive will have a particularly strong impact on transfer payments; family allowances are being reduced by Sch 100 per child and month, so that expenditures on this item are expected to fall by 9. 4 percent to Sch 37. 1 billion. The cyclical upswing as well as consolidation measures will reduce growth in expenditures on unemployment insurance to 1. 6 percent. Interest payments (excluding swap interest payments which are offset by corresponding revenues) are expected to rise by 11. 6 percent to Sch 84. 9 billion; this upward trend impedes fiscal consolidation. Moreover, it turns out that payments to other public law entities are on the rise. This phenomenon points to a widening gap between production and financing, a factor also rendering the consolidation of the budget more difficult. A better coordination of fiscal policy between the various public law entities, especially the territorial authorities, will be an important precondition for fulfilling those Maastricht criteria which relate to the fiscal position of the whole public sector.

60|$|Their quarrels are {{a matter}} of history, and concern me {{personally}} only so far as this, that our burgesses being convened for the 1st of March in the year after my arrival in Virginia, {{it was agreed that}} we should all pay a visit to our <b>capital,</b> and our <b>duty</b> to the Governor. Since Harry's unfortunate marriage Madam Esmond had not performed this duty, though always previously accustomed to pay it; but now that her eldest son was arrived in the colony, my mother opined that we must certainly wait upon his Excellency the Governor, nor were we sorry, perhaps, to get away from our little Richmond to enjoy the gaieties of the provincial capital. Madam engaged, and at a great price, the best house to be had at Richmond for herself and her family. Now I was rich, her generosity was curious. I had more than once to interpose (her old servants likewise wondering at her new way of life), and beg her not to be so lavish. But she gently said, in former days she had occasion to save, which now existed no more. Harry had enough, sure, with such a wife as he had taken out of the housekeeper's room. If she chose to be a little extravagant now, why should she hesitate? She had not her dearest daughter and grandchildren with her every day (she fell in love with all three of them, and spoiled them as much as they were capable of being spoiled). Besides, in former days I could not accuse her of too much extravagance, and this I think was almost the only allusion she made to the pecuniary differences between us. So she had her people dressed in their best, and her best wines, plate, and furniture from Castlewood by sea at no small charge, and her dress in which she had been married in George II.'s reign, and we all flattered ourselves that our coach made the greatest figure of any except his Excellency's, and we engaged Signor Formicalo, his Excellency's major-domo, to superintend the series of feasts that were given in my honour; and more fleshpots were set a-stewing in our kitchens in one month, our servants said, than had been known in the family since the young gentlemen went away. So great was Theo's influence over my mother, that she actually persuaded her, that year, to receive our sister Fanny, Hal's wife, who would have stayed upon the plantation rather than face Madam Esmond. But, trusting to Theo's promise of amnesty, Fanny (to whose house we had paid more than one visit) came up to town, and made her curtsey to Madam Esmond, and was forgiven. And rather than be forgiven in that way, I own, for my part, that I would prefer perdition or utter persecution.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} tax {{factors in}} 21 developing {{countries that have}} an impact on foreign direct investment flows. It categorizes those factors into issues associated with tax coordination; tax rates and rate structures; and composition of the tax base. Recent actions by countries reveal no clear pattern in their attempts to increase tax coordination, while many have reduced corporate tax rates and stream-lined tax incentives. However, broad-based tax reform is lacking in most, leaving room for further possibilities in tax reform for attracting foreign investment. The paper also addresses nontax factors that can be instrumental in attracting foreign investment.
