The HS also featured a full front air dam, black and tartan interior trim and additional instrumentation. Other {{versions of the}} HS included the HS-X (with black exterior paint and walnut trimmed interior) and the Panther Westwinds (with single-cam turbo), {{both of which were}} made in very small numbers.|$|E
500|$|Three racing Tigers were {{constructed}} for the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans, a prototype and two that were {{entered in the}} race.

2500|$|The G Convertible came {{equipped}} with a standard [...] 3.7-liter V6, backed by a choice of a 7-speed automatic transmission with available magnesium paddle shifters or a responsive <b>close-ratio</b> 6-speed manual transmission. The G Convertible has a curb weight of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Engine offerings {{were mostly}} {{unchanged}} from 1963 {{except that the}} standard [...] 389 four-barrel V8 gained three , with the extra-cost Hydra-matic transmission. The standard three-speed manual and optional Hydra-matic transmissions were unchanged from 1963, however, a new GM-built Muncie four-speed available in either a wide-ratio M-20 or <b>close-ratio</b> M-21 options replaced the Borg-Warner T-10.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{inline-four}} {{engine was}} only {{offered in the}} base Chevy II 100 series models.

This engine with the <b>close-ratio</b> four-speed manual transmission turned the normally mild Nova into a proper muscle car; The Powerglide automatic was not available with the 350hp engine.|$|E
2500|$|Car Life {{tested a}} 1965 GTO with Tri-Power {{and what they}} {{considered}} the most desirable options (<b>close-ratio</b> four-speed manual transmission, power steering, metallic brakes, rally wheels, 4.11 limited-slip differential, and [...] "Rally" [...] gauge cluster), with a total sticker price of US$3,643.79. With two testers and equipment aboard, they recorded 0–60miles per hour (0–97km/h) in 5.8seconds, the standing quarter mile in 14.5seconds with a trap speed of 100miles per hour (160km/h), and an observed top speed of 114miles per hour (182.4km/h) at the engine's 6,000rpm redline. A four-barrel Motor Trend test car, a heavier convertible handicapped by the two-speed automatic transmission {{and the lack of}} a limited slip differential, ran 0–60mph in 7seconds and through the quarter mile in 16.1 seconds at 89miles per hour (142.4km/h).|$|E
2500|$|The Nova Super Sport was {{transformed}} from a trim option to a performance package for 1968. [...] One of the smallest muscle cars ever fielded by Detroit, the Nova SS now included a [...] V8 engine along with a heavy-duty suspension and other performance hardware, priced at US$312. Optional engines included {{two versions of the}} big-block [...] V8 rated at [...] and , which went for US$348. Both engines were offered with a choice of transmissions including the M-21 <b>close-ratio</b> four-speed manual, the heavy-duty M-22 [...] "Rock Crusher" [...] four-speed manual, or the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. A total of 5,571 SS coupes were produced for 1968. Novas sported the SS badge until 1976. [...] Front disc brakes were optional on the 1968 Nova SS.|$|E
2500|$|The chassis {{was carried}} {{over from the}} second {{generation}} models, retaining the fully independent suspension (with minor revisions) and the four-wheel disc brake system. The engine line-up and horsepower ratings were also carried over {{from the previous year}} as were the 3 and 4-speed manual transmissions. The new optional Turbo Hydramatic 3-speed automatic transmission (RPO M40) replaced the two-speed Powerglide. The L30, a [...] small-block [...] V8 engine rated at [...] and a 3-speed manual transmission were standard, but only a few hundred 3-speed manual equipped cars were sold. The 4-speed manual was available in M20 wide-ratio or M21 <b>close-ratio</b> transmission versions. The M22 “Rock Crusher”, a heavy duty, <b>close-ratio</b> 4-speed gearbox, was also available for certain applications. The engine line-up included the L79, a [...] high performance version of the [...] small-block. Also available were several variants of the [...] big-block V8, that taken together made up nearly half the cars. There was the L36, a [...] version with a Rochester 4-barrel carburetor; The L68, a [...] motor with a Holley triple 2-barrel carb set up (3 X 2 tri-power); The L71, generating [...] with a tri-power; The L89 option was the L71 engine but with much lighter aluminum cylinder heads rather than the standard cast iron. Then there was the L88 engine that Chevrolet designed strictly for off-road use (racing), with a published rating of , but featured a high-capacity 4-barrel carb, aluminum heads, a unique air induction system, and an ultra-high compression ratio (12.5:1). All small block cars had low-profile hoods. All big block cars had domed hoods for additional engine clearance with twin simulated vents and “427” emblems {{on either side of the}} dome. The new seven-inch wide steel wheels had F70x15 nylon bias-ply tires standard with either white or red stripe tires optional. Rare options were: L88 engine (80), J56 heavy-duty brakes (81), UA6 alarm system (388), L89 aluminum heads (624).|$|E
2500|$|Drivetrains {{were carried}} {{over from the}} {{previous}} generation, comprising four [...] small block V8s, three transmissions, and six axle ratios. Carbureted engines came in , , [...] and [...] versions. As before, the base and optional units employed hydraulic lifters, a mild camshaft, forged-steel crankshaft, 10.5:1 compression, single-point distributor, and dual exhausts. The 300-bhp engine produced its extra power via a larger four-barrel carburetor (Carter AFB instead of the 250's Carter WCFB), plus larger intake valves and exhaust manifold. Again topping the performance chart was a [...] fuel-injected V8, available for an extra $430.40. The car's standard transmission remained the familiar three-speed manual, though the preferred gearbox continued to be the Borg-Warner manual four-speed, changing over to the Muncie M20 during the 1963 model year, delivered with wide-ratio gears when teamed with the base and 300-bhp engines, and <b>close-ratio</b> gearing with the top two powerplants. Standard axle ratio for the three-speed manual or two-speed Powerglide automatic was 3.36:1. The four-speed gearbox came with a 3.70:1 final drive, but 3.08:1, 3.55:1, 4.11:1, and 4.56:1 gearsets were available. The last was quite rare in production, however.|$|E
2500|$|... 1979 saw the crossed-flag emblems on {{the nose}} and fuel door revert to those seen on the '77 model. Three popular {{features}} introduced on the '78 pace car replicas made it into this year’s production: the new bucket seats, {{the front and rear}} spoiler package, and the glass roof panels. The new lightweight “high back” seats were made standard equipment. The new seats had better side bolster, provided easier access to the rear storage area, and the seat pair resulted in a weight reduction of about 24pounds. The bolt-on front and rear spoilers were offered as an option and nearly 7,000 cars were ordered so equipped. Functionally, the spoilers decreased drag by about 15% and increased fuel economy by about a half-mile per gallon. A bigger hit were the glass mirror-tint roof panels, now a regular option, with nearly 15,000 cars so fitted despite their costing $365. All T-tops were now wired into the standard anti-theft alarm system. Tungsten-halogen high-beam headlights became standard as did an AM-FM radio, {{and for the first time}} a cassette tape player could be added as a $234 option. Heavy duty shock absorbers could now be ordered without the full Gymkhana suspension. An auxiliary electric engine cooling fan was first installed, but only on L-82 equipped cars with air conditioning. Rocker panels and rear window trim were painted black. Output for all engines increased due to new [...] "open flow" [...] mufflers. The dual-snorkel air intake introduced on L-82 cars the previous year was now fitted to all cars and the base engine now generated [...] The optional L-82 engine increased to [...] This was the final year a manual gearbox could be ordered with the L-82 engine. This was also the last year for the M21 <b>close-ratio</b> 4-speed, a gearbox that, as in previous years, required the optional L-82 engine. A wide-ratio 4-speed was available for all cars. Noteworthy is that about 82% of the cars were ordered with manual transmissions in 1968. In '79, less than 20% of the cars were delivered with manual gearboxes. This year reached an all-time high in Corvette popularity. Production hit its peak in 1979 at 53,807, a record that stands to this day.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{industry}} standardization between manufacturers as to {{what constitutes}} a <b>close-ratio</b> transmission. Therefore, a transmission that one manufacturer terms <b>close-ratio</b> {{may not necessarily be}} considered close-ratioed by another manufacturer.|$|E

50|$|A <b>close-ratio</b> {{transmission}} is a transmission {{in which there}} is a relatively little difference between the gear ratios of the gears. For example, a transmission with an engine shaft to drive shaft ratio of 4:1 in first gear and 2:1 in second gear would be considered wide-ratio when compared to another transmission with a ratio of 4:1 in first and 3:1 in second. This is because the <b>close-ratio</b> transmission has less of a progression between gears. For the wide-ratio transmission, the first gear ratio is 4:1 or 4, and in second gear it is 2:1 or 2, so the progression is equal to 4/2 = 2 (or 200%). For the <b>close-ratio</b> transmission, first gear has a 4:1 ratio or 4, and second gear has a ratio of 3:1 or 3, so the progression between gears is 4/3, or 133%. Since 133% is less than 200%, the transmission with the smaller progression between gears is considered <b>close-ratio.</b> However, the difference between a <b>close-ratio</b> and wide-ratio {{transmission is}} subjective and relative.|$|E
50|$|<b>Close-ratio</b> {{transmissions}} benefit {{passenger vehicles}} as well. The 2000 Honda S2000 produced 240 bhp at 8,300 rpm and 207 Nm of torque at 7,500 rpm, giving the S2000 a power band of 800 rpm, essentially 8% of the engine's operating speed range. Given the narrow power band of this engine, a <b>close-ratio</b> gearbox would be essential for maximum performance. The S2000's 6-speed transmission {{consisted of a}} 3.13:1 1st gear and 0.97:1 5th gear, resulting in the 1st gear ratio being 3.23 {{times that of the}} 5th gear ratio, vs 3.76 for the BMW 323i <b>close-ratio</b> transmission.|$|E

50|$|In {{the series}} {{transmission}}, the 1st gear ratio is 4.73 {{times that of}} the 5th gear ratio, while in the <b>close-ratio</b> transmission the 1st gear ratio is 3.76 {{times that of the}} 5th gear ratio. Given that both transmissions have 5 gears, this is indicative of the latter transmission having gear ratios spaced closer together; hence, its being a <b>close-ratio</b> transmission.|$|E

50|$|A 5-Speed Manual Transmission for FWD and mid-engine cars. Compared to the C50/52, it {{features}} <b>close-ratio</b> 3rd-to-4th gearing.|$|E
5000|$|Mathematically, this {{closeness}} can {{be represented}} by the cumulative average spacing between, or geometric average of, gears. For the above series transmission, each successive gear's ratio is 68% of that of the preceding gear (e.g. (1 / 4.73)1/4 = 0.678). The <b>close-ratio</b> transmission has successive gear ratios 72% of that of the preceding gear. Thus, the <b>close-ratio</b> transmission above has each successive gear [...] "closer" [...] in numerical ratio to the preceding gear {{than that of the}} series transmission.|$|E

5000|$|The W57 is {{sometimes}} {{designated as a}} [...] "close-ratio transmission"; however in its stock form it does not meet all the criteria for a <b>Close-ratio</b> box.|$|E
50|$|This table {{compares the}} ratios of two BMW 323i {{vehicles}} from the 1980s, the first being the series transmission and the second being the optional <b>close-ratio</b> transmission.|$|E
50|$|<b>Close-ratio</b> {{transmissions}} {{require a}} compromise, however. To maximize the dynamic {{performance of a}} vehicle, the automotive engineer would choose gear ratios that allow the vehicle to reach its theoretical maximum speed. For the BMW 323i above, that speed might be 130 mph given its 150-horsepower output at 6,000 rpm and aerodynamic and frictional drag at that speed. Thus, the engineer would select the appropriate rear axle ratio that, with the 1.00:1 5th gear ratio of the <b>close-ratio</b> transmission, causes the engine to turn at 6,000 rpm and generate the 150 HP needed at 130 mph.|$|E
50|$|The ATC250R is a {{high-performance}} ATV produced by Honda from 1981 to 1986. Early models (1981-1984) used an air-cooled, 248 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine. Fuel was fed through a 27 mm (1981-1982) or 30 mm (1983-1984) round-slide carburetor. Power was accessed through a <b>close-ratio</b> five-speed transmission with a manual clutch. Later models (1985-1986) used a liquid-cooled, 246 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine with a 34 mm round (1985) or flat (1986) slide carburetor. The biggest engine downfall {{was the lack}} of a power valve. The 85-86 models were upgraded with a <b>close-ratio</b> six speed transmission again with a manual clutch.|$|E
5000|$|RS - [...] "rally sport", <b>close-ratio</b> 5-speed, minimal interior, rally suspension, LSD, (Enkei Wheels, Recaro bucket seat, AYC (Active Yaw Control), Sports ABS (Anti-Lock braking system), Brembo brakes, double-din audio, {{power window}} are {{available}} as option).|$|E
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines found in passenger automobiles {{are able to}} operate over a relatively wide range of speeds. A <b>close-ratio</b> type of transmission is designed to allow an engine to remain in a relatively narrow operating speed. Alternately, a wide-ratio transmission requires the engine to operate over a greater speed range, but requires less shifting and allows {{a wider range of}} output speeds. <b>Close-ratio</b> transmissions are generally offered in sports cars, in which the engine is tuned for maximum power in a narrow range of operating speeds and the driver can be expected to enjoy shifting often to keep the engine in its power band.|$|E
50|$|The car also {{features}} uprated suspension with a lowered ride height and stiffened racing springs. The DBRS9 {{has also been}} fitted with a <b>close-ratio</b> racing gearbox in either 6-speed fully manual or an upgraded sequential manual form.|$|E
50|$|By extension, an {{automatic}} transmission {{could also be}} called close-ratioed. With the advent of 6-, 7-, and 8-speed automatic transmissions, the ratios become closer and closer together, which meets the mathematical conception {{of what constitutes a}} <b>close-ratio</b> transmission.|$|E
50|$|A multi-plate wet {{slipper clutch}} {{transfers}} {{power to a}} six-speed, <b>close-ratio</b> transmission ideal for closed-course competition. The back-torque limiter automatically disengages the clutch (partially) under hard downshifting at high engine speeds to prevent rear wheel hop during corner entry.|$|E
50|$|Cars {{tested a}} W30 4-4-2 with <b>close-ratio</b> four-speed and 4.33 rear axle (a dealer-installed only option), obtaining {{a quarter mile}} of 14.1 seconds at 103 mi/h km/h in {{completely}} stock form. 0-60 times were between 6.5 and 6.7 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} a 999cc dual {{overhead}} cam V-twin unit with two fuel injectors and four valves per cylinder. Power is {{delivered to the}} rear wheel by a <b>close-ratio,</b> six-speed transmission. The chassis is constructed from aluminium alloy, being a twin-spar design.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>close-ratio</b> {{transmission}} is a vehicle transmission {{in which the}} difference between the gear ratios of the gears is minimized relative to other transmissions used in similar vehicles. The use of [...] "close" [...] describes nearness rather than open-ness (i.e. open vs close).|$|E
50|$|While the {{optional}} <b>close-ratio</b> transmission above {{is also not}} optimal for the RA168E application, it is an improvement. Shifting from 2nd gear at 12,000 rpm to 3rd gear reduces engine speed to 69% (1.61 divided by 2.33) of 12,000 rpm, or 8,290 rpm.|$|E
