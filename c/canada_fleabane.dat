40|$|The 2, 4 -D choline/glyphosate DMA {{formulation}} {{has reduced}} drift and volatility {{compared to the}} amine or ester formulation of 2, 4 -D and therefore is advantageous compared to a tank mix of 2, 4 -D amine or ester with glyphosate. The objective {{of this research was}} to compare the control of glyphosate susceptible and glyphosate resistant <b>Canada</b> <b>fleabane</b> with 2, 4 -D choline/glyphosate DMA with 2, 4 -D amine, glyphosate, and a tank mix of 2, 4 -D amine and glyphosate. Ten rates of 2, 4 -D amine (0 - 6708 g∙ae∙ha⁻), glyphosate (0 - 7052 g∙ae∙ha⁻), a tank mix of glyphosate plus 2, 4 -D amine (0 - 7052 g∙ae∙ha⁻ + 0 - 6708), and 2, 4 -D choline/glyphosate DMA (0 - 13760 g∙ae∙ha⁻) were examined in the greenhouse for the control of two susceptible (GS) and two resistant to gly-phosate (GR) <b>Canada</b> <b>fleabane</b> biotypes. The tank mix of 2, 4 -D amine plus glyphosate and 2, 4 -D choline/glyphosate DMA provided equivalent control of the GR <b>Canada</b> <b>fleabane</b> biotypes at 35 days after the application (DAA). The 2, 4 -D choline/glyphosate DMA treatment was more effica-cious than the tank mix on the GS biotypes. Glyphosate (880 g∙ae∙ha⁻) provided 50 % and 100...|$|E
40|$|From 1991 to 1994 inclusively, a {{field and}} {{laboratory}} study was undertaken on egg parasitoids of the tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) {{to determine their}} potential in controlling their host. Five species were found to parasitize Lygus eggs in southwestern Quebec. They were three mymarids: Anaphes iole Girault, Polynema pratensiphagum (Walley), and Erythmelus miridiphagus Dozier (Mymaridae) and two scelionids: Telenomus nysivorus Huggert and Telenomus n. sp. (a new species near strelzovi Vasiliev) (Scelionidae). The maximum levels of field parasitism by these parasitoids were 20, 70, 35, and 70 % (for both species of Telenomus), respectively. The field parasitism was determined on Lygus eggs inserted in Contender green beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L., Irish cobbler potatoes, Solanum tuberosum L., and alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. P. pratensiphagum and Telenomus were the most abundant parasitoid species recorded. In 1991 and 1992 the seasonal occurrences of these parasitoids were investigated in three different habitats: mixed weeds, alfalfa, and crown vetch, Coronilla varia L. In both years Telenomus n. sp. was the most numerous parasitoid in all three habitats throughout the season, and had a strong synchrony with L. lineolaris populations. The laboratory and field monitoring experiments on the overwintering of A. iole, P. pratensiphagum and E. miridiphagus indicated {{that the presence of}} an alternative host is essential for the overwintering of these parasitoids. The eggs of the alfalfa plant bug, Adelphocoris lineolatus (Geoze) were the most common overwintering host for all three mymarids and <b>Canada</b> <b>fleabane,</b> Erigeron canadensis L. sustained more Adelphocoris eggs and egg parasitoids than other weed hosts. In the laboratory the parasitoid survival, mortality, fecundity, and adult longevity were determined for P. pratensiphagum, A. iole and Telenomus n. sp. The females of all three species lived longer than males, but males emerged 24 hours before females, and all are solitary parasitoids. Telenomus n. sp. showed a higher rate of survival (93 %) and a higher rate of parasitism (87 %) than other species under laboratory conditions. For rearing L. lineolaris, potato sprouts, S. tuberosum were found to be the medium preferable to potato slices and Patana artificial diets. This medium is worthy of further investigation for use in augmenting the egg parasitoids of L. lineolaris...|$|E
