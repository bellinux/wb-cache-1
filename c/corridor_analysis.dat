As a result of the regular presence of water and dense vegetation, the highest evapotranspiration (latent heat) rates usually occur within wetlands. Vegetation cover and evapotranspiration of large areas of restoration like that of Kissimmee River basin, South Florida will be best estimated using remote sensing technique than point measurements. Kissimmee River basin has been the area of ecological restoration for some years. The current ecohydrological restoration activities were evaluated through fractional vegetation cover (FVC) changes and latent heat flux using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Groundwater level data were also analyzed for selected eight groundwater monitoring wells in the basin. Results have shown that the average fractional vegetation cover and latent heat along 10 km buffer of Kissimmee River between Lake Kissimmee and Lake Okeechobee was higher in 2004 than in 2000.

Inspecting corridors using traditional, manual methods requires the engineer to be unnecessarily exposed to the hazard.

Mobile terrestrial LiDAR is an emerging remote data collection technique capable of generating accurate fully three-dimensional virtual models while driving at speeds up to 100 km/h.

This approach seemed justified by the functional importance of these relatively linear phenomena within the landscape, that of fostering transport of organisms (including humans) from one part of the landscape to another.

Constructing an effective and harmonious urban ecological network and maintaining a sustainable living environment in response to rapid urbanization are the key issues required to be resolved by landscape planners. In this paper, Nanchang City, China was selected as a study area. Based on a series of landscape metrics, the landscape pattern analysis of the current (in 2005) and planned (in 2020) green space system were, respectively, conducted by using FRAGSTATS 3. 3 software.

The Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli is threatened in particular by habitat disturbance because its population is small and it lives in an area where high human population density results in intense exploitation of natural resources.

One such region surrounds Lake George and Southern Lake Champlain, nested between the Green and Adirondack Mountains.

This landscape’s inherent connectedness provides many benefits to wildlife, including species richness, enhanced persistence, and increased genetic interchange.

Salt Lake City, Utah, is undergoing rapid population and economic growth, which has elevated the competing priorities associated with maintaining the city’s Jordan River. To understand how people living near the river perceive it, a tablet-based public-intercept survey was conducted to gather public feedback from traditionally underrepresented groups about the Jordan River <b>Corridor.</b> This <b>analysis</b> looks at respondents’ levels of concern about water quality in the Jordan River. Using socio-demographic indicators, this analysis seeks to understand what factors influence residents’ levels of concern about water quality in the river.

40|$|Effects of {{functioning}} transportation infrastructure are receiving {{more and more}} environmental and social concern nowadays. Nevertheless, preliminary corridor plans are usually developed {{on the basis of}} technical and economic criteria exclusively. By the time of environmental impact assessment (EIA), which succeeds, relocation is practically impossible and only preventative measures can be applied. This paper proposes a GIS-based method of delimiting motorway corridor and integrating social, environmental and economic factors into the early stages of planning. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques are used to assess all possible alternatives. GIS-held weighted shortest path algorithm enables to locate the corridor. The evaluation criteria are exemplary. They include nature conservation, buildings, forests and agricultural resources, and soils. Resulting evaluation surface is divided into a grid of cells, which are assigned suitability scores derived from all evaluation criteria. Subsequently, a set of adjacent cells connecting two pre-specified points is traced by the least-cost path algorithm. The best alternative has a lowest total value of suitability scores. As a result, the proposed motorway corridor is routed from origin to destination. It is afterwards compared with an alternative derived by traditional planning procedures. Concluding remarks are that the location criteria need to be adjusted to meet construction requirements as well as analysis process to be automated. Nevertheless, the geographic information system and the embedded shortest path algorithm proved to be well suited for preliminary <b>corridor</b> location <b>analysis.</b> Future research directions are sketched...|$|R
