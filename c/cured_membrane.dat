40|$|Concrete curing {{has long}} been {{realized}} to be important to produce durable concrete. Curing compound is widely used to cure concrete in the field. The current <b>curing</b> <b>membrane</b> evaluation method ASTM C 156, however, is incapable of distinguishing the curing compound quality and guiding the curing practice in the field. A new laboratory <b>curing</b> <b>membrane</b> evaluation protocol is developed in this study. It {{has the ability to}} rank the quality of curing compound and guide curing practice in the field according to the field ambient weather conditions and the type of curing compound. A series of field tests were conducted to investigate the key factors that affect the curing effectiveness in the field conditions. A finite element program, temperature and moisture analysis for curing concrete (TMAC 2), is updated to solve the coupled and nonlinear heat transfer and moisture transport problems in early-age concrete. Moisture capacity is induced into the TMAC 2, which makes it unique to characterize the self-desiccation. A full scale concrete pavement test study was conducted at the FAA National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF) near Atlantic City, New Jersey. In this study, the material properties, i. e. thermal conductivity and moisture diffusivity, were backcalculated from field data. Thereafter, backcalculated material properties were used to forward-calculate the temperature and moisture histories of all other sections. High order shear deformable theory is used to model the concrete slab curling and warping behavior because of highly nonlinear temperature and moisture gradients. The maximum shear strain is obtained a couple of inches below the concrete slab. This might account for the occurrence of delamination...|$|R

The laboratory studies have concentrated on the volumetric changes in the material and on the effectiveness of <b>curing</b> <b>membranes.</b> Shrinkage in clay-ce-ment mixtures-has been shown to be anisotropic. When it is measured in the direction appropriate for estimating the horizon-tal shrinkage in pavements, shrinkage is inversely proportional to the cement content provided that the material is properly cured. As the cement content is increased up to 15 per cent the shrinkage of horizontally compacted specimens decreases. The effects of the method of compaction, density and pretreatment moisture content on the shrinkage of clay-cement is considered. Curing method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Curing is {{essential}} if concrete is {{to perform the}} intended function over the design life of the structure while excessive curing time {{may lead to the}} escalation of the construction cost of the project and unnecessary delays. Where there is a scarcity of water and on sloping surfaces where curing with water is difficult and in cases where large areas like pavements have to be cured, the use of curing compound may be resorted to. The parameters of the study include the curing period [1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 day], curing method [conventional wet <b>curing,</b> <b>membrane</b> forming compound <b>curing</b> and accelerated curing] and the type of cement [Ordinary Portland Cement(OPC) 43 grade, Portland Pozzolana Cement(PPC) 43 grade and Ordinary Portland Cement(OPC) 43 grade + 10 % Silica Fume(SF) replacement for cement].

40|$|The {{cause of}} early {{cracking}} in newly poured concrete slabs {{is often the}} plastic shrinkage. Plastic shrinkage occurs during the first hours after casting when the concrete is exposed to premature drying. During this time the concrete still is plastic, and could be vibrated and surface finished. Thus, the actual hardening has not started. In cases when the shrinkage is subjected to resisting forces tensile stresses can arise in the material and cracks may occur. The plastic shrinkage {{is assumed to be}} due to two simultaneous water transport in the concrete mass, namely dewatering (water transport from the concrete slab’s interior to the surface) and evaporation (water leaving the surface). When the evaporation exceeds the dewatering, the surface will dry out and the risk of cracking increases. Factors affecting evaporation and dewatering also affect the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking formation. Previous research highlights, among other things, wind speed, air temperature, humidity, concrete consistency, cement, additives and variations of specimen thickness as risk parameters. To counter the plastic shrinkage cracking formation, some finishing work can to be done. The literature suggests, for example, water <b>curing,</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>curing,</b> application of plastic wrap and, if necessary, the establishment of windbreaks and sunshades. The master thesis includes eight laboratory tests in which the occurrence of plastic shrinkage cracks in concrete with vct 0, 38 has been studied at different cement types and under varying wind speed. The cement types that have been compared are ordinary Portland cement (byggcement) and base-cement (bascement). The Portland cement is now commonplace in the workplaces while the base-cement is going to be introduced on the market in 2013 and 2014. In order to study the phenomenon of plastic shrinkage cracks an experimental setup was built in which a concrete slab with dimensions 1200 x 400 x 80 mm was cast. The model is based on a previously used equipment but with some modifications and a more sophisticated measuring equipment. By making use of a wind machine a wind over the plate surface could be simulated. In the experimental tests the evaporation of the specimen, the concrete temperature, the air temperature, the relative humidity and the wind speed was measured. The evaporation measurement was performed by continuously weighing the concrete slab. The results from the experiments indicate that the base-cement gives rise to fewer cracks than the Portland cement. Also the time until the first crack was observed was longer for the base-cement which would mean that the possibility of curing the surface would increase. In the study no significant temperature variation between the cement types was observed. Further, a higher wind speed gave rise to a higher evaporation and a shorter time until cracking was noticed. The master thesis also includes studies of the phenomenon itself and theoretical analysis of different models of plastic shrinkage cracking formation. Various formulas have been studied and the measured evaporation agreed well with the theoretically calculated evaporation during the time the concrete was in its plastic state.

40|$|Thin film {{composite}} (TFC) layers {{are formed}} using interfacial polymerization reaction between an aqueous phase and organic phase on membrane supports. In {{the preparation of}} thin film composite membrane, there are many interfacial reaction factors that influence the membrane performance, amongst them are dipping time, curing temperature and composition of aqueous phase. Thus in this project these factors were studied in two stages. In the preliminary stage, the effect of dipping time and curing temperature {{on the performance of}} TFC membrane were evaluated using two different kinds of polymer membrane supports, cellulose acetate and polysulfone. Initial results revealed that dipping time does not affect the performance of TFC membranes especially rejection rate but curing temperature have significant influence. Curing temperature ranging from 40 ??C to 100 ??C was used during the interfacial reaction process. Cellulose acetate TFC <b>membranes</b> <b>cured</b> at 60 ??C exhibited highest rejection rate of 76 % whilst polysulfone TFC <b>membranes</b> <b>cured</b> at 80 ??C showed not only highest rejection rate of 80 % but also excellent flux rates. Since polysulfone TFC membranes showed superior performance compared to cellulose acetate, it is chosen for the second stage of the experiment. In this stage, a systematic experimental design based on the response surface methodology was used to identify the significant interfacial reaction factors which influence the membrane performance. The factors considered were the composition of aqueous phase that includes the ratio of m-phenyldiamine to hydroquinone as monomer, percent of tetrabutylammonium bromide as a catalyst and percent of sodium hydroxide as an acid acceptor. Rejection and flux rates were the response variables investigated.

40|$|A novel bio-affinitive, photocuring, and membrane-forming gelatin {{derivative}} was synthesized in this study. This {{process was}} based on the amide formation between carboxylic acid and the amine in methanol-water media using dicycloliexyl-carbodiimide (DCC) as a condenser. Gelatin and glycine were the sources of amine in the model reaction. Since there were two anhydride groups in each 3, 3, 4, 4 '-benzophenone tetra-carboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) molecule, two 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) molecules were used to induce the ring-opening reaction of BTDA and release two carboxylic acid groups. The resulting photoreactive gelatin was called GE-BTHE, of which the photoreactive component was the ketone groups of BTDA and HEMA that played the role of double bond supplier. This photoreactive gelatin could be converted from the transparent liquid phase into swollen membrane by a 6 -min irradiation of high pressure mercury lamp. The most efficient irradiation was at 267 nm and the highest degree of swelling of the <b>cured</b> GE-BTHE <b>membrane</b> could reach 5. 9.

The most straightforward way to implement the modification is to use, during the ultraviolet-curing step, an ultraviolet photomask similar to the photomasks used in fabricating microelectronic devices. In lieu of such a photomask, one could use a mask made of any patternable ultraviolet-absorbing material (for example, an ink or a photoresist) ...|$|R

Microcystin-LR (MCT) {{is one of the}} most relevant cyanotoxin, being the most widely studied hepatotoxin. For safety purposes, the World Health Organization recommends a maximum value of 1 μg L− 1 of MCT in drinking water. Therefore, there is a great demand for remote and real-time sensing techniques to detect and quantify MCT. In this work a Fabry–Pérot sensing probe based on an optical fibre tip coated with a MCT selective thin film is presented. The membranes were developed by imprinting MCT in a sol–gel matrix that was applied over the tip of the fibre by dip coating. The imprinting effect was obtained by <b>curing</b> the sol–gel <b>membrane,</b> prepared with (3 -aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS), diphenyl-dimethoxysilane (DPDMS), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), in the presence of MCT. The imprinting effect was tested by preparing a similar membrane without template. In general, the fibre Fabry–Pérot with a Molecular Imprinted Polymer (MIP) sensor showed low thermal effect, thus avoiding the need of temperature control in field applications. It presented a linear response to MCT concentration within 0. 3 – 1. 4 μg L− 1 with a sensitivity of − 12. 4 ± 0. 7 nm L μg− 1. The corresponding Non-Imprinted Polymer (NIP) displayed linear behaviour for the same MCT concentration range, but with much less sensitivity, of − 5. 9 ± 0. 2 nm L μg− 1.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of the standardly used liquid electrolyte, subject to evaporation in real applications, with polymer electrolytes, that can ensure good performance and especially prolonged durability, in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and Li-ion batteries is a stimulating challenge. Free radical photo-polymerisation (UV-curing) is a promising approach {{for the production of}} thermo-set polymer coatings, inks adhesives and membranes where the surface /volume ratio is high. It takes place at room temperature under UV light and, therefore, is an easy, low energy consuming, reliable and rapid process. Methacrylic-based thermo-set polymer membranes prepared by UV curing were already proposed as solid or quasi solid polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries and DSSCs applications. Aiming to assemble high performing energy devices, the production of composite membranes with improved mechanal properties, flexibility and long time performances has to be taken in consideration. Nanoscale-microfibrillated cellulose particles (MFC), first studied by Herrick et al and Tubark et al. are easily available and biodegradable; they show stiffness, impressive mechanical properties and reinforcing capability, low weight and, furthermore, their preparation process is easy, low cost and does not involve chemical reactions. For all these reasons nanoscale MFC have already been used {{in a wide variety of}} applications such as rheology modifier in food, paints, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products and have the potential to significantly reinforce polymers at low filler loadings and serve as promising candidates for bio-composite production. Considering the interesting properties of MFC and the potentials of free radical photo-polymerisation, a UV <b>cured</b> MFC-polymer composite <b>membrane</b> could surely result highly promising.

40|$|The growing {{market of}} liquid and gas {{separation}} (GS) demands for improvements of existing membranes and/or {{development of new}} membranes. In the case of GS, crucial are the anti-plasticization properties of the membrane polymer, while for e. g. solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF), solvent stability is important, including stability {{in a wide range}} of pH (1 - 14) and at high temperature. When preparing thin film composite membranes for any kind of membrane applications, the support layer is preferably highly chemically stable to allow coating of the selective layer from any kind of solvent or to allow any kind of chemical or thermal post-treatment. All these very diverse aspects require implementation of cross-linking in membrane synthesis. The most typical method is via chemical cross-linking, realized through a chemical reaction between the membrane polymer (e. g. polyimide) and a cross-linker (e. g. a diamine). Such cross-linking methods have some disadvantages. Firstly, they cannot be used to all polymers, such as polysulfones (PSUs) or poly(ether ether ketones) (PEEKs), because of the lack of reactive groups in the backbone of such polymer chains. In addition, chemical cross-linking also generates waste streams, often very environmentally unfriendly. A new generic way to prepare highly chemical and thermal resistant SRNF membranes is presented in this PhD thesis. The concept is based on the preparation via nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) of an asymmetric membrane consisting of a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN). As base polymer for the membranes, polysulfone (PSU) was proposed because of its good chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties, as well as its intrinsic photosensitivity and lack of reactive groups. The latter is of importance in e. g. SRNF, where membrane polarity is often undesired. When combined with the appropriate acrylate cross-linkers, SIPN structure was obtained by employing simple UV cross-linking, hence not generating any waste streams. Moreover, this method is quick, easy to use and upscale. In the first part, the photochemical aspects of the synthesis of SRNF membranes via NIPS/UV were studied. Additives suitable for UV cross-linking reaction were chosen, including cross-linkers with a varying functionality, as well as initiators from the group of free-radical photoinitiators type I and type II. The photoinitiators were applied in different concentrations. The influence of the additives, of the UV dose, and of the membrane thickness on the UV curing efficiency was investigated. The resulting membranes were analysed by ATR-FTIR, HPLC, DSC, and screened for solvent resistance. The SIPN network structure was characterized by DSC and TGA analysis. The best type and concentration of photoinitiator were selected for the further studies. In the second part, the morphological aspects and the performance of the resulting membranes in SRNF were explored. Asymmetric membranes consisting of 2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl-diphenyl-phosphine oxide (TPO) as photoinitiator and acrylate cross-linkers with different functionality were synthesized via NIPS/UV. The effects of various cross-linker types and of the membrane synthesis sequence on morphology, SRNF, and solvent resistant properties of the membrane were examined. Based on the obtained results, various poly(aryl sulfones) (PASUs) were screened in the last part. The influence of PASU type and concentration in the casting solution on UV <b>curing</b> efficiency, <b>membrane</b> morphology, SRNF performance, and solvent resistance was investigated. Polysulfone (with high and low molecular weight), poly(ether sulfone), and poly(phenyl sulfone) membranes were prepared using 3 wt% of TPO and 5 wt% of penta-acrylate cross-linker. The membranes were synthesized by NIPS/UV and characterized by SEM, ATR-FTIR, and SRNF. As a result, SIPN based membranes consisting of linear PSU and cross-linked polyacrylate (PAc) were developed by a very easy, versatile, and environmentally benign method. The optimized asymmetric membranes based on such SIPN, showed good SRNF performance and superior chemical resistance in comparison to conventional PSU membranes. status: publishe...|$|R
