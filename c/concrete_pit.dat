25|$|As of January 2008, {{the number}} of dingoes on the island was {{estimated}} to be 120 to 150, and sightings have become less common. A University of Queensland researcher, Nick Baker, claims the dingoes on Fraser Island have adopted unusual behaviour. Rather than hunt in small packs, Fraser Island dingoes had developed a tolerance for each other and work together in one big hunting pack. Dingo-proof fences, consisting of metals bars across a <b>concrete</b> <b>pit</b> and a 1.8m high mesh fence were built around nine island settlements in 2008, to keep the dingoes out of the townships.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] by [...] {{windows are}} {{designed}} to prevent inmates from knowing their specific location within the complex because they can see only the sky and roof through them, making it virtually impossible to plan an escape. Inmates exercise in a <b>concrete</b> <b>pit</b> resembling an empty swimming pool, also designed {{to prevent them from}} knowing their location in the facility. The pit is only large enough for a prisoner to walk 10 steps in a straight line, or 31 steps in a circle. Telecommunication with the outside world is forbidden, and food is hand-delivered by correction officers. However, inmates sent here from other prisons can potentially be allowed to eat in a shared dining room. The prison as a whole contains a multitude of motion detectors and cameras, and 1,400 remote-controlled steel doors. Officers in the prison's control center monitor inmates 24 hours a day and can activate a [...] "panic button" [...] that instantly closes every door in the facility should an escape attempt be suspected. Pressure pads and [...] razor wire fences surround the perimeter, which is patrolled by heavily armed officers with attack dogs. In extreme cases of inmate misbehavior, the center of the prison houses an area known as [...] "Z-Unit" [...] or [...] "The Black Hole," [...] which can hold up to 148 prisoners in completely darkened and fully soundproofed cells. Each Z-Unit cell is equipped with a full set of body restraints that are built directly into the concrete bed.|$|E

They were only emplaced for a few years and the fort was disarmed before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. It became a Royal Engineers depot during the war and was rearmed in 1930 with a pair of replacement 6-inch guns, used to train the Territorial Army's Gravesend battery. At the same time, the Gravesend Corporation purchased the interior of the fort. The interior of the fort was opened to the public in 1932 as a pleasure garden, though the battery remained in use until 1938. Some of the fort's internal structures were also demolished at this time.|$|R

When this idea was abandoned the battery was left vacant until a local volunteer group opened the east facing casemates in 1994 as a Summer Exhibition Centre. The centre gun embrasure was converted to a doorway. The west casemates have had their wooden partitions removed allowing them to be used for storage and parking for the chalets. The two 6-inch gun emplacements are intact on top of the battery but are not accessible. The <b>concrete</b> <b>pits</b> for the Moncrieff carriages can still be seen beneath the later 6-inch B.L. emplacements.
