25|$|Variations in the {{quiescent}} current with temperature, or between parts {{with the same}} type number, are common, so <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> and {{quiescent current}} {{may be subject to}} significant variation.|$|E
25|$|Class B {{amplifiers}} have a {{very high}} efficiency but are impractical for audio work because of high levels of distortion (See: <b>Crossover</b> <b>distortion).</b> In practical design, the result of a tradeoff is the class AB design. Modern Class AB amplifiers commonly have peak efficiencies between 30–55% in audio systems and 50-70% in radio frequency systems with a theoretical maximum of 78.5%.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E
40|$|Strongly {{correlated}} f-electron {{systems are}} a rich reservoir for exotic and intriguing physical phenomena; their competition and interplay between localized magnetic moments in partially filled d- or f-electron shells, and conduction electron states lead to complex magnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and other intricate matter of states. The complex phase diagrams of temperature T versus a control parameter δ, such as chemical composition x, applied pressure P, and magnetic field H, have been observed, where they exhibit new and unexpected physics, including "non-Fermi-liquid" (NFL) behavior, "rattling" motion of atoms {{in a cage}} structure, local structure <b>distortion,</b> <b>crossover</b> of superconducting order parameters, and the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism. In order to explore such new phase diagrams, therefore, the work in this dissertation focuses on several chemical substitution studies on f-electron systems: the layered superconductor La 1 -xYxO 0. 5 F 0. 5 BiS 2, and the filled-skutterudite PrPt 4 Ge 12 -xSbx and Pr 1 -xEuxPt 4 Ge 12 systems, whose parent compound PrPt 4 Ge 12 is an unconventional superconductor. Polycrystalline samples were synthesized {{during the course of}} the studies and were characterized by means of x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements...|$|R
2500|$|Careful {{design of}} {{each stage of}} an {{open-loop}} (non-feedback) amplifier can achieve about 1% distortion for audio-frequency signals. With negative feedback, 0.001% is typical. [...] Noise, even <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion,</b> can be practically eliminated. [...] Negative feedback also compensates for changing temperatures, and degrading or nonlinear components in the gain stage, but any change or nonlinearity in the components in the feedback loop will affect the output. Indeed, {{the ability of the}} feedback loop to define the output is used to make active filter circuits. The concept of feedback is used in operational amplifiers to precisely define gain, bandwidth, and other parameters entirely based on the components in the feedback loop.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the circuit}} {{involving}} Q16 (variously named rubber diode or VBE multiplier), the 4.5k resistor must be conducting about 100μA, with the Q16 VBE roughly 700mV. Then the VCB must be about 0.45V and VCE at about 1.0V. Because the Q16 collector {{is driven by}} a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of ≈ 1V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor exp(100mV / VT [...] ) ≈ 36 smaller than the 1mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the op amp. This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> of this stage.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a class B/AB amplifier, <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> can be reduced by using a slight forward bias in the base circuit such that the {{transistors}} are idling at a small output current. The forward bias causes the circuit to operate in class-AB mode, so both transistors are slightly on during crossover. This can reduce or eliminate the characteristic kink of <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion,</b> although other types of <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> will remain.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefit of}} all class-A {{amplifiers}} {{is the absence of}} <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion.</b> This <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> was found especially annoying after the first silicon-transistor class-B and class-AB transistor amplifiers arrived on the consumer market. Earlier germanium-based designs with the much lower turn-on voltage of this technology and the non-linear response curves of the devices had not shown large amounts of cross-over distortion. Although <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> is very fatiguing to the ear and perceptible in listening tests, it is also almost invisible (until looked for) in the traditional Total harmonic distortion (THD) measurements of that epoch.|$|E
5000|$|It is at {{the point}} at which the output moving from one {{transistor}} to another (the crossover point) that a small amount of distortion is created. [...] "This <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> is inevitable and although it can be minimized, Cambridge's elegant Class XD alternative doesn't eliminate <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion,</b> it shifts it away from the zero-crossing point of the waveform." ...|$|E
5000|$|Overall low {{harmonic}} distortion with small signals. By nature Class A amplifiers do not suffer from <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... • Class XD pushes <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> {{away from}} the central point where the {{amplifier}} output spends most of its time ...|$|E
50|$|Variations in the {{quiescent}} current with temperature, or between parts {{with the same}} type number, are common, so <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> and {{quiescent current}} {{may be subject to}} significant variation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{point where}} the device comes closest to being 'off' is not at 'zero signal', so the {{problems}} of <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> associated with class-AB and -B designs is avoided.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the price}} {{for this is that}} they suffer from <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion,</b> of more or less {{constant}} amplitude regardless of signal amplitude. This means that class AB and B amplifiers produce their lowest distortion percentage at near maximum amplitude, with poorer distortion performance at low levels. As the circuit changes from pure class A, through AB1 and AB2, to B, open-loop <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> worsens. Class AB and B amplifiers use NFB to reduce open-loop distortion. Measured distortion spectra from such amplifiers show that distortion percentage is dramatically reduced by NFB, but the residual distortion is shifted towards higher harmonics.|$|E
50|$|Some {{sets were}} prone to {{suffering}} <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> as the battery voltage fell. This is a rough unpleasant type of distortion. In sets prone to this, significant care {{was taken to}} avoid it, {{or in some cases}} at least minimize it.|$|E
50|$|Class A PP designs have no <b>crossover</b> <b>{{distortion}}</b> and distortion becomes negligible as {{signal amplitude}} is reduced. The {{effect of this}} is that class A amplifiers perform extremely well with music that has a low average level (with negligible distortion) with momentary peaks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crossover</b> <b>{{distortion}}</b> {{is a type}} of distortion {{which is}} caused by switching between devices driving a load, most often when the devices (such as a transistor) are matched. It is most commonly seen in complementary, or [...] "push-pull", Class-B amplifier stages, although it is occasionally seen in other types of circuits as well.|$|E
50|$|Avoids this <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> (because the {{transistors}} {{are always}} on) {{but at the}} expense of a lot of heat generation. Managing this heat and power dissipation inevitably means that Class A designs are much more expensive to implement and often of lower power output so as to minimize the heat build-up as much as possible.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} kinds of distortion, another {{way in which}} <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> can be reduced is {{through the use of}} feedback. By {{comparing}} the output to the desired output, and adjusting the input to correct for any error, we can significantly reduce distortion. This may be done with an operational amplifier, as shown below, or with a discrete circuit.|$|E
50|$|In this context, {{distortion}} {{refers to}} any kind of deformation of an output waveform compared to its input, usually clipping, harmonic distortion, or intermodulation distortion (mixing phenomena) caused by non-linear behavior of electronic components and power supply limitations. Terms for specific types of nonlinear audio distortion include: <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion,</b> slew-Induced Distortion (SID) and transient intermodulation (TIM).|$|E
50|$|Class B {{amplifiers}} have a {{very high}} efficiency but are impractical for audio work because of high levels of distortion (See: <b>Crossover</b> <b>distortion).</b> In practical design, the result of a tradeoff is the class AB design. Modern Class AB amplifiers commonly have peak efficiencies between 30-55% in audio systems and 50-70% in radio frequency systems with a theoretical maximum of 78.5%.|$|E
50|$|A {{push-pull}} amplifier produces less distortion than a single-ended one. This allows a class-A or AB {{push-pull amplifier}} {{to have less}} distortion for the same power as the same devices used in single-ended configuration. Class AB and class B dissipate less power for the same output than class A; distortion can be kept low by negative feedback and by biassing the output stage to reduce <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inherently generates <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion,</b> and inconveniently {{displays}} this non-linearity at the zero-crossing, {{where it}} is always in evidence no matter how low the signal amplitude. At one unique value of quiescent current the distortion produced is a minimum, {{and this is what}} characterizes optimal Class B; however at no value can it be made to disappear. It is in fact inherent in the classical Class B operation of a pair of output transistors.|$|E
50|$|Less {{pronounced}} {{forms of}} distortion may {{be observed in}} this circuit as well. An emitter-follower will have a voltage gain of just under 1. In the circuit shown, the NPN emitter-follower and the PNP emitter-follower will generally have very slightly different voltage gains, leading to slightly different gains above and below ground. Other more subtle forms of <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion,</b> stemming from slight differences between the PNP and NPN devices, exist as well.|$|E
5000|$|Class-A power {{amplifier}} designs {{have largely been}} superseded by more efficient designs, though their simplicity makes them popular with some hobbyists. There is a market for expensive high fidelity class-A amps considered a [...] "cult item" [...] among audiophiles mainly for their absence of <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> and reduced odd-harmonic and high-order harmonic distortion. Class A power amps are also used in some [...] "boutique" [...] guitar amplifiers due to their perceived tonal qualities.|$|E
50|$|Tube sound (or valve sound) is the {{characteristic}} sound {{associated with a}} vacuum tube amplifier (valve amplifier in British English), a vacuum tube-based audio amplifier. After introduction of solid state amplifiers, tube sound appeared as the logical complement of transistor sound, which had some negative connotations due to <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> of early transistor amplifiers. The audible significance of tube amplification on audio signals is a subject of continuing debate among audio enthusiasts.|$|E
5000|$|... 468-weighting is {{also used}} in {{weighted}} distortion measurement at 1 kHz. Weighting the distortion residue after removal of the fundamental emphasises high-order harmonics, but only up to 10 kHz or so where the ears response falls off. This results in a single measurement (sometimes called distortion residue measurement) which has been claimed to correspond well with subjective effect even for power amplifiers where <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> {{is known to be}} far more audible than normal THD (Total harmonic distortion) measurements would suggest.|$|E
5000|$|For many {{purposes}} {{different types}} of harmonics are not equivalent. For instance, <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> at a given THD is much more audible than clipping distortion at the same THD, since the harmonics produced are at higher frequencies, which are not as easily masked by the fundamental. [...] A single THD number is inadequate to specify audibility, and must be interpreted with care. Taking THD measurements at different output levels would expose whether the distortion is clipping (which increases with level) or crossover (which decreases with level).|$|E
5000|$|In the audiophile world, such {{popularity}} is justified {{on the basis}} of sound quality, the earlier valve amplifier designs were free of such artifacts as <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> that beset the early bipolar transistor designs of the 1960s. Despite more recent designs that have removed these problems, the [...] "valve sound" [...] is still preferred by some, who will pay large amounts to achieve it. It's also notable that almost all recent audiophile valve amplifiers make a deliberate display of their valves and place them visibly on show.|$|E
50|$|The {{distortion}} {{content of}} class-A circuits (SE or PP) typically monotonically reduces as the signal level is reduced, asymptotic to zero during quiet passages of music. For this reason class-A amplifiers are especially desired for classical and acoustic music etc. cf. class-B and AB amplifiers, {{for which the}} amplitude of the <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> {{is more or less}} constant, and thus the distortion relative to signal increases as the music gets quieter. Class-A amplifiers measure best at low power. Class-AB and B amplifiers measure best just below max rated power.|$|E
50|$|Q3 is {{a common}} emitter stage that {{provides}} amplification of the signal and the DC bias current through D1 and D2 to generate a bias voltage for the output devices. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push-pull, also called a complementary pair. The diodes D1 and D2 provide {{a small amount of}} constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E
5000|$|In a class-AB amplifier, the {{conduction}} {{angle is}} intermediate between class A and B; the two active elements conduct {{more than half}} of the time.Class AB is widely considered a good compromise for amplifiers, since much of the time the music signal is quiet enough that the signal stays in the [...] "class-A" [...] region, where it is amplified with good fidelity, and by definition if passing out of this region, is large enough that the distortion products typical of class B are relatively small. The <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> can be reduced further by using negative feedback.|$|E
50|$|Careful {{design of}} {{each stage of}} an {{open-loop}} (non-feedback) amplifier can achieve about 1% distortion for audio-frequency signals. With negative feedback, 0.001% is typical. Noise, even <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion,</b> can be practically eliminated.

5000|$|A {{single-ended}} amplifier {{may have}} an asymmetric transfer characteristic and will generally produce even as well as odd harmonics. [...] A particularly famous research about [...] "tube sound" [...] compared a selection of single-ended tube microphone preamplifiers to a selection of push-pull transistorized microphone preamplifiers. The difference in harmonic patterns of these two topologies has henceforth been often incorrectly attributed as difference of tube and solid-state devices (or even the amplifier class). Push-pull tube amplifiers can be run in class A (rarely), AB, or B. Also, a class-B amplifier may have <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> that will be typically high order and thus sonically very undesirable indeed.|$|E
50|$|Leakage current {{increases}} {{significantly in}} bipolar transistors (especially germanium-based bipolar transistors) as they increase in temperature. Depending {{on the design}} of the circuit, this increase in leakage current can increase the current flowing through a transistor and thus the power dissipation, causing a further increase in collector-to-emitter leakage current. This is frequently seen in a push - pull stage of a class AB amplifier. If the pull-up and pull-down transistors are biased to have minimal <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion</b> at room temperature, and the biasing is not temperature-compensated, then as the temperature rises both transistors will be increasingly biased on, causing current and power to further increase, and eventually destroying one or both devices.|$|E
50|$|Harmonic {{distortion}} adds overtones {{that are}} whole number multiples {{of a sound}} wave's frequencies. Nonlinearities {{that give rise to}} amplitude distortion in audio systems are most often measured in terms of the harmonics (overtones) added to a pure sinewave fed to the system. Harmonic distortion may be expressed in terms of the relative strength of individual components, in decibels, or the root mean square of all harmonic components: Total harmonic distortion (THD), as a percentage. The level at which harmonic distortion becomes audible depends on the exact nature of the distortion. Different types of distortion (like <b>crossover</b> <b>distortion)</b> are more audible than others (like soft clipping) even if the THD measurements are identical. Harmonic distortion in radio frequency applications is rarely expressed as THD.|$|E
