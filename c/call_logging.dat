50|$|Telephone call data, such as {{originating}} station, destination, {{start and}} ending times, and transmission characteristics, is collected from a telecommunications system or {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) in form of call detail records (CDRs). The equipment typically presents this data on older PBXs via a serial communications port, or more recently via a computer network over an Ethernet connection. From the interface, CDRs are collected on computer systems running <b>call</b> <b>logging</b> and analysis software. Some PBX manufacturers provide their own basic <b>call</b> <b>logging</b> software but many other third-party software packages are available.|$|E

50|$|During the 1970s, Post Office Telecommunications was {{embarking on}} {{upgrading}} the telephone network, {{with the view}} to modernizing the various established mechanical switching devices, consisting mostly of Strowger exchanges, employed in the UK telephone exchanges, and replacing them with an electronic system. This replacement system became known as System X. Concurrently, {{and as part of}} this network upgrade, a dedicated engineering group was formed within the division THQ (Telecoms) to design a <b>call</b> <b>logging</b> system and to establish its feasibility for integration within the various existing Strowger and electronic exchanges, prior to their eventual replacement. A mix of different telephone exchange equipment was selected for trial within Scotland, comprising Strowger pre-2000, 2000 and 4000 type switches located in Director telephone systems and non-Director areas. The <b>call</b> <b>logging</b> trial proved successful and while it was initially designed to gather phone call data and cost of billing details specific to the customers' calls, a hidden benefit emerged such that local management were also able to see a pattern of the types of calls being generated, i.e. calls to and from certain businesses in addition to billing information, which was used to ease flow of traffic during peak times in the exchange and to plan for future customer provision within a catchment area. The concept of this <b>call</b> <b>logging</b> equipment was also deployed in UXD exchanges for remote areas where a System X exchange was not considered feasible.|$|E
50|$|This {{system was}} {{extended}} to domestic tape decks, and so slower speeds as they were adopted tended to be exactly half the previous slowest speed. Pre-recorded tapes were mostly 71⁄2 ips, with a few at 33⁄4 ips. Message tapes transmitted by post and <b>call</b> <b>logging</b> tapes were commonly recorded at 17⁄8 ips or even 15⁄16 ips. The most common reel-to-reel speed of 71⁄2 ips is approximately 19 cm/s.|$|E

5000|$|A {{cassette}} {{longer than}} a C90, such as a C120, must use even thinner tape. Many equipment manufacturers discourage {{the use of these}} longer cassettes, partly because the tape is so fragile, and also because of the difficulty of providing optimum recording over an extended range of tape thicknesses (thinner tape is more prone to [...] "print through" [...] echo). However C180 cassettes have been produced both for the consumer market and for specialised applications such as <b>call</b> <b>logging.</b>|$|E
50|$|TSAPI, {{short for}} Telephony Server Application Programming Interface, was a {{computer}} telephony integration standard developed and promoted by Novell and AT&T. It consisted {{of a number of}} call control commands for switching calls, voice mail and <b>call</b> <b>logging</b> using NetWare servers. Unlike the competing TAPI from Microsoft/Intel, TSAPI was a server-based system that did not expect client-side equipment to handle call switching. This was important to AT&T, who sold large telephone switches that TSAPI was intended to work with.|$|E
50|$|Studio- and {{otherwise}} professional-quality ¼"-width tapes thinner than long-play were not commercially available in either reel format. However some specialised applications, such as <b>call</b> <b>logging,</b> used ten-and-a-half or larger reels of double-play or thinner tape for extended recording times. These machines were extremely restricted in the reel sizes {{for which they}} were designed, and often had no rewind or fast forward facility at all, or even playback. These functions were instead performed on a dedicated machine in the event of playback being required.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a Palm system <b>call</b> <b>logging</b> tool called Palmist. Palmist allows the practitioner to selectively collect statistics {{such as the}} system call invoked, application that invoked the system call, {{the time of the}} call and the call arguments. The logging mechanism adds a latency of about 10 msec per call to collect the log. On an average, the system uses about 20 bytes of memory on the PDA to store the log record. The mechanism has limitations in collecting logs for system calls that are needed by the collection mechanism itself. Our logging mechanism works for about 80 % (707 of 881) of Palm OS 3. 5 system calls. Our system can be utilized by system developers to customize their application behavior to optimize system parameters such as energy consumption, ease of use etc. 1...|$|E
