25|$|At {{the age of}} 15, due to the {{frequency}} of performances at different venues (up to six venues per day) that she had, her voice was affected due {{to the development of}} nodules on her vocal chords. Following the advice of the doctor, she took a year off and to keep herself occupied, she attended art lessons with her cousin. After a year, she started performing again despite the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> vocal range, which lowered her voice by an octave (eight keys).|$|E
25|$|With Charlotte in Werther in 1974, Crespin began {{performing}} opera roles {{from the}} mezzo-soprano repertoire {{to adjust to}} the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> voice. However the timbre of her voice had not altered much from her earlier singing years and she therefore brought a different sound to the roles from that of the typical mezzo-soprano. Regardless, she was well received in her new choice of repertoire. This period also led to her interest in Offenbach and her sophisticated wit found its place in recordings of Métella, the Grand Duchess of Gérolstein and Périchole, along with Dulcinée (Massenet's Don Quichotte).|$|E
25|$|In Australia's {{constitutional}} system, one of {{the main}} duties of the Governor-General is to appoint a Prime Minister, who thereafter heads the Cabinet and advises the Governor-General on how to execute his or her executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs. This means that the monarch's and the viceroy's roles are primarily symbolic and cultural, acting {{as a symbol of the}} legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate. In practice, ministers direct the use of the royal prerogative that resides in the monarch, which includes the privilege to declare war, maintain peace, and direct the actions of the Australian Defence Force. The Governor-General is empowered by the constitution to summon and prorogue parliament, and call elections; however the powers are almost never exercised without advice from the Prime Minister. Still, the royal prerogative belongs to the Crown, and not to any of the ministers and the Governor-General may unilaterally use these powers in exceptional constitutional crisis situations, such as when, during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, Sir John Kerr dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, on the occasion of a stalemate over government funding between the House of Representatives and the Senate. There are also a few duties which must be specifically performed by the Queen. These include signing the appointment papers of Governors-General, the confirmation of the creation of awards of Australian honours, and the approval of any <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> Australian title.|$|E

25|$|Townspeople sing joyfully of {{the peace}} that will follow the {{imminent}} wedding of the prince of Mantua and the princess of Bavaria. Young people look forward to songs and dancing, {{and a group of}} prisoners released by the King celebrate. A group of impoverished students, Spark, Hartmann, Facio enter hoping also to share in some fun while contemptuous of the townspeople. The King and his guards emerge from the palace. The King announces the arrival of the prince of Mantua to wed his daughter Elsbeth and encourages the celebration. A courtier explains that Elsbeth is grieving on the death of the court jester of whom she was fond. Marinoni, the prince of Mantua's aide-de-camp enquires about the festivities and the princess, but is mocked by the students. Fantasio enters and sings a ballad to the moon. The page of Elsbeth enters to tell the students to keep their voices down as they will disturb the princess; they enter the tavern. Elsbeth sings of her wonder at the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life, but Fantasio enters unseen and asks her if she is really in love – with a complete stranger. Elsbeth, startled, leaves repeating Fantasio's words. When Spark joins his friend Fantasio talks extravagantly of his feelings. Soon the funeral cortege of court jester St Jean passes by and Fantasio has the idea to take the appearance of the jester {{to gain access to the}} princess, and he and Spark enter the nearby tailor's shop to get the costume. This will also help him avoid being arrested for his debts by the police. The fatuous prince of Mantua and his aide Marinoni enter, and the prince, wanting to discover the real thoughts and feelings of his future wife determines to dress as a servant to find out; he and Marinoni exit to exchange their clothes. The students come in singing and Fantasio re-appears dressed as the old jester. Two sentries mistakenly let him into the palace grounds and he looks forward to his adventure and to meeting Elsbeth again.|$|E

Although she had belonged to a local church as a child, Debra had become irreligious by 2001. After reading Yancey's book while she was alone on the ocean that Christmas, she said, [...] "I felt like God was there with me protecting me".

The album was preceded by a digital single, [...] "Winter Story", and marked a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> image, {{with an emphasis on}} being [...] "cute" [...] rather than [...] "sexy". Harisu charted at number 46 in Korea, and as with her previous album it was released in Taiwan and China with extra songs recorded in Mandarin.

In addition to collaborating with producer Nathan Chapman—who also recorded her first three albums—she worked with new producers, such as Dann Huff, Max Martin, and Shellback; {{the latter two}} also co-wrote the album with her.

After her departure, family adviser Baron Stockmar remarked of the affair thatt was not without great difficulty that the Prince succeeded in getting rid of [...] She was foolish enough to contest his influence, and not to conform herself to the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> position...

They feel I belong to them, and they feel a certain resentment - that I went to the other side. In calmer moments, of course, they know it isn't true, that I can do more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. In the movie business, as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna. She saves Universal a fortune...every day." ...|$|E
500|$|After Lourdes's birth, Madonna became {{involved}} in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, introduced to her by actress Sandra Bernhard. Her seventh studio album, Ray of Light, (1998) reflected this <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> perception and image. She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and {{wanted to create a}} sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit [...] "was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave was happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. That's not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, really. And William Orbit provided her with that." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Stokes died {{unexpectedly}} in 1962, {{an experience}} which left Constance bereft; a long-time friend {{said that she}} never really recovered. Faced with a substantial mortgage to service, Stokes returned to work: painting. Two years later, she opened her first one-woman show in over thirty years. It comprised 43 works, with the 27 paintings priced dearly, at upwards of 150 guineas. The exhibition was a success both financially and critically: Stokes earned over 4000 guineas, and the exhibition attracted praise from art historian and critic Bernard William Smith. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she painted and held shows; this later phase of her work {{was based on a}} stronger, if lighter, colour palette and reflected the influence of the art of Henri Matisse, whom Stokes admired. There was also a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> subject matter, from [...] "classically conceived" [...] still lifes, groups of figures and nudes, to more decorative themes. Stokes' works continued to be well received, having been included in the 1975 exhibition Australian women artists at the University of Melbourne, and the Regional Galleries Association of Victoria's 1977 touring exhibition The heroic years of Australian painting, 1940–1965. Stokes' last painting was Alice Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole, painted around 1989; she died in Melbourne in 1991.|$|E

500|$|In 1966, Lansbury took on {{the title}} role of Mame Dennis in the musical Mame, Jerry Herman's musical {{adaptation}} of the novel Auntie Mame. The director's first choice for the role had been Rosalind Russell, who played Mame in the non-musical film adaptation Auntie Mame, but she had declined. Lansbury actively sought the role {{in the hope that}} it would mark a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> career. When she was chosen, it came as a surprise to theatre critics, who believed that it would go to a better-known actress; Lansbury was forty-one years old, and it was her first starring role. Mame Dennis was a glamorous character, with over twenty costume changes throughout the play, and Lansbury's role involved ten songs and dance routines which she trained extensively for. First appearing in Philadelphia and then Boston, Mame opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in May 1966. Auntie Mame was already popular among the gay community, and Mame gained Lansbury a cult gay following, something that she later attributed to the fact that Mame Dennis was [...] "every gay person's idea of glamour... Everything about Mame coincided with every young man's idea of beauty and glory and it was lovely." ...|$|E
500|$|Jasmine {{demonstrates}} several traits, {{beliefs and}} ideologies associated with feminism, exercising much [...] "feminist potential", although notably less explicit than Belle's. Nonetheless, the character still adheres to traditional romance-oriented aspirations {{commonly associated with}} Disney's princess characters despite [...] "her modern, feminist attitude", although her yearning for romance is much more subdued in comparison. Steve Daly of Entertainment Weekly identified Jasmine as [...] "a sexually aware, proto-feminist princess". [...] "New" [...] Exoticisms: Changing Patterns in the Construction of Otherness author Isabel Santaolalla wrote that Jasmine appears to have inherited [...] "the legacy bequeathed by the 1960s Women's Movement." [...] Having [...] "stepped out of the 90s" [...] according to The Washington Posts Desson Howe, Jasmine is appropriately opposed to the glass ceiling." [...] Defying marriage laws and arranged marriages are also among Jasmine's central themes. Larkin believes that her character is responsible for inspiring a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> kingdom's marriage laws, explaining, [...] "Jasmine didn't just believe in something, she fought against something that she saw was an injustice... She actively sought change and made it happen." [...] Musker agreed that the princess [...] "rebel against the social structure in choosing to marry someone of her own free will". According to singer Brad Kane, who provides Aladdin's singing voice, [...] "Aladdin is a stealth feminist movie" [...] because Jasmine is [...] "willing to give up being a princess to not get stuck marrying someone." [...] Jasmine's defiance eventually successfully convinces her father to change the constitution.|$|E
500|$|Whereas most of {{the other}} female {{characters}} in EastEnders were portrayed in a somewhat more glamorous working class way, Pauline Fowler was the exception to the rule, being the sole character to represent the [...] "homely and domestic" [...] side of the Beale family. As the serial progressed, the character altered from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the show's early years, she became a sombre battle-axe, hardened by a life of misery in Albert Square. Other characters refer to her as [...] "Fowler the growler", and in the Evening Gazette she was described as [...] "the Boadicea of battle-axes." [...] The initial <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> demeanour is traced back to the death of her mother, Lou Beale (Anna Wing), a fierce dowager, who ruled over her family with a [...] "rod of iron". Following Lou's screen funeral in July 1988, Pauline retorts, [...] "Shut up Arthur Fowler, no one interrupts Pauline Beale when she's in full flow," [...] a line that was used similarly by Lou in the episode that preceded her own death. This parallel symbolised the transference of the family's matriarchal role from Lou to Pauline. Wendy Richard has indicated that both she and show creator, Julia Smith, had always intended for Pauline to become like her mother, and former EastEnders executive producer John Yorke has commented on the importance of the lineage between the two characters: [...] " [...] endures, stoically and heroically, whatever life may throw at her, just as her mother did before her. This sense of lineage is vitally important, too. Pauline has been in the show since its start and was handed the role of matriarch on Lou Beale's death." ...|$|E
