5|$|Finite {{symmetry}} {{groups such}} as the Mathieu groups are used in <b>coding</b> <b>theory,</b> which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.|$|E
5|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{matrices}} whose entries are real or complex numbers. However, matrices can be considered with much more general types of entries than real or complex numbers. As a first step of generalization, any field, that is, a set where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations are defined and well-behaved, may be used instead of R or C, for example rational numbers or finite fields. For example, <b>coding</b> <b>theory</b> makes use of matrices over finite fields. Wherever eigenvalues are considered, as these are roots of a polynomial they may exist only in a larger field {{than that of the}} entries of the matrix; for instance they may be complex in case of a matrix with real entries. The possibility to reinterpret the entries of a matrix as elements of a larger field (for example, to view a real matrix as a complex matrix whose entries happen to be all real) then allows considering each square matrix to possess a full set of eigenvalues. Alternatively one can consider only matrices with entries in an algebraically closed field, such as C, from the outset.|$|E

40|$|To {{generate}} great explanatory power, {{empirical research}} needs to be underpinned by powerful theory and take advantage of a full range of appropriate methodological approaches. There is a growing sentiment in educational research that this aim is best served by employing both qualitative and quantitative methods within a mixed-methods framework (Creswell 2 ̆ 6 Plano Clark, 2007). It is also thought that a mixed-methods approach can increase the opportunity of effectively communicating and collaborating within and between fields and thereby enable knowledge-building (Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Onwuegbuzie, 2004). Yet, the mixed-methods approach has tended to be underutilized in <b>code</b> <b>theory</b> research, which has typically employed qualitative and documentary methods. This paper explores both how mixed-methods research can be enacted in <b>code</b> <b>theory</b> and its value. Specifically it traces the development of a quantitative language of description that enacts <b>code</b> <b>theory</b> concepts and its use and evolution through several mixed-methods studies...|$|R
50|$|Gerry Philipsen (born 1944), Professor Emeritus of Communication at the University of Washington is an {{academic}} and theorists and ethnographer of communication. Philips research treats communicative acts as occurring within cultural, social and small group settings.

Speech <b>code</b> <b>theory</b> explores {{the manner in which}} groups communicate based on societal, cultural, gender, occupational or other factors. Philipsen received recognition for his lifetime achievement from the National Communication Association. Philipsen was born in Portland, Oregon in 1944.|$|R
25|$|Among current {{educational}} psychologists, {{the cognitive}} perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, {{perhaps because it}} admits causally related mental constructs such as traits, beliefs, memories, motivations and emotions. Cognitive theories claim that memory structures determine how information is perceived, processed, stored, retrieved and forgotten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by Allan Paivio's dual <b>coding</b> <b>theory.</b> Educational psychologists have used dual <b>coding</b> <b>theory</b> and cognitive load theory to explain how people learn from multimedia presentations.|$|E
25|$|In <b>coding</b> <b>theory,</b> burst error-{{correcting}} codes employ {{methods of}} correcting burst errors, which are errors {{that occur in}} many consecutive bits rather than occurring in bits independently of each other.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coding</b> <b>theory</b> is {{concerned}} with finding explicit methods, called codes, for increasing the efficiency and reducing the error rate of data communication over noisy channels to near the channel capacity. These codes can be roughly subdivided into data compression (source coding) and error-correction (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible. A third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both codes and ciphers). Concepts, methods and results from <b>coding</b> <b>theory</b> and information theory are widely used in cryptography and cryptanalysis. See the article ban (unit) for a historical application.|$|E

5000|$|According to Philipsen {{there are}} three {{defining}} characteristics of the speech <b>codes</b> <b>theory</b> and he illustrated these by referencing Carbaugh's previous study. The first characteristic being that speech codes are, [...] "grounded in the observation of communication conduct in particular times and places" [...] (Gudykunst, 2005). Speech <b>codes</b> <b>theory</b> is concerned about observing communication conduct through noticing, describing, interpreting and explaining the findings. The second is that speech codes present, [...] "a way to interpret or explain observed communicative conduct by reference to situated codes of meaning and value." [...] Different meanings are interpreted in multiple ways depending on that community's discursive life. The last characteristic is that this theory, [...] "provides a general understanding of communicative conduct." ...|$|R

In <b>coding</b> <b>theory,</b> many codes are constructed as subspaces of vector spaces over finite fields.|$|E
40|$|Leading {{theories}} of arithmetic cognition take {{a variety of}} positions regarding item formatting and its possible effects on encoding, retrieval, and calculation. The extent to which formats might require processing from domains other than mathematics (e. g., a language domain and/or an executive functioning domain) is unclear and an area in need of additional research. The {{purpose of the current}} study is to evaluate several leading {{theories of}} arithmetic cognition with attention to possible systematic measurement error associated with instrument formatting (method effects) and possible contributions of cognitive domains other than a quantitative domain that is specialized for numeric processing (trait effects). In order to simultaneously examine measurement methods and cognitive abilities, this research is approached from a multi-trait, multi-method factor analytic framework. A sample of 1959 3 rd grade students (age M= 103. 24 months, SD= 5. 41 months) were selected for the current study from the baseline time points of a larger, longitudinal study conducted in southeastern metropolitan school districts. Abstract <b>Code</b> <b>Theory,</b> Encoding Complex <b>Theory,</b> Triple <b>Code</b> <b>Theory,</b> and the Exact versus Approximate Calculations Hypothesis (a specification of Triple <b>Code</b> <b>Theory)</b> were evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis, using 11 measures of arithmetic with symbolic problem formats (e. g., Arabic numeral and language-based formats) and various problem demands (e. g., requiring both exact and approximate calculations). In general, results from this study provided support for both Triple <b>Code</b> <b>Theory</b> and Encoding Complex Theory, and to some extent, Exact Versus Approximate Calculations Theory is also supported. As predicted by Triple <b>Code</b> <b>Theory,</b> arithmetic outcomes with language formatting, Arabic numeral formatting, and estimation demands across formats were related but distinct from one another. The relationship between problems that required exact calculations (across formats) also provided support for Exact Versus Approximate Calculations Theory’s stipulation that exact calculation problems may draw from the same cognitive processes. As predicted by Encoding Complex Theory, executive function was a direct predictor of all arithmetic outcomes. Language was not a direct predictor of arithmetic outcomes; however, the relationship between language and executive function suggested that language may play a facilitative role in reasoning during numeric processing, particularly for language-formatted problems...|$|R
