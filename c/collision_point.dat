5|$|Specifically, the HPP lattice gas model {{consists}} of particles moving at unit velocity {{in the four}} axis-parallel directions. When two particles meet on the same line in opposite directions, they collide and are sent outwards from the <b>collision</b> <b>point</b> on the perpendicular line. This system obeys the conservation laws of physical gases, and produces simulations whose appearance resembles the behavior of physical gases. However, it was found to obey unrealistic additional conservation laws. For instance, the total momentum within any single line is conserved. As well, the differences between axis-parallel and non-axis-parallel directions in this model (its anisotropy) is undesirably high. The FHP lattice gas model improves the HPP model by having particles moving in six different directions, at 60 degree angles to each other, instead of only four directions. In any head-on collision, the two outgoing particles are deflected at 60 degree angles from the two incoming particles. Three-way collisions are also possible in the FHP model and are handled {{in a way that}} both preserves total momentum and avoids the unphysical added conservation laws of the HPP model.|$|E

A billiard-ball computer consists of a system of synchronized particles (the billiard balls) moving in tracks and guided by a fixed set of obstacles. When the particles collide with each other or with the obstacles, they undergo an elastic collision much as real billiard balls would do. The input to the computer is encoded using {{the presence or absence of}} particles on certain input tracks, and its output is similarly encoded using the presence or absence of particles on output tracks. The tracks themselves may be envisioned as wires, and the particles as being Boolean signals transported on those wires. When a particle hits an obstacle, it reflects from it. This reflection may be interpreted as a change in direction of the wire the particle is following. Two particles on different tracks may collide, forming a logic gate at their <b>collision</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

40|$|Maintaining head-on {{collisions}} {{over many}} hours {{is an important}} aspect of optimizing the performance of a collider. For current LHC operation where the beam optics is fixed during periods of colliding beam, mainly ground motion induced perturbations have to be compensated. The situation will become significantly more complex when luminosity leveling will be applied following the LHC luminosity upgrades. During β^{*} leveling the optics in the interaction region changes significantly, feed-downs from quadrupole misalignment may induce significant orbit changes that may lead to beam offsets at the <b>collision</b> <b>points.</b> Such beam offsets induce a loss of luminosity and reduce the stability margins for collective effects that is provided by head-on beam-beam. It is therefore essential that the beam offsets at the <b>collision</b> <b>points</b> are minimized during the leveling process. This paper will review sources and mitigation techniques for the orbit perturbation at the <b>collision</b> <b>points</b> during β^{*} leveling, and present results of experiments performed at the LHC to mitigate and compensate such offsets...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between enhancement of H^- negative ion volume production {{and behaviors of}} fast primary electros are studied. Trajectories of fast primary electrons are calculated numerically, including collisional effects with hydrogen molecules. Taking into account our experimental study, following two main targets are discussed: (1) Effect of field intensity of the magnetic filter (MF) and a filament position on active region of fast primary electrons, and (2) combination effect of the field intensity of the MF and the filament position for controlling behaviors of fast electrons. Active region of fast electrons depends strongly on the field intensity of the MF and filament position. Therefore, spatial distributions of ionization and vibrational excitation <b>collision</b> <b>points</b> are also changed {{in the same manner}} although number of vibrational excitation <b>collision</b> <b>points</b> is lower than that of ionization <b>collision</b> <b>points</b> due to longer mean free path. According to the results and discussions including transport of produced vibrationally excited molecules and H^- ions, for enhancement of H^- production, it is desired that fast electrons should approach the MF position and move into the downstream region as deep as possible without destruction of H^- ions. To realize these conditions, good combination between filament position and the intensity of the MF should be required...|$|R
