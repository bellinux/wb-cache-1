5|$|A {{social control}} program was {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, {{they hoped to}} remove the need for military and police intervention, and thus stem the violence of previous decades. Measures were implemented to ensure the industrialization of <b>coca</b> production, with Morales inaugurating the first <b>coca</b> industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged <b>coca</b> and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E
5|$|These {{industrialization}} measures proved largely unsuccessful {{given that}} <b>coca</b> remained illegal in most nations outside Bolivia, thus depriving the growers {{of an international}} market. Campaigning against this, in 2012 Bolivia withdrew from the UN 1961 Convention which had called for global criminalisation of <b>coca,</b> and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to declassify <b>coca</b> as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticised Bolivia, asserting that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to Bolivia to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of cocaine seizures in Bolivia increased under Morales' government, as they sought to encourage <b>coca</b> growers to report and oppose cocaine producers and traffickers. However, high levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in cocaine remained a continuing problem for Bolivia.|$|E

5|$|Pesticides {{derived from}} plants include nicotine, rotenone, {{strychnine}} and pyrethrins. Plants such as tobacco, cannabis, opium poppy, and <b>coca</b> yield psychotropic chemicals.

5|$|Born to an Aymara {{family of}} {{subsistence}} farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a basic education before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to Chapare Province. Growing <b>coca</b> {{and becoming a}} trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the campesino ("rural laborers") union. In that capacity he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to eradicate <b>coca</b> {{as part of the}} War on Drugs, denouncing these as an imperialist violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government direct action protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS and was elected to Congress. His campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the Cochabamba protests and gas conflict. In 2002 he was expelled from Congress for encouraging protesters, although he came second in that year's presidential election.|$|E
5|$|In the Andes {{region of}} South America, with civilizations {{including}} the Inca, the major crop was the potato, domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago. <b>Coca,</b> still a major crop to this day, was domesticated in the Andes, {{as were the}} peanut, tomato, tobacco, and pineapple. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Animals were also domesticated, including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{new plant}} {{medicines}} arrived in Europe as products of Early Modern exploration {{and the resulting}} Columbian Exchange, in which livestock, crops and technologies were transferred between the Old World and the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. Medicinal herbs arriving in the Americas included garlic, ginger, and turmeric; coffee, tobacco and <b>coca</b> travelled in the other direction.|$|E
5|$|Variations of the pisco sour {{exist in}} Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. There are adaptations of the {{cocktail}} in Peru using fruits such as maracuya, aguaymanto, and apples, or traditional ingredients {{such as the}} <b>coca</b> leaf. In Chile, variants include the Ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with mango juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the Yunqueño variant (from its Yungas region) replaces the lime with orange juice.|$|E

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and <b>coca</b> had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Evo {{returned to his}} family, who had escaped the agricultural devastation of 1980's El Niño storm cycle by relocating to the Tropics of Cochabamba in the eastern lowlands. Setting up home {{in the town of}} Villa 14 de Septiembre, El Chapare, using a loan from Evo's maternal uncle, the family cleared a plot of land in the forest to grow rice, oranges, grapefruit, papaya, bananas and later on <b>coca.</b> It was here that Morales learned to speak Quechua, the indigenous local language. The arrival of the Morales family was a part of a much wider migration to the region; in 1981 El Chapare's population was 40,000 but by 1988 it had risen to 215,000. Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing <b>coca,</b> which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in cocaine. Evo joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2nd Central Tournament. The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.|$|E
5|$|From 1984 to 1991 the sindicatos {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} protests against the forced eradication of <b>coca</b> by occupying local government offices, setting up roadblocks, going on hunger strike, and organizing mass marches and demonstrations. Morales was personally involved in this direct activism and in 1984 was present at a roadblock where 3 campesinos were killed. In 1988, Morales was elected to the position of Executive Secretary of the Federation of the Tropics. In 1989 he spoke at a one-year commemoratory event of the Villa Tunari massacre in which 11 <b>coca</b> farmers had been killed by agents of the Rural Area Mobile Patrol Unit (Unidad Móvil Policial para Áreas Rurales – UMOPAR). The following day, UMOPAR agents beat Morales up, leaving him in the mountains to die, but he was rescued by other union members. To combat this violence, Morales concluded that an armed cocalero militia could launch a guerrilla war against the government, but he was soon persuaded on an electoral path to change instead. In 1992, he made various international trips to champion the cocalero cause, speaking at a conference in Cuba, and also traveling to Canada, during which he learned of his mother's death.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards. His supporters have lauded him {{as a champion of}} indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing to live up to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of <b>coca</b> contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|The Ashaninkas were {{pressured}} to begin growing <b>coca</b> as cocaine trafficking increased in Peru {{by the early}} 1980s. Gagnon {{said that he would}} leave the mission if the people entered the cocaine trade, and no one chose to change their way of life. As the trade grew in the area, though, Gagnon talked to a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent and {{sent a letter to the}} Peruvian security police base commander in Mazamari in 1983. Gagnon was told, and heeded the advice of two drug traffickers, not make any further overtures about the cocaine trade.|$|E

5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as <b>coca</b> leaves.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{the demand}} for soft drinks {{significantly}} increased {{as a result of}} the prohibition against alcohol in the United States that began on January 29, 1920. The Grapico product was so successful by 1920, that Grapico specifically was listed in the Louisiana law among generic items, Coca-Cola, and RC Cola as items to be taxed: Section 22 of Act No. 233 of 1920, which read:That all persons, associations of persons, firms and corporations engaged in the sale of soda water, ice cream, confections, soda pop, <b>Coca</b> Cola, Chero-Cola, Grapico or other similar soft drinks or beverages or refreshments, shall pay license based on the gross annual sales, and such licenses are hereby fixed and graded as follows.|$|E
5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by <b>Coca</b> Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate advertising costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% of restaurant operating funds (ROF) paid by the two beverage suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the corporate advertising budget. These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These funds often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset other costs imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants are the source of many psychoactive drugs, some such as <b>coca</b> known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as Psilocybe and fly agaric mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.|$|E
25|$|Colombia {{continues}} to be the world's single largest producer of cocaine and <b>coca</b> leaves. The land area under <b>coca</b> cultivation has decreased from over 140,000 hectares in 2001 due to aerial <b>coca</b> eradication and manual eradication, but there has been an increase in <b>coca</b> cultivation since 2013, with 96,000 hectares under <b>coca</b> cultivation in 2015 according to the latest United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report, representing a 39% increase on the previous year. The majority (81%) of <b>coca</b> cultivation is concentrated in three southern departments (Nariño, Cauca, Putumayo, Caquetá) and in Norte de Santander Department, which are also regions with a substantial FARC presence. The UNODC suggests that different negotiations on the issue, in Havana and other settings, are generating incentives for increased <b>coca</b> cultivation because of the perception that the benefits of development projects would mainly be directed at <b>coca</b> cultivators.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{biochemical}} {{analysis of}} la doncellas hair, {{the children were}} drugged with alcohol and <b>coca</b> {{before the start of}} the sacrificial ritual. La Doncella had been drugged by <b>coca</b> leaves and a maize beer known as chicha. Though all three of the sacrifices consumed significant amounts of these substances prior to the ritual, a hair sample analysis shows that la doncella consumed significantly more <b>coca</b> and alcohol than either el niño or la niña del rayo. Her hair contained the highest concentration of <b>coca</b> ever found in Andean human remains.|$|E

25|$|Toledo {{walked a}} thin line in {{responding}} to both U.S. pressure to severely limit coca-production and protests by <b>coca</b> farmers against the eradication of <b>coca</b> production in poor, rural areas, {{where the majority of}} the population is involved in that business. The presumed link between the Shining Path and narcotics trafficking was unclear, because the <b>coca</b> farmers gave most of their crops to drug traffickers who then paid the Shining Path to operate within certain regions.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Stepan Company is {{the only}} {{manufacturing}} plant authorized by the Federal Government to import and process the <b>coca</b> plant, which it obtains mainly from Peru and, to a lesser extent, Bolivia. Besides producing the <b>coca</b> flavoring agent for Coca-Cola, the Stepan Company extracts cocaine from the <b>coca</b> leaves, which it sells to Mallinckrodt, a St. Louis, Missouri, pharmaceutical manufacturer that {{is the only}} company in the United States licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal use.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} {{purchased}} by SABMiller in 2009. In 2011, SABMiller invested around USD $20 million modernizing the bottling plant and operations. After these improvements, the plant produced 40,000 glass bottles hourly. Previous output was approximately 12,000 bottles per hour. In November 2014, Ambo Mineral Water was jointly purchased by SABMiller PLC and SouthWest Development, with plans to join <b>Coca</b> Cola as SABMiller. During this time, {{it was announced that}} <b>Coca</b> Cola Company and <b>Coca</b> Cola Sabco were going to form a new company named Coca-Cola Beverages Africa.

25|$|Recognizing {{the drug}} trade {{as a threat to}} {{regional}} security, Toledo sought to create a common Andean approach to the drug war. He saw that revenue from drug trafficking funded terrorist activities, but also that U.S. insistence on the eradication of <b>coca</b> crops failed to address the problem. Alternative crop programs were also being resisted by <b>coca</b> farmers who depended on the <b>coca</b> trade for their livelihood. At a meeting of the 19-member Rio group in May 2003, Toledo proposed developing a joint strategy to deal with drug trafficking, but pressure from Washington, which preferred bilateral efforts, helped kill the notion.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} temperance movement {{prohibited the}} use of alcohol and heavily criticized medicinal wine such as French Wine <b>Coca.</b> Pemberton was forced to drop the wine ingredient in his French Wine <b>Coca.</b> After some further experimenting, he decided on the use sugar syrup as a substitution for the wine {{and that is when}} Coca-Cola was born.|$|E
25|$|Escobar {{quickly became}} known internationally as his drug network gained notoriety; the Medellín Cartel {{controlled}} {{a large portion}} of the drugs that entered the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Spain. The production process was also altered, with <b>coca</b> from Bolivia and Peru replacing the <b>coca</b> from Colombia, which was beginning to be seen as substandard quality than the <b>coca</b> from the neighboring countries. As demand for more and better cocaine increased, Escobar began working with Roberto Suárez Goméz, helping to further the product to other countries in the Americas and Europe, as well as being rumored to reach as far as Asia.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} of Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has resisted criticism of aerial spraying of <b>coca</b> and poppy and has seen major reductions in both crops {{according to the}} United Nations Office of Crime and Drugs (See also Plan Colombia). In 2003, over 1,300 square kilometers of mature <b>coca</b> were sprayed and eradicated in Colombia, where {{at the start of}} the year, approximately 1,450 square kilometers had been planted. This strategic accomplishment prevented the production over 500 tonnes of cocaine, sufficient to supply all the cocaine users in both US and Europe for one year. Further, it eliminated upward of $100 million of illicit income in Colombia. No effect on prices or availability in the marketplace has been noted, and the actual number of acres of <b>coca</b> planted seems to have actually increased, largely shifting to more remote areas or into neighboring countries. Aerial spraying also has the unintended consequence of destroying legitimate crop fields in the process.|$|E
