40|$|Civic {{participation}} {{of young people}} around the world is routinely described in deficit terms, as they are labelled apathetic, devoid of political knowledge, disengaged from the community and self-absorbed (Andolina, 2002; Weller, 2006). This paper argues that the connectivity of time, space and social values (Lefebvre, 1991; Soja, 1996) are integral to understanding the performances of young people as civic subjects. Today’s youth negotiate unstable social, economic and environmental conditions, new technologies and new forms of <b>community.</b> <b>Loyalty,</b> citizenship and notions of belonging take on new meanings in these changing global conditions. Using the socio-spatial theories of Lefebvre and Foucault, and the tools of critical discourse analysis, this paper argues that the chronotope, or time/space relationship of universities, produces student citizens who, in resistance to a complex global society, create a cocooned space which focuses on moral and spiritual values that can be enacted on a personal level...|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction. The European Court of Justice, partly {{followed}} in this by the European legislator, has regulated Community {{law and policy}} {{through a set of}} general principles of law. For the Community legal order in the first pillar, general legal principles have developed from functional policy areas such as the internal market, the customs union, the monetary union, the common agricultural policy, the European competition policy, etc., which are of great importance for the quality and legitimacy of Community law. The principles in question are not so much general legal principles of an institutional character, such as the priority of Community law, direct effect or <b>Community</b> <b>loyalty,</b> but rather principles of law which shape the fundamental rights and basic rights of the citizen. I refer to the principle of legality, of nulla poena, the inviolability of the home, the nemo tenetur principle, due process, the rights of the defence, etc. Many of these legal principles have been elevated to primary Community law status by the European Court of Justice, often as a result of preliminary questions. Nevertheless, a considerable number of them have also been elaborated in the context of contentious proceedings before the Court of Justice, such as in the framework of European competition law and European public servants law...|$|E

Implementation and maintenance {{at the level of}} the Member States of inconsistent acts with EU law affect the obligation of <b>community</b> <b>loyalty</b> and ensure the full effectiveness of EU law which rests on their failure could result in an action of breaching community obligations. Revocation is the legal transaction that the issuer has withdrawn its own body act on its own initiative or pursuant to the provisions of the superior authority. The disappearance of the illegal administrative act of domestic law doesn’t necessarily involve restoring legality community as for this may be necessary the adoption of a new act. While acknowledging the procedural autonomy of the member states, the European Union law requires that national administrative rules concerning the acts revoking to respect two of its general principles - the principle of legal certainty and legitimate expectations principle, which can cause a number of complications, constraints on public administrations.

40|$|Within rural studies {{there have}} been few {{attempts}} to critically analyse crimes against nature. This paper addresses this gap by providing an analysis of farmers’ reasons for illegally culling badgers in the United Kingdom. Drawing on Sykes and Matza’s (1957) concepts of neutralisation and drift, the paper shows how farmers rationalise this activity. Using in-depth interviews with 61 farmers in the England and Wales, the paper shows how they justify badger culling through discursive strategies that claim the activity is necessary, deny the necessity of the law, condemning the condemners, and appealing to <b>community</b> <b>loyalties</b> The paper also shows that neutralisation helps identify contextual factors that allow farmers to drift ambiguously between deviant values and social norms. In the case of badger culling, drift is attributable to an attack on a particular rural identity and way of living that has left farmers perceiving their selves as an effect. As much as they are attempts to rationalise criminal behaviour, neutralisation techniques can also be seen as spatial discourses demarcating the boundaries of cultural and spatial identities. In conclusion, the paper discusses the implications for resolving the problems of wildlife crime...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{some of the}} {{characteristics}} of traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural practices that contribute to effective family functioning, and how these practices can have positive effects on children and communities. The approach is to gather the views of Aboriginal families and compare these perspectives with supporting evidence drawn from the literature. The findings suggest that, provided the necessary social conditions are in place, culture can be a protective force for children, families and communities. Key Messages 	Aboriginal kinship relations reflect a complex and dynamic system that is not captured by existing non- Indigenous definitions of family. 	Emerging evidence supports some of the strengths of traditional Aboriginal culture in family functioning and raising children, yet conventional academic wisdom can be incompatible with traditional Aboriginal knowledge systems. 	The strengths of Aboriginal cultural traditions, as they apply to family life and raising children, revolve around four interrelated themes, including: –    Theme 1 : A collective community focus on child rearing helps children—The values of interdependence, group cohesion and <b>community</b> <b>loyalty</b> are key features of Aboriginal family and community life, where raising children {{is considered to be a}} shared responsibility of all community members. –    Theme 2 : Children need the freedom to explore and experience the world—Aboriginal communities offer their children every opportunity to explore the world around them, to help them develop the necessary skills to successfully negotiate their pathways to adulthood. –    Theme 3 : Elderly family members are important to family functioning—The elderly are highly respected for their contributions to family life in Aboriginal communities, particularly in helping children to understand the practical aspects of life and society. –    Theme 4 : Spirituality helps families cope with challenges—Families and communities who engage in spiritual practices benefit from a greater sense of identity, and individuals are more likely to connect with, support and help protect one another...|$|E
40|$|Feminist epistemologists {{have often}} argued that our {{relationships}} with structures of power shape the content, expression, and social force {{of what we}} know. While feminist standpoint theorists have often maintained that experiences {{on the margins of}} social power can lead to better understandings of the roles of systems of oppression in society, more recent writings on epistemologies of ignorance examine the reverse, how experiences from positions of social power limit our understandings. In this project, I draw on the concept of epistemic privilege as it has been formulated by feminist standpoint theorists, criticisms of objectivity and fixed, transcendent truths, and analyses of the relationships between structures of power and concepts of knowing. By considering the works of Sandra Harding, Lorraine Code, and Patricia Hill Collins, among others, I argue that knowledge is situational and contingent and that some individuals possess privileged understandings due to their positions on the margins of power structures. However, I also argue that, in order for feminist epistemology to utilize the concept of epistemic privilege successfully, it must incorporate a concept of error into its considerations of constructions of knowledge. Thus, throughout this dissertation, I examine how a concept of error could bolster efforts to subvert the dominant approaches to knowledge that have upheld male privilege and undermine the patriarchal power structures that rely on them. I propose a form of feminist inquiry that incorporates a method of error sensitivity, which will enable inquirers to recognize when institutions of power, individual limitations, and cultural myths are restricting knowing subjects' perspectives and leading them to commit errors. This concept of error, and the related approach to error-sensitive inquiry, relies upon a commitment to continuous and ever-expanding inquiry by a community, rather than an isolated individual. Thus, I derive much of my conceptual framework from the work of Josiah Royce and his concepts of the Beloved <b>Community,</b> <b>loyalty</b> to loyalty, and communities of interpretation...|$|E

This thesis examines online news consumption and customer loyalty to online news websites. Using the underlying theoretical perspective developed from the debate between social constructionist and technical determinist stances in technology acceptance and usage, this thesis examines the application of domestication theory to online news service consumption and loyalty. Based on loyalty literature and the conjecture from Oliver (1999) that customers can be enveloped in a <b>community</b> of <b>loyalty</b> which will aid and direct their (purchase) decisions, this thesis additionally looks into the role of an online news site’s <b>community</b> in fostering <b>loyalty.</b> A research model to test the effect of online community participation on the previously empirically supported link between perceived value and loyalty was created. Constructs to support the community variable were derived from literature and refined through exploratory research and are introduced in this thesis. Furthermore, measures for domestication stages were derived from the literature and further developed through exploratory research with online news site users and are also introduced in this research. This research examines the use of domestication theory in understanding news service consumption and adds to the growing body of domestication literature as well as adding to the emerging literature on, and increasing the understanding of acceptance and usage of online news services. The study helps to close a gap in the literature by employing a perceived value – <b>community</b> – <b>loyalty</b> model to identify which perceived value components have an influence on user loyalty to online news services.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{a selected}} group of Saskatchewan service centers {{in order to}} isolate factors which contributed to their growth or decline. The objectives {{of the study were}} formulated around the basic hypothesis that the growth of a center is influenced by identifiable factors which may be common to centers or unique to particular centers. The analysis was intended to provide insights into the process of growth by quantifying and testing relationships between the population of rural service centers and various conceptually, significant variables. The centers studied included all of the incorporated Sask­atchewan centers with 1951 census populations between 500 and 2, 500. This consisted of 74 centers. From 1951 to 1971 the populations of 14 of these centers had declined, while 60 had increased. The study included a review of selected, research literature devoted to the study of rural service centers, detailed case studies of two pairs of service centers, and simple and multiple regression analyses of selected secondary data. The service centers chosen for the case studies were Leader-Prelate and Balcarres-Lemberg. These centers were chosen because of their similarity with respect to location and size in 1951. A field survey was employed and personal interviews were obtained from civic officials and businessmen as a means of gaining insights into the process of growth of the centers studied as cases. The main conclusions of the study were that the centers studied competed with each other as well as with other centers for the business of a declining rural population, and that larger centers had a competitive advantage in the provision of commercial, public and community services such as hospitals, schools and other local amenities. With these advantages the larger centers were able to attract more business and new residents from surrounding areas. The analysis further indicated that centers which were situated at the junction of two highways, were located at a greater distance from their competitors, or whose population was largely in the labor force age categories, tended to remain relatively larger and more stable over the period. Factors such as community leadership, <b>community</b> <b>loyalty,</b> and active, community-minded people were indicated as having a positive impact on the growth of the centers studied. Also very important were the administrative decisions of policy makers with respect to such things as the location of schools, hospitals and highways. The limitations of the study suggested the need for a broader data base which would permit a more comprehensive study in terms of variables considered and the number of centers included. Also, there would be merit in testing the usefulness of additional analytical techniques such as simulation, logit analysis and discriminant analysis. The findings of this study should be useful to policy makers who are concerned about the well-being and further development of service centers. This is especially important in light of the significance of decisions of senior and local governments regarding the provision of services, facilities and amenities in a center. Hopefully the study has made a significant contribution to the body of knowledge regarding service center growth and viability...|$|E
