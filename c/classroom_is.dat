25|$|Unlike fashion {{modeling}}, modeling in an {{art school}} <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> {{for the purpose of}} learning how to draw humans of different shapes, ages, and ethnicity. Obese models may be in demand by experienced artists.|$|E
25|$|Icons {{throughout}} the building were painted by Mother Raphael Schweda. The chapel remains largely unaltered since its completion in 1927. Mother Raphael's fifth-floor <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> now {{an art gallery}} featuring many of her works, which include portraits, religious images, and floral paintings.|$|E
25|$|As each episode begins, viewers {{hear the}} school children, off-screen, leaving {{school at the}} end of the day. They say goodbye to the {{classroom}} pets. Once the <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> vacant, a pencil holder rattles to create the ringing of a telephone. Often, the classroom will be decorated with student artwork or other items related to the storyline, particular animal or geographic location of that episode.|$|E
50|$|In 1919, {{the average}} {{enrollment}} of students per <b>classroom</b> <b>was</b> 44; in 1953, the average enrollment of students per <b>classroom</b> <b>was</b> 30; and in 2002, the average enrollment of students per <b>classroom</b> <b>was</b> 20.|$|R
50|$|In 1959 a new wing {{with six}} <b>classrooms</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} and two further <b>classrooms</b> <b>were</b> added in 1968-1969. When the new <b>classrooms</b> <b>were</b> built, the original school building was converted {{to convert to}} administrative use, a library and music rooms.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, facing space shortages, {{portable}} <b>classrooms</b> <b>were</b> {{built on}} the current location of the [...] "F-wing". In 2001, these <b>classrooms</b> <b>were</b> destroyed and replaced with new portable <b>classrooms</b> which <b>were</b> built in 2002 and opened {{in the back of}} the current [...] "E-wing". These classrooms served as temporary space, while four new permanent <b>classrooms</b> <b>were</b> constructed on the site of the destroyed portables at a cost of $1 million. The new <b>classrooms</b> <b>were</b> completed in 2004 and were shortly thereafter known as the [...] "F-wing".|$|R
25|$|The Education (Scotland) Act 1872, which {{completely}} ignored Gaelic, {{and led to}} {{generations of}} Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the <b>classroom,</b> <b>is</b> now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living can recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school. Even later, when these attitudes had changed, little provision was made for Gaelic medium education in Scottish schools. As late as 1958, even in Highland schools, only 20% of primary students were taught Gaelic as a subject, and only 5% were taught other subjects through the Gaelic language.|$|E
25|$|Student {{involvement}} in the <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> {{a key part of}} OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{only part}} of the {{building}} was given to the school; in other parts there remained tenants, a separate music school, kindergarten, and a wind band. On 1 August 1935, the entirety of the building was given over to the secondary school. Year by year, the building was improved. During the 1937/38 school year the school received a gym, which was expanded to include dressing rooms and work-out rooms. When the gym was built {{at the back of the}} school's property, it abutted another outlying building belonging to the school. This small house, formerly used as teachers' quarters, and now home to the P.E. offices and a <b>classroom,</b> <b>is</b> also under historical preservation due to it being the birthplace of Dr. Kálmán Balogh, a famous Hungarian pharmaceutical scientist. The roof of the gym was renovated in 2008.|$|E

50|$|In 1921 a <b>classroom</b> <b>was</b> {{added to}} the {{northwest}} of the 1867 building. A new <b>classroom</b> <b>was</b> also {{added to the}} north side of the 1874 building at this time.|$|R
25|$|Before the $2.9 million {{facility}} {{opened in}} September 1965, the district received a $12,000 grant from {{a unit of}} the Ford Foundation that would allow the school to use IT computer systems run by a senior program analyst from that firm that would allow students to select classes on their own, with a system of folding walls that could be adjusted to handle student groups of varying sizes. The school spent its first five decades relatively unchanged in terms of architecture. In 2006, an extra gym was added. Most recently, the new science wing was opened as well as a new entrance building. This school {{is one of the first}} locally to provide every student with a laptop, which can be taken home, and be used in school everyday. Every <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> fitted with a wireless access point (IEEE 802.11 a/g/n), which provides the students with internet. For the 2007-08 school year, the school upgraded all the laptop computers to Apple MacBooks.|$|E

50|$|Establishment of {{the school}} was {{approved}} on 15 January 1981, and the opening ceremony was held on 5 March 1981. On 21 January 1998 the multimedia <b>classroom</b> <b>was</b> completed, and on 21 August 2009 the English <b>classroom</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|R
50|$|The campus {{infrastructure}} boasts {{state of}} the art technology. <b>Classrooms</b> <b>are</b> equipped with smart interactive boards, videoconferencing facilities. <b>Classrooms</b> <b>are</b> also equipped with high-speed Wi-Fi and LAN networks. Student assignments and exams are handled on Moodle, a learning management system.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are about}} 38-39 classrooms. Every <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> {{equipped}} with an interactive board and a projector where teachers can show slides and PowerPoint presentations, movies, videos, etc. There is a cafeteria serving nutritious and tasty food, for use for both staff faculty and students.|$|E
2500|$|Soil-based {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} serve as educational tools, as they encompass multiple [...] scientific disciplines (microbiology, geochemistry, electrical engineering, etc.) {{and can be}} made using commonly available materials, such as soils and items from the refrigerator. Kits for home science projects and classrooms are available. One example of microbial fuel cells {{being used in the}} <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> in the IBET (Integrated Biology, English, and Technology) curriculum for Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{the school}} {{received}} {{a grant from}} the Iowa Department of Management to construct the first Arbor Day-certified Nature Explore classroom in southeast Iowa. A Nature Explore <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> a model outdoor classroom for nature-based learning, designed to connect children to nature. Maharishi School [...] "has access to large recreation facilities" [...] at MUM including a [...] "climbing wall, indoor track, cardio and weight training, tennis courts and a swimming pool."

2500|$|Students {{sometimes}} resist critical pedagogy. Student {{resistance to}} critical pedagogy {{can be attributed}} to a variety of reasons. Student objections may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: [...] "Resistance in this context thus occurs when students are asked to shift not only their perspectives, but also their subjectivities as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed." [...] Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or ideologies, introduced in the <b>classroom,</b> <b>is</b> a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Trinity Western {{launched}} a teaching certification program, but the British Columbia College of Teachers denied accreditation of the university's program, {{arguing that the}} [...] "Responsibilities of Membership" [...] agreement students must sign (replaced in 2009 with the Community Covenant) is discriminatory and that those graduating from Trinity Western's program will discriminate against gay students. The lower courts in British Columbia and, later, the Supreme Court of Canada, ruled in favour of Trinity Western University, stating {{that there was no}} basis for the BCCT's decision, and, moreover, that [...] "the concern that graduates of TWU will act in a detrimental fashion in the <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> not supported by any evidence".|$|E
2500|$|Waldorf preschools {{employ a}} regular daily routine that {{includes}} free play, artistic work (e.g. drawing, painting or modeling), circle time (songs, games, and stories), outdoor recess, and practical tasks (e.g. cooking, cleaning, and gardening), with rhythmic variations. Periods of outdoor recess are also usually included. The <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> intended {{to resemble a}} home, with tools and toys usually sourced from simple, natural materials that lend themselves to imaginative play. The use of natural materials has been widely praised as fulfilling children's aesthetic needs, encouraging their imagination, and reinforcing their identification with nature, though one pair of reviewers questioned whether the preference for natural, non-manufactured materials is [...] "a reaction against the dehumanizing aspects of nineteenth-century industrialization" [...] rather than a [...] "reasoned assessment of twenty-first century children's needs".|$|E
50|$|The school {{opened its}} new doors on 5 January 1971 and had 69 pupils on roll. Almost {{immediately}} a third <b>classroom</b> <b>was</b> needed as pupil numbers rose {{in line with}} a general local trend and in the following years two further mobile <b>classrooms</b> <b>were</b> added.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} research {{carried out in the}} past 40 years into various aspects of noise in open plan classrooms. The emergence of open plan classroom design in response to progressive educational reforms is discussed. A limited amount of evidence of the effects of noise in open plan <b>classrooms</b> <b>is</b> presented. Surveys of both background and intrusive noise levels in open plan <b>classrooms</b> <b>are</b> summarized and compared. Differences between noise levels in open plan and enclosed <b>classrooms</b> <b>are</b> also considered. Recommended noise limits and acoustic design criteria for open plan <b>classrooms</b> <b>are</b> discussed, together with some current international standards. The paper concludes with a discussion of appropriate noise control measures to reduce noise and maximize speech intelligibility and speech privacy in open plan classrooms...|$|R
2500|$|The {{choice to}} {{integrate}} multimodal {{forms in the}} <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> not accepted unproblematically by everyone in educational communities. In Charles Bazerman’s essay, “The Case for Writing Studies as a Major Discipline,” he states “multimodal compositions are seen in the classrooms across the country {{but there seems to}} be a lack of support from the institutions to advance what the instructors are bringing into the classroom." [...] The idea of learning has changed over the years and now, some argue, must adapt to the personal and affective needs of new students. According to Kress and Bezemer, “education has to accommodate to ‘life-long’, ‘life-wide’ learning, that is, learning at all times, by those who demand that their interests be taken with utmost seriousness, in all sites, in all phases of professional and personal life.” As a result, some administrations may be reluctant to institute wide-spread change without assurance of results. In order for classroom communities to be legitimately multimodal, all members of the community must share expectations about what can be done with through integration, requiring a [...] "shift in many educators’ thinking about what constitutes literacy teaching and learning in a world no longer bounded only by print text." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{variation}} in scores {{from year to}} year and from class to class. [...] This variation is similar to performance measures in other fields, such as Major League Baseball and thus may reflect real, natural variations in the teacher's performance. [...] Because of this variation, scores are most accurate if they are derived from a large number of students (typically 50 or more). [...] As a result, it is difficult to use this model to evaluate first-year teachers, especially in elementary school, as they may have only taught 20 students. [...] A ranking based on a single <b>classroom</b> <b>is</b> likely to classify the teacher correctly about 65% of the time. [...] This number rises to 88% if ten years' data are available. [...] Additionally, because the confidence interval is wide, the method is most reliable when identifying teachers who are consistently in the top or bottom 10%, rather than trying to draw fine distinctions between teachers that produce more or less typical achievements, such as attempting to determine whether a teacher should be rated as being slightly above or slightly below the median.|$|E
