5000|$|Egbert H. Gold {{was born}} in 1868 in Cornwall, Connecticut. His family had been {{designers}} and manufacturers of steam heating systems; Gold's father invented the first <b>cast-iron</b> <b>radiator.</b> Gold went into the family business, but in 1901 struck {{out on his own}} and established a company based in Chicago. In 1913, while yachting with his wife Margaret, Gold anchored in Lake Macatawa and went ashore to explore this peninsula. Seeing potential in the land, he purchased the property in December of that year. He had the land built up, and in 1913 began construction of a lodge on the property. Gold hired architect Thomas Eddy Tallmadge to design the lodge, and H. D. Deam to build it. He named the property [...] "Marigold" [...] after his wife Margaret and daughter Mary Jayne.|$|E

Simulation results quantitatively indicate the variation of heating effect with radiator type (<b>cast-iron</b> <b>radiator,</b> steel radiator and copper-aluminium radiator), radiator size and water flow rate. Moreover, {{the negative impact of}} water flow rate under design value on indoor thermal environment has been highlighted, by which the suggestion to have better understanding about the hydraulic misadjustment degree of heat pipeline has been given. Additionally, <b>cast-iron</b> <b>radiator</b> has been demonstrated to be better than the new type of copper-aluminium radiator in terms of room air temperature...|$|E

Reuben conceived the idea of the first convector radiator in 1925 which replaced the heavy, bulky, <b>cast-iron</b> <b>radiators</b> that prevailed at the time. Trane's first air conditioning unit was developed in 1931.|$|R
