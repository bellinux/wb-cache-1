5|$|The West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway (WHH) and {{a number}} of landowners struck an {{agreement}} to construct a line from the Tees at Cargo Fleet via Normanby, Upsall and Guisborough to Skinningrove, with <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> and branches to Staithes and Skelton-in-Cleveland. The line would connect to the WHH's own route north of the river via a crossing of the Tees. Several local landowners through which the proposed line ran were key to the scheme – Captain Thomas Chaloner of Guisborough, J.T. Wharton of Skelton Castle, Anthony Lax Maynard of Skinningrove and Ralph Ward Jackson of Greatham Hall, Normanby. Ward Jackson, who was the chairman of the WHH, was {{the driving force behind the}} project and envisaged making West Hartlepool into the industrial heart of Teesside.|$|E
5|$|Originally a garden, {{the demand}} for more {{accommodation}} for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by Bishop Robinson {{at the suggestion of}} his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, {{as a result of a}} benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of the First quad are repeated on them — only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819, they were joined up to the Front quad with their present, rather incongruous <b>connecting</b> <b>links.</b> In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated – the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of Basil Champneys, and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the Provost's Lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.|$|E

25|$|Architect William Buckland adapted Palladio's Villa Pisani {{design to}} satisfy the tastes of colonial Annapolis. He re-designed the plan to {{accommodate}} the tastes for asymmetrical regional preferences and modified the hyphens from Palladio's arched entries to more practical single storey <b>connecting</b> <b>links.</b> He also incorporated fashionable urban design by sinking {{the windows in the}} method mandated by the London Building Act of 1774. This device provided better protection from fire and gave the overall design a greater degree of visual solidity and three dimensionality (see image at right). This adaptation from Palladio's model marks his maturity as an architect and ranks him as one of America's first and finest architects.|$|E

50|$|When the Ouellette Avenue curve was {{constructed}} in 1963, the portion north of the curve along Dougall Avenue and Tecumseh Road was reverted to municipal control, and the designation of Highway 3B {{was placed on the}} re-aligned curve leading along Dougall Avenue and Ouellette Avenue.

60|$|The correspondence, thus {{arranged}} in chronological order, forms an almost continuous record of Mrs. Browning's life, {{from the early}} days in Herefordshire to her death in Italy in 1861; but in order to complete the record, it has been thought well to add <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> of narrative, which should serve to bind the whole together into the unity of a biography. It is a chronicle, rather than a biography in the artistic sense of the term; a chronicle of the events of a life in which there were but few external events of importance, and in which the subject of the picture is, for the most part, left to paint her own portrait, and that, moreover, unconsciously. Still, this is a method which may be held to have its advantages, in that it can hardly be affected by the feelings or prejudices of the biographer; and if it does not present a finished portrait to the reader, it provides him with the materials from which he can form a portrait for himself. The external events are placed upon record, either in the letters or in the <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> of narrative; the character and opinions of Mrs. Browning reveal themselves in her correspondence; and her genius is enshrined in her poetry. And these three elements make up all that may be known of her personality, all with which a biographer has to deal.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, the City of Windsor re-aligned Ouellette Avenue to {{flow into}} Dougall Avenue directly, {{instead of having}} Highway 3B traffic head north along Dougall Avenue, then making a short east-bound jog on Tecumseh Road before {{continuing}} left (north) on Ouellette Ave. The former alignment remained as Ouellette Avenue, while the new alignment became [...] "Ouellette Place". Four years later, it was designated as a <b>Connecting</b> <b>Link,</b> enabling Windsor to receive monetary and mechanical/paving assistance in maintaining the road, and to continue to sign it as Highway 3B, should it be downloaded. Though it was officially turned back in 1975, the <b>connecting</b> <b>link</b> status remained in place until January 1, 1998. This was when the <b>connecting</b> <b>link</b> status was repealed, and the road was officially retired as a Provincially maintained highway.|$|R

60|$|Such was the dish, {{the merits}} of which I was now eager to discuss. I eyed it wistfully for a moment, and then, unable any longer to stand on ceremony, plunged my hand into the {{yielding}} mass, and to the boisterous mirth of the natives drew it forth laden with the poee-poee, which adhered in lengthening strings to every finger. So stubborn was its consistency, that in conveying my heavily-freighted hand to my mouth, the <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> almost raised the calabash from the mats on which it had been placed.

60|$|Bradley {{had noted}} {{something}} of the obvious indications of a gradual evolution from ape to spearman as exemplified by the several overlapping races of Alalus, club-men and hatchet-men that formed the <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> between the two extremes with which he, had come in contact. He {{had heard of the}} Krolus and the Galus--reputed to be still higher in the plane of evolution--and now he had indisputable evidence of a race possessing refinements of civilization eons in advance of the spear-men. The conjectures awakened by even a momentary consideration of the possibilities involved became at once as wildly bizarre as the insane imagings of a drug addict.|$|E

60|$|I {{will now}} give a brief {{description}} of all the principal breeds. Diagram 1. may aid the reader in learning their names and seeing their affinities. The rock-pigeon, or Columba livia (including under this name two or three closely-allied sub-species or geographical races, hereafter to be described), may be confidently viewed, as we shall see in the next chapter, as the common parent-form. The names in italics on the right-hand side of the page show us the most distinct breeds, or those which have undergone the greatest amount of modification. The lengths of the dotted lines rudely represent the degree of distinctness of each breed from the parent-stock, and the names placed under each other in the columns show the more or less closely <b>connecting</b> <b>links.</b> The distances of the dotted lines from each other approximately represent the amount of difference between the several breeds.|$|E

Why, again, do whole groups of allied species appear, though certainly they often falsely appear, to have come in suddenly on the several geological stages? Why do we not find great piles of strata beneath the Silurian system, stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Silurian groups of fossils? For certainly on my theory such strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs in the world's history.|$|E
