5|$|The Reed <b>City</b> <b>Bus.</b> US10 {{was created}} by 1960 to follow Chestnut and Church streets into the community's central {{business}} district and through adjacent residential areas. In 1975 when US10 was rerouted to follow the freeways around Clare, the former routing through downtown on McEwan and Fifth streets was redesignated as a business loop; it was also signed to provide connections between US10 and what is now US127 because of an incomplete interchange between those two freeways. The Midland business loop dates back to 1961 and follows Eastman Avenue and two sets of one-way streets before completing its routing as a freeway. The two business loops created for Flint and Pontiac were designated in 1941 and 1961, respectively. They followed streets that were once part of US 10, but after additional changes to US10's routing in Michigan, they were renumbered as business loops of other highways in 1962 and 1986, respectively. Near Flint, part of US10 was replaced by M-54 when the US Highway was moved to a freeway, and near Pontiac it was replaced by US24 after US10 was truncated in the state.|$|E
