5|$|The lavish banquet was <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{an affront}} to those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1832, President Andrew Jackson, displeased with Atkinson's {{handling}} of the war, appointed General Winfield Scott to take command. Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a cholera pandemic had spread to eastern North America. As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from Buffalo, New York, across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them dying. At each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left. On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the war's final campaign, but he would {{be too late to}} see any combat.|$|E

25|$|On May 24, 2000; US Airways {{announced}} plans to be acquired for $4.3 billion by UAL Corp., {{the parent company of}} United Airlines, the world's largest commercial carrier at the time.

Negotiations stalled; with both airlines losing money and the deal all but <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blocked by the federal government, UAL withdrew its purchase offer on July 27, 2001, paying US Airways a $50 million penalty for withdrawing from the deal.|$|E

She had been beaten over the head with a blunt instrument, later found to be an empty liquor bottle, and very likely raped.

In the 20-year span from 1960 to 1989 from the theater standpoint, the majority of cartoons in Hong Kong were imported from the US. It was typical to play American movies in major cinemas preceded by an American cartoon segment. Sometimes the segment would even be shown in its entirety. An MGM or Disney movie was almost <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preceded by another Disney animation.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 and 1999 {{there was}} some {{controversy}} when the university decided to sell the Turner Collection, a valuable collection of printed mathematical books, including some which had belonged to and had been heavily annotated by Isaac Newton, in order to fund major improvements to the university library. Senior university officials authorised {{the sale of the}} collection to a private buyer, with no guarantee that it would remain intact or within the UK. Although the sale was legal, it was unpopular among the academic community, and the controversy was fuelled by prolonged negative press coverage suggesting that the £1m sale price was too low and that the collection was <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> broken up.|$|E
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is {{a common}} snake and has adapted well to human habitats. In {{southern}} parts of Thailand, they are reported {{to hide in the}} thatch of the roofing material inside bungalows to prey on geckos and mice during the night. In these areas, one can almost be <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relatively close to a C. ornata most anywhere, perhaps hiding in the crown of the nearby coconut palm, under the roots of a tree, or even curled up in a potted plant. When hunting and pursuing fleeing prey, they have been reported to drop down out of the crown of coconut palms. Snakes are often indiscriminately killed, as many locals incorrectly assume all snakes are venomous. C. ornata is sometimes cooked for food.|$|E

25|$|The natural predators {{of adult}} greater rheas {{are limited to}} the cougar (Puma concolor), which are found in most areas {{inhabited}} by greater rheas and are <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their leading predator, and the jaguar (Panthera onca), which are found with greater rheas and opportunistically hunt them in the Paraguayan chaco, central Bolivia and the Brazilian cerrado. Feral dogs are known to kill younger birds, and the southern caracara (Caracara plancus) is suspected to prey on hatchlings. Armadillos sometimes feed on greater rhea eggs; nests have been found which had been undermined by a six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) or a big hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) and the rhea eggs were broken apart. Predation on young rheas has also been reportedly committed by greater grisons (Galictis vittata).|$|E
25|$|The Hutu {{militants in}} the camps were very aware that the camps {{provided}} both protection and resources for their military activities. They thus {{had an interest in}} keeping the camps where they were, in effect making the refugees semi-hostages. Rumors of Tutsi retributions and an impending second genocide also convinced many Hutu refugees that they should not return. The obvious candidate to impose order was the Zairean government of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. However, Zaire was a large and weak state, which did not have firm control of the eastern regions that were {{on the opposite side of}} the country from the capital. It has also been noted that Uganda and Zaire had unfriendly relations. Mobutu would not have been pleased by the emergence of a Rwandan government that was allied with Uganda and may have hoped that the Hutu militants could rid him of the new government of Paul Kagame. Documents belonging to Hutu fighters show that Mobutu allowed the militants to ship large amounts of arms into the country. The only other option with international credibility was a multilateral intervention led by the UN, but it quickly became clear that few nations were interested in what seemed <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a difficult and bloody operation in a remote African region.|$|E
500|$|Before 1940, {{marriage}} in Scotland {{was based on}} Celtic customs, rather than Catholic religious customs.
