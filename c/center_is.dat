This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415nm and thus does not induce color on its own. However, the N3 <b>center</b> <b>is</b> always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 centers are yellow in color.|$|E
