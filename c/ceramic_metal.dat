25|$|Fidget spinners are toys {{not unlike}} yo-yo or other skill toys, {{designed}} to spin with little effort. A basic fidget spinner {{consists of a}} two- or three-pronged design with a bearing in its center circular pad. A person holds the center pad while the toy spins. They are made from various materials including brass, stainless steel, titanium, copper, aluminium, and plastic. The bearings are generally <b>ceramic,</b> <b>metal</b> (stainless steel or chrome), and some are hybridssuch as ceramic balls with stainless races and cages. Each fidget spinner also has two or more weights on the outside that make it spin faster and stay balanced. Bearings can vary to adjust for the design's spin time, vibration, and noise, causing unique sensory feedback.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the static frictional resistance at the bracket/archwire interface in two recently introduced bracket systems and {{compare them to}} conventional <b>ceramic</b> and conventional <b>metal</b> bracket systems. Three variables were considered including the bracket system, archwire type and archwire angulation. Material and Methods: Four bracket systems were tested in vitro: Self ligating <b>ceramic,</b> <b>ceramic</b> with <b>metal</b> slot and module, conventional ceramic with module and conventional metal with module. A specially constructed jig and an Instron testing machine were {{used to measure the}} static frictional resistance for 0. 014 inches round and 0. 018 x 0. 025 inches rectangular stainless steel wires at 0 ° and 7 ° angulations. Main outcome measures: static frictional force at the bracket/archwire interface; recorded and measured in units of force (Newtons). Results: Self ligating <b>ceramic</b> and <b>metal</b> slot <b>ceramic</b> bracket systems generated significantly less static frictional resistance than conventional ceramic bracket systems with the wire at both angulations (P < 0. 05).
