Results : Mean serum magnesium level in preeclampsia (1. 83 ± 0. 21 mg/dl) was lesser in comparison to normal pregnant women (2. 03 ± 0. 16 mg/dl). Serum calcium level was lower (8. 10 ± 0. 56 mg/dl) than control (9. 59 ± 0. 62 mg/dl) with p< 0. 001.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{associations}} between CSF biomarkers, initial neurologic dysfunction, and long-term ambulatory outcome in dogs with acute intervertebral disk herniation (IVDH). DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. ANIMALS: 54 dogs with acute thoracolumbar IVDH and 16 clinically normal dogs. PROCEDURES:For each dog, variables, including CSF myelin basic protein (MBP), <b>lactate,</b> <b>calcium,</b> glucose, and total protein concentrations; nucleated cell count; and creatine kinase (CK) and aspartate aminotransferase activities, were measured. For dogs with thoracolumbar IVDH, initial neurologic function {{was characterized by}} use of a modified Frankel score (MFS; determined {{on a scale of}} 0 to 5, where 0 represented paraplegia with no deep nociception and 5 represented paraspinal hyperesthesia only). Long-term follow-up was assessed. RESULTS: Among dogs with thoracolumbar IVDH, those with CSF CK activity ≤ 38 U/L had a 35 -fold increase in the odds of long-term ambulation, compared with the odds in dogs with CSF CK activity > 38 U/L, adjusting for neurologic functioning at the evaluation. The CSF <b>lactate,</b> <b>calcium,</b> and glucose concentrations and aspartate aminotransferase activity were not predictive of long-term ambulatory outcome. Data analysis revealed that longterm functional recovery was > 98 % for affected dogs, regardless of their initial MFS, when CSF CK activity was ≤ 38 U/L and MBP concentration was ≤ 3 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In dogs with acute thoracolumbar IVDH, CSF CK activity and MBP concentration appeared to be prognostic indicators and, along with initial MFS, can be used to predict long-term ambulatory outcome.

The definitions of terms used in blood gas analy-sis are shown in Box 1. Arterial blood gases are preferred when assessing respiratory status, but venous samples also yield useful information regarding metabolic status. Venous blood tends to have a slightly lower pH and higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) than arterial blood because of local tissue metabolism.
