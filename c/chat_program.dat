25|$|In 1925, Tatum {{moved to}} the Columbus School for the Blind, where he studied music and learned braille. He {{subsequently}} studied piano with Overton G. Rainey at either the Jefferson School or the Toledo School of Music. Rainey, who was also visually impaired, probably taught Tatum in the classical tradition, as Rainey did not improvise and discouraged his students from playing jazz. In 1927, Tatum began playing on Toledo radio station WSPD as 'Arthur Tatum, Toledo's Blind Pianist', during interludes in Ellen Kay's shopping <b>chat</b> <b>program</b> and soon had his own program. By the age of 19, Tatum was playing at the local Waiters' and Bellmens' Club. As word of Tatum spread, national performers passing through Toledo, including Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Joe Turner and Fletcher Henderson, {{would make it a}} point to drop in to hear the piano phenomenon.|$|E
2500|$|HearMe.com was {{launched}} in January 1999 following the success of Mplayer. [...] Mpath intended to expand their market from entertainment using money that was being made through Mplayer to create a VOIP communications network. [...] The technology used {{was based on the}} lucrative audio chat software used within Mplayer. [...] HearMe.com's website featured wildly popular and free voice and video-conferencing chatrooms, as well as free HTML (ActiveX) code that would allow one to add a voicechat module directly to their own website and speak with visitors in realtime. [...] The popularity of the chatrooms is exemplified by this uncopyrighted song. The new business became successful {{to the point where the}} entire company decided to refocus itself on this market, and this unit was not part of the buyout. [...] In late September 1999, Mpath Interactive bought Resounding Technology, Inc, maker of Roger Wilco, another audio <b>chat</b> <b>program.</b> [...] HearMe continued to release updates of the software until mid 2000 when HearMe saw its end and went out of business. However in late 2000 a deal with PalTalk emerged, where PalTalk assumed all rights to HearMe's technology. It was later implemented into GameSpy Arcade.|$|E
