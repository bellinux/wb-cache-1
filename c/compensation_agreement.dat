25|$|In {{light of}} the {{government}} announcement, the patients of the Mutual Aid Society decided {{to ask for a}} new <b>compensation</b> <b>agreement</b> with Chisso and submitted the demand on 6 October. The company replied that it was unable to judge what would be fair compensation and asked the national government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients' society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in 1959 with unfortunate results. At a meeting on 5 April 1969, the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the arbitration group (who were willing to accept binding arbitration) and the litigation group (who decided to sue the company). That summer, Chisso sent gifts to the families who opted for arbitration rather than litigation.|$|E

40|$|EBITDA, {{earnings}} before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, {{is used by}} {{many firms}} {{as a measure of}} performance in financial covenants and incentive <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements.</b> In 2009, when the FASB, in conjunction with the IASB, likely begins requiring firms to report virtually all leases as capital leases, we expect calculated measures of EBITDA to increase. As a result, firms may find unexpected slack in financial covenants and increases in incentive compensation that are unrelated to real improvements in performance. In anticipation of the change in accounting for leases, companies will want to revise contracts that employ EBITDA to ensure that unanticipated consequences are avoided. This research report examines the effects of lease capitalization on EBITDA in cases where it is employed in financial agreements. Our focus is on companies noted to employ EBITDA in financial covenants or incentive <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements</b> with significant exposure to operating leases. For a sample of 25 companies we recalculated EBITDA, treating operating leases as though they were capital-lease commitments. For some firms, we found significant increases in EBITDA, with a sample-wide median increase of 7. 7...|$|R

5000|$|Positive {{accounting}} can {{be associated}} with the contractual view of the firm. The firm is viewed as “a nexus of contracts” and accounting one tool to facilitate the formation and performance of contracts. Under this view, accounting practices evolve to mitigate contracting costs by establishing ex ante agreement among varying parties. For example, positive accounting postulates that conservatism in accounting -in this sense defined conditionally as requiring lower (higher) standards of verifiability to recognize losses (gains)- has origins in contract markets, including managerial compensation contracts and lender debt contracts. As an example, absent conservatism, managerial <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements</b> may reward managers based on current reports that later evidence indicates were unwarranted.|$|R

40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to monitoring executive compensation. While the public seems convinced that executives at public corporations are paid too much, so far attempts to rein in executive compensation have met with little success. Several approaches have been tried - requiring large pay packages to consist predominantly of incentive pay, new procedures for approving pay, mobilization of public outrage at giant compensation packages. None, however, has stemmed the growth of executive compensation, or convinced opponents of large pay packages that such pay is either fair or deserved. Here we suggest {{a new approach}}, one that turns to an unlikely agency to oversee executive compensation: the courts. Foes of high executive compensation have generally dismissed the courts as ineffective allies in curbing executive compensation, reasoning that courts have never wished to become involved in pay decisions. We show, however, that at several points over the last century, courts have proven surprisingly willing to second-guess decisions on executive compensation. These courts ultimately retreated from activist approaches to executive compensation not because of complacency but because they did not wish to become entangled in setting pay. Recent developments in corporate law point {{a way out of this}} impasse. Last year, in "Gantler v. Stephens", Delaware’s Supreme Court resolved a major unanswered issue in corporation law when it held that a corporation’s officers owe the same fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders as do its directors. Gantler opens the door for courts to monitor executive compensation by scrutinizing rigorously officers’ actions in negotiating their own <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements.</b> The Delaware Chancery Court has already taken up this invitation by holding that corporate officers are bound by their duty of loyalty to negotiate employment contracts in an arm’s-length, adversarial manner. If the officers do not do so, but instead try to manipulate the process, they will open themselves up to shareholder lawsuits and judicial scrutiny of <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements</b> via their negotiations. This approach should be welcomed by the courts, which will not be required to determine whether compensation packages are fair or merited, but will instead be asked to engage in a familiar task, examining whether proper procedures were followed in setting compensation. This approach also promises to break an impasse between the two major academic approaches to executive compensation. Advocates of "Board Capture" theory have long argued that senior executives so dominate their boards that they can effectively set their own pay. "Optimal contracting" theorists doubt this, contending that, given legal and economic constraints, executive <b>compensation</b> <b>agreements</b> are likely to be pretty good and benefit shareholders. The approach advocated here should, surprisingly, please both camps. To Board Capture theorists, it offers to cast light on pay negotiations they believe are largely a sham; to Optimal Contracting theorists, it offers a way to improve the already adequate negotiating environment...|$|R
