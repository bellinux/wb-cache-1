40|$|A <b>synopsis</b> <b>record</b> card {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in general practice to provide ready reference to the important facts of the patient's record. When such a card {{is available in the}} record wallet it is used at 50 % of all patient consultations and significantly reduces the time needed to retrieve past data essential to the consultation. The card contains clinical details, and data on medication, drug idiosyncrasies, immunizations, screening procedures, social, occupational and family history and practice research. As <b>synopsis</b> <b>records</b> are particularly important in teaching practices and when referral letters to hospital or personal medical attendant insurance reports are written, provision has been made for the inclusion of data relevant to those functions. So that the card may act as an intermediary for record computerization, all elements needed in the construction of a computer record have been taken into account. The prototype card was circulated to 3000 RCGP members for comment and the majority of replies were favourable. Suggested modifications have been incorporated in the final design of the card...|$|R

50|$|The first {{reference}} to this species came in John Ray's 1690 <b>Synopsis,</b> which <b>recorded</b> {{the discovery of}} a rare fern near the summit of Snowdon in Wales by Edward Lhwyd. However, the plant was first definitely identified as a separate species from specimens collected in Scotland in James Bolton's 1785 publication Filices Britannica. Bolton distinguished between Acrostichum ilvense and Acrostichum alpina, now Woodsia ilvensis and Woodsia alpina respectively, which had previously been conflated. The story is further confused because although Lhwyd called his find A. ilvense, and a translation of the latin name suggests the plant we now know as W. ilvensis, examination of his specimens has shown that he collected W. alpina. The genus Woodsia was not established until 1810 by Robert Brown, who named it named after the English botanist Joseph Woods.|$|R

40|$|<b>SYNOPSIS</b> This paper <b>records</b> the {{hospital}} incidence of peptic ulcer amongst Africans and Indians in Durban and {{draws attention to}} the lower incidence amongst Africans. Peptic ulcer symptoms are amongst the commonest complaints in Indian patients in Durban; epigastric pain related to meals, dyspepsia, and periodic exacerbations of such pain frequently form a secondary complaint when the chief complaint is referable {{to other parts of the}} body. Diseases of the stoniach and duodenum, on the other hand, are relatively much less frequent in African patients. The frequency and types of peptic ulcer among Indians and Africans admitted to this hospital in the 10 -year period 1950 - 59 inclusive have been analysed. No separate study has been made o...|$|R

40|$|The plant Sambucus, called elder or elder-berry in English, {{has been}} {{associated}} with major and minor deities longer than history records. In contrast to gods and goddesses, other applications of sambucus are made in more secular ways. Sambucus and its variants have been applied to five entities—plants, a musical instrument (sambuce, שׂבּבָא), a military device (sambuca, σαμβύκῆ), a sailing vessel (sambuq, sanbuq, زنبق), and a liquor (sambuca, zammut). Each of these connotations is separated, some slightly and others markedly, from the others by fragmented historical records. While the most ancient application known is for the musical instrument, the designation of a plant is not much, if any, younger. The war machine is almost the same age as the plant tradition. Considerably more recent are the labels of a ship and alcoholic drink.

40|$|We asked jurors {{awaiting}} trial assignment {{to listen to}} a <b>recorded</b> <b>synopsis</b> of an authentic criminal trial and to make a choice among 4 verdict possibilities. Each participant juror then deliberated with another juror whose verdict choice differed, as a microcosm of a full jury’s deliberation. Analysis of the transcripts of these deliberations revealed both characteristics general to the sample and characteristics for which variation appeared across participants. Findings were interpreted in terms of a model of juror reasoning as entailing theory-evidence coordination. More frequently than challenging the other’s statements, we found, a juror agreed with and added to or elaborated them. Epistemological stance — whether knowledge was regarded as absolute and certain or subject to interpretation — predicted several characteristics of discourse. Absolutists were less likely to make reference to the verdict criteria in their discourse. Those who did so, {{as well as those who}} made frequent reference to the evidence, were more likely to persuade their discourse partners...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synopsis</b> The fossil <b>record</b> {{indicates}} that crinoids have exhibited remarkable regenerative abilities since their {{origin in the}} Ordovician, abilities that they likely inherited from stem-group echinoderms. Regeneration in extant and fossil crinoids is recognized by abrupt differences {{in the size of}} abutting plates, aberrant branching patterns, and discontinuities in carbon isotopes. While recovery is common, not all lost body parts can be regenerated; filling plates and overgrowths are evidence of non-regenerative healing. Considering them as a whole, Paleozoic crinoids exhibit the same range of regenerative and non-regenerative healing as Recent crinoids. For example, Paleozoic and extant crinoids show evidence of crown regeneration and stalk regrowth, which can occur only if the entoneural nerve center (chambered organ) remains intact. One group of Paleozoic crinoids, the camerates, may be an exception in that they probably could not regenerate their complex calyx-plating arrangements, including arm facets, but their calyxes could be healed with repar-ative plates. With that exception, and despite evidence for increases in predation pressure, there is no compelling evidence that crinoids have changed though time in their ability to recover from wounds. Finally, although crinoid appendages may be lost as a consequence of severe abiotic stress and through ontogenetic development, spatiotemporal changes in the intensity and frequency of biotic interactions, especially direct attacks, are the most likely explanation for observed patterns of regeneration and autotomy in crinoids...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synopsis</b> The fossil <b>record</b> {{has been}} an {{invaluable}} aid for reconstructing the major events of vertebrate evolution. There is no comparable record for protochordates, however, which severely limits our knowledge of their ancestral morphology, habits, and mode of life. The alternative is inference based on an interpretation of living protochordates but this is fraught with problems, not least being our own biases of what we think an ancestral chordate ought to look like. Relevant to the present symposium {{is the problem of}} head/trunk relationships and whether or not the myotomes of the trunk originally extended into the head in vertebrates. I will review what is currently known of patterns of innervation in tunicates and amphioxus in relation to Romer’s somaticovisceral concept of the vertebrate body to show how little {{progress has been made in}} resolving this problem. There are, in contrast, surprisingly good prospects for solving some other puzzles concerning chordate origins. Dorsoventral inversion provides a good example. A consensus is now emerging, based largely on molecular data from hemichordates that casts new light on the asymmetry of the head in amphioxus. Specifically, the morphogenetic growth process that reestablishes symmetry in late-stage larvae can now be seen, at least in part, as a recapitulation of past evolutionary events, and this has important implications for the origin and basic organization of the brain. Reconstructing the evolutionary past Protochordates are crucially important to compara...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Extensive {{excavation}} {{activities by}} the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing (IVPP) {{over the last}} 20 years have increased {{our knowledge of the}} Neogene micromammals from China considerably. Yet, it is still rather fragmentary; we deal with a very vast country with a complex geological and faunal history and varied ecological conditions at all times. The fossil sites are not distributed evenly in time and space (Fig. 1), and among Neogene micromammals, insectivores are often disregarded taxonomically, even though they are a major element in most assemblages. Qiu (1988) and Qiu & Qiu (1995) discussed the major Neogene micromammal faunas from China and presented faunal lists, including insectivores. The location of the local faunas is shown in Fig. 1. A <b>synopsis</b> of fossil <b>records</b> of soricids from Asia was given by Storch et al. (1998). Detailed taxonomic studies of Neogene insectivores deal with local faunas such as Lufeng in the south and Tunggur, Ertemte, and Bilike in the north of China. Where necessary, we updated for the present paper the biochronological and local (administrative/geographical) settings and consulted type specimens of various taxa. Some taxa, however, still would require a more comprehensive review. Unlike the other contributions in this volume, we used the terms of the Chinese Land Mammal Ages for the chronological setting instead of the European Neogene Mammal units (MN zones). Our correlation with MN zones must be considered tentative for the most part. Within each Age the localities are arranged stratigraphically. All specimens are housed in the collections of IVPP, aside from the holotype of Metexallerix gaolanshanensis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synopsis</b> The fossil <b>record</b> of {{the order}} Carnivora extends back at least 60 million years and {{documents}} a remarkable history of adaptive radiation characterized by the repeated, independent evolution of similar feeding morphologies in distinct clades. Within the order, convergence is apparent in the iterative appearance {{of a variety of}} ecomorphs, including cat-like, hyena-like, and wolf-like hypercarnivores, as well as a variety of less carnivorous forms, such as foxes, raccoons, and ursids. The iteration of similar forms has multiple causes. First, there are a limited number of ways to ecologically partition the carnivore niche, and second, the material properties of animal tissues (muscle, skin, bone) have not changed over the Cenozoic. Consequently, similar craniodental adaptations for feeding on different proportions of animal versus plant tissues evolve repeatedly. The extent of convergence in craniodental form can be striking, affecting skull proportions and overall shape, as well as dental morphology. The tendency to evolve highly convergent ecomorphs is most apparent among feeding extremes, such as sabertooths and bone-crackers where performance requirements tend to be more acute. A survey of the fossil record indicates that large hypercarnivores evolve frequently, often in response to ecological opportunity afforded by the decline or extinction of previously dominant hypercarnivorous taxa. While the evolution of large size and carnivory may be favored at the individual level, it can lead to a macroevolutionary ratchet, wherein dietary specialization and reduced population densities result in a greater vulnerability to extinction. As a result of these opposing forces, the fossil record of Carnivora is dominated by successive clades of hypercarnivores that diversify and decline, only to be replaced by new hypercarnivorous clades. This has produced a marvelous set of natural experiments in the evolution of similar ecomorphs, each of which start from phylogenetically and morphologically unique positions...|$|R
