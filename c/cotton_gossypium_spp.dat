Extrafloral nectary {{anatomy and}} carbon {{metabolism}} of Australian native wild <b>cottons</b> (<b>Gossypium</b> spp.; Malvaceae) [...] Chapter 2. Response of Australian native wild <b>cotton</b> (<b>Gossypium</b> spp.; Malvaceae) extrafloral nectar production and composition to elevate 4 d carbon dioxide. Extrafloral (EF) nectar {{is the foundation}} of many ant-plant interactions worldwide. EF nectar is a resource that encourages ant presence, in turn resulting in protection for plants against herbivores. There is a paucity of research on this relationship and the plant structures that underpin it in Australian species. An examination of the morphology and anatomy of EF nectaries of four Australian <b>cottons</b> (<b>Gossypium</b> <b>spp.)</b> revealed a suberised layer in the nectaries which indicates solutes must travel through the symplasm. ¹⁴CO₂ labelling showed the studied leaves were carbon sources and the EF nectar carbon cost was 1 % of net photosynthates. Any environmental changes that affect EF nectar could have flow-on effects for ecological communities, for example rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels. This study tested the response of EF nectar to elevated CO₂; the first investigation of elevated CO₂ impacts on any EF nectar system. The total volume and composition of EF nectar did not change, but there was evidence of accelerated plant development and a change in EF nectar allocation within plants. Developmental changes due to elevated CO₂ could affect the timing of EF nectar production which could have flow-on effects to ant mutualists and the defence of plants.

40|$|Both {{ancient and}} recent polyploidy, {{together}} with post-polyploidization loss of many duplicated gene copies, complicates angiosperm comparative genomics. To explore an approach by which these challenges might be mitigated, genetic maps of extant diploid and tetraploid <b>cottons</b> (<b>Gossypium</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{were used to}} infer the approximate order of 3016 loci along the chromosomes of their hypothetical common ancestor. The inferred Gossypium gene order corresponded more closely than the original maps did to a similarly inferred ancestral gene order predating an independent paleopolyploidization (α) in Arabidopsis. At least 59 % of the cotton map and 53 % of the Arabidopsis transcriptome showed correspondence in multilocus gene arrangements based on {{one or both of}} two software packages (CrimeStatII, FISH). Genomic regions in which chromosome structural rearrangement has been rapid (obscuring gene order correspondence) have also been subject to greater divergence of individual gene sequences. About 26 %- 44 % of corresponding regions involved multiple Arabidopsis or cotton chromosomes, in some cases consistent with known, more ancient, duplications. The genomic distributions of multiple-locus probes provided early insight into the consequences for chromosome structure of an ancient large-scale duplication in cotton. Inferences that mitigate the consequences of ancient duplications improve leveraging of genomic information for model organisms in the study of more complex genomes...|$|R

40|$|New World {{tetraploid}} <b>cottons</b> (<b>Gossypium</b> <b>spp.)</b> originated through hybridization of ancestral diploid {{species that}} presently have allopatric ranges in Asia-Africa (the A genome) and the New World tropics and subtropics (the D genome). Despite intensive study, {{the identity of}} the parental diploids and the antiquity of polyploidization remain unresolved. In this study, variation in the maternally inherited chloroplast genome was assessed among species representing both of the parental genomes and the tetraploids. Approximately 560 restriction sites were assayed in each accession, representing sequence information for about 3200 nucleotides. The resulting maternal phylogeny has no convergent restriction site mutations and demonstrates that the cytoplasm donor for all tetraploid species was an A genome diploid with a chloroplast genome that is similar to Gossypium arboreum and Gossypium herbaceum. No mutational differences were detected between these two species, and few mutations distinguish the chloroplast genomes of A genome diploids from those of tetraploid taxa. In contrast to expectations based on extensive taxonomic, geographic, and genetic diversity, a surprisingly low level of sequence divergence has accumulated subsequent to polyploidization. Chloroplast genomes of tetraploid species are distinguished from each other by between one and six apparent point mutations. The data suggest that tetraploid cotton originated relatively recently, perhaps within the last 1 - 2 million years, with subsequent rapid evolution and diversification throughout the New World tropics...|$|R

40|$|The <b>cotton</b> genus (<b>Gossypium</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{contains}} 8 monophyletic diploid genome groups (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, K) and {{a single}} allotetraploid clade (AD). To gain insight into the phylogeny of Gossypium and molecular evolution of the chloroplast genome in this group, we performed a comparative analysis of 19 Gossypium chloroplast genomes, six reported {{here for the first}} time. Nucleotide distance in non-coding regions was about three times that of coding regions. As expected, distances were smaller within than among genome groups. Phylogenetic topologies based on nucleotide and indel data support for the resolution of the 8 genome groups into 6 clades. Phylogenetic analysis of indel distribution among the 19 genomes demonstrates contrasting evolutionary dynamics in different clades, with a parallel genome downsizing in two genome groups and a biased accumulation of insertions in the clade containing the cultivated cottons leading to large (for Gossypium) chloroplast genomes. Divergence time estimates derived from the cpDNA sequence suggest that the major diploid clades had diverged approximately 10 to 11 million years ago.

Cotton leaf is normally used in conjunction with lemon juice by the local populace in Nigeria for the treatment of enteric infections. Decoction method was used for the extraction of the active components from the plant in order to simulate the traditional method of extraction. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the diameters of zones of inhibition were determined by broth dilution and Agar diffusion methods respectively. The ethanolic extracts are more effective than the water extracts on the test organisms. The MIC {{of the water and}} ethanolic extracts ranged between 1. 25 - 5. 0 w/v on the test organisms. Similarly, the average diameter of zones of inhibition of the water extracts on the test organisms ranged between 3. 0 to 13. 0 mm while that of the ethanolic extracts ranged between 12. 0 to 21. 0 mm. The results of this study showed that E. coli was the most susceptible followed by Klebsiella sp., then Salmonella sp., and finally Shigella sp. at the concentrations used for both water and ethanolic extracts. This observation thereby justifies the traditional uses of these plant extracts among the Nigerian local populace for the treatment of some enteric infections such as dysentery and diarrhoea...|$|R

On the North coast of Peru the cultivation of the native and naturally coloured <b>cotton</b> (<b>Gossypium</b> Barbadense <b>spp.</b> locally called algodón El País) is part of the Moche indigenous culture (a local pre-Inca population). Since 1949 the Peruvian legal prohibition to produce native cotton, linked to the risk of genetic contamination of the industrial white cotton cultivations, made the keeping of these traditional varieties very difficult. Nevertheless the situation has totally changed since 2008 due to Regulation n° 29224 declaring native cotton as a genetic, ethnic and cultural heritage of the country. This study analyses the economic feasibility of re-inserting the native cotton as part of the agricultural production of 50 farmers on the North coast of Peru, proposing a farm economic data analysis, scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis based on OFAT (One Factor at A Time) methodology: the results attest that in all the productive scenarios proposed (10 %, 25 % and 50 % of the farm agricultural surface growing native cotton) the average farm incomes are going to increase.

The cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCV), thought to affect only <b>cotton</b> <b>Gossypium</b> (L.) <b>spp.,</b> is now known to infect other malvaceous plants {{and members of the}} Convolvulaceae and Leguminosae. Results of an experimental host range study suggest that potential virus-vector reservoirs may exist in cotton growing regions which include both weeds and cultivated plants. Geminivirus-like (GVL) particles of ∼ 18 x 30 nm were isolated for the first time from CLCV-infected bean, Phaseolus vulgaris (L.), 'Red Kidney', a plant which was a better purification host than cotton. Studies of CLCV-vector relationships indicated that the acquisition- and inoculation-access times, latent period and length of retention by whitefly vectors were {{similar to those of the}} original isolate reported in California in 1954. When growth chamber temperatures of 26, 32, and 37 C were used in virus-vector studies, optimal acquisition and transmission occurred at 32 C while temperatures of 37 C were lethal to whitefly adults. Two additional virus-like agents were isolated from single and mixed infections of lettuce or melons, respectively. The virus-like agent from lettuce infected primarily members of the Chenopodiaceae, Compositae and Cucurbitaceae, and was whitefly but not mechanically transmissible. Long flexuous closterovirus-like rods of ∼ 10 x 1400 - 2000 nm were visualized in extracts prepared from plants inoculated with the lettuce isolate. The isolate was similar to the lettuce infectious yellow virus (LIYV) based upon host range, transmission characteristics and unique particle morphology. Both long flexuous rods like those associated with the lettuce isolate and GVL particles of 18 x 30 nm were associated with diseased melons. The host range of the GVL agent was confined to the Cucurbitaceae and Leguminosae and the agent was separated from the mixed infection by mechanical transmission to a non-LIYV host.
