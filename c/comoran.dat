5|$|In March 2008, {{hundreds}} of <b>Comoran</b> government troops began assembling on Mohéli, which {{is closer to}} Anjouan than the larger island, Grande Comore. Sudan and Senegal provided a total of 750 troops, while Libya offered logistical support for the operation. In addition, 500 Tanzanian troops were due to arrive soon after. France, the former colonial power, also assisted the operation by airlifting AU troops to the area.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 2008, Bacar was remanded in custody. <b>Comoran</b> President Sambi visited Anjouan {{in early}} April, marking {{his first visit}} to the island since May 2007. He said that he hoped that {{separatism}} in Anjouan would cease with the removal of Bacar from power, and he praised the African leaders who had provided assistance for the invasion.|$|E
5|$|Mohamed Bacar {{managed to}} escape to Mayotte by {{speedboat}} and reports on March 26 confirmed his presence {{on the island and}} stated he had requested political asylum in France. The Associated Press reported from Paris that France was considering the request for political asylum but <b>Comoran</b> leaders demanded that France should return Bacar to the Comoros, and there have been anti-French protests calling for the same. France stated that it was treating the asylum request as quickly as possible, but, on March 27, Bacar was moved to the French island of Réunion, where he was charged and investigated for illegally entering French territory while carrying weapons, along with 23 of his followers. The case was rejected for procedural reasons, but Bacar and the 23 others remained in custody.|$|E

50|$|The World Bank {{estimated}} that in 1993 the Comoros had one physician per 6,582 <b>Comorans,</b> a marked {{improvement over the}} ratio of one to 13,810 reported in 1983. Comparable data for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole were not available; however, it appeared that <b>Comorans</b> enjoyed a more favorable ratio than many of their neighbors in East Africa and the Indian Ocean.|$|R

25|$|The grand {{marriage}} {{is a symbol of}} social status on the Comoros islands. The completion of an ada marriage also greatly increases a man’s standing in the <b>Comoran</b> hierarchy. A <b>Comoran</b> man can only wear certain elements of the national dress or stand in the first line at the mosque if he has had a grand marriage. Also, one is not fully considered a man until he has had an ada marriage.|$|E
500|$|The troops then retreated back to Mohéli and {{returned}} to Anjouan on Sunday March 16 to rescue the two wounded soldiers. According to a military source one federal soldier suffered an arm injury and another had a minor foot injury. [...] The same sources reported that {{during the course of}} the operation [...] "about twenty people" [...] in Domoni died as a result of the <b>Comoran</b> and AU bombardment of Anjouanese positions. These facts were disputed by the Anjouan administration which insisted that one of the two <b>Comoran</b> soldiers who had attacked Anjouanais positions in Domoni on March 15 had in fact died and that the police station was not captured. They stated that the <b>Comoran</b> and AU forces had been ambushed by Anjouanais forces during the early stages of their incursion at Domoni and had been forced to withdraw from what was a hopeless situation, ...|$|E
500|$|The <b>Comoran</b> federal {{government}} delayed {{the holding of}} an election on Anjouan due to alleged irregularities and intimidation, but Bacar nevertheless printed ballots and held an election in June, claiming [...] a landslide victory of 90 percent.|$|E
50|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of <b>Comorans</b> in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000 <b>Comorans,</b> 18,000 Indians, and 9,000 Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{international}} assistance, {{economic development}} was slow. Although some <b>Comorans</b> blamed the French, who {{had yet to}} restore technical assistance to pre-1975 levels, others suspected that Abdallah, who owned a large import-export firm, was enriching himself from development efforts {{with the assistance of}} Denard, who continued to visit the Comoros.|$|R
50|$|The {{importation}} of huge quantities of building materials and construction equipment provided immediate benefits to import-export {{firms in the}} islands, of which Établissements Abdallah et Fils was the largest. In the meantime, the projects were of little immediate use to <b>Comorans</b> and were likely to go underused for years to come.|$|R
500|$|In the 2000s, {{molecular}} studies helped {{clarify the}} systematics of Miniopterus. In 2007, Javier Juste and colleagues, using sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, found that bats from Madagascar (M.manavi), Grande Comore (M.manavi griveaudi) and São Tomé (M.minor newtoni; currently Miniopterus newtoni) did not cluster together {{to the exclusion}} of other African Miniopterus; however, their samples of [...] "M.manavi" [...] were in fact misidentified M.majori. The next year, Nicole Weyeneth and colleagues used cytochrome b and mitochondrial D-loop sequences to assess the relationships of <b>Comoran</b> Miniopterus. They found two unrelated clades within Malagasy and <b>Comoran</b> samples of [...] "Miniopterus manavi", neither of which was closely related to M.newtoni or to Tanzanian samples of M.minor.|$|E
500|$|Despite this intervention, {{a fishing}} boat with {{soldiers}} left Moheli for Anjouan on March 14. There were conflicting statements from both sides, with <b>Comoran</b> and AU military sources reporting that {{a fishing boat}} carrying around fifty soldiers {{from the federal government}} of Comoros landed in southern Anjouan and attempted to capture a police station. [...] In a later statement <b>Comoran</b> Chief of Staff Salim Mohamed revised the information and said a reconnaissance team of about 10 soldiers landed on March 14 in the south of Anjouan island and reached the southern town of Domoni. [...] Two soldiers were wounded, a federal source said. [...] "The target of the operation was the Domoni police station in Anjouan so as to free political prisoners," [...] said the source.|$|E
500|$|Early reports {{indicated}} that the Bacar government had fled to {{the interior of the}} island and were in hiding, however later uncorroborated reports from the Comoros government on March 25 stated that Mohamed Bacar had fled the island incognito seeking exile in Mayotte. [...] There was no comment from the Bacar government but the <b>Comoran</b> government spokesperson said that the invasion troops had been told to look for him and were conducting house to house searches.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{weakening}} {{of the position of}} the Shirazi elite, one observer reports that in many subtle ways old distinctions persist. The descendants of slaves, formally emancipated in 1904, are mostly sharecroppers or squatters, working the land that belonged to their ancestors' former owners, although some have gone abroad as migrant laborers (a greatly restricted option since Madagascar's expulsion of thousands of <b>Comorans</b> in the late 1970s). Men of [...] "freeborn" [...] families choose [...] "freeborn" [...] wives, holding, if possible, a grand marriage; but if they take second wives, these women often are of slave ancestry.|$|R
5000|$|Only {{weeks before}} the violent end of the Abdallah regime in late 1989, one {{observer}} noted that the [...] "Comoros is still run like a village, {{with a handful of}} tough men in charge and supported by foreign aid." [...] As <b>Comorans</b> prepared for a November 4, 1989, referendum on constitutional changes that would enable President Abdallah to run for a third term in 1990, human rights remained in precarious condition, and the only avenue of economic advancement for most islanders—the civil service—faced cutbacks at the urging of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Even those who would keep their government jobs, however, were not guaranteed economic security. As often occurred whenever export earnings slid, civil servants had not been paid since mid-summer.|$|R
500|$|Bacar's asylum {{request was}} {{rejected}} on May 15, 2008. [...] France's Secretary of State for Overseas, Yves Jégo, said France {{would support the}} <b>Comoran</b> government's efforts. [...] "We will continue to act {{in consultation with the}} Comoros so that the law can be applied and Col Bacar can be tried." [...] Presidential elections in Anjouan occurred on June 15 and June 29, 2008. The election was won by Moussa Toybou, who defeated Mohamed Djaanfari in the second round.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{commemoration}} ceremony held in Comoros for {{the accident}} victims on July 6, <b>Comoran</b> President Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi declared {{a month of}} national mourning in his island nation and honored Maturaffi Sélémane Libounah, the sailor who had rescued Bahia Bakari, telling him: [...] "You saved someone else's life {{at the risk of}} losing yours." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the <b>Comoran</b> {{government}} has no ships of its own, it asked all commercial and private vessels {{to help in the}} search and rescue effort. At approx. 11 local time (08:00 UTC), about 9 hours after the crash, the Sima Com 2 [...] a privately owned ship which normally carries passengers between Comoros and the neighboring island of Madagascar [...] arrived at the crash site and discovered Bakari, as the sole survivor among bits of floating wreckage.|$|E
2500|$|A {{worldwide}} {{search was}} launched for more coelacanths, with a reward of 100 British pounds, {{a very substantial}} sum to the average subsistence fisherman of the time. [...] Fourteen years later, one specimen {{was found in the}} Comoros, but the fish was no stranger to the locals — in the port of Domoni on the <b>Comoran</b> island of Anjouan, the Comorians were puzzled to be so rewarded for a [...] "gombessa" [...] or [...] "mame", their names for the nearly inedible fish that their fishermen occasionally caught by mistake.|$|E
2500|$|The second specimen, {{found in}} 1952 by <b>Comoran</b> {{fisherman}} Ahamadi Abdallah, {{was described as}} a different species, first as Malania hunti and later as Malania anjounae, after Daniel François Malan, the South African Prime Minister who had dispatched an SAAF Dakota at the behest of Professor Smith to fetch the specimen. It was later discovered that the lack of a first dorsal fin, at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen's life. Ironically, Malan was a staunch creationist; when he was first shown the primitive creature, he exclaimed, with a twinkle, [...] "My, it is ugly. Do you mean to say we once looked like that?" [...] The specimen retrieved by Smith is on display at the SAIAB in Grahamstown, South Africa where he worked.|$|E

50|$|A weak, divided, and {{opportunistic}} opposition facilitated Abdallah's {{efforts to}} undermine the political process. The character of <b>Comoran</b> politics ensured that opposition would be sustained by an unwieldy group of strong personalities. As the personal stock of these would-be leaders rose and fell, coalitions coalesced and just as quickly fell apart {{in a process that}} engendered distrust and cynicism. The ban on opposition political organizations at home—brutally upheld, when necessary, by the Presidential Guard (Garde Presidentelle—GP) and the <b>Comoran</b> military—further undercut efforts to organize against the head of state. The French government's displeasure at intrigues of <b>Comoran</b> exiles in Paris also complicated opposition efforts.|$|E

50|$|Abdallah complemented his {{political}} maneuvers by employing a GP officered {{by many of}} the same mercenaries who had helped him take power in 1978.

50|$|The Comoros has officially {{participated in}} the African Franc Zone (Communauté Financière Africaine—CFA; see Glossary) since 1979. The CFA franc was devalued by 50 percent on January 12, 1994, causing the {{exchange}} rate to become 100 CFA francs for one French franc. Subsequently, the <b>Comoran</b> franc was devalued so that instead of being directly aligned with the CFA franc, seventyfive <b>Comoran</b> francs equaled one French franc.|$|E
