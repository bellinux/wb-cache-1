5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is <b>common</b> <b>to</b> define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also <b>common</b> <b>to</b> define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E
5|$|A natural bobtail can {{be found}} in some members of the breed, which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders <b>common</b> <b>to</b> brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases <b>common</b> <b>to</b> small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E

5|$|Although it was <b>common</b> <b>to</b> bury dogs {{in ancient}} Egypt, {{the funeral of}} Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate, an honour {{normally}} reserved for upper-class humans.

5|$|Although much of Thoughts {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice <b>common</b> <b>to</b> all conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.|$|E
5|$|Angelou was {{challenged}} by her friend, author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, {{to write an}} autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize Caged Bird as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques <b>common</b> <b>to</b> fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics <b>common</b> <b>to</b> autobiographies written by Black American women {{in the years following}} the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.|$|E
