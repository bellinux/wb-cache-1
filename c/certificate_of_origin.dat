25|$|H.R. 1415 has 13 sections, {{the first}} of which names the act as the “Clean Diamond Trade Act”. The Act defines the {{motivation}} behind the passage as due to the human rights issues associated with the rough diamond trade. It also addresses previous action that has been taken to address threats due to conflicts coming from rough diamond trade. The act mentions the United Nations Security Council prohibiting states from exporting weapons to countries affected by diamond conflicts, in addition to mandating that states prohibit importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone and Liberia (3). The United States subsequently restricted the importation of diamonds to those containing a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later {{measures}} {{adopted by the}} Committee included requiring those selling goods to Arab states to provide a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> to prove the goods were not manufactured by Palestinian Jews, the allocation of 50% {{of the value of}} goods confiscated in this manner to customs officials, the prohibition by Arabs of the use of Jewish banks, insurance companies, contractors, and transport in Palestine. Member states of the Arab League began implementing these resolutions through legal and administrative measures. After the Partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states was introduced at the United Nations on 29 November 1947, efforts to apply the boycott were intensified. However, the boycott was unsuccessful, as established in the first annual report of the Boycott Committee, and trade between Palestine (the vast majority by Jews) and Arab States neighboring Palestine continued to thrive.|$|E
2500|$|A {{solution}} was negotiated in 2004, whereby the Israeli authorities would specify on the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> the geographic {{location of the}} production site (e.g., Israel, Barkan), without having to specify whether the goods originated in the Territories. The EU customs authorities are then able to discern the exact origin and provide preferential treatment only to goods from Israel proper, giving de facto meaning to the EU policy of non-recognition of the Territories {{as part of the}} State of Israel ...|$|E
50|$|Non-{{preferential}} <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are {{the most}} common type <b>of</b> <b>certificate.</b> These <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> see that goods do not benefit from any preferential treatment and do not emanate from a particular bilateral or multilateral free trade agreement. Chambers that are authorized to issue <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are most frequently authorized to issue non-preferential <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b>|$|R
50|$|Under these Conventions, {{signatory}} {{governments were}} able to allow organizations “which possess the necessary authority and offer the necessary guarantees” to the State to issue <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Thus due to the widespread network {{of the chamber of}} commerce community, in most countries, chambers of commerce were seen as these organizations allowed to issue <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> As such, seen as “competent authorities”, chambers began to more widely issue non-preferential <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Free {{movement}} of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, 'Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States'. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all [...] "trading rules" [...] that are [...] "enacted by Member States" [...] which could hinder trade [...] "directly or indirectly, actually or potentially" [...] would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This [...] "wide test", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former [...] "Buy Irish" [...] company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities 'manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, [...] "protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants", [...] "national treasures" [...] of [...] "artistic, historic or archaeological value" [...] and [...] "industrial and commercial property." [...] In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association {{is one of the}} 'fundamental pillars of a democratic society', against which the free {{movement of}} goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.|$|E

50|$|The Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville) was {{expelled}} from the Kimberley Process in 2004 because, despite having no official diamond mining industry, the country was exporting large quantities <b>of</b> diamonds, the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> which it could not detail.

50|$|The single-window {{system is}} a trade {{facilitation}} idea.

50|$|Turkey {{is by far}} {{the main}} trading partner of Northern Cyprus, {{supplying}} 55% of imports and absorbing 48% of exports. In a landmark case, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on 5 July 1994 against the British practice of importing produce from Northern Cyprus based on <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and phytosanitary <b>certificates</b> granted by the de facto authorities. The ECJ decided that only goods bearing <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> from the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus could be imported by EU member states. The decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU: from $36.4 million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7 million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996. Even so, the EU continues to be the second-largest trading partner of Northern Cyprus, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share of total exports.|$|R
