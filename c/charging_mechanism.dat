The liability to declare and pay the output tax is transferred to the recipient of the fulfillment within the reverse <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Since Apri 1 1, 2011 there has been extended the application of the reverse <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> to the domestic (home) fulfillments and since this date the mechanism has been applied to the delivery of slag, waste and metal scrap, defined in the Annex 5 and to the trading with the greenhouse gas emissions allowances. Since January 1, 2012 the reverse <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been applied also for construction and assembly works which leads to a significant extension of VAT payers which this provision may affect.

The {{current system of}} value added tax has weaknesses, including carousel fraud, negative impact on cash flow of businesses and complicated rules to collect and manage the tax. Reverse <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> is considered as a solution of existing weaknesses of current system. Although this regime is able to solve the mentioned weaknesses, it also has some disadvantages.

Other problems of introduction of reverse <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> include concentration of the whole tax with the last tax payer, issues at retail sales where tax payers and non-payers exist and minor complications in the transition to the new system. For all the negatives this thesis is trying to find solutions to eliminate or reduce them.

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the Colombian electricity market took place in 1994 and the pool started operation in 1995.

50|$|The R-23 cannon has an {{automatic}} <b>charging</b> <b>mechanism</b> that fires the cannon {{in case of}} a misfire. When one of the two pyrotechnical cartridges is fired, a small bolt inside that cartridge is accelerated to penetrate the side wall of the R-23 cartridge.

This unique and curious mechanism was used in the R-23 cannon for the first time. The same kind of mechanism with a single pyrotechnical cartridge was later incorporated into the 30 mm GSh-301 aircraft cannon.|$|E

50|$|The HK79 is {{fitted with}} an internal, single-action firing {{mechanism}} {{that has a}} <b>charging</b> <b>mechanism</b> located {{at the rear of}} the frame (the mechanism is cocked manually after loading the weapon) and a trigger mechanism with a button-type trigger located on the left-hand side of the handguard.

The safety mechanism’s “safe” and “ready” positions are marked with red and white rings respectively; the weapon can be loaded and cocked with the safety set at either position. A quadrant sight is provided for aiming, fitted to the right side of the grenade launcher, providing a rotating frame with a post and notch sight, graduated for distances from 50 to 350 m, every 50 m.

50|$|The A-12.7 {{machine gun}} is a gas-operated weapon with a {{vertically}} moving wedge breechblock. On the actuating slide two pivoting, jointed chambering levers are mounted. Those chambering levers actually work like {{the arms of}} a praying mantis. The upper, longer lever is used to ram the cartridge from the belt link into the chamber. An extraction claw on its forward end is used to extract the fired cartridge case. The lower lever protrudes into the weapon housing and has a U-shaped recess on its lower end. As the actuating slide moves back and forth, a traverse lug in the weapon housing is cammed into this recess to guide the chambering levers. The A-12.7 aircraft machine gun has an electrical sear mechanism that is operated by a voltage of 26V. At the back plate a spring buffer is located. Ammunition may be fed from either the left or from the right side. A pneumatically operated <b>charging</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{on the left side of}} the receiver is used to charge the machine gun and to clear misfires.

The plumes produced generate large perturbations in the surface atmospheric electric potential gradient and high charge densities have been measured on falling volcanic ash particles. The complex nature of volcanic plumes (which contain gases, solid particles, and liquid drops) provides several possible <b>charging</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> For plumes rich in solid silicate particles, fractoemission (the ejection of ions and atomic particles during fracture events) is probably the dominant source of charge generation. In other plumes, such as those created when lava enters the sea, different mechanisms, such as boiling, may be important.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{was developed for}} examining the thunderstorm electrification process {{in which it is}} assumed that the electrification is entirely due to noninductive charge transfer between colliding ice crystals and hail. Since this ice-hail <b>charge</b> <b>mechanism</b> is very dependent on particle sizes and distributions, an explicit microphysical framework is used. To maintain simplicity, the electrification model is kinematic; thus the temperature and velocity fields are input into the electrification model. The cloud model of Taylor (1989) was used to generate the temperature and velocity fields to examine the July 19, 1981, Cooperative Convective Precipitation Experiment thundercloud. Using these fields, the electrification model produced time-dependent ice particle concentrations, radar reflectivities, charge, and vertical electric field distributions in good general agreement with those observed. The model produced a maximum electric field strength of 1. 27 kV/cm, which is on the order of that needed for lightning initiation, and this maximum occurred very close to the time of the observed discharge.
