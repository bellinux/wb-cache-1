25|$|The writ {{of error}} coram nobis {{was one of}} the oldest {{remedies}} of the common law. It lay to correct a judgment rendered by the court upon errors of fact not appearing on the record and so important that if the court had known of them at the trial it would not have rendered the judgment. The ordinary writ of error lay to an appellate court to review an error of law apparent on the record. The writ of error coram nobis lay to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the <b>contested</b> <b>judgment.</b> Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to the docket for new trial.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred devoted {{considerable}} attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores {{his concern for}} judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing <b>contested</b> <b>judgments</b> made by his ealdormen and reeves and [...] "would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [...] in his absence anywhere in the realm {{to see whether they}} were just or unjust". A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.|$|R
50|$|PETA {{subsequently}} {{alleged that}} Berosini had moved more than $2 {{million out of}} the country to avoid paying court costs. Berosini and his wife, Joan, claimed that the money was for a land investment in Central and South America. In February 2000, a federal magistrate ordered Berosini to return the money, finding that Berosini was deliberately hiding his assets. Berosini and PETA agreed to a settlement in which Berosini paid $340,000 in court costs and interest. However, two years later, Berosini was ordered to pay three law firms $250,000 for the time they spent trying to find the $2 million. Berosini <b>contested</b> this <b>judgment</b> four times on appeal and lost each time, and PETA claims that it is considering further legal action against Berosini for filing a frivolous appeal.|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper {{explores the}} spatial and {{material}} {{context of a}} creative production project. Taking the music recording project as an empirical setting, it explores {{the creation of a}} pop song and reveals the highly situated character of its management and organisation. Making a creative product such as a pop song is a complex endeavor, requiring a large number of decisions involving highly subjective and often <b>contested</b> and contestable <b>judgments.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand how this is achieved. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on observation of musicians and a music producer during the creation of a pop song in a mid-sized recording studio. Interviews were also conducted with the participant musicians and 24 music producers based in the UK. The resulting qualitative data were analysed using a socio-material perspective to trace the spatial relationships and explore the material organization of the project. Findings Producing musical product is achieved through establishing spatial and material relations in order to regulate tasks and roles and manage the challenge of making decisions within temporarily assembled teams engaged in tasks characterised by high levels of uncertainty. Originality/value This paper tackles a neglected aspect of creative management, the physical context in which it is carried out. Other sites within the creative industries such as design and film studios, theatre and other performance spaces can usefully be analysed using the approach and perspective of this research...|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Mannesmann was {{acquired}} by Vodafone Group Plc. in a tax-free exchange of 53.7 Vodafone shares for each share of Mannesmann. This was a controversial takeover, since never before in Germany had a company as large and successful as Mannesmann been acquired in a hostile takeover by a non-German owner. The merger {{was said to have}} been engineered in a private deal concluded between Mannesmann’s management and Vodafone. The acquisition was spearheaded by Vodafone's Chief Executive, Chris Gent, and Goldman Sachs' Scott Mead, who was then the chief advisor on the deal.The circumstances of the deal and the (not only for German standards) particularly high severance payments awarded to leading managers of the company led in 2004 to a trial at Landgericht Düsseldorf (Düsseldorf Regional Court) - the so-called Mannesmann trial. The accused, among others the chairman of the supervisory board {{at the time of the}} takeover, Josef Ackermann, and the former CEO of Mannesmann, Klaus Esser, were initially granted a full discharge by the court. However, after revision proceedings, the Bundesgerichtshof Federal Court of Justice overruled the <b>contested</b> <b>judgment</b> and referred the case back for retrial at the Landgericht. On 29 November 2006, the proceedings were terminated, with the defendants agreeing to settlements amounting to millions of euros.|$|E
5000|$|Alabama {{state courts}} {{strictly}} follow the common-law {{definition of the}} writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct errors of fact. The writ may not be issued to correct errors of law. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Alabama (Citations and quotes removed): The writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy known more for its denial than its approval. Even so, Alabama Courts allow the writ of error coram nobis to attack judgments in certain restricted instances.When no rule or statute controls, [...] "the common law of England, {{so far as it}} is not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws and institutions of this state, shall, together with such institutions and laws, be the rule of decisions, and shall continue in force, except as from time to time it may be altered or repealed by the Legislature." [...] § 1-3-1, Ala. Code 1975.The writ of error coram nobis was one of the oldest remedies of the common law. It lay to correct a judgment rendered by the court upon errors of fact not appearing on the record and so important that if the court had known of them at the trial it would not have rendered the judgment. The ordinary writ of error lay to an appellate court to review an error of law apparent on the record. The writ of error coram nobis lay to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the <b>contested</b> <b>judgment.</b> Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to the docket for new trial.An evidentiary hearing must be held on a coram nobis petition which is meritorious on its face. An evidentiary hearing on a coram nobis petition are required upon meritorious allegations::*that counsel was denied.:*that the State used perjured testimony.:*that petitioner was not advised of right to appeal or right to transcript.:*of an ineffective assistance of counsel, specifically, failing to present alibi witnesses and failing to subpoena witnesses.:*of the denial of effective assistance of counsel.A writ of error coram nobis is also the proper procedural mechanism by which a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent may collaterally challenge that adjudication.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the design of}} recording studios {{in the management of}} relations within popular music recording projects. The creation of a pop song is a complex endeavor, requiring a large number of decisions involving highly subjective and often <b>contested</b> and contestable <b>judgments.</b> Organized in a flat structure and without established lines of authority this temporary assembly of people are faced with the challenge of making a product characterized by uncertainty over how to make it and what it will sound like once it is completed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to understand how this is achieved. The study is based on observation of the practices, and relationships operating in a recording studio and supplemented by interviews with the participants. Using a socio-material approach, the spatial organization and use of technological objects are included to produce a contextual analysis of how actions are organized and decisions taken. What emerges is an understanding of how the designed arrangement of the participants and the application of sound production and editing technology are used to manage the development of the song and confer decision-making authority upon the music producer. When the spatial organization of the participants is altered by the introduction of new technology and new spaces, the decision-making power of the producer is challenged and artist power is increased. The management of creative projects is achieved through establishing spatial and material relations in order to overcome the challenge of making decisions between temporarily assembled teams engaged in tasks characterized by high levels of uncertainty...|$|R
