It is demonstrated that the predicted habit plane and orientation relationship are coincident well with the observed crystallographic features. The polymorphic phase transformation of C-centred monoclinic structure to body-centred tetragonal structure is proposed to start from an initial Bain lattice correspondence that <b>close-packed</b> <b>plane</b> of matrix is parallel to <b>close-packed</b> <b>plane</b> of product, so is closed-packed direction.

CoPt films with the <b>close-packed</b> <b>plane</b> parallel to the substrate surface grow epitaxially on the Ru underlayer {{as well as on}} the MgO substrate. Flat surfaces with the arithmetical mean roughness value of 0. 2 nm are realized for both films. The crystal structure is determined by considering the atomic stacking sequence of <b>close-packed</b> <b>plane</b> and the order degree. The film formed on MgO substrate consists of an fcc-based L 11 ordered crystal, whereas the film grown on Ru underlayer involves an hcp-based Bh ordered crystal in addition to the L 11 ordered crystal. The order degrees of films formed on MgO substrate and Ru underlayer are 0. 30 and 0. 34, respectively. The L 11 crystal consists of two variants whose stacking sequences of <b>close-packed</b> <b>plane</b> are ABCABC … and ACBACB…, while the Bh crystal is a single-crystal with the stacking sequence of ABAB … Formation of Bh crystal is promoted on the Ru underlayer. The film formed on Ru underlayer shows a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy reflecting the magnetocrystalline anisotropies of L 11 and Bh crystals. ...|$|E

Defect count was decided by the optical scan method and scanning electron microscopy reviewing. Removal rate and corroded pits were found to decrease with increasing (111) /(200) ratio because (111), the <b>close-packed</b> <b>plane</b> of the face-centered cubic structure, has strong chemical resistance during polishing. Furthermore, incorporated impure atoms, such as carbon, chloride, and sulfur, tend to weaken grain boundaries to generate more corroded pits but do not affect removal rate.

Atomic resolution imaging of ultrathin single crystalline Au nanowires using aberration-corrected microscopy reveals an intriguing relaxation whereby the atoms in the <b>close-packed</b> atomic <b>planes</b> normal to the growth direction are displaced in the axial direction leading to wrinkling of the (111) atomic plane normal to the wire axis.

Detailed crystallographic analysis identified that intense BF variant selection occurs for the small-grained austenite, but due to the large austenite grain quantity, and thus the large total austenite grain boundary area per unit volume of the small-grained austenite, with the reduction of PAGS from 62. 8 μm to 22. 3 μm, the effective grain size of the transformed microstructure gradually decreases from 9. 5 μm to 5. 6 μm.

40|$|The {{identification}} of orientation relationships (ORs) plays {{a crucial role}} in the understanding of solid phase transformations. In steels, the most common models of ORs are the ones by Nishiyama–Wassermann (NW) and Kurdjumov– Sachs (KS). The defining feature of these and other OR models is the matching of directions and planes in the parent face-centred cubic gamma phase to ones in the product body-centred cubic/tetragonal alphaα' phase. In this article a novel method that identifies transformation strains with ORs is introduced and used to develop a new strain-based approach to phase-transformation models in steels. Using this approach, it is shown that the transformation strains that leave a <b>close-packed</b> <b>plane</b> in the gamma phase and a close-packed direction within that plane unrotated are precisely those giving rise to the NW and KS ORs when a cubic product phase is considered. Further, it is outlined how, by choosing different pairs of unrotated planes and directions, other common ORs such as the ones by Pitsch and Greninger–Troiano can be derived. One of the advantages of our approach is that it leads to a natural generalization of the NW, KS and other ORs for different ratios of tetragonality r of the product body-centred tetragonal alpha' phase. These generalized ORs predict a sharpening of the transformation textures with increasing tetragonality and are thus in qualitative agreement with experiments on steels with varying alloy concentratio...|$|E

The habit planes reported in literature for this type of martensite are { 557 }fcc, {{but it is not clear}} whether they correspond to the laths or to the blocks. In this paper, we present crystallographic calculations proving that the average of the two KS distortions associated with the variants in a block is exactly a NW distortion. A new method of averaging distortion matrices was introduced for this purpose. It is also shown that the { 575 }fcc planes are let untilted by this NW distortion, and are thus good theoretical candidates for the observed habit planes. The predicted { 575 }fcc planes, however, do not contain any of the common close-packed directions of the two variants in the block, which is in apparent contradiction with the current view. In order to clarify this point, some Electron BackScatter Diffraction (EBSD) maps were acquired on different low-carbon steels; the prior austenitic grains were automatically reconstructed and the traces of the habit planes predicted by the different models were analyzed and compared to the morphologies. This experimental work shows that { 575 }fcc planes are the habit plane of the blocks, and that the habit plane of one block often dominates the others, which impedes to discriminate the different models. The advantages of our model are its simplicity, the absence of fitting parameters, and the symmetric role played by the variants the blocks. Comment: 31 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
