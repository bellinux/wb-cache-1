As with the previous satellites, these are leased services under the FAA's Geostationary Satellite Communications <b>Control</b> <b>Segment</b> contract with Lockheed Martin for WAAS geostationary satellite leased services, who is contracted to provide up to three satellites through the year 2016. A third satellite was later added to the system. From March to November 2010, the FAA broadcast a WAAS test signal on a leased transponder on the Inmarsat-4 F3 satellite. The test signal was not usable for navigation, but could be received and was reported with the identification numbers PRN 133 (NMEA #46).

40|$|ANNUAL REPORT: 1988 - 89; SUBCONTRACT NUMBER: EO 6549 - 84 - 011 This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} isolate effects of electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by extremely low frequency (ELF) antenna systems on bird species breeding in or migrating through Wisconsin and Michigan. Specifically, we seek to determine if bird species richness and abundance differ between areas that {{are close to the}} antenna and those that are far enough away to be unaffected by the antenna. We are pursuing this question at both the community and species level. Characteristics examined include total species richness and abundance, abundances of common bird species, and abundances of birds within selected guilds. Our monitoring program includes bird censuses over a five month period from May to September (1986 - 1989). Additional data were collected in June of 1985 and August-September of 1984. Here we summarize results of our 1989 research activities. The Michigan transmitter began 150 amp tuning and testing intermittently {{in the first part of}} May. On the 14 th of May, the transmitter began continuous 150 amp operation for 16 hrs/day on weekdays and all day on weekends. On October 7 th, the Michigan transmitter began full power continuous operation. We therefore consider May 1989 to be a transitional period, and June through September to be impact periods. Bird abundance and species diversity were highest in June and July in Michigan and in May and June in Wisconsin. No significant differences in community level parameters (total individuals, total species) were noted in either state. Considerable annual variation in numbers of individuals and species was noted. Particularly abundant species (all seasons included) included the Nashville Warbler, Ovenbird, White-throated Sparrow, Red-eyed Vireo, Black-capped Chickadee, Hermit Thrush and Golden-crowned Kinglet. The most abundant species present on treatment and <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> varied among seasons and between states. Among "abundant" species (> 1 individual observed/ 500 m segment), five of 34 comparisons (over all seasons) revealed a significant difference between treatment and <b>control</b> XII <b>segments</b> in Michigan; four indicated a greater abundance on <b>control</b> <b>segments.</b> Six of 31 comparisons indicated a significant difference between treatment and <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> in Wisconsin; four indicated a greater abundance on <b>control</b> <b>segments.</b> Previous analyses of vegetation on Wisconsin and Michigan study sites (Blake et al. 1988) revealed differences between treatment and control plots. The difference most likely to influence bird populations was distribution of coniferous and deciduous habitats. Treatment segments supported more coniferous and lowland habitats than did control areas, in both states. To account for differences in habitat between treatment and <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> in Wisconsin, we paired treatment and <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> on the basis of habitat similarity and compared bird abundances on these paired segments (N = 15 pairs). (The Michigan study is designed as a "before-and-after" experiment and, thus, differences in habitat pose less of a problem for interpretation of bird distribution patterns.) Two of 31 comparisons of abundant species showed significant differences between paired segments in Wisconsin; in both cases, numbers were higher on treatment segments. The final report for Wisconsin will consider effects of vegetation on results from previous years and on distribution patterns of guilds. Eighteen of 105 comparisons of common species (based on prominence values) between treatment and <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> (all segments) in Michigan and 20 of 100 in Wisconsin were significant. Values were higher on <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> in Michigan in 9 cases; 6 of 20 were more abundant on control than on treatment segments in Wisconsin. Few species were consistently and significantly more abundant on either treatment or <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> among seasons within a year or within seasons between years. Differences between treatment and <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> are most likely due to habitat differences. Species were classified into guilds on the basis of foraging behavior and preferred breeding habitat. Few significant differences in abundances of birds within different guilds were found between treatment and <b>control</b> <b>segments.</b> Differences were most consistent for habitat categories, providing further evidence that habitat differences are responsible for many of the observed differences in bird distribution patterns between treatment and <b>control</b> <b>segments.</b> Natural Resources Research Institute, University of Minnesota, Dulut...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Acupuncture {{points and}} meridians are {{commonly}} believed to possess unique electrical properties. The experimental {{support for this}} claim is limited given the technical and methodological shortcomings of prior studies. Recent studies indicate a correspondence between acupuncture meridians and connective tissue planes. We hypothesized that segments of acupuncture meridians {{that are associated with}} loose connective tissue planes (between muscles or between muscle and bone) visible by ultrasound have greater electrical conductance (less electrical impedance) than non-meridian, parallel <b>control</b> <b>segments.</b> Methods We used a four-electrode method to measure the electrical impedance along segments of the Pericardium and Spleen meridians and corresponding parallel <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> in 23 human subjects. Meridian segments were determined by palpation and proportional measurements. Connective tissue planes underlying those segments were imaged with an ultrasound scanner. Along each meridian segment, four gold-plated needles were inserted along a straight line and used as electrodes. A parallel series of four control needles were placed 0. 8 cm medial to the meridian needles. For each set of four needles, a 3. 3 kHz alternating (AC) constant amplitude current was introduced at three different amplitudes (20, 40, and 80 μAmps) to the outer two needles, while the voltage was measured between the inner two needles. Tissue impedance between the two inner needles was calculated based on Ohm's law (ratio of voltage to current intensity). Results At the Pericardium location, mean tissue impedance was significantly lower at meridian segments (70. 4 ± 5. 7 Ω) compared with <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> (75. 0 ± 5. 9 Ω) (p = 0. 0003). At the Spleen location, mean impedance for meridian (67. 8 ± 6. 8 Ω) and <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> (68. 5 ± 7. 5 Ω) were not significantly different (p = 0. 70). Conclusion Tissue impedance was on average lower along the Pericardium meridian, but not along the Spleen meridian, compared with their respective controls. Ultrasound imaging of meridian and <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> suggested that contact of the needle with connective tissue may explain the decrease in electrical impedance noted at the Pericardium meridian. Further studies are needed to determine whether tissue impedance is lower in (1) connective tissue in general compared with muscle and (2) meridian-associated vs. non meridian-associated connective tissue. </p...|$|R

To determine whether vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) expression {{may play a}} role in inflammatory cell recruitment into human atherosclerotic lesions, immunohistochemistry was performed with a polyclonal rabbit antisera, raised against recombinant human VCAM- 1, on 24 atherosclerotic coronary plaques and 11 <b>control</b> coronary <b>segments</b> with nonatherosclerotic diffuse intimal thickening from 10 patients. Immunophenotyping was performed on adjacent sections to identify smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. To confirm VCAM- 1 -expressing cell types, double immunostaining with VCAM- 1 antisera and each of the cell-specific markers and in situ hybridization were performed. All atherosclerotic plaques contained some VCAM- 1, compared to 45 % of <b>control</b> <b>segments.</b> VCAM- 1 was found infrequently on endothelial cells at the arterial lumen din both plaques (21 %) and in <b>control</b> <b>segments</b> (27 %), but was prevalent in areas of neovascularization and inflammatory infiltrate in the base of plaques. Double immunostaining and in situ hybridization confirmed that most VCAM- 1 was expressed by subsets of plaque smooth muscle cells and macrophages.
