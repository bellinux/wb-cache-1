25|$|One {{potential}} {{event is}} the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires {{more resources to}} complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity. Reallocation of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a <b>certain</b> <b>value.</b> Events {{can be used to}} model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} protect the {{population}} living around base stations and users of mobile handsets, governments and regulatory bodies adopt safety standards, which translate to limits on exposure levels below a <b>certain</b> <b>value.</b> There are many proposed national and international standards, but that of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is the most respected one, and has been adopted so far by more than 80 countries. For radio stations, ICNIRP proposes two safety levels: one for occupational exposure, another one for the general population. Currently there are efforts underway to harmonise the different standards in existence.|$|E
25|$|Multi-sided {{platforms}} exist {{because there}} is a need of intermediary in order to match both parts of the platform in a more efficient way. Indeed, this intermediary will minimize the overall cost, for instance, by avoiding duplication, or by minimizing transaction costs. This intermediary will make possible exchanges that would not occur without them and create value for both sides. Two-sided platforms, by playing an intermediary role, produce <b>certain</b> <b>value</b> for both users (parties) that are interconnected through it, and therefore those sides (parties) may both be evaluated as customers (unlike in the traditional seller-buyer dichotomy).|$|E

25|$|Even if the {{expression}} > always evaluates to true at run-time, most type checkers will reject {{the program as}} ill-typed, because it is difficult (if not impossible) for a static analyzer to determine that the else branch will not be taken. Conversely, a static type checker will quickly detect type errors in rarely used code paths. Without static type checking, even code coverage tests with 100% coverage {{may be unable to}} find such type errors. The tests may fail to detect such type errors, because the combination of all places where values are created and all places where a <b>certain</b> <b>value</b> is used must be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|If {{a circle}} {{boundary}} is drawn around the two-dimensional {{view of a}} fractal, the fractal will never cross the boundary, {{this is due to}} the scaling of each successive iteration of the fractal being smaller. When fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the fractal increases, while the area will never exceed a <b>certain</b> <b>value.</b> A fractal in three-dimensional space is similar, however, a difference between fractals in two dimensions and three dimensions, is that a three dimensional fractal will increase in surface area, but never exceed a certain volume. This can be utilized to maximize the efficiency of ion propulsion, when choosing electron emitter construction and material. If done correctly, the efficiency of the emission process can be maximized.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} a star, {{the mass of the}} star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter. The paths of all the star's satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter. Each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse. At any point along its orbit, any satellite will have a <b>certain</b> <b>value</b> of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter, and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches periapsis, the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases; as a planet approaches apoapsis, its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.|$|E

25|$|These {{examples}} show that, in {{the absence}} of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else. In short, {{in the absence}} of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of <b>certain</b> <b>value</b> (good money), while the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.|$|E
25|$|Express trust: An {{express trust}} arises where a settlor {{deliberately}} and consciously decides {{to create a}} trust, over their assets, either now, or upon his or her later death. In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a will or a trust deed. Almost all trusts {{dealt with in the}} trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts. The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an express trust to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property. In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a <b>certain</b> <b>value,</b> or is real estate.|$|E

500|$|For instance, {{recall the}} {{one-dimensional}} cellular automaton {{defined as an}} example from a rectangular band, in which the cell states are pairs of values (l,r) drawn from sets [...] and [...] of left values and right values, the left value of each cell moves rightwards at each time step, and the right value of each cell moves leftwards. In this case, for each left or right value [...] of the band, one can define a conserved quantity, {{the total number of}} cells that have that value. If there are [...] left values and [...] right values, then there are [...] independent first-order-invariants, and any first-order invariant can be represented as a linear combination of these fundamental ones. The conserved quantities associated with left values flow uniformly to the right at a constant rate: that is, if the number of left values equal to [...] within some region [...] of the line takes a <b>certain</b> <b>value</b> at time , then it will take the same value for the shifted region [...] at time [...] Similarly, the conserved quantities associated with right values flow uniformly to the left.|$|E
500|$|A {{technical}} device much used by Mahler {{is that of}} [...] "progressive tonality," [...] which Deryck Cooke {{describes as}} [...] "the procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that {{in which it was}} stated," [...] and which is often used [...] "to symbolise the gradual ascendancy of a <b>certain</b> <b>value</b> by progress from one key to another over the whole course of a symphony." [...] This technique was also used by Mahler's Danish contemporary Carl Nielsen. Mahler first employed the device in an early song, Erinnerung ("Memory"), and thereafter used it freely in his symphonies. For example, the predominant key of the First Symphony is D major; {{at the beginning of the}} Finale, the [...] "conflict" [...] movement, the key switches to F minor, and only after a lengthy battle gets back to D, near the end. The Second Symphony begins in C minor and ends in E flat. The movements of the Fifth Symphony progress successively from C-sharp minor to A minor, then D major, F major and finally to D major. The Sixth Symphony, unusually for Mahler, begins and ends in the same key, A minor, signifying that in this case the conflict is unresolved.|$|E
500|$|A cyst of {{the genus}} Azotobacter is the resting form of a {{vegetative}} cell; however, whereas usual vegetative cells are reproductive, the cyst of Azotobacter does not serve this purpose and is necessary for surviving adverse environmental factors. Following the resumption of optimal environmental conditions, which include a <b>certain</b> <b>value</b> of pH, temperature, and source of carbon, the cysts germinate, and the newly formed vegetative cells multiply by a simple division. During the germination, the cysts sustain damage and release a large vegetative cell. Microscopically, the first manifestation of spore germination is the gradual decrease in light refractive by cysts, which is detected with phase contrast microscopy. Germination of cysts, a slow process, takes about 4–6 h. During germination, the central body grows and captures the granules of volutin, which were located in the intima (the innermost layer). Then the exine bursts and the vegetative cell is freed from the exine, which has a characteristic horseshoe shape. This process is accompanied by metabolic changes. Immediately after being supplied with a carbon source, the cysts begin to absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide; the rate of this process gradually increases and saturates after four hours. The synthesis of proteins and RNA, [...] occurs in parallel, but it intensifies only after five hours after {{the addition of the}} carbon source. The synthesis of DNA and nitrogen fixation are initiated 5 h after the addition of glucose to a nitrogen-free nutrient medium.|$|E
