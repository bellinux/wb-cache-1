5|$|Academically, the University of Toronto {{is noted}} for {{influential}} movements and curricula in literary criticism and <b>communication</b> <b>theory,</b> known collectively as the Toronto School. The university was {{the birthplace of}} insulin and stem cell research, and {{was the site of}} the first practical electron microscope, the development of multi-touch technology, the identification of the first black hole Cygnus X-1, and the development of the theory of NP-completeness. By a significant margin, it receives the most annual scientific research funding of any Canadian university. It is one of two members of the Association of American Universities outside the United States, the other being McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, {{in terms of its}} actual page numbers, {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and <b>communication</b> <b>theory.</b> The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E
5|$|Prominent alumni in {{the field}} of science include Douglas L. Coleman, who {{discovered}} leptin, Richard Bader, noted for his work on the atoms in molecules theory, Harold E. Johns, who pioneered the use of cobalt-60 in the treatment of cancer, Karl Clark, who pioneered the separation method to extract bitumen from the oil sands, and Steve Mann, a researcher and inventor {{in the field}} of computational photography. Notable faculty members include chemist Ronald Gillespie, who helped shape VSEPR theory, as well as David Sackett and Gordon Guyatt, whose research team was largely credited for largely establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. Prominent alumni {{in the field of}} social sciences was Harold Innis, who helped shape <b>communication</b> <b>theory</b> and the staples thesis, and sociologist Henry Giroux, one of the founding theorists of critical pedagogy.|$|E

25|$|In public health, he {{advocated}} establishing a medical administrative authority, with powers over epidemiology and veterinary medicine. He worked {{to set up}} a coherent medical training program, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program, and discussed the balance of trade. He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as game theory. In sociology he laid the ground for <b>communication</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
25|$|As the war {{came to an}} end, his {{research}} focus shifted to include not only military but civilian research projects as well. On the military side he continued pursuing ballistic missile research, including research on antiballistic missile defence and associated computing algorithms, and in the civilian domain he concentrated on modern <b>communication</b> <b>theory.</b> On the post-war military research front {{he worked on the}} Nike Zeus missile project as part of a team with Douglas Aircraft, and later on the design of anti-ballistic missiles.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to apply three <b>communication</b> <b>theories</b> (namely, Argumentation Theory, the Foot-in-the-Door Technique, and the Door-in-the-Face Technique) to the {{formulation}} of complaints that communicate effectively to company employees and yield compensation for the consumer. What the authors demonstrate is that complaining is not a haphazard procedure if <b>communication</b> <b>theories</b> are applied properly. In addition, also emphasized is the importance of self-efficacy, as a psychological component, to illustrate the necessity for complainers to have sufficient and trueself-confidence in order to carry out each of these theories in practice...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, earlier International <b>communication</b> <b>theories</b> {{have failed}} to develop models or {{research}} agendas that match {{the reality of the}} contemporary role of global <b>communication.</b> The old <b>theories</b> only explain part of the global picture and the theories of modernization, dependency, and cultural imperialism {{have failed to}} satisfactorily explain global communication.|$|R

25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in <b>communication</b> <b>theory</b> is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E
25|$|An n-gram {{model is}} a type of {{probabilistic}} language model for predicting the next item in such a sequence {{in the form of a}} (n−1)–order Markov model. n-gram models are now widely used in probability, <b>communication</b> <b>theory,</b> computational linguistics (for instance, statistical natural language processing), computational biology (for instance, biological sequence analysis), and data compression. Two benefits of n-gram models (and algorithms that use them) are simplicity and scalability – with larger n, a model can store more context with a well-understood space–time tradeoff, enabling small experiments to scale up efficiently.|$|E
25|$|Argumentation {{theory is}} {{interdisciplinary}} {{in the sense}} that no one discipline will be able to provide a complete account. A full appreciation of argumentation requires insights from logic (both formal and informal), rhetoric, <b>communication</b> <b>theory,</b> linguistics, psychology, and, increasingly, computer science. Since the 1970s, there has been significant agreement that there are three basic approaches to argumentation theory: the logical, the rhetorical and the dialectical. According to Wenzel, the logical approach deals with the product, the dialectical with the process, and the rhetorical with the procedure. Thus, informal logic is one contributor to this inquiry, being most especially concerned with the norms of argument.|$|E
40|$|From the {{disciplinary}} perspective of communication studies, we review {{theory and research}} in family communication, including {{a brief history of}} the family communication field; the contributions of a family communication perspective; and 5 theories of family communication: <b>communication</b> accommodation <b>theory,</b> <b>communication</b> privacy management <b>theory,</b> family <b>communication</b> patterns <b>theory,</b> narrative theor(ies), and relational dialectics theory. We then illustrate the concept of discourse dependence in family communication processes and discuss current trends in family communication research. We also suggest emerging directions for family communication scholarship...|$|R

25|$|Feminist <b>communication</b> <b>theory</b> also {{encompasses}} {{access to}} the public sphere, whose voices are heard in that sphere, {{and the ways in}} which the field of communication studies has limited what is regarded as essential to public discourse. The recognition of a full history of women orators overlooked and disregarded by the field has effectively become an undertaking of recovery, as it establishes and honors the existence of women in history and lauds the communication by these historically significant contributors. This recovery effort, begun by Andrea Lunsford, Professor of English and Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at Stanford University and followed by other feminist communication theorists also names women such as Aspasia, Diotima, and Christine de Pisan, who were likely influential in rhetorical and communication traditions in classical and medieval times, but who have been negated as serious contributors to the traditions.|$|E
500|$|The University of Toronto is {{the birthplace}} of an {{influential}} school of thought on <b>communication</b> <b>theory</b> and literary criticism, known as the Toronto School. Described as [...] "the theory of the primacy of communication in the structuring of human cultures and the structuring of the human mind", the school {{is rooted in the}} works of Eric A. Havelock and Harold Innis and the subsequent contributions of Edmund Snow Carpenter, Northrop Frye and Marshall McLuhan. Since 1963, the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology of the Faculty of Information has carried the mandate for teaching and advancing the Toronto School.|$|E
500|$|Innis's {{writings}} on communication explore {{the role of}} media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations. He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC. He warned, however, that Western civilization is now imperiled by powerful, advertising-driven media obsessed by [...] "present-mindedness" [...] and the [...] "continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity". His intellectual bond with Eric A. Havelock formed {{the foundations of the}} Toronto School of <b>communication</b> <b>theory,</b> which provided a source of inspiration for future members of the school: Marshall McLuhan and Edmund Snow Carpenter.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the {{two step}} flow model and other <b>communication</b> <b>theories</b> {{suggest that the}} media does not {{directly}} have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even selective exposure play {{a larger role in}} influencing the public in the modern age.|$|R

500|$|Harold Adams Innis ( [...] ; November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a Canadian {{professor}} of political economy at the University of Toronto {{and the author of}} seminal works on media, <b>communication</b> <b>theory,</b> and Canadian economic history. [...] Despite his dense and difficult prose, Innis was one of Canada's most original thinkers. He helped develop the staples thesis, which holds that Canada's culture, political history, and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of [...] "staples" [...] such as fur, fishing, lumber, wheat, mined metals, and coal. [...] The staple thesis dominated economic history in Canada 1930s-1960s, and continues to be a fundamental part of the Canadian political economy tradition.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: <b>Communication</b> <b>Theory,</b> Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E

The article established INMS as a field which “refines and expands twentieth-century intercultural <b>communication</b> <b>theories,</b> examining their salience in a digital world” and challenged communication researchers to investigate the impact of new media on intercultural communication. Intercultural new media studies provides a theoretical framework for exploring (1) the influence of culture on the social uses of new media, (2) how new media changes culture, and (3) how new media affects extant intercultural <b>communication</b> <b>theories,</b> {{most of which were}} developed in the twentieth century and grounded in a face-to-face paradigm.|$|R

2500|$|Shannon's work on {{cryptography}} {{was even}} {{more closely related to}} his later publications on <b>communication</b> <b>theory.</b> At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for Bell Telephone Labs entitled [...] "A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography," [...] dated September 1945. A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as [...] "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" [...] in the Bell System Technical Journal. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Shannon said that his wartime insights into <b>communication</b> <b>theory</b> and cryptography developed simultaneously and that [...] "they were so close together you couldn’t separate them". In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to [...] "develop these results … in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Neil Sloane, an AT Fellow who co-edited Shannon's large {{collection}} of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's <b>communication</b> <b>theory</b> (now called information theory) {{is the foundation}} of the digital revolution, and every device containing a microprocessor or microcontroller is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's publication in 1948: [...] "He's one of the great men of the century.

40|$|There are few works {{which deals}} with problem of {{communication}} of people with disabilities. In Poland there are mainly pedagogical and psychological publications.
