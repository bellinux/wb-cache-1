Microbiological analysis was carried out using colonies of Escherichia coli transported directly from a culture dish to the prosthetic component. Friction implants (Group 1) were activated by tapping and a torque wrench was used for screw-tightened implants (Groups 2 and 3). Each abutment/implant set was immersed in test tubes containing 5 mL of brain-heart infusion broth and incubated at 37 &# 176;C for 14 days, observed daily for the presence of contamination. A statistically significant difference was observed regarding the number of contaminated implants. There was greater contamination in Group 2 implants (p< 0. 05), with no statistically significant difference between the other groups (Group 1 = 20 % and Group 3 = 0 %).

40|$|The {{success rate}} of osseointegrated {{implants}} {{is reported to be}} above 90 %. Despite of the knowledge of the mechanisms of osseointegration, some faults still occur at implants systems. Recent researches assign those faults mainly to patient’s prosthetic rehabilitation. The misfit at abutment-implant interface and the missing of a passive adaptation between the prosthesis and the abutment can lead prosthesis components, abutment screw or implants to fracture. This misfit can also generate a inadequate load distribution to marginal bone, bacterial plaque accumulation and even though, a complete loss of osseo integration. The origin of the loss of displacement of the prosthesis is a complex process, involving factors as: implant material properties, implant design, conical degree, machining accuracy of the components, fatigue, fluid and bacterial microleakage, masticatory functions and others. Considering the importance of a higher longevity to the osseointegrated implants and the necessity to obtain the best adjustment that is possible at the abutment-implant interface, this research will perform a literature review about the perfect adjustment needed at abutment-implant interface, yours biomechanical, functional, biological and clinical implications and also will study the different methods to analyze this interface.

40|$|Shaft sinking is an {{important}} part of the mining process, of which “mucking” (clearing the broken rock from the bottom of the shaft) plays a critical role. The aim of the research was to develop a scaled experimental replica of the so-called Clamshell Mucker and compare its performance, over a range of operating parameters, with those yielded by numerical simulations, for the long-term purpose of validating the simulation as a tool for optimizing the design of full-scale machines. Towards this end a scaled experimental rig of the clamshell mucker was developed and tested over an appropriate range of geometrical and operating parameters, for two different materials: hard plastic balls and thereafter 13 mm decomposed granite stone. Hydraulic actuator forces were established by measuring line pressures, while angular rotation of the jaws of the mucker was monitored using an angular potentiometer. Simple analysis provided a relationship between actuator force and torque on the buckets. The stone in the muck reservoir was agitated after each test run, to ensure random particle arrangements with no structuring, and a constant digging depth. Testing of the hard plastic balls was used to establish a qualitative comparison between Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) and physical testing, using both video and still photography comparisons, corresponding to the teeth initially touching the surface with a bucket closing velocity of 20 deg/s. Heuristic correlations obtained by this means were generally favourable. Quantitative testing using 13 mm granite stone yielded the bucket <b>closing</b> <b>torque</b> variation with bucket angle for various combinations of:- (a) bucket closing velocity, (b) initial distance of the bucket from the muck pile, (c) proximity of the bucket to the side and front walls of the container, and (d) the angle at which bucket assembly enters the muck pile. The main set of tests took place with the bucket entering vertically and positioned in the middle of the bed. Three different initial distances from the surface to the starting position of the bucket teeth were investigated (20 mm, 10 mm and 0 mm), with bucket angular velocities of 10 deg/s, 15 deg/s and 20 deg/s. Thereafter, testing was conducted at the forward (polycarbonate) boundary of the container and one of the lateral boundaries (steel) respectively, each for a single bucket velocity of 20 deg/s and covering the three above-mentioned initial distances from the surface. This testing was performed in an attempt to simulate the proximity effects that would be encountered in practice - for example, digging close to a side wall. Finally, torque variations with bucket angle were established at four different angles of attack (0 ±, 5 ±, 15 ± and 30 ±), at a constant bucket closing velocity of 20 deg/s, with the closest portion of the bucket initially touching the surface. Data was generally interpreted in the context of the fact the torque required to rotate the buckets appears to depend on an interplay between:- (a) the level of fluidization between particles in the bed, increasing with bucket closing velocity, results in a reduced torque; (b) particulate congestion, increasing as the initial distance from the surface of the granular material decreases, results in an increased torque; and (c) the momentum required to move the particles and change their direction, increasing with bucket velocity, results in an increased torque. Accordingly, for the larger initial distances from the surface momentum effects are dominant, generally leading to an increase of torque with angular velocity. However, as the initial distance reduces, congestion becomes increasingly important, until for the zero initial separation case, the lowest angular velocity yields the highest torques, probably because fluidization has been inhibited. Because particle to boundary interactions have lower friction than particle to particle interactions, torques in the presence of boundaries were lower than for the middle position in the initial stages. Beyond a certain point, proximity to the forward boundary led to congestion with a commensurate increase in torque above that of the middle case, whereas proximity to the lateral boundary led to no congestion, so the torques remained generally lower than for the middle case. When considering the effects of angle of penetration, it was found that the largest angle of penetration (30 ±) gave the highest torque in the initial stages, probably because the highest volumes of material are captured relative to other angles of attack. Beyond a bucket angle of about 14 ± congestion becomes increasingly dominant, with the rise in torque due to this effect generally delayed with increasing angles of attack. This phenomenon was ascribed to the fact that in all cases other than zero angle of penetration, only one jaw initially enters the material, with the second following at a later stage: therefore particles escape to a free surface for the mid-range bucket angles, with the onset of congestion commensurately delayed to the larger ones. Comparisons between DEM data and measurements for various testing parameters showed that the simulated and physical results display similar values of torque towards the beginning and end of the digging motion, but DEM predictions are low in the middle of the range. This is thought to arise primarily from the fact that simplified particle geometries (smooth, with no sharp edges) were incorporated into the DEM model because of computational resource limitations, whereas the real granular particles have sharp edges and are blocky, thus increasing particle interlocking effects and the high level of congestion frequently exhibited in the physical experimentation. This effect was generally reflected by poor comparisons between DEM data and experimentation in the context of torque variations with velocity in the middle range of angular positions. Because the coefficients of rolling friction and restitution were obtained from published data, additional simplified simulations were run to determine the sensitivity of these parameters (in addition to static friction coefficient, for comparative purposes) on the force characteristics of the model. It was established that specifically chosen percentage changes in all of the parameter values relative to the base system led to percentages of force deviation that were at least 3 to 5 times smaller, reinforcing the inference that particle interlocking effects were the dominant reason for poor mid-range correlations between experimentation and the DEM modelling. The maximum energy to fill the buckets was required at a zero angle of penetration, diminishing significantly to an angle of about 15 ± and then increasing once again. This trend is attributed to the fact that the 0 ± case is most affected by congestion, whereas the larger angles of attack (beyond about 20 ±) cause the weight of the material to significantly affect the energy required to close the buckets. While it was considered possible that similar trends would be observed in practice, that could potentially reflect in improved operational guidelines for the mucking process, further analysis suggested that an energy saving of less than 814. 3 kJ might be attainable for clearing a 6 m diameter shaft during a single cycle. While this appears to be inconsequential in the broader context, it should be subjected to a more comprehensive investigation in the context of full-scale cleaning strategies. It is recommended that:- (a) the test facility be modified to extend the range of bucket angular velocities; (b) testing be conducted with a broader range of particle sizes; (c) research into the interlocking and frictional effects of rock be pursued, to create representative particulate shapes as input to the DEM model; (d) higher friction coefficients be attempted as a means of artificially compensating for interlocking effects that are impractical to achieve because of computer resource limitations; and (e) testing be conducted with a range of different bucket shapes and sizes for the purpose of optimizing the design by way of minimizing structural stresses and the specific energies required to collect individual loads...|$|E

The manipulator is being developed concurrently by Odetics Inc., under internal research and development funding. This SBIR contract supports algorithm conception, development, and simulation, as well as software implementation and integration with the manipulator hardware. The Odetics Dexterous Manipulator is a lightweight, high strength, modular manipulator being developed for space and commercial applications. It has seven fully active degrees of freedom, is electrically powered, and is fully operational in 1 G. The manipulator consists of five self-contained modules. These modules join via simple quick-disconnect couplings and self-mating connectors which allow rapid assembly/disassembly for reconfiguration, transport, or servicing. Each joint incorporates a unique drive train design which provides zero backlash operation, is insensitive to wear, and is single fault tolerant to motor or servo amplifier failure. The sensing system is also designed to be single fault tolerant. Although the initial prototype is not space qualified, the design is well-suited to meeting space qualification requirements. The control algorithm design approach is to develop a hierarchical system with well defined access and interfaces at each level. The high level endpoint/configuration control algorithm transforms manipulator endpoint position/orientation commands to joint angle commands, providing task space motion. At the same time, the kinematic redundancy is resolved by controlling the configuration (pose) of the manipulator, using several different optimizing criteria. The center level of the hierarchy servos the joints to their commanded trajectories using both linear feedback and model-based nonlinear control techniques.

40|$|Field {{oriented}} {{control is}} an established technique for rapid control of torque in induction motors. The controller tracks {{the orientation of}} the rotor flux, which rotates at synchronous frequency. The component of stator current in phase with this flux (known as the "flux current"), can be used to maintain a constant flux. Under these conditions, torque is directly proportional to the quadrature component of stator current, or "torque current". It has not proved cost-effective to measure either the rotor flux orientation or the motor torque directly. However both can be estimated from a combination of voltages and/or currents and position (or speed). The standard mathematical model uses the resistances and inductances of the motor equivalent circuit. These parameters may vary with temperature, motor operating speed and load. The underlying cause, range and timescale of these variations is examined, along with techniques for tracking the changes on-line. Detailed off-line characterisation results are presented for the test motor, in order to determine how accurately the parameters can be identified in practice. A number of standard torque and flux estimators have been analysed and implemented. Experimental results are presented for a 5. 5 kW motor drive system. Parameter errors and delays within the controller, which cause an error in {{the orientation of the}} stator currents, are shown to affect the motor performance. The motor is incorrectly fluxed, which may reduce its efficiency and peak torque capability in the steady state.

A static torque is applied to a driveline system via the mass of an overhanging torsion bar and electromagnet. Then an applied load may be varied via attached mass and released to simulate the step down (tip-out) response of the system. Shaft torques and torsional and translational accelerations are recorded at pre-defined locations. The static <b>torque</b> <b>closes</b> up the driveline clearances in the pinion/ring (crown wheel) mesh. With release of the applied load the driveline undergoes transient vibration. Further, the ratio of preload to static load is adjusted to lead to either no-impact or impact events. Test A provides a ‘linear’ result where the contact stiffness does not pass into clearance. This test is used for confirming transient response and studying friction and damping. Test B is for mass release with sufficient applied torque to pass into clearance, allowing {{the study of the}} clunk. A set of non-linear differential equations describe the experiment and the applicable dry friction coefficients are experimentally found. Various test conditions (corresponding to no impacts, and single-sided or double-sided impacts) are successfully simulated. Numerical and experimental time histories compare well...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{their natural}} {{habitats}} bacteria are frequently exposed to sudden changes in temperature {{that have been}} shown to affect their swimming. With our believed to be new methods of rapid temperature control for single-molecule microscopy, we measured here the thermal response of the Na+-driven chimeric motor expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Motor torque at low load (0. 35 μm bead) increased linearly with temperature, twofold between 15 °C and 40 °C, and torque at high load (1. 0 μm bead) was independent of temperature, as reported for the H+-driven motor. Single cell membrane voltages were measured by fluorescence imaging and these were almost constant (∼ 120  mV) over the same temperature range. When the motor was heated above 40 °C for 1 – 2  min the torque at high load dropped reversibly, recovering upon cooling below 40 °C. This response was repeatable over as many as 10 heating cycles. Both increases and decreases in torque showed stepwise torque changes with unitary size ∼ 150 pN nm, <b>close</b> to the <b>torque</b> of a single stator at room temperature (∼ 180 pN nm), indicating that dynamic stator dissociation occurs at high temperature, with rebinding upon cooling. Our results suggest that the temperature-dependent assembly of stators is a general feature of flagellar motors...|$|R
40|$|Kaminski, Thomas W. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if an eccentric exercise-training regimen in conjunction with an athlete???s offseason exercise program can produce a significant shift in optimum length of the hamstrings in athletes of different sports with diverse training protocols. Thirty-one athletes were randomly assigned to an eccentric exercise-training group (EG) or a control group (CG). Over a 7 -week period the EG performed two eccentric exercises while the CG performed a stretching protocol over this time in addition to their normal training routine. Isokinetic-testing was performed pre and post intervention to determine optimum length. Significant attrition lead to an inability to report a significant group by time interaction between the EG and CG (F 1, 13 = 2. 27, p=. 156). Examination of simple main effects determined there was a significant shift of optimum length in the EG (t= 2. 725, p=. 030). No significant changes were seen in the optimum length of the CG or normalized concentric and eccentric peak torque values in both groups. In conclusion, 7 weeks of additional eccentric exercise training shifted the angle of peak <b>torque</b> <b>closer</b> to knee extension in the EG, increasing the optimum length of the hamstrings in Division I football, baseball, and lacrosse athletes.

40|$|Scrupulous {{measurements}} and detailed data {{analysis of the}} torque in a swirling turbulent flow driven by counter-rotating bladed disks reveals an apparent breaking {{of the law of}} similarity. Potentially, such breakdown could arise from several possible factors, including dependence on dimensionless numbers other that $Re$ or velocity coupling to other fields such as temperature. However, careful redesign and calibration of the experiment showed that this unexpected result was due to background errorscaused by minute misalignments which lead to a noisy and irreproducible torque signal at low rotation speeds and prevented correct background subtraction normally ascribed to frictional losses. An important lesson to be learnt is that multiple minute misalignments can nonlinearly couple to the torque signal and provide a dc offset that cannot be removed by averaging. That offset can cause the observed divergence of the friction coefficient C_f from its constant value observed in the turbulent regime. To minimize the friction and misalignments, we significantly modified the experimental setup and carried out the experiment with one bladed disk where the disk, torque meter and motor shaft axes can be aligned with significantly smaller error, <b>close</b> to the <b>torque</b> meter resolution. As a result we made precise measurements with high resolution and sensitivity of the small torques produced for low rotation speeds for several water-glycerin solutions of different viscosities and confirmed the similarity law {{in a wide range of}} Re in particular in low viscosity fluids.

40|$|Due to {{the ever}} {{increasing}} number of industrial robots in the world, working day and night producing and manufacturing, a need has arisen {{to make sure that}} these robots work energy efficient. This is both to make robots cost effective for businesses and environmentally friendly. During the course of this thesis a method for planning an energy efficient velocity profile for an ABB IRB 1600 robot has been developed. This method does not only look at the assignment of velocity and acceleration along a path, but also the gain of energy efficiency that optimizing the position and orientation of a manipulation task have. The result of this method shows that the optimal position and orientation gives a minimization of the movement of the second joint, and that at this optimal position the gain in energy efficiency of the optimal orientation is 161. 1 % from the horizontal plane. The optimal trajectory also have a 16. 3 % smaller energy consumption than a trajectory made by ABBs own motion planner in the optimal plane. Thus, the work done in this thesis optimize energy in two ways. Experiments were also performed to find the maximum and minimum torque for the first three joints of the robot. This was supposed to be used when constraining acceleration and jerk. These constraints were however excluded from the optimization scheme as the energy efficient trajectories obtained were nowhere <b>close</b> to the <b>torque</b> bounds. These experimental results are however greatly of interest when looking at time-optimal trajectories, and can be reused for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|The torque in {{turbulent}} Taylor-Couette flows for shear Reynolds numbers Re_S up to 3 x 10 ^ 4 {{at various}} mean rotations is studied {{by means of}} direct numerical simulations for a radius ratio of η= 0. 71. Convergence of simulations is tested using three criteria of which the agreement of dissipation values estimated from the torque and from the volume dissipation rate {{turns out to be}} most demanding. We evaluate the influence of Taylor vortex heights on the torque for a stationary outer cylinder and select a value of the aspect ratio of Γ= 2, <b>close</b> to the <b>torque</b> maximum. The connection between the torque and the transverse current J^ω of azimuthal motion which can be computed from the velocity field enables us to investigate the local transport resulting in the torque. The typical spatial distribution of the individual convective and viscous contributions to the local current is analysed for a turbulent flow case. To characterise the turbulent statistics of the transport, PDF's of local current fluctuations are compared to experimental wall shear stress measurements. PDF's of instantaneous torques reveal a fluctuation enhancement in the outer region for strong counter-rotation. Moreover, we find for simulations realising the same shear Re_S>= 2 x 10 ^ 4 the formation of a torque maximum for moderate counter-rotation with angular velocities ω_o≈- 0. 4 ω_i. In contrast, for Re_S<= 4 x 10 ^ 3 the torque features a maximum for a stationary outer cylinder. In addition, the effective torque scaling exponent is shown to also depend on the mean rotation state. Finally, we evaluate a close connection between boundary-layer thicknesses and the torque.

40|$|We study wakes and gap opening by {{low mass}} planets in gaseous protoplanetary disks {{threaded}} by net vertical magnetic fields which drive magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence through the magnetorotational instabilty (MRI), using three dimensional simulations in the unstratified local shearing box approximation. The wakes, which are {{excited by the}} planets, are damped by shocks similar to the wake damping in inviscid hydrodynamic (HD) disks. Angular momentum deposition by shock damping opens gaps in both MHD turbulent disks and inviscid HD disks even for low mass planets, in contradiction to the "thermal criterion" for gap opening. To test the "viscous criterion", we compared gap properties in MRI-turbulent disks to those in viscous HD disks having the same stress, {{and found that the}} same mass planet opens a significantly deeper and wider gap in net vertical flux MHD disks than in viscous HD disks. This difference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gap region in MRI disks, leading to a larger effective α within the gap. Thus, across the gap, the Maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap density profile, and a deeper gap is needed for the Maxwell stress gradient to balance the planetary torque density. We also confirmed the large excess <b>torque</b> <b>close</b> to the planet in MHD disks, and found that long-lived density features (termed zonal flows) produced by the MRI can affect planet migration. The comparison with previous results from net toroidal flux/zero flux MHD simulations indicates that the magnetic field geometry {{plays an important role in}} the gap opening process. Overall, our results suggest that gaps can be commonly produced by low mass planets in realistic protoplanetary disks, and caution the use of a constant α-viscosity to model gaps in protoplanetary disks.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To study bone healing at {{implants}} installed {{with different}} insertion torques. MATERIAL AND METHODS In six Labrador dogs, all mandibular premolars and first molars were extracted. After 4 months of healing, flaps were elevated, and two implant sites were prepared at {{each side of}} the mandible. In {{the right side of the}} mandible, the distal sites were prepared conventionally, while the mesial sites were over-prepared by 0. 2 mm. As a consequence, a final insertion torque of ~ 30 Ncm at the distal and a minimal insertion <b>torque</b> <b>close</b> to 0 Ncm at the mesial sites were obtained. In the left sides of the mandible, however, the recipient sites were underprepared by 0. 3 mm resulting in an insertion torque of ≥ 70 Ncm at both implants. Cover screws were applied, and flaps sutured to fully submerge the experimental sites. After 4 months, the animals were sacrificed and ground sections obtained for histological evaluation. RESULTS The mineralized bone-to-implant contact was in the range of 55. 2 - 62. 1 %, displaying the highest value at implants with ~ 30 Ncm insertion torque and the lowest value at the implant sites with close to 0 Ncm insertion torque. No statistically significant differences were revealed. Bone density was in the range of 43. 4 - 54. 9 %, yielding the highest value at implants with ≥ 70 Ncm insertion torque and the lowest at the implant sites with close to 0 Ncm insertion torque. The difference between the sites of ~ 30 Ncm and the corresponding ≥ 70 Ncm insertion torque reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Similar amounts of osseointegration were obtained irrespective of the insertion torque applied. Moreover, implants installed in sites with close to 0 Ncm insertion torque may properly osseointegrate as well...|$|R
