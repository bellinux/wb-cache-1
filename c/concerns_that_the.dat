50|$|Opening with {{shots of}} the liberation of Paris, the narrator informs <b>the</b> {{audience}} <b>that</b> this was America's honeymoon; <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> time people were <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war was about to end and the difficulties of transforming back to civilian life.

5000|$|Justices White, Blackmun and Souter concurred but voiced <b>concern</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court was foreclosing {{the area}} for review.

5|$|A-line. Founded by Anselmo, born 1926. One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} lines today, descendants include the second-largest number of stallions at stud. Anselmo was brought back to stud {{at the age of}} 21, when a lack of stallions after World War II led to <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> line would not survive, and produced several stallions now represented in all Haflinger breeding populations worldwide.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} National Liberal Party (PNL), {{he was elected}} to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in November 1919, {{representing}} Gorj County.

5|$|As {{a magnet}} school founded to promote school integration, racial and {{economic}} diversity {{have been important}} factors in admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1percent black, 41.7percent low income, and 7.7percent disabled in 2009–10. In 2007, {{in response to a}} US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools, CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in magnet school admissions. School officials insist this will have little impact, despite parent <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> decision will erode diversity.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the {{dreadnought}} design had {{not been}} fully validated, despite {{the success of the}} British namesake; for example, there were still <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Minas Geraes class' superfiring turret arrangement—which {{had not been}} utilized on the original Dreadnought, but was also being installed on the American —would cause blast to hurt the crew in the lower turret. Any immediate concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests when no ill effects were observed, though the Times (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during São Paulos gun trials in June 1910.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E

5|$|<b>Concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film {{would fail}} limited its initial bookings {{to less than}} half those a film of its {{magnitude}} normally received. Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, it received mostly positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend {{and went on to}} gross over $115 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. It has become a cult classic, spawning the sequel, Blues Brothers 2000, 18 years later, which was a critical and commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city would not be safe enough for such a sensitive agency.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E

By mid-2011, credit was outpacing GDP by a wide margin, raising <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> economy was overheating. Argentina began a period of fiscal austerity in 2012. In April 2012, {{the government}} announced plans to expropriate YPF, despite the opposition of some energy experts, claiming that YPF's Spanish partner and major holder, Repsol, had not done his duty as to provide the financial support for research and land exploitation, {{as well as being}} a bad administrator concerned only in sending profits to Spain and forsaking YPF's economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of fusion power development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{within the}} Labour Party there was {{disagreement}} {{about whether or}} not to build the Hardanger Bridge. In addition to crossing the Hardangerfjord, there were <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bridge would increase the traffic through Hardangervidda National Park, and that it subsequently would result in an all-year road being built with subsequent negative impact on nature and wildlife. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party stated on 10 October 1995 that the government was in favor of the Triangle Link and opposed to the Hardanger Bridge.|$|E

Ryan raises <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> program could be seen as detached and apathetic, arguing that Natalie knows nothing about the reality of the firing process or how to handle upset people. He then plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. Ryan's boss assigns him to bring Natalie on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes.|$|E
5|$|Senators raised <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Congress {{could either}} abuse such {{authority}} or neglect to enact any such legislation after {{the adoption of}} this proposal.

In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn.
