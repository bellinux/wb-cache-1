50|$|In the {{actuated}} position the <b>curved</b> <b>spring</b> provides some upward force. If the actuator is released this will move the flat spring upward. As the flat spring moves, the force from the <b>curved</b> <b>spring</b> increases. This results in acceleration until the normally-closed contacts are hit.

40|$|Micro-scale energy {{harvesting}} from motion has received increasing research interest. The energy harvesters {{can be used}} as replacements for batteries in low-power wireless electronic devices. Conventional vibration energy harvesters are designed as linear resonance structures. These have a very narrow bandwidth and operate efficiently only when the excitation frequency is very close to the resonant frequency of the harvester. The narrow bandwidth limits their applications in realworld environments that have a wide spectrum of frequencies or varying vibration spectra. This thesis investigates a method to extend the bandwidth of the energy harvesters. We exploit nonlinearities of suspensions, in particular softening and bistable characteristics, to widen the harvesting bandwidth. The nonlinear-spring characteristics are obtained purely through their geometrical design without relying on extra features such as permanent magnets that can interfere with the surroundings. Two electrostatic energy harvesters are designed, fabricated and characterized based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The first harvester with a quad-angled spring, which displays a softening characteristic, is made by through-wafer-thickness deep-reactive ion etching onto a silicon wafer. The experimental results show that a 13 -fold increase in the bandwidth of the harvester with the angled springs and an average output power increase of 68 % compared with that of linear-vibrating energy harvesters at a broadband random vibration of 7 × 10 - 4 g 2 /Hz. We also find that the harvester is tolerant to variations both in the center frequency and bandwidth of vibration, and can perform close to its theoretical maximum with wideband vibrations. The second MEMS electrostatic energy harvester with <b>curved</b> <b>springs</b> is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator wafer using bulk micro-fabrication technology. The <b>curved</b> <b>springs</b> display an asymmetrical bistable behavior obtained purely through geometrical design. The experimental results with a white noise vibration at 4 × 10 - 3 g 2 /Hz show that the harvester bandwidth reaches 715 Hz, representing the largest bandwidth reported in the literature so far. Such wideband harvesters are well-suited to extract power from a wide spectrum of vibrations or from sources {{with a wide range of}} variability in the spectrum...|$|R

VSB system is established to protect the structure against dynamic loads induced by earthquake, wind and etc. To obtain the curved shape of the spring, mathematical modeling is conducted. Direct compression experimental tests are conducted {{for a variety of}} models with different thicknesses and materials. The results of the experiments show a nonlinear stiffness trend for the <b>curved</b> <b>spring</b> element. In addition, to observe the yielding of the <b>curved</b> <b>spring,</b> different strain gauges are installed in several positions to record the strain in the models during the application of compression load. The results reveal that the geometry and material characteristics have an important effect on the stiffness value of the spring.

The results from the experiments, as well as model and finite element simulation, show the curved spring's potential {{to be used in the}} developed VSB system and can be installed as a lateral resistance system in a structure subjected to vibration excitation such as an earthquake.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a computer based tool {{that can be used to}} predict the three-dimensional load-deformation relationships of arbitrarily loaded coiled springs. The non-linear deformation of the spring is calculated by dividing the spring into small elements for which the load-deformation relationships can be considered to be linear. The load and deformation of each element are calculated recursively from one end to the other, and the total deformation of the spring is obtained as the sum of the contributions of all the elements. A linear, locally constant stiffness matrix is then established at the pre-loaded equilibrium point. This matrix is obtained by adding small increments to the initial load, calculating the corresponding changes in deformation and solving the linear system of equations in load increments and changes of deformation. An extended model for the linear stiffness of a short section of a coiled spring is developed in order to improve the accuracy of the calculations. This model calculates the deformation of the <b>curved</b> <b>spring</b> wire and includes the effects of pitch, curvature of the wire and distortion due to normal and transverse forces in the wire. The model shows some additional three-dimensional properties of the spring, e. g., rotational asymmetry. A three-dimensional static measurement of the load and deformation of a laterally loaded spring is performed and shows good agreement with the calculation of the non-linear deformation. Further, the natural frequencies of a mechanical system consisting of a rigid body and a laterally loaded spring are measured and compared with calculated results. This comparison verifies the merits of the linearized stiffness matrix. Both the static and dynamic experiments show that the accuracy of the calculations is improved when the extended stiffness model is used...|$|E

40|$|Elliptic curves {{are found}} at the {{intersection}} of a broad range of mathematics. As such there are definitions of elliptic <b>curves</b> <b>springing</b> from abstract number theory where they are defined in terms of sheafs and schemes, and therefore almost completely dissociated from the underlying field, to complex analysis where elliptic curves found their name as being associated to elliptic integrals. However one’s first introduction to an elliptic curve often fails to explain why such a broad range of theory exists for such a simple object. Most commonly one says that an elliptic curve is given by the solutions to a nonsingular cubic in two variables x and y over a field. Usually this field is C, Q, Q(α) or Q p. These being the most common fields of use in number theory and algebraic geometry. Frequently one is shown pictures of common elliptic curves such as y 2 = x 3 − 4 x, y 2 = x 3 − 3 x + 3, and y 2 = x 3 − x: y 2 = x 3 − 4 x y 2 = x 3 − 3 x + 3 y 2 = x 3 − x The reason for this broad range of definitions is that elliptic curves while defined as algebraic curves in projective space, have a natural group structure which encourages the development of the algebraic approaches to the subject. This paper will introduce the group law and will also present a rough outline of a theorem by Hasse which shows that every elliptic curve over Fp has a rational point. The Proof of this theorem requires a great deal of machinery from a broad range of mathematics. In particular it requires elements from Algebraic Geometry, Differential Geometry, Galois Theory of finite fields, the group structure of elliptic curves, and the group structure of maps between elliptic curves...|$|R
50|$|Running {{the bridge}} out is {{effected}} by pushing it along its rails until the outer two wheels {{are at the}} edge of the granite sill of the ditch. When the bridge is pushed beyond this point the two outer wheels do not descend the slopes of the granite slabs but instead the bridge remains in a horizontal position. This is due to the centre axle being offset from the centre of the girders causing the bridge to run on its inner two wheels. The middle two wheels follow along the trays. When the bridge is just less than halfway out, the ends of the centre axle then engage in the cups of the lifting arms. The middle two wheels partially descend the slopes of the granite sill. The bridge continues to move out, its outer end dipping below the horizontal, its inner wheels still running along the trays of the courtyard. The weight of the bridge, at the point where the centre of gravity of the lifting arms is beyond the pivot point of the arms and the stays, causes the bridge mechanism to descend, its wheels running up the vertical racers set into the wall of the pit. At a point where the inner wheels are at the top of the slope down the granite sill, the outer ends of the girders and the outer wheels hit <b>curved</b> <b>sprung</b> metal guides.These guide the outer end of the bridge upwards so that the ends of the girders come to rest on the lip of the granite slab, the inner wheels descending the slope of the inner granite slab.

Virtual simulations can give worthwhile information and knowledge about the behavior of these vehicles under these different conditions, allowing faster, cheaper and more precise design. However, numerical models of passenger buses are not straightforward due to the multiple elements that interact with each other and with nonlinear responses, making it harder to predict their behavior to different requests. In this case study, an electric bus dynamic behavior was analyzed for different conditions. This study was fundamental for design decisions since the batteries mass increases the center of gravity,which may instigate risks of instability.
