25|$|Cue chalk is a calcite or {{carbonate}} base {{applied to}} the tip of the <b>cue</b> <b>stick</b> used in billiards in order for players to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, as well as for a smoother stroke. Cue tip chalk was co-invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro William A. Spinks and chemist William Hoskins in 1897. U.S. patent #578,514 for cue chalk was issued to Spinks and Hoskins on March 9, 1897.|$|E
25|$|On the July 16 {{episode of}} Raw, Austin was shown {{drinking}} and playing pool {{at a bar}} downtown. During the night, Vince McMahon held a WWF meeting backstage. Undertaker and the APA gave a motivational speech on how they should not tolerate the Alliance any longer. After they were finished, Brooklyn Brawler wheeled Freddie Blassie into the room so he could address the wrestlers and pump them up for the night. As the WWF wrestlers united, Austin could be seen watching the events on the television at the bar. He proceeded to slam his <b>cue</b> <b>stick</b> on the pool table and left.|$|E
25|$|Kinetic energy can {{be passed}} from one object to another. In the game of billiards, the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by {{striking}} it with the <b>cue</b> <b>stick.</b> If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically and the ball it collided with accelerates to a speed as the kinetic energy is passed on to it. Collisions in billiards are effectively elastic collisions, in which kinetic energy is preserved. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound, binding energy (breaking bound structures).|$|E

25|$|In {{physical}} simulation, we wish {{to conduct}} experiments, such as playing billiards. The physics of bouncing billiard balls are well understood, {{under the umbrella of}} rigid body motion and elastic collisions. An initial description of the situation would be given, with a very precise physical description of the billiard table and balls, as well as initial positions of all the balls. Given a force applied to the cue ball (probably resulting from a player hitting the ball with his or her <b>cue</b> <b>stick),</b> we want to calculate the trajectories, precise motion, and eventual resting places of all the balls with a computer program. A program to simulate this game would consist of several portions, one of which would be responsible for calculating the precise impacts between the billiard balls. This particular example also turns out to be ill conditioned: a small error in any calculation will cause drastic changes in the final position of the billiard balls.|$|E
25|$|Later that night, DDP and Rhyno faced Kane and the Undertaker. During the match, {{there was}} {{interference}} from the Alliance. In response, The Hardy Boyz, the APA, Jericho, and Kurt Angle came {{to help their}} WWF allies, but more Alliance members came in and overwhelmed the WWF wrestlers. Backstage, many WWF and Alliance wrestlers were fighting each other, and the WWF {{seemed to be on}} the losing end of things. A truck was seen driving up to the arena, however, and Austin came out with his <b>cue</b> <b>stick</b> and proceeded to beat down any WCW and ECW wrestlers in his path. He then came to the ring, trash-talking on the way down, and beat down the Alliance wrestlers, giving Stunners to most {{of the men in the}} ring. The WWF wrestlers had cleaned house and were standing tall. The WWF seemed to be in good shape for the upcoming pay-per-view with Austin's return.|$|E

500|$|George Balabushka (Russian: Григорий Антонович Балабушка Grigoriy Antonovich Balabushka; December 9, 1912– December 5, 1975) was a Russian-born [...] billiards (pool) cue maker, {{arguably the}} most {{prominent}} member of that profession, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the Stradivarius of cuemakers". His full name or last name standing alone is often used to refer to a <b>cue</b> <b>stick</b> made by him. Arriving in the U.S. in 1924, he worked at various carpentry and toy and furniture making jobs. He was an avid pool player and purchased a pool room with a business partner in 1959 and thereafter started making cues as gifts for friends which quickly blossomed into a business when others wanted to purchase them.|$|E
500|$|Billiards {{champion}} Tex Zimmerman (Cochran's {{partner in}} the 924 Club) and well known pool hustler Danny McGoorty {{had a hand in}} organizing the tour. In preparation, they played up Katsura's exoticness and her physical attractiveness. Tex Zimmerman's wife sewed tight-fitting kimonos for Katsura, slit up the side, which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels. Katsura was a tiny woman, weighing between 88 and 96pounds. and standing 5feet tall—just about the height of a standard <b>cue</b> <b>stick.</b> McGoorty later mused: [...] "Masako was cute! She was thirty-nine years old but she looked twenty-nine. She hopped around that table on her high heels, giving the fans a little smile, and everybody loved her." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank B. Adams (December 19, 1847 – after January 1923), {{commonly}} known as Yank Adams, was a professional carom billiards player who specialized in finger billiards, in which a player directly manipulates the balls {{with his or her}} hands, instead of using an implement such as a <b>cue</b> <b>stick,</b> often by twisting the ball between one's thumb and middle finger. Adams, who was sometimes billed as the [...] "Digital Billiard Wonder", has been called the [...] "greatest of all digit billiards players", and the [...] "champion digital billiardist of the World."

50|$|Boccette is a billiards-type {{game played}} in Italy.

2500|$|A massé is {{performed}} by hitting the cue ball with {{the butt of}} the <b>cue</b> <b>stick</b> elevated; usually by 60 degrees or more. While controlling the aim, speed and curve of the cue ball takes a great deal of practice to master, there is a science to it. [...] After the initial contact, the cue ball will travel straight along the path defined by the horizontal alignment of the cue until the cue ball slows enough for the imparted vertical spin to take over. [...] The cue ball will then curve onto a line defined by an angle described by the cue ball's initial resting point on the table and point on the table where the cue tip was aimed. [...] The time before vertical spin overcomes horizontal movement is determined by the force with which the cue ball is struck. [...] Massés are quite difficult for non-experts, and are not allowed in some venues, as the table's [...] can be easily damaged by unskilled players.|$|E
