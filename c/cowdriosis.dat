50|$|Heartwater (also {{known as}} <b>cowdriosis,</b> nintas and ehrlichiosis) is a tick-borne rickettsial disease of {{domestic}} and wild ruminants. It is caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium) - an intracellular gram-negative coccal bacterium (also referred to as Rickettsia ruminantium). The disease is spread by bont ticks, which {{are members of the}} genus Amblyomma. Affected mammals include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and buffalo, but the disease has the biggest economic impact on cattle production in affected areas. The disease’s name is derived from the fact that fluid can collect around the heart or in the lungs of infected animals.|$|E

We conclude from our data the mobility of those cells, related to the expression of the metalloproteinases (especially the 92 kD form of the enzyme), {{is an important factor in}} Kaposi saroma dissemination and is the main factor limiting the scale up of <b>Cowdriosis</b> vaccine production in Bovine Umbilical Endothelial Cell line. We showed that PMA and TNF increased the 92 kD Metallaproteinase and that TGFβ, produced in an inactive form in cultures of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, is a potential inhibitor of Kaposi sarcoma spreading, and could also be useful in improving our process for Cowdria ruminantium vaccine production, since it reduces the sensitivity of the cells to mechanical stress without affecting significantly the overall infectious process.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate various tick species infesting livestock in four locations in Pibor area. Seasonal distribution of ticks, population density and prevalence of tick-borne diseases were thoroughly studied with emphasis on the ecological and epidemiological background. Ticks were collected from cattle, sheep, goat, and dog and from the pasture. Blood smears were collected from cattle, sheep and goat for detection of tick-borne pathogens. Sera were collected from cattle to assess the prevalence of Ehrlichiosis (<b>Cowdriosis)</b> due to high infestation of Ambylomma lipidium. The participatory rural appraisal tools were used to collect data on tick ecology and tick-associated health problems of livestock in Pibor area. The potential of application of these techniques were discussed. The tick species identified in the study area revealed, Ambylomma lipidium, Ambylomma vareigatum, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus, Hyalomma. m. refupes, Rhipicephalus simus simus, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, Rhipicephalus sanguineous.

40|$|Tick-borne {{diseases}} (TBDs) {{caused by}} different protozoan and rickettsial species occur {{all over the}} world but their greatest impact is in the tropics and subtropics where they cause huge losses mainly in improved breeds of cattle. The economically important tick-transmitted diseases of cattle are caused by the protozoan parasites Babesia bigemina and B. bovis, and Theileria parva and T. annulata, and by the rickettisial organisms Anaplasma marginale and Cowdria ruminantium. In the tropics, countries in the eastern and central regions of Africa are probably most affected. In these regions theileriosis, caused by T. parva, combined with babesiosis, anaplasmosis and <b>cowdriosis,</b> continues to restrict the introduction of improved breeds of cattle. Live vaccines for babesiosis, anaplasmosis and <b>cowdriosis</b> have been available and used for several years. Despite this, the intensive application of acaricides on cattle has been required mainly to control the brown ear tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, the principal vector of T. parva, for which no vaccine was available. In the last 20 years, a significant research effort has been put into the development of a vaccine against T. parva. This has resulted in the infection-and-treatment method of immunisation, which has opened up the possibility of reducing the use of acaricides. The FAO Regional Programme on Control of Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases is deploying live vaccines to control TBDs (particularly theileriosis) as part of the integrated control of ticks and TBDs in the predominantly small holder dairy sector in the region. The live vaccines for tick-borne diseases other than theileriosis have been used for several decades and their efficacies have been well defined. However, the infection-and-treatment method immunisation against T. parva has only been used on a limited scale and the need to assess efficacy evaluate delivery systems and measure the long-term impact of immunisation is clearly recognised. This paper identifies the problems of producing and delivering a live vaccine against theileriosis and the parameters that need to be monitored to evaluate the efficacy and long-term biological impact of immunisation. The paper also briefly describes the technologies that are available to monitor immunisation...|$|E

40|$|Health and {{nutrition}} of livestock are major constraints on productivity, and their {{improvement in the}} Caribbean {{was the subject of}} a seminar held in Antigua in November 1990. The meeting, which was organized jointly by CTA and the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI), focused on the control of two tick-associated diseases, <b>cowdriosis</b> and dermatophilosis, and on the better utilization of locally available feedstuffs, including by-products of the two major crops in the region, sugarcane and bananas. Beautiful but lethal <b>Cowdriosis,</b> or heartwater, is carried by the beautiful but often lethal tick Amblyomma variegatum, which was introduced into the Caribbean with cattle from West Africa. As well as acting as a vector for <b>cowdriosis</b> the tick also suppresses the immune response of infested cattle, which facilitates infection by the bacterial skin disease dermatophilosis. Both diseases cause serious loss of productivity even when animals recover but, where stock are of susceptible types (exotic and cross-brads) and where nutrition is poor, mortality can be high. When A. variegatum infested St Kitts 75 % of the cattle died and the livestock industry has not recovered. All the Caribbean islands except Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago are now infested to some degree and it is feared that unless appropriate action is taken on a regional basis the tick and its associated diseases will spread inexorably to the remaining islands and to the South, Central and North American mainland. Participants at the seminar included the leading international authorities on A. variegatum, <b>cowdriosis</b> and dermatophilosis. Presentations were given by Professor G Uilenberg (IEMVT, Paris), Dr N Barre (INRA, Guadeloupe), Professor H Williams (UVI, Trinidad), Dr C Yunker (Veterinary Research Laboratory, Zimbabwe), Dr D Lloyd (Royal Veterinary College, London) and Dr d E George (USDA, Kerrville, Texas). The discussions that followed led participants to conclude that eradication of the tick is possible, as experience in Puerto Rico has shown, but that re-introduction inevitably occurs from surrounding countries. Therefore the seminar participants recommended that all the governments in the region should introduce a coordinated regional policy for eradication of A. variegatum as a matter of great urgency. They also recommended that CARDI and CTA request FAO to help in coordination and liaison between relevant agencies and countries in setting up a regional programme. This should include surveillance, reporting outbreaks, training in diagnostic and treatment procedures and the development of suitable acaricides. A new pour-on acaricide is proving successful in controlling Amblyomma and a system of 'baiting' was described where animals are grazed on infested pastures and regularly treated with the acaricide to kill the ticks that have become attached. After a short period land is completely cleared of the ticks. Cane for feed and forage The seminar also discussed a variety of ways of using bananas and sugar cane and their products as feed energy sources for ruminants and monogastric livestock. The conclusion was that their potential, and that of several other crops and by-products, has yet to be realized. Participants from Colombia, Cuba, Honduras and Venezuela were invited to share their experiences with those from the anglophone Caribbean. Dr T R Preston, consultant to the Convenio Inter-instituticional pare la Produccion Agropecuaria en el Valle del Rio Cauca (CIPAV) in Colombia, described a system for which he had just received an international award (see Newslines) and which can yield about 3000 kg of meat/ha/year based on two perennial crops, sugar cane and nitrogen-fixing trees. The cane stalks are fractionated into cane juice and bagasse using a simple animal-powered 3 -roll mill. The cane juice is a complete replacement for cereal grains and the basis (75 %) of a high quality diet for pigs. The cane tops are fed to sheep while the tree leaves provide protein for pigs and sheep. From Trinidad the Director of the Sugarcane Feed Centre, Floyd Neckles, described their work which has proved the value of whole chop ped sugar cane as the basis of a feed of large and small ruminants. Again a leguminous tree (Leucaena in this case) can pro vice the protein. Although bananas are another major crop in the region, Dr Marco Esnaola of the Pan American School of Agriculture pointed out that they are perishable and also bulky, and thus expensive to transport. However, where cattle or pigs can be fed close to a source of waste bananas they can be an economical feed either fresh or cooked, though ripe bananas give better results than green fruit Other crops and by-products reviewed included cassava, sweet potato, rice residues, citrus pulp, coconut meal, brewers grains, poultry litter and abattoir wastes. 11 was also pointed out that there is considerable potential for the improvement of pasture grasses and legumes and there was considerable debate as to whether pastures should be planted with forage trees as a more high yielding system for feeding ruminants. With imports of livestock products and feeds for livestock accounting for more than half (53 %) of all import costs in the anglophone Caribbean there is obviously great potential for improving productivity of farm animals in the region. As the conclusions and recommendations of this seminar showed, this could and should be done by taking immediate steps to implement policies that will eliminate disease and make better use of locally available feed resources. seminar held in Antigua in November 1990.

This fusion molecule was designed to combine the binding specificity of Fc with the antimicrobial properties of rMPO. The rMPO-Fc fusion dimerized through the Fc fragment, while retaining the enzymatic activity of rMPO. The chimeric molecule was glycosylated and most of the propeptide was eliminated, indicating a better processing of the polypeptide than for rMPO alone. Both rMPO and rMPO-Fc bound to and were internalized by macrophage-like U 937 promonocytic cells. Unexpectedly, the chimera failed to bind to the Fc receptor but interacted with a higher affinity than rMPO with the same binding sites. The presence of the Fc fragment in the chimera, in addition, did not extend the plasma half-life of the fusion protein.

A total body collection of ticks was carried out in five different locations, Sennar, Singa, Dinder, Abu Naama and Um Banein on Desert sheep (Watish and Ashgar) on two farms from each locality at two monthly intervals for one year starting July 2002 to May 2003. Four tick genera and eight species were identified. These were Amblyomma, Boophilus, Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus. The tick species included Amblyomma lepidum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum, H. truncatum, Rhipicephalus camicasi, R. evertsi evertsi, R. guilhoni and R. muhsamae. Sera collection was carried out in the five above mentioned locations from two farms of each locality three times a year, starting September 2002 (autumn), January 2003 (winter) and May 2003 (summer). Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA was used to determine the sero-prevalence of Cowdria ruminantium. The test was performed with recombinant major antigenic protein 1 (MAP 1 -B). Out of 300 sheep sera tested by indirect ELISA MAP 1 -B, 230 were found to be positive to C. ruminantium antibodies with overall prevalence of 76. 6 %. According to locations, the prevalence of the disease ranged between 85. 1 % at Um Banein and 63. 3 % in Sennar. The C. ruminantium antibodies persisted throughout the year in each locality, and seasonality prevalence of the disease showed an increase in sero-prevalence during autumn (80 %) and winter (82 %) while a slight reduction in seroprevalence was observed in summer (68 %). In this study, an experimental infection of sheep with Um Banein strain of Cowdria species was carried out using in-vitro isolate performed from A. lepidum adult ticks collected from cattle in the study area by inoculating of the homogenate in adult Nubian goats. Seven Desert sheep of Dubassi eco-type were used. They were assigned into two groups. Group I composed of three animals served as uninfected control. Group II composed of four animals that inoculated intravenously with 5 ml of infected blood from the Nubian goats. The clinical signs and postmortem findings were typical of sheep <b>cowdriosis.</b> The main pathological findings observed were hydropericardium, hydrothorax, lung congestion and oedema of lymph nodes and brain. The histopathological findings showed intensive leukocyte stasis and severe perivascular infiltration in lung, lymph node, myocardium and brain. The convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of kidneys were dilated and Bowman,s spaces were widened. The mean haematological values from the infected sheep indicate that a decrease in PCV, RBCs count and Hb content were coincided with fever while a slight increase in WBCs count was observed. Alterations in plasma biochemical parameters were not significant in most of the infected group expect for some changes in bilirubin concentration...|$|E
40|$|The major {{antigenic}} protein 1 fragment B (MAP 1 -B) {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) for {{the diagnosis}} of Cowdria ruminantium infections was validated to determine cutoff values and evaluate its diag-nostic performance with sheep and goat sera. Cowdria-infected populations consisted of 48 sheep and 44 goats, while the noninfected populations consisted of 64 sheep and 107 goats. Cutoff values were determined by two-graph receiver-operating characteristic (TG-ROC) curves. The cutoff value was set at 31 and 26. 6 % of the positive control reference samples for sheep and goat sera, respectively. The test’s diagnostic performance was evaluated with measurements of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the ROC curves and by the valid range proportion (VRP). The AUCs were 0. 978 for sheep sera and 0. 989 for goat sera. The VRP for both sheep and goat sera was approximately 1. 0. The intermediate range (IR), which defines results that are neither positive nor negative, was 0 for goat sera and 2. 81 for sheep sera. In an ideal test, the AUC and VRP would be 1. 0 and the IR would be 0. In this study these parameters were close to those of an ideal test. It is concluded that the MAP 1 -B ELISA is a useful test for the diagnosis of C. ruminantium infection in small ruminants. <b>Cowdriosis</b> (or heartwater) is a tick-borne disease of rumi-nants caused by the rickettsia Cowdria ruminantium and i...|$|E
40|$|Report of the Second External Program Review (EPR) of ILRAD, {{conducted}} in 1986 concurrently with the EMR. The document includes the summary of discussion {{of both the}} EPR and EMR at the CGIAR meeting in June 1986. Also transmittal letters from the panel chair, Jos Mortelmans, to TAC Chair Guy Camus and from Camus to the CGIAR Chairman with TAC's commentary, and the ILRAD board's response to panel recommendations. The review found ILRAD to have recovered fully from its difficult situation {{at the time of}} the 1980 quinquennial review. The panel recommended appointment of two research coordinators, one each for theileriosis and trypanosomiasis. ILRAD's expanded field activities in Kenya and elsewhere provided an opportunity to expand training, as had been recommended by the 1980 review, and to intensify collaboration with African institutions. The panel recommended that ILRAD continue its work on finding immunological means of controlling trypanosomiasis, although this approach now seemed less promising than thought in 1980. Work on other means of controlling this disease, including chemotherapy and trypanotolerance, should be expanded. Immunological approaches to theileriosis were deemed very promising. The panel urged intensification of efforts to improve the 'infection and treatment' method, and high priority for sporozoite research. <b>Cowdriosis</b> warranted serious attention as well, although this should not require establishment of a new program or new positions. The EPR was discussed at TAC 39, and at the CGIAR Meeting in May 1986...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cowdriosis</b> or {{heartwater}} {{is a major}} tick-borne disease on ruminants in Africa and the Caribbean. The causative {{agent is}} Ehrlichia ruminantium, an intracellular bacterium. Development of vaccines against heartwater has been hampered the limited efficiency of vaccine in the field, {{thought to be a}} consequence of the high genetic diversity of strains circulating in a same area. A sampling scheme was set to collect ticks over 2 years in a delimited area and well identified flock. Prevalence was low at about 3 %. A set of 37 strains was considered for MLST analysis along with two reference strains, i. e. ERGA and ERWO, for which full-length genome was available, using a previously described scheme based on the genes gltA, groEL, lepA, lipA, lipB, secY, sodB and sucA. Two populations were identified both with limited genetic variability but with differing evolutionary patterns. Population 1 is in genomic stasis, in agreement with the paradigm for intracellular bacteria. The two reference strains, one from the Caribbean separated from West African strains three centuries ago and another one isolated in South Africa, belong to Population 1. Population 2 is on expansion following a recent clonal emergence from Population 1. The founder strain was identified as strain 395. Strain 623 displays a particularly high rate of mutations in groEL. Owing to the chaperone function of GroEL, this might indicate another clonal emergence under way. This work brings further insight in the genomic plasticity of E. ruminantium and its impact on vaccine strategy. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Tick-borne {{diseases}} (TBDs) {{present a}} major economic burden to communities across East Africa. Farmers in East Africa must use acaracides to target ticks and prevent transmission of tick-borne {{diseases such as}} anaplasmosis, babesiosis, <b>cowdriosis</b> and theileriosis; the major causes of cattle mortality and morbidity. The costs of controlling East Coast Fever (ECF), caused by Theileria parva, in Uganda are significant and measures taken to control ticks, to be cost-effective, should {{take into account the}} burden of disease. The aim of the present work was to estimate the burden presented by T. parva and its spatial distribution in a crop-livestock production system in Eastern Uganda.; A cross sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of T. parva in Tororo District, Uganda. Blood samples were taken from all cattle (n: 2, 658) in 22 randomly selected villages across Tororo District from September to December 2011. Samples were analysed by PCR and T. parva prevalence and spatial distribution determined.; The overall prevalence of T. parva was found to be 5. 3 %. Herd level prevalence ranged from 0 % to 21 % with majority of the infections located in the North, North-Eastern and South-Eastern parts of Tororo District. No statistically significant differences in risk of infection were found between age classes, sex and cattle breed.; T. parva infection is widely distributed in Tororo District, Uganda. The prevalence and distribution of T. parva is most likely determined by spatial distribution of R. appendiculatus, restricted grazing of calves and preferential tick control targeting draft animals...|$|E
40|$|Diagnosis {{of major}} endemic bovine {{parasitic}} diseases in sub-Saharan Africa such as trypanosomosis, theileriosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis and <b>cowdriosis</b> is increasingly relying on clinical diagnosis due to deterioration of veterinary services and laboratory facilities. Pyrexia {{is a common}} clinical feature of aforementioned diseases whose detection relies on measurement of rectal temperature. The research {{undertaken in this study}} was aimed at assessing the effects of diurnal changes and variable coat colour of indigenous Nkedi Zebu cattle on the diagnostic value of rectal temperature under tropical conditions. The results revealed that variation in rectal temperature was significantly influenced by time of day it was taken and by the coat colour of the Nkedi Zebu cattle (P < 0. 001). Rectal temperature experienced diurnal changes: steadily rising to reach a peak at 17. 00 h before declining. The mean rectal temperature of unhealthy cattle was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than that of the healthy ones only between 13. 00 and 17. 00 h of the day. During which period the proportion of unhealthy cattle having a rectal temperature of 39. 4 °C or higher was significantly higher than that of healthy ones (P < 0. 001). Regarding the variable coat colour of indigenous breeds, rectal temperature among cattle of different coat colours was significantly different (P < 0. 05). In conclusion {{it is important to consider}} diurnal changes in rectal temperature and differences due to variable coat colour of indigenous African breeds when measuring rectal temperature for assessing pyrexia, during clinical diagnosis of bovine trypanosomosis and tick-borne diseases that are endemic in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E
40|$|Heartwater (<b>cowdriosis)</b> is an important, often fatal, tick-borne {{disease of}} {{domestic}} and wild ruminants in sub-Saharan Africa and some Indian Ocean and Caribbean islands. The causal agent, Cowdria ruminantium (Cowdry 1925), is a rickettsia closely related {{to members of the}} genus Ehrlichia, and is probably a part of a complex of genomic species. Imported breeds of sheep and goats (especially Angoras) are highly susceptible, but indigenous populations of endemic areas may be resistant to infection. Very young stock (less than 9 d old) possess a natural resistance that is unrelated to the immune status of the dams. Symptoms of heartwater vary, but usually begin with fever and may involve neurological signs and respiratory distress. Clinical diagnosis is based on symptoms, history of tick exposure and post-mortem findings, and is confirmed by demonstration of characteristic rickettsial organisms in vascular endothelial cells. Laboratory diagnosis is retrospective and includes fluorescent antibody and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serological tests are compromised by non-specific reactions with certain Ehrlichia spp. DNA and oligonucleotide probes have been developed, but are thus far unavailable in many countries affected by heartwater. Treatment with tetracyclines is effective if begun {{in the early stages of}} infection. Control is based on a knowledge of the disease cycle in nature, and is achieved through judicious tick control, vaccination or both. A virulent, blood-based vaccine is available. Existence of a carrier state in recovered animals, including wild ruminants, complicates control efforts, and eradication is feasible only in circumscribed foci. Problem areas in fundamental and applied research on heartwater, as it affects sheep and goats, are discussed. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|Heartwater, or <b>cowdriosis,</b> is a tick-borne {{disease of}} {{domestic}} and wild ruminants that is endemic in the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is caused by an intracellular pathogen, Ehrlichia ruminantium and may be fatal {{within days of the}} onset of clinical signs with mortality rates of up to 90 % in susceptible hosts. Due to the presence of competent tick vectors in North America, there is substantial risk of introduction of heartwater with potentially devastating consequences to the domestic livestock industry. There is currently no reliable or safe vaccine for use globally. To develop a protective DIVA (differentiate infected from vaccinated animals) subunit vaccine for heartwater, we targeted the E. ruminantium immunodominant major antigenic protein 1 (MAP 1) with the hypothesis that MAP 1 is a glycosylated protein and glycans contained in the antigenic protein are important epitope determinants. Using a eukaryotic recombinant baculovirus expression system, we expressed and characterized, for the first time, a glycoform profile of MAP 1 of two Caribbean E. ruminantium isolates, Antigua and Gardel. We have shown that the 37 - 38 kDa protein corresponded to a glycosylated form of the MAP 1 protein, whereas the 31 - 32 kDa molecular weight band represented the non-glycosylated form of the protein frequently reported in scientific literature. Three groups of sheep (n = 3 - 6) were vaccinated with increasing doses of a bivalent (Antigua and Gardel MAP 1) rMAP 1 vaccine cocktail formulation with montanide ISA 25 as an adjuvant. The glycosylated recombinant subunit vaccine induced E. ruminantium-specific humoral and Th 1 type T cell responses, which are critical for controlling intracellular pathogens, including E. ruminantium, in infected hosts. These results provide an important basis for development of a subunit vaccine as a novel strategy to protect susceptible livestock against heartwater in non-endemic and endemic areas...|$|E
