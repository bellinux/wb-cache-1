5|$|Aliens was {{nominated}} for seven Academy Awards including Best Original Score, Best Sound, Best Film Editing, and Best Art Direction. It won two awards for Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects. Sigourney Weaver received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and although she did not win, it was considered a landmark nomination for an actress to be <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> science fiction/horror film, a genre which previously was given little recognition.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1909 Bogue plan, this part of Lower Queen Anne had been <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> civic center. The Civic Auditorium (later the Opera House, now McCaw Hall), the ice arena (later Mercer Arena), and the Civic Field (rebuilt in 1946 as the High School Memorial Stadium), all built in 1927 had been placed there based on that plan, as was an armory (the Food Circus during the fair, later Center House).|$|E
5|$|As {{territorial}} {{governor of}} Montana, Leslie quickly drew {{the ire of}} the press for his pro-temperance position. The territory's political machinery also turned against him, and he was removed from office by President Benjamin Harrison. When Grover Cleveland succeeded Harrison {{for a second term}} in office, he appointed Leslie district attorney for Montana. Leslie continued to practice law well into his eighties, and was being <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> district court judgeship in Montana when he fell ill with pneumonia and died on February 7, 1907, at the age of 87.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced {{crews were}} siphoned off to Malta, to undertake ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The leftover crews, some 75 percent, were {{far off the}} 200 operational hours <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pilot to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons. The mixing of experienced crews and the inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased.|$|E

Toppings included a mango lime sauce, avocado, aioli, a Cajun spiced sauce, and relish. Originally successful, the sandwiches piqued the interest of Burger King's corporate offices and were being <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> potential global rollout. However, interest in the product faded and they were discontinued.|$|E

The expansion announcement prompted numerous applications {{from a wide variety}} of American cities. By the end of the expansion era, a minimum of 22 cities are reported to have been considered for teams.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurrence}} {{of the effects}} of his injury in 1924 restricted Gilligan's cricket in 1925. Appearing in fewer games and bowling far less frequently than in previous seasons, he scored 542 runs at 15.05 and took only eight wickets. He bowled in the first four games of the season, but in his remaining seventeen appearances played only as a batsman. In 1926, he was more successful and his performances helped Sussex to rise from thirteenth to tenth in the County Championship. Playing more games, he scored 1,037 runs at 30.50, the highest seasonal batting average of his career, and took 75 wickets at 20.74. That season, although no longer <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place in the England team himself, Gilligan joined the panel of Test selectors, and as a consequence missed some cricket for Sussex. He published a book on that summer's tour by Australia called Collins's Men.|$|E
5|$|After Sorkin's {{completion}} of the script in January 2014, development on the project began to heat up when David Fincher entered negotiations to direct the film, with Fincher selecting Christian Bale as his choice for Jobs. However, in April 2014, Fincher exited the project due to contractual disputes. Danny Boyle was then hired to direct, with Leonardo DiCaprio in discussions for the role. In October, DiCaprio exited, with Bale, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Bradley Cooper being considered. Sorkin revealed {{in an interview that}} month that Bale was once again cast in the role, with Seth Rogen entering negotiations to play Wozniak, and Jessica Chastain being <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> part. Ike Barinholtz revealed he had auditioned for the role of Wozniak. In November, Bale again left the project, with Michael Fassbender emerging as a frontrunner to replace him, and Scarlett Johansson reportedly being offered a role before Sony put the project in turnaround and Universal Pictures acquired it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} {{closure of the}} {{stations}} was being considered, and in 1984, was <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{combined heat and power}} scheme. After the privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1989, the stations passed into the ownership of National Power. After almost 37 years of use they were decommissioned in May 1991 as outdated and uneconomical to operate. They had been overtaken technologically, and had lower generating capacity than newer plants such as Drax. Their closure coincided with that {{of a large number of}} coal mines in the North East of England, just after the privatisation of both the electricity industry and the National Coal Board in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E
5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E

5|$|The Manned Orbital Telescope was a {{proposal}} for a manned spacecraft for astronomical or solar observation. It would have used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, and would have been launched on a Saturn IB. The enlarged reentry module was also <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> spacecraft proposed at the same time, which would have been used to rescue the crews of manned spacecraft that were stranded in low Earth orbit. It would have launched atop a Titan IIIC, once in orbit it would have maneuvered by means of a Transtage integrated into the equipment module. The larger capsule would have been used to accommodate the crew of the spacecraft which required rescuing.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E

Having recovered from a double hernia operation, and proving himself fit for the start of the county season, Trescothick began his comeback to cricket by scoring 256 from 117 balls in a 50 over match against Devon on 8 April 2007, helping Somerset to 502–4 off their 50 overs.|$|E
