40|$|With the {{progress}} of the society, people`s living standard is increasing. More and more cars (more than 72 million) are produced and utilized all over the world. This makes a large number of quarter windows which located on the back-side window of a vehicle are urgently needed. Encapsulated glass is widely adopted for a quarter window for various advantages. Positioning by centering table {{is one of the most}} important procedures during the fabrication of encapsulated glass for the quarter window. The existing centering table has a lot of disadvantages such as poor flexibility and precision, which results in failure in production such as damage or low quality. Developing a <b>centering</b> <b>system</b> for positioning encapsulated glass with high efficiency and precision becomes very significant for the industry. In this thesis, I designed a new centering table that used a new column base structure and pins for tightness. This new centering table has a high precision while still maintain the flexibility of the table that makes the centering table can be applied to encapsulated automotive glass with other sizes and shapes...|$|E
40|$|High speed trains {{normally}} use actively controlled pneumatic {{systems to}} recenter the carbody {{with respect to}} the bogie when the train negotiates a curve. Pneumatic systems are used because of their softness, which adds a little contribution to the elastic force generated by the mechanical springs of the lateral suspension system, thereby allowing the neccessary dynamic isolation between carbody and bogie. Howeve, pneumatic systems have the drawbacks of large dimensions and slow response, often accompanied by a few damped oscillations. An innovative solution was developed which makes use of hydraulic actuators providing them with artificial compliance generated by an appropriate control, hence making hydraulic actuators suitable for this application. A carbody <b>centering</b> <b>system</b> is thus obtained presenting fast response, small volume and a softness comparable to that of a pneumatic system. The optimal control law for this system was defined, the system dynamic characteristics were analyzed and a technological demonstrator was built to assess the system merits. The paper outlines the theoretical grounds for the system control, its performance and the most significant results obtained during a test campaign conducted on the technological demonstrator...|$|E
40|$|Precise {{machining}} {{of bearing}} rings {{is integral to}} finished bearing assembly quality. The output accuracy of center-based machining systems such as lathes or magnetic chuck grinders relates directly {{to the accuracy of}} part centering before machining. Traditional tooling and methods for centering on such machines are subject to wear, dimensional inaccuracy, setup time (hard tooling) and human error (manual centering). A flexible system for initial part centering is developed based on a single measurement system and actuator, whereby the part is placed by hand onto the machine table, rotated and measured to identify center of geometry offset from center of rotation, then moved by a series of controlled impacts or pushes to align the centers. The prototype <b>centering</b> <b>system</b> is developed as a demonstration platform for research in a number of mechanical engineering areas, particularly: Characterization of optimal state estimators through analysis of accuracy and computational efficiency; Distributed communication and control, efficient transfer of information in a real-time environment, and information sharing between processes; Modeling of sliding dynamics and the interaction of friction with compliant body dynamic models; Motion path planning through both deterministic geometric transforms and through frequency domain command manipulation. A vision is created for future work not only in the described areas, but also in the areas of advanced controller design incorporating multiple variables, derived machine diagnostic information, and application of the distributed communication architecture to information flow throughout the manufacturing organization. The guiding motivation for this research is reduction of manufacturing processing costs in the face of global competition. The technologies researched, developments made, and directions prescribed for future research aid in enabling this goal. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Thomas R.

40|$|Three-Dimensional Printing (3 DPTM) is a rapid-manufacturing process {{originally}} developed at MIT for building parts directly from CAD-generated models. Parts are fabricated in "slices" {{by creating a}} complete layer of powder and then selectively joining powder particles with a polymer binder deposited using a moving printhead. Traditional 3 DPTM builds layers by spreading dry powder and prints binder using a rastering scheme with a continuous-jet printhead. For smaller parts and greater accuracy, {{a variation on the}} process called slurry 3 DPTM (s 3 DPTM) uses raster-built slurry layers and a vector-printing scheme with a drop on demand (DoD) printhead. This here thesis presents efforts to improve core technology in both dry-powder 3 DPTM and slurry 3 DPTM. One of the most critical steps in s 3 DPTM is the building of the slurry layers. To avoid intra- and interlayer defects the slurry layer must be rastered at high deposition rates to promote line merging and better layer quality. The difficulty lies in the design of a machine capable of oscillating the slurry nozzle at the required frequencies. Fortunately, such a design was completed and the machine built as part of a collaborative effort with TDK Japan to build an s 3 DPTM machine for manufacturing small parts. The design uses a reciprocating countermass strategy to recycle mechanical energy and eliminate troublesome vibrations. A general overview of this slurry layer forming station (LFS) is given, along with an in-depth treatment of several components, including the forcers, <b>centering</b> <b>system,</b> and interface software. And speaking of rastering, dry-powder 3 DPTM relies on this strategy for printing binder, just as the LFS uses a raster method to build powder layers. Beginning with observations made during the design of the LFS, the fluid-handling system was redesigned to improve binder droplet stream stability during the carriage traverse and turnaround. The improvement was made possible by repositioning a smaller version of the "Clamshell" constant pressure vessel used to set the fluid flow rate to the printhead carriage itself and using a closed-loop control system to maintain a constant fluid level in the Clamshell. Drawings, parts lists, schematic diagrams, and assembly instructions are included for building additional fluid control systems. by David C. Ables. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Although {{some areas}} of {{clinical}} health care are becoming adept at implementing continuous quality improvement (CQI) projects, there has been limited experimentation of CQI in health promotion. In this study, we examined {{the impact of a}} CQI intervention on health promotion in four Australian Indigenous primary health care centers. Our study objectives were to (a) describe the scope and quality of health promotion activities, (b) describe the status of health <b>center</b> <b>system</b> support for health promotion activities, and (c) introduce a CQI intervention and examine the impact on health promotion activities and health <b>centers</b> <b>systems</b> over 2 years. Baseline assessments showed suboptimal health <b>center</b> <b>systems</b> support for health promotion and significant evidence-practice gaps. After two annual CQI cycles, there were improvements in staff understanding of health promotion and systems for planning and documenting health promotion activities had been introduced. Actions to improve best practice health promotion, such as community engagement and intersectoral partnerships, were inhibited by the way health <b>center</b> <b>systems</b> were organized, predominately to support clinical and curative services. These findings suggest that CQI can improve the delivery of evidence-based health promotion by engaging front line health practitioners in decision-making processes about the design/redesign of health <b>center</b> <b>systems</b> to support the delivery of best practice health promotion. However, further and sustained improvements in health promotion will require broader engagement of management, senior staff, and members of the local community to address organizational and policy level barriers...|$|R
