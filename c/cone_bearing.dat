Therefore it seems not without interest to me, to give a short description of a specimen, found by my colleague Mr. Ritsema in a bottle with Insects from East-Sumatra, presented to our Museum by Mr. W. E. J. Hekmeyer. The length of the whole animal measures only 25 m. m., its greatest breadth 3 1 / 2 m. m. The dorsal {{side of the body}} is slightly arched, its ventral surface nearly flat; there is a narrow shallow groove running along the middle of the back. The skin presents narrow transverse ridges, passing between the legs from the dorsal to the ventral side and surrounding the whole body; the legs are also faintly ringed. The ridges are beset by a number of warts, which are very developed on the legs. Each wart appears to consist of a truncated <b>cone,</b> <b>bearing</b> on its top a small cylinder, provided with a spine, while the surface of the wart is covered by numerous minute tubercles, which are also scattered over the whole skin between the warts, giving it a net-like appearance...|$|E

40|$|The {{important}} genus Agathis is {{well represented}} in the rich flora of the island of Borneo. In some places it forms nearly pure stands and has been heavily exploited for its resin and for lumber. Three species, one of which merely represents leaf variations from another, have been proposed previously for this genus in Borneo (Warburg, 1900; Meijer Drees, 1940). Several hundred collection numbers {{can be found in}} the major herbaria, much the majority of which belong to one species. This is particularly true for the non-Asian herbaria. During several field trips to Borneo, however, I identified three additional quite distinct unnamed species. The great variability of leaf size and shape even on individual plants in this genus together with difficulty in making good representative collections from these immense trees has surely hindered the recognition of the distinctions to be described here. None of these species has been totally overlooked, to be sure, inasmuch as a few specimens of each have previously reached the major herbaria. Furthermore, Whitmore (1979) concluded after seeing some of this material that it did not correspond to any of the species already described from Borneo but in fact represented Agathis dammara, a species not actually found in Borneo. I will describe all five Borneo species in order to clarify their distinctions.

Unconsolidated-undrained (UU) triaxial and cone penetration test results were used to develop correlations between undrained shear strength and cone resistance for clay soil {{in the study area}} located on alluvial clay desposits in Banting, Selangor, Malaysia. An empirical correlation of Su with effective overburden pressure is developed and the <b>cone</b> <b>bearing</b> factor (N k) of 17 ± 8 is recomended using S u = ௤ ೎ ିఙ ே ೖ and N k of 28 ± 8 using S u ൌ ௤ ೎ ே ೎.

Introduction The cone penetration test (CPT) has been used for many years as a standard investigation tool, mainly to determine quickly the soil profile (through the friction ratio) {{as well as for the}} estimation of the undrained shear strength, S u, in the case of cohesive soils. Cone resistance (q c) usually varies directly with the undrained shear strength of clay (S u). Soil strength parameters use for design of foundation in Malaysia are mainly extract from Standard Penetration Test (SPT) result which sometimes might lead to an erroneous conclusion.

40|$|Callitris rhomboidea and Callitris oblonga have a parapatric {{distribution}} in Eastern Tasmania. C. rhomboidea occurs on the East Coast and C. oblonga is mainly {{confined to a}} few coastal and inland river valleys between Launceston and the East Coast. C. rhomboidea is capable of continuous gap-phase regeneration. Natural stands are often multi-aged but even-aged cohorts often reflect burning. C. oblonga regenerates after fire or after mechanical damage to <b>cone</b> <b>bearing</b> branches (usually during floods). It is therefore an episodic regenerator which {{does not appear to}} regenerate continuously in the absence of exogenous disturbance. The two species are ecologically differentiated by frost tolerance, waterlogging and shade tolerance. C. oblonga is more tolerant of frost and waterlogging but C. rhomboidea still occupies a very wide ecological amplitude, although it possibly has a competitive advantage on the driest sites. C. oblonga is well adapted to a riparian and floodplain niche, a distribution which is reinforced by the higher fire frequency in non riparian habitats. Hybrids between the two taxa are rare because timing of their peak pollen release is asynchronous. Climatically suitable areas apparently occur for both species beyond their present range but a temperature reduction during the Last Glacial may have limited C. rhomboidea to the east of the Eastern Tiers and C. oblonga to a small glacial refuge within {{the northern part of the}} Eastern Tiers. Expansion beyond these palaeogeographically determined limits has been retarded by the slow overland migration rates of both species, and by the onset of anthropogenic burning. Limited post-glacial dispersal of C. oblonga has been aided by downstream spread of propagules. An increase in fire frequency with the arrival of Aboriginal man about 30, 000 years ago may have not only constrained the expansion of Callitris but also caused the extinction of C. rhomboidea in the far north east of Tasmania. A further increase in burning from the early nineteenth century, has caused a decline in the extent of Callitris. Frequent burning has forced C. rhomboidea into fire protected habitats such as cliffs, deep gullies and rocky knolls, and C. oblonga into areas protected by anastomosing channels, cut off meander loops or rocky benches and cliffs. Prior to human colonisation of the "Tasmanian peninsula", C. rhomboidea was probably found on more xeric sites in juxtaposition with rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest on other sites. Frequent burning is hypothesised to have caused a shift in forest patterns. C. oblonga is inadequately reserved. Management of the species should aim to protect the most upstream stands, which provide sources of propagules for downstream habitats. C. oblonga conservation would be helped by fire prevention, enrichment planting and weed control. C. rhomboidea is adequately reserved but fire frequency should be reduced throughout its range, and outlying stands, especially on islands, should be reserved and protected...|$|E

40|$|Objective In vitro tests {{demonstrated}} that the new cone-bearing configuration of the Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart Inc, New York, NY) left ventricular assist device exhibits better hydraulic efficiency than the previous pin-bearing design. We investigated the long-term outcomes of patients who received the Jarvik 2000 left ventricular assist device, depending on bearing design. Methods A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from 18 centers included in the Italian Registry was performed. From May 2008 to September 2013, 99 patients with end-stage heart failure were enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their Jarvik 2000 suspending mechanism: Group pin included patients with pin bearings (May 2008 to June 2010), and group cone included patients with newer <b>cone</b> <b>bearings</b> (July 2010 to September 2013). The 2 {{groups did not differ}} significantly in terms of baseline characteristics. Results A total of 30 of 39 patients (group pin) and 46 of 60 patients (group cone) were discharged. During follow-up, 6 patients underwent transplantation, and in 1 patient the left ventricular assist device was explanted. The cumulative incidence competing risk of the entire cohort for noncardiovascular-related death was 28 % (20 %- 40 %); the cumulative incidence competing risk for cardiovascular-related death was 56 % (42 %- 73 %) : 71 % in group pin versus 26 % in group cone (P =. 034). The multivariate analyses confirmed that the pin-bearing design was a risk factor for cardiovascular death, along with Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class. Right ventricular failures and ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were significantly higher in group pin. Conclusions Patients with the new pump configuration showed a better freedom from cardiovascular death and lower incidence of fatal stroke and right ventricular failure.

The present study demonstrates that the Spalax retina contains a photoreceptor layer, an outer nuclear layer (ONL), an outer plexiform layer (OPL), an inner nuclear layer (INL), an inner plexiform layer (IPL), and a ganglion cell layer (GCL). By immunohistochemistry, the number of melanopsin (mRGCs) and non-melanopsin bearing retinal ganglion cells was analyzed in detail. Using the ganglion cell marker RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) it was shown that the Spalax eye contains 890 ± 62 RGCs. Of these, 87 % (752 ± 40) contain melanopsin (cell density 788 melanopsin RGCs/mm 2). The remaining RGCs were shown to co-store Brn 3 a and calretinin. The melanopsin cells were located mainly in the GCL with projections forming two dendritic plexuses located in the inner part of the IPL and in the OPL. Few melanopsin dendrites were {{also found in the}} ONL. The Spalax retina is rich in rhodopsin and long/middle wave (L/M) <b>cone</b> opsin <b>bearing</b> photoreceptor cells. By using Ctbp 2 as a marker for ribbon synapses, both rods and L/M cone ribbons containing pedicles in the OPL were found in close apposition with melanopsin dendrites in the outer plexus suggesting direct synaptic contact.

40|$|Case {{carburized}} <b>bearing</b> <b>cones</b> {{were subjected}} to impact loadings using an experimental impact drop tester. The cones were manufactured from AISI-SAE 4320 steel by hot ring rolling, or machining from seamless tube. The microstructure consisted of retained austenite and tempered martensite. Some samples also contained fine dispersed carbides. ^ The cones were impacted with energies {{in the range from}} 3 to 30 J. The acceleration of the impacter was measured in-situ. Post impact analysis included indentation surface profiling and cross section sampling for hardness, retained austenite and crack morphology. ^ In general, results indicated that material response to impact loading was dominated by core thickness, microstructural constituents, and service history. ^ Impacts on lubricated contact surfaces were more elastic, thereby limiting deformation. The critical or transition impact energy which caused case fracture was determined. The mode of case fracture depended on the retained austenite profile and load history: (1) Increased retained austenite levels beyond 40 %, greatly reduced case fracture. (2) Increased load cycles moved the transition zone to lower impact energies. With increasing core thickness, the microstructure absorbed more energy. For high energy impacts which caused case fracture, the dependency on core thickness was enhanced. ^ Resulting impact damage depended on the amount and condition of retained austenite. As the retained austenite content increased, more energy was absorbed through work hardening and transformation to martensite. This reduced the depth of the damaged microstructure, as well as the indentation size. Instantaneous case fracture was prevented and cracking of the case structure was largely reduced. During service life, the microstructure continually lost the capability to respond elastically to impact loading. As a result, the absorbed energy increased, damage appeared deeper below the surface and the transition zone beyond which case fracture occurred, moved to lower impact energies. ^ The presence of carbides in the microstructure was beneficial only for very low impact loads, which limited deformation. As load increased, the carbides acted as stress concentration sites, which promoted crack initiation. The mode of deformation changed from displacement and transformation of retained austenite to a combination of displacement and case fracture, which absorbed minimum energy. As a result, the impact damage was far more severe, and extended deeper into the material. ...|$|R
