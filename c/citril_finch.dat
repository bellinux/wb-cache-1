50|$|The <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> {{differs from}} the Corsican finch C. corsicana in habitat selection. While the {{mainland}} <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> is rather restricted to subalpine coniferous forests and alpine meadows, the insular Corsican finch {{may be found in}} different habitats from sea level to the highest mountain slopes. The <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> nests mainly in conifers such as pines (Pinus) and spruces (Picea) while the Corsican finch uses also lower bushes such as tree Heath (Erica arborea), juniper (Juniperus) and bramble (Rubus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> (Carduelis citrinella), {{also known}} as the Alpine <b>citril</b> <b>finch,</b> is a small songbird, a member of the true finch family Fringillidae.

These data are in accordance with the results of previous studies, in which considerable differences between these two localities have been found in survival rate, body condition, moult speed, diet selection, and breeding success.

5000|$|The <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> was {{formally}} {{described by the}} German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 under the binomial name Fringilla citrinella.

It is a diminutive of the Latin citrinus meaning citrine or light greenish-yellow. The Corsican finch (Carduelis corsicana) was at one time considered as conspecific with the <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> but is now treated a separate species.

5000|$|The {{goldfinch}} {{was one of}} {{the birds}} described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his Historiae animalium of 1555. The first formal description was by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1758. He introduced the binomial name, Fringilla carduelis. [...] Carduelis is the Latin word for a goldfinch. The genus Carduelis was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 by tautonomy based on Linneus's specific epithet.

50|$|As {{might be}} {{expected}} in such an important ecosystem, {{there is a great}} variety of wildlife, with mammals such as Spanish ibex, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, badger, various types of weasel, European wild cat, fox and hare among others. Birds are also well represented with such specialities as <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> and crested tit as well as the usual waterfowl, especially in the Embalse de Santillana (Santillana reservoir). birds of prey include the impressive Spanish imperial eagle and Eurasian black vulture. In fact, the animal species inhabiting the Guadarramas represent 45% of the fauna of Spain and 18% of those in Europe as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|The siskin {{is easy to}} recognize, but in some {{instances}} it can be confused with other finches such as the <b>citril</b> <b>finch,</b> the greenfinch or the European serin. The European siskin, in many plumages, is a bright bird. Adult male European siskins are bright green and yellow with a black cap, and an unstreaked throat and breast. Adult females also usually have green and yellow plumage tones: for example, yellow in the supercilium and {{on the sides of}} the breast, green tones in the mantle and yellow in the rump. The ground colour of the underparts of European siskin is normally pure white. In females and juveniles, the centre of the belly and lower breast are often largely or entirely unstreaked. The wingbars of European siskin are broad and yellow (with the tips white) and the bill is short with a decurved culmen.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Citril</b> <b>finch</b> Serinus citrinella is a Paleartic {{endemic species}} that breeds in the subalpine {{mountain}} zones of western temperate Europe. The species {{seems to be}} suffering a serious decline in its northern range, mainly in the Black Forest and the NE of the Alps. Numerous reasons have been provided for this decline, {{but all of them}} have been related to breeding habitats. Given that the species undergoes an altitu¬dinal migration and that during winter it may use very different habitats, a sound knowledge of the distribution patterns and habitats used outside the breeding period is needed to conduct adequate conservation policies and management. This information, however, is largely lacking. The aim of this paper was to determine the current habitat used by Citril finches in north–eastern Spain during the winter, to analyse habitat suitability and to study movements, by investigating the origin of birds that overwinter in Catalonia. <b>Citril</b> <b>finch</b> distribution was modelled using both discriminant analysis and maximum entropy modelling, on the basis of species occurrences during winter in Catalonia (data from 1972 – 2009). Results showed that the presence of two tree species, Black pine (Pinus nigra subsp. salzmanii) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), both as part of mixed open forests, and the presence of abundant farmland and arvensic plants —the two vegetation units located in a typical sub¬mediterranean context, where the warm temperatures (sunny days) in late winter permit the cones to open—, were the ecological and bioclimatic variables that explain the distribution model. All these variables in tandem seem to be the key for the current potential distribution of the <b>Citril</b> <b>finch</b> in winter (AUCscores: training data AUC= 0. 955; test data AUC = 0. 953). We analyzed recoveries (N = 238) of 2, 368 birds ringed at wintering grounds and 12, 648 birds ringed at subalpine localities in the adjacent Pyrenees from 1977 – 2004. We found that in the study area, we recovered ringed birds from many different locations from across the distributional range of the species, including trans–Pyrenean birds from the Alps. This stresses the high mobility of <b>Citril</b> <b>finch</b> populations to reach wintering areas. From a conservation point of view, the high importance of pines (mainly Black pine) for the wintering distribution of the species stresses that any threat on pines, especially forest fires, will have acute detrimental effects for <b>Citril</b> <b>finch</b> populations...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. —Inter-locality {{variation}} in breeding phenology and nesting habitat of the <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> Car-duelis citrinella in the Catalonian Pre-Pyrenees. Aims: Considerable variations {{have been found}} amongst several <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> sub-populations at Port del Comte mountain in the Catalonian Pre-Pyrenees in reproductive success, body mass, fat score, diet, sur-vival rate and speed of moult due to different habitat quality and different slope exposition. In line with these studies, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate variations in breeding phenology and nesting habi-tat between north-facing high quality areas (Vansa) and south-facing low quality areas (Bofia) as well as east-facing areas of intermediate quality (Port Comte / Sucre). Since the species habitat requirements have been little studied before, another aim of this study was the recording of some basic data on the phenolo-gy of this species and its nesting habitat in Spain. Location: The slopes of Port del Comte mountain (Catalonian Pre-Pyrenees). Results and Conclusions: As expected, variations were found in breeding phenology and nesting habi-tat. Birds on the moister and cooler north-and east-facing slopes (Vansa, Port Comte) started breeding ear-lier than did birds from the drier and sunnier south-facing slopes (Bofia). All nests at the slightly more elevated locality of Bofia were built in mountain pines Pinus mugo, while at the other two study sites...|$|E

40|$|The <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> (Serinus citrinella) is a Cardueline finch {{restricted}} to the high mountains of western Europe. Since 1991 we have captured-recaptured about 6000 birds in two contrasting subpopulations located on the same mountain but separated by 5 km in distance. Citril finches, at the north-facing locality (La Vansa), rely more on Pine trees (Pinus uncinata) as their main food source, than birds at the south-facing locality (La Bofia), which rely more on herb seeds, which are of lower energetic content. Birds at La Vansa had higher body mass and fat score than those at La Bofia, suggesting that La Vansa was a site of higher-quality than La Bofia. By {{the use of a}} metapopulation approach and multistate models, we found that citril finches at the high-quality locality (La Vansa) showed higher survival rates than those at the low-quality one (La Bofia) (Vansa adults: φ = 0. 42 - 0. 04, juveniles: φ = 0. 34 - 0. 05; Bofia adults: φ = 0. 35 - 0. 04, juveniles: φ = 0. 28 - 0. 05). Dispersal was also asymmetric and higher for juvenile birds, with movement rates for juvenile citril finches from the low-quality to the higher-quality locality (Bofia to Vansa: ‚ = 0. 38 - 0. 10) higher than the reverse (Vansa to Bofia: ‚ = 0. 09 - 0. 03). We also investigated time-specific factors (e. g. meteorological data and fructification rate of Pinus) as potential predictors of overall mortality and dispersal patterns. The results do not allow strong conclusions regarding the impact of these factors on survival and movement rates. Patterns of movement found in the <b>Citril</b> <b>Finch</b> between localities document a new model for the dispersal of species from low to high quality habitats, which we label of 'sources and pools'. This contrasts with currently accepted models of 'sources and sinks', in which movement is from high to low quality habitats, and 'Ideal Free Distributions', {{in which there is a}} balanced dispersal between habitats of different quality. ...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to affect natural populations in many ways. One way of getting {{an understanding of the}} effects of a changing climate is to analyze time series of natural populations. Therefore, we analyzed time series of 25 and 20 years, respectively, in two populations of the <b>citril</b> <b>finch</b> (Carduelis citrinella) to understand the background of a dramatic increase in wing length in this species over this period, ranging between 1. 3 and 2. 9 phenotypic standard deviations. We found that the increase in wing length is closely correlated to warmer winters and in one case to rain in relation to temperature in the summer. In order to understand the process of change, we implemented seven simulation models, ranging from two nonadaptive models (drift and sampling), and five adaptive models with selection and/or phenotypic plasticity involved and tested these models against the time series of males and females from the two population separately. The nonadaptive models were rejected in each case, but the results were mixed {{when it comes to the}} adaptive models. The difference in fit of the models was sometimes not significant indicating that the models were not different enough. In conclusion, the dramatic change in mean wing length can best be explained as an adaptive response to a changing climate...|$|E
