5|$|Especially {{important}} was the fishing and trade in herring and cod in the Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. The herring was of unprecedented significance to the economy of much of Northern Europe, {{and it was one}} of the most common commodities traded by the Hanseatic League, a powerful north German alliance of trading guilds. Kippers made from herring caught in the North Sea could be found in markets as far away as Constantinople. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. Stockfish, cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of mollusks including oysters, mussels and scallops were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater crayfish were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Freshwater fish such as pike, <b>carp,</b> <b>bream,</b> perch, lamprey and trout were common.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major and}} {{historical}} {{activity in the}} gulf is fishing, especially on the northern coast near Vyborg, Primorsk and on the southern coast near Ust-Luga. Commercial fish species are herring, sprats, European smelt, whitefishes, <b>carp</b> <b>bream,</b> roaches, perch, European eel, lamprey and others. In 2005, the catchment was 2000 tons by the ships of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast alone.|$|E
25|$|The Karelian Isthmus is {{a popular}} place for hiking, cycling, skiing (Korobitsyno and Kavgolovo), {{climbing}} (near Kuznechnoye), canoeing (Losevo), fishing for consumption (of <b>carp</b> <b>bream,</b> northern pike, roach, European perch, ruffe, burbot and others), mushroom hunting (for porcini, red-capped scaber stalk, birch bolete, velvet bolete, slippery Jack, golden chanterelle, Lactarius resimus, woolly milk-cap, ugly milk-cap, saffron milk-cap, Lactarius rufus, various Russulas and others), berry picking (of bilberry, raspberry, woodland strawberry, cowberry, cranberry, cloudberry, bog bilberry and stone bramble). It {{is a popular}} summer resort for Saint Petersburg citizens since the late 19th century, served by trains of Finlyandsky Rail Terminal. The isthmus, especially the land along Saint Petersburg–Vyborg and Saint Petersburg–Priozersk railroads, hosts numerous dachas.|$|E
50|$|It is {{used for}} coarse fishing, {{particularly}} <b>carp,</b> roach, <b>bream,</b> perch, tench and pike.|$|R
50|$|The park {{contains}} two lakes {{which are very}} popular with fishermen. The larger lake has two islands and is inhabited by several large <b>carps,</b> <b>bream</b> and tench fishes {{as well as a}} large amount of skimmer breams, roaches and perches. The smaller lake has a path running around the perimeter making it ideal for match fishermen to set up with their seatboxes; it offers good amounts of Roach and Bream as well as several Carp and Tench.|$|R
50|$|The {{waterway}} is {{a popular}} location for match and occasional fishing. There are large <b>carp,</b> chub, <b>bream,</b> roach, and perch in the canal, plus dace and barbel on some stretches (www.waterscape.com/River_Soar).|$|R
25|$|Ukraine {{is divided}} into two main zoological areas. One of these areas, in the west of the country, is made up of the borderlands of Europe, where there are species typical of mixed forests, the other is located in eastern Ukraine, where steppe-dwelling species thrive. In the forested areas of the country it is not {{uncommon}} to find lynxes, wolves, wild boar and martens, as well as many other similar species; this is especially true of the Carpathian Mountains, where a large number of predatory mammals make their home, as well as a contingent of brown bears. Around Ukraine's lakes and rivers beavers, otters and mink make their home, whilst in the waters <b>carp,</b> <b>bream</b> and catfish are the most commonly found species of fish. In the central and eastern parts of the country, rodents such as hamsters and gophers are found in large numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{south-eastern}} side of {{the district}} {{is dominated by the}} [...] country park which opened in 1989. At the other northern end of the town is South Norwood Lake, which was created after the reservoir for the unsuccessful Croydon Canal went out of use. It is used by the Croydon Sailing Club and local anglers who fish for <b>carp,</b> <b>bream</b> and perch.|$|E
60|$|The Unknown.--I wish {{to guard}} you against the {{adoption}} of any hypothesis on this recondite and abstruse subject. But however difficult {{it may be to}} define the exact nature of respiration, yet the effect of it and its connexions with the functions of the body are sufficiently striking. By the action of air on the blood it is fitted for the purposes of life, and from the moment that animation is marked by sensation or volition, this function is performed, the punctum saliens in the ovum seems to receive as it were the breath of life in the influence of air. In the economy of the reproduction of the species of animals, {{one of the most important}} circumstances is the aeration of the ovum, and when this is not performed, from the blood of the mother as in the mammalia by the placenta, there is a system for aerating as in the oviparous reptiles or fishes, which enables the air freely to pass through the receptacles in which the eggs are deposited, or the egg itself is aerated out of the body through its coats or shell, and when air is excluded, incubation or artificial heat has no effect. Fishes which deposit their eggs in water that contains only a limited portion of air, make combinations which would seem almost the result of scientific knowledge or reason, though depending upon a more unerring principle, their instinct for preserving their offspring. Those fishes that spawn in spring or the beginning of summer and winch inhabit deep and still waters, as the <b>carp,</b> <b>bream,</b> pike, tench, &c., deposit their eggs upon aquatic vegetables, which by the influence of the solar light constantly preserve the water in a state of aeration. The trout, salmon, hucho, and others of the Salmo genus, which spawn in the beginning or end of winter, and which inhabit rivers fed by cold and rapid streams which descend from the mountains, deposit their eggs in shallows on heaps of gravel, as near as possible to the source of the stream where the water is fully combined with air; and to accomplish this purpose they travel for hundreds of miles against the current, and leap over cataracts and dams: thus the Salmo salar ascends by the Rhone and the Aar to the glaciers of Switzerland, the hucho by the Danube, the Isar, and the Save, passing through the lakes of the Tyrol and Styria to the highest torrents of the Noric and Julian Alps.|$|E
