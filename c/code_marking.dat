The result indicates that using fluorescent paint is a technique with many advantages e. g. offering the possibility to be read under ice.

40|$|The {{development}} ufthe {{optical character}} reading (OCR) machine for high-speed <b>code</b> <b>marking</b> and sortation of letter mail {{has led to}} the need for a high-speed method of printing the phosphorescent code marks used by the mechanised letter sorting machines. This paper looks at the requirements,for the printing system, the method adopted and the results achieved. 1 HISTORY Early {{in the development of the}} automatic letter sorting system the British Post Ofice (BPO) adopted a system of <b>code</b> <b>marking</b> letter mail with phosphorescent machine readable codes. Phosphorescent encoding was chosen in preference to fluorescent, magnetic, or passive optical encoding because envelopes have no natural phosphorescence thus simplifying the detection of the coded information. Fluorescent and magnetic encoding systems are more likely to suffer from background inter-ference; background fluorescence occurs from optical brightening agents (OBAs) added to the paper in manu-facture and background magnetism from enclosures within envelopes. A passive optical system, black and white bars, places a constraint on the customer to leave a set area of the envelope blank and is unacceptable. The method of coding currently in use on coding desks is hot melt transfer which, although highly effec-tive on all envelope materials at coding desk rates, is an inherently slow process having a maximum throughput speed of two items per second. Optical character reading (OCR) machines are cost effective only at high throughput rates, of the order of ten items per second, and so a new method of printing was required to match the increased speed. Enclosures within envelopes can be irregular in shape, raising some parts of the envelope surface and leaving cavities elsewhere, thus the envelope can be ren-dered vulnerable to damage by high pressures from an impact type of printer. An ink jet printer imposes almost zero impact pressure on the printed item and also has the capability of high printing speed; it thus became the first choice solution to the printing problem even though no suitable phosphorescent ink was avail-able at the time.

40|$|Purpose: One of {{the most}} actual trends in program code {{protection}} is <b>code</b> <b>marking.</b> The problem consists in creation of some digital “watermarks” which allow distinguishing different copies of the same program codes. Such marks could be useful for authority protection, for code copies numbering, for program propagation monitoring, for information security proposes in client-server communication processes. Methods: We used the methods of digital steganography adopted for program codes as text objects. The same-shape symbols method was transformed to same-semantic element method due to codes features which makes them different from ordinary texts. We use dynamic principle of marks forming making codes similar to be polymorphic. Results: We examined the combinatorial capacity of permutations possible in program codes. As a result it was shown that the set of 5 - 7 polymorphic variables is suitable for the most modern network applications. Marks creation and restoration algorithms where proposed and discussed. The main algorithm is based on full and partial permutations in variables names and its declaration order. Algorithm for partial permutation enumeration was optimized for calculation complexity. PHP code fragments which realize the algorithms were listed. Discussion: Methodic proposed in the work allows distinguishing of each client-server connection. In a case if a clone of some network resource was found the methodic could give information about included marks and thereby data on IP, date and time, authentication information of client copied the resource. Usage of polymorphic stego-watermarks should improve information security indexes in network communications. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Somatic {{hypermutation}} introduces base substitutions {{into the}} rearranged and expressed immunoglobulin (Ig) variable regions to promote immunity. This pathway requires and is {{initiated by the}} Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) protein, which deaminates cytidine to produce uracils and UG mismatches at the Ig genes. Subsequent processing of uracil by mismatch repair and base excision repair factors contributes to mutagenesis. While selective for certain genomic targets, the chromatin modifications which distinguish hypermutating from non-hypermutating loci are not defined. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we show that AID-targeted loci in mammalian B cells contain ubiquitinated chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of a constitutively hypermutating Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 s B cell line, Ramos, revealed the presence of monoubiquitinated forms of both histone H 2 A and H 2 B at two AID-associated loci, but not at control loci which are expressed but not hypermutated. Similar analysis using LPS activated primary murine splenocytes showed enrichment of the expressed V(H) and S gamma 3 switch regions upon ChIP with antibody specific to AID and to monoubiquitinated H 2 A and H 2 B. In the mechanism of mammalian hypermutation, AID may interact with ubiquitinated chromatin because confocal immunofluorescence microscopy visualized AID colocalized with monoubiquitinated H 2 B within discrete nuclear foci. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that monoubiquitinated histones accompany active somatic hypermutation, revealing part of the histone <b>code</b> <b>marking</b> AID-targeted loci. This expands the current view of the chromatin state during hypermutation by identifying a specific nucleosome architecture associated with somatic hypermutation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a mechatronic system, designed and {{developed for the}} forest industry, to trace logs from forest to sawmill. The research is {{a key part of}} a large research project launched by the EU in 2006 called the Indisputable Key project. Wood waste during harvesting, transportation and refinement is a major concern for the wood industry worldwide. Some raw materials are not suited for specific end products, and acknowledging this late in the wood value chain is cost inefficient. Pinpointing specific raw material suitable for a particular end product could increase quality, reduce waste and environmental impact; to accomplish this, traceability is essential. To trace the raw material of a final wood product to its origin, marking and reading of the different specimens must occur at each refining stage in the wood value chain. The traceability chain can be divided into three main stages: forest to sawmill, inside the sawmill, and from sawmill to second manufacturer. The research presented here covers {{the first part of the}} wood value chain, namely, forest to sawmill. In Scandinavian countries, logs are cut to length in the forest using a harvester machine. To trace logs, a unique identity code needs to be associated with each log at harvesting time in the forest and detected before further processing at the sawmill. Earlier research using RFID transponders as code carriers have been functionally verified but too costly. Although the cost of RFID transponders is declining, alternative methods are considered a necessity. This constitutes the main driver behind this thesis. The thesis presents a promising alternative log marking method comprising a harvester saw-integrated log code printer and a sawmill code detection system. An identity code in the form of a standard matrix code is applied via the harvester saw bar during cutting. A prototype has been designed and realized and the results point towards a both time and cost efficient solution. The code detection system, to be placed in one or more locations at the sawmill, is based on vision technology and image processing to detect the applied log codes. Both log <b>code</b> <b>marking</b> and reading systems communicate with an ICT system which maintains the traceability database. A major advantage of the system is that both marking and reading is performed without any time-loss and hence do not disturb the high pace production flow in todays forestry. Also, the item cost of each code mark is very low, compared to e. g. a transponder. The marking technology is patent pending. A field test was performed in December 2009 in northern Sweden. A test batch of 320 logs was marked and read. Two code structures (i. e., matrix and barcode) were applied, where 210 barcoded logs were used to demonstrate log traceability between forest and sawmill. This result indicates that this technology has potential. The prototype is not intended for commercial use, but serves merely to demonstrate the potential of the method; further research is needed to improve its functionality. QC 2011051...|$|E
