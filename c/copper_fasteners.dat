25|$|In August 2015 the Diving with a Purpose Underwater Archaeology Program in {{conjunction}} with the National Park Service and the National Association of Black Scuba Divers announced they believe the wreck has been located on the reef off the coast of Key Largo, Fl. Underwater excavations in 2010 and 2012 by the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration identified the wreck through a cologne bottle from the early 1800s, bone china, lead shot, blue-edged earthenware, metal rigging, <b>copper</b> <b>fasteners,</b> and wooden plank fragments recovered from the wreck site.|$|E
50|$|Henry Ramey Upcher {{was built}} by Lewis 'Buffalo' Emery of Sheringham {{at a cost of}} £150. Her keel was laid down on 4 April 1894 after a search had taken several months to find a {{suitable}} piece of wood to mould the keel. This was marked with a ceremonial driving of the first nail by Miss Upcher and Mrs Russel Upcher. The boat was built {{in the style of the}} local crab fishing boats using local oak for the planking and <b>copper</b> <b>fasteners.</b> The boat was 39 ft long and 11 ft wide and was double ended. She was powered with 16 oars and she was fitted with a large dipping lug mainsail and a mizzen. She was much lighter than the RNLI’s lifeboat William Bennett who was on the Sheringham station during this period. Difficulties with launching the RNLI boat also made her faster to launch. These two factors made her very popular with the fishermen that crewed her. On the downside, her extra width tended to make her more liable to ship water in severe conditions and so was less suitable than the RNLI boats in heavy seas. Her naming ceremony took place on 4 September 1894 by Mrs. Upcher. When launched the crew of the Henry Ramey Upcher commonly consisted of 28 men. This was a coxswain, second coxswain and 16 oarsmen; a further 8 men tended the sails and two worked the pumps near the stern.|$|E
40|$|At least 64 shipwrecked stone {{transports}} {{have been}} discovered throughout the Mediterranean region dating primarily to the Roman period. Few have been excavated and even fewer have had more than scant hull remains recovered. None have been thoroughly examined {{with a focus on}} the construction of the vessel. Consequently, little is known about stone transport or the construction of stone transport ships from archaeological contexts or ancient historical sources. In 1993, on an Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) shipwreck survey along the western Turkish coast, the K?z?lburun column wreck was discovered. At present, excavated ceramics suggest the date of the K?z?lburun shipwreck lies in the first century B. C. E.; the Late Hellenistic period (323 - 31 BCE). Analyses of the marble consignment have revealed that the ship carried a primary cargo of architectural elements quarried on the island of Proconnesus. Subsequent investigations point to a likely destination of the ancient city of Claros on the Karian coast of Asia Minor (modern day Turkey). Between 2005 and 2011 excavations were carried out on the column wreck by an international team of archaeologists, INA staff members, and graduate students led by Donny Hamilton and Deborah Carlson, both of Texas A&M University. The 2005 excavation season produced the first, albeit scant, hull remains, with more timbers being recovered between 2006 and 2009. The most substantial hull remains were recovered in 2007 following the removal of the eight large marble column drums to a more remote part of the site. The intense weight and pressure exerted by the heavy cargo on the hull remains aided the preservation by creating an environment that was unfavorable for wood consuming organisms and other biological agents. Recording and detailed examination of the hull remains was conducted during the summer of 2008, fall of 2009, and fall of 2010. This thesis presents the analyses and interpretation of the K?z?lburun ship?s wooden hull remains and <b>copper</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Additionally, after discussing the methods of recording and cataloging of the ship?s extant remains, I place the ship in its historical and technological contexts, demonstrating that it was of contemporaneously common dimensions and construction, as opposed to a more robust construction that is often assumed of ancient stone-carrying vessels...|$|E
