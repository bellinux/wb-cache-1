40|$|Composers seem to <b>compose</b> alone. It is {{not just}} a {{stereotype}} especially in western music culture, in which <b>composing</b> is mostly an off-stage process. A composition is published or performed only after the composer finishes endless revision. However, in different music cultures, <b>composing</b> could mean to improvise on-stage, which could happen between multiple improvisers. As various graphical computer-assisted <b>composing</b> tools gradually become pervasive, <b>composing</b> is no longer exclusive to professional composers [1][2]. A missing element of those tools is the chance to share and collaborate through the <b>composing</b> process. A beginner in <b>composing</b> will enjoy <b>composing</b> even more if not <b>composing</b> alone. Why don’t they learn to <b>compose</b> together, in an improvisational style? Why can’t they share a tiny catchy tune that just comes out their minds? In this thesis, we seek to fill in the missing piece in the proposed <b>composing</b> environment. Aims and Objectives The focus of the thesis is to explore how the design of a <b>composing</b> environment can encourage sharing and collaboration between learners through the <b>composing</b> process an...|$|R

500|$|When <b>composing</b> {{for video}} games, Klepacki spends {{a few days}} to <b>compose</b> and master one song on average. He feels writing music for games is {{somewhat}} difficult as only early software builds are available to play; he sometimes must <b>compose</b> songs based on vague descriptions. <b>Composing</b> for cut scenes is easier by comparison, and Klepacki enjoys drawing inspiration and direction from game design art. Nonetheless, he prefers to <b>compose</b> for a game throughout its development rather than write songs for a finished product. He feels that game music has been harder to <b>compose</b> than film or solo music as he must <b>compose</b> for all situations a player may discover or engineer. Klepacki maintains templates with a base of common instruments prepared for sudden bursts of inspiration, as he resents [...] "having technical issues...as an obstacle."

40|$|Designed for {{teachers}} and researchers interested {{in the study of}} the <b>composing</b> process, this guide introduces a method of analysis that can be applied to data from a range of different cases. Specifically, the guide offers a simple, direct coding scheme for, describing the movements occurring during <b>composing</b> that involves four procedures: teaching writers how to <b>compose</b> aloud, taping the <b>composing</b> aloud sessions, coding the tapes onto the <b>composing</b> style sheets, and analyzing the <b>composing</b> style sheet. The guide describes the style sheet as a tool to (1) reduce a lengthy <b>composing</b> tape to a chart; (2) introduce a coding system that can be replicated; (3) sort specific, observable behaviors into defined categories that make it possible to discern regularities and patterns within and across cases; (4) provide a way of determining how parts of the process relate to the whole; and (5) present the sequences of movements tha...|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{interest}} in young children’s writing {{has increased in}} recent years, the focus has centered more around transcription skills (i. e., letter formation and spelling) and less upon children’s early <b>composing.</b> Of the limited research that does exist on early <b>composing,</b> there is little shared understanding around the conceptualization of the construct or {{how it should be}} measured. Research to date has utilized varied and sometimes conflicting scoring and assessment techniques to assess early <b>composing</b> skills in young children. In order to more fully conceptualize this construct, the first study synthesizes extant literature focused upon early writing and <b>composing</b> to understand the nature and measurement of emergent <b>composing.</b> The second study aims to examine <b>composing</b> by exploring 160 prekindergarten children’s performance on a testing battery including a number of pre-existing and alternative writing assessments in order to explore the nature, measurement, and variability of early <b>composing</b> skills. In addition, this study will examine language, literacy, and executive function skills as they relate to children’s performance on early composition tasks. Partial correlations, controlling for children’s age, will be used to determine the degree of relation among children’s <b>composing</b> scores. Partial correlations will also be used to examine the associations of <b>composing</b> scores and children’s language, literacy, and cognitive skills. Multiple linear regressions will be utilized to determine the nature and degree of relation among children’s language, literacy, and executive function skills and early <b>composing.</b> Research of this nature has implications for a more comprehensive understanding of early <b>composing</b> and will lead to a deeper understanding of how to more effectively measure this construct...|$|R

Immaculate Conception's place at the end of the third generation is significant: its Romanesque Revival style is atypical of that period and much more common in the fourth generation that would soon arise, putting it in somewhat of a transitional place between the third and fourth generations.|$|E
