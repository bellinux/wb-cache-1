40|$|Abstract: The lower solar {{atmosphere}} is an intrinsically multi-component and colli-sional environment with electron and proton <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{in the range}} 108 − 1010 Hz, which may be considerably higher than the gyro-frequencies for both species. Colli-sions between different species are altitude dependent because {{of the variation in}} density and temperature of all species. We aim to provide a reliable quantitative set of data for <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies,</b> magne-tization, viscosity, and thermal conductivity for the most important species in the lower {{solar atmosphere}}. Having such data at hand is essential for any modeling that is aimed at describing realistic properties of the considered environment. The relevant elastic and charge transfer cross sections in the considered range of colli-sion energies are now accepted by the scientific community as known with unprecedented accuracy for the most important species that may be found in the lower solar atmo-sphere. These were previously calculated using a quantum-mechanical approach and were validated by laboratory measurements.

25|$|When a {{radio wave}} reaches the ionosphere, the {{electric}} {{field in the}} wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into oscillation at the same frequency as the radio wave. Some of the radio-frequency energy is given up to this resonant oscillation. The oscillating electrons will then either be lost to recombination or will re-radiate the original wave energy. Total refraction can occur when the <b>collision</b> <b>frequency</b> of the ionosphere {{is less than the}} radio frequency, and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the {{mean free path}} of the electron gas interaction, a standard TEM is evacuated to low pressures, typically {{on the order of}} 10−4 Pa. The need for this is twofold: first the allowance for the voltage difference between the cathode and the ground without generating an arc, and secondly to reduce the <b>collision</b> <b>frequency</b> of electrons with gas atoms to negligible levels—this effect is characterized by the mean free path. TEM components such as specimen holders and film cartridges must be routinely inserted or replaced requiring a system with the ability to re-evacuate on a regular basis. As such, TEMs are equipped with multiple pumping systems and airlocks and are not permanently vacuum sealed.|$|E

Absorption at Birdlings Flat is found to have no significant relationship to any other geophysical parameter.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{structure}} of the magnetized sheath is investigated in the multifluid framework. The ambient magnetic field is assumed parallel to the wall and the effect of the plasma magnetization, plasma ionization, and plasma-neutral collisions on the sheath is examined. It is shown that the width of the non-neutral boundary layer is dependent on the <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{as well as on the}} plasma magnetization. The size of the sheath layer can decrease with the increase in magnetic field. The increase in the ion-neutral collision can also adversely affect the sheath size. The equilibrium and levitation of the dust particles in a collisional magnetized sheath are shown to depend on the <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies</b> and on the magnetization. Further, the increase in the collision or magnetization invariably leads to the presence of the positively charged grains near the plasma wall suggesting that the grain levitation inside the charged layer is implicitly dependent on the plasma parameters in a nontrivial way. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{continuum}} {{modeling of}} low pressure plasma discharges, electron collisional interaction terms are modeled using <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies</b> based on electron temperature.

By retaining the directed relative velocities in the collision integrals for multi-temperature mixtures, we have derived necessary corrections for plasma conductivity. Computational results of an argon discharge (10 mTorr) show that these corrections result in increased <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies,</b> leading to increased total power deposition of about 10 % at 500 W in a 300 mm TCP reactor, for a constant inductive coil current.

40|$|An {{important}} question for a comet mission is whether comet nuclei preserve information clarifying aggregation processes of planetary matter. New observational {{evidence shows that}} Trojan asteroids, as a group, display a higher fraction of highly-elongated objects than the belt. More recently evidence has accumulated that comet nuclei, as a group, also display highly-elongated shapes at macro-scale. This evidence comes from the several comets whose nuclear lightcurves or shapes have been well studied. Trojans and comet nuclei share other properties. Both groups have extremely low albedos and reddish-to neutral-black colors typical of asteroids of spectral class D, P, and C. Both groups may have had relatively low <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies.</b> An important problem to resolve with spacecraft imaging is whether these elongated shapes are primordial, or due to evolution of the objects.

40|$|In a {{magnetized}} dusty plasma, Hall {{effect can}} arise due to collisional processes when, e. g., ion-dust collision decouples the ions from the magnetic field. In this case, {{due to the}} dust stoppage of the ions, the Hall electric field can be generated over large scales. The same collisional processes are also responsible for dust charge fluctuations. Therefore, the Hall effect and dust charge fluctuations are intricately linked to {{each other through the}} same mechanism. The inertial scale over which the Hall effect is dynamically important depends not only on the value of the grain charge times the ratio of the grain to the plasma (ion) number densities but also on the ratio of the ion-dust to the electron-dust <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This scale can become arbitrarily large when these <b>collision</b> <b>frequencies</b> are comparable.
