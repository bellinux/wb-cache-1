40|$|ABSTRACT. In this article, we {{describe}} the influence of violations of <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> of fairness (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler, 1986 a) on subsequent ethical decision-making and emotions. Across two studies, we manipulated explanations for a common action, and we find that explanations that violate <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> of fairness (e. g., {{by taking advantage of}} an in crease in market power) lead to greater intentions to behave unethically than explanations that are consistent with <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> of fairness (e. g., by passing along a price increase). We find that perceptions of justifiability mediate this relationship. We also find that individuals derive significant psychological benefits (greater satisfaction, greater happiness, and reduced anger) from engaging in unethical behavior following perceived violations of fairness.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{supporting}} Adda Smaradottir's FreeTheNipple act in public cyberspace, girls uploaded their topless photos to Facebook and protested against its <b>Community</b> <b>Standards</b> of considering women's breasts as sexual materials. Those photos and related news articles were blocked initially, but Facebook considered those photos {{did not violate}} <b>Community</b> <b>Standards.</b>|$|R
40|$|The 1973 Miller v. California {{decision}} of the United States Supreme Court established that individual communities {{have the right to}} determine which sexually explicit materials are to be considered obscene and barred from availability in their community. Since the Miller ruling, 2 ̆ 2 <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> 2 ̆ 2 have become central to the prosecution and defense of sexually explicit materials, and judges or jurors are expected to assess and apply local standards in determining whether or not material is obscene. Despite the centrality of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> 2 ̆ 2 issue in determining obscenity, very few communities have ascertained their <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> regarding sexually explicit material. ^ This research determines the personal standards and the perceived <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> of 308 Lancaster County, Pennsylvania residents regarding access to sexually explicit materials in their community. ^ Community members were surveyed by a questionnaire developed by the investigator and some respondents were studied further using a semi-structured interview. For consideration of the <b>community</b> <b>standard,</b> straight percentages were used. Chi-square, Spearman rho, and discriminant analysis were used where appropriate. ^ Results indicate there is community consensus that adults should have access to materials depicting nudity, that minors should not have access to sexually explicit materials and that sexually explicit depictions of rape or sexual violence should not be available to adults. Beliefs in the negative or positive effects of sexually explicit materials influence attitudes regarding access to the materials. There is no community consensus regarding depictions of nonviolent sexual acts, therefore there is an absence of sufficient conditions for a <b>community</b> <b>standard</b> to be said to exist. <b>Community</b> <b>standards</b> are perceived as less tolerant than personal standards. Responses concerning sexually explicit material are significantly influenced by demographic variables. This research indicates a judge or jury applying the Miller test of obscenity is unlikely to make an objective assessment of <b>community</b> <b>standards.</b> ^ This study 2 ̆ 7 s results provide grounds for a challenge to the Miller test of obscenity based on the Miller test 2 ̆ 7 s false assumptions regarding the assessment and existence of <b>community</b> <b>standards.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{accepted}} view, Smith carved out distributive justice from {{his concept of}} justice and argued that distributive justice would follow {{in the wake of}} natural liberty. In recent contributions, however, it is emphasized that a system of natural liberty will only generate beneficent distributional outcomes if the rules of commutative justice safeguard natural liberty and mirror <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> of justice. In this paper it is argued that Smith increasingly came to question whether commercial society could meet this requirement. Given their subservience to sectional interests, rules of justice neither safeguard natural liberty nor conform to <b>community</b> <b>standards.</b> Moreover, the inherent strain in commercial society to corrupt man's moral sentiments erodes <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> of justice. In the development of Smith's views his growing concern for distributive justice is reflected.

5000|$|Since this {{position}} was novel and not clearly supported by precedent, the court {{turned to a}} supreme court case to find justification. Citing many different opinions in Ashcroft v.ACLU, 535 U.S. 564 (2002), the court builds a case {{that the majority of}} justices view local <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> as a problem when applied to the internet. Additionally, evidence is provided that many justices do not see a national <b>community</b> <b>standard</b> to be a problem, or unconstitutional. In summary, Judge Fletcher writes: [...] "Accordingly, five Justices concurring in the judgment, as well as the dissenting Justice, viewed the application of local <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> in defining obscenity on the Internet as generating serious constitutional concerns. At the same time, five justices concurring in the judgment viewed the application of a national <b>community</b> <b>standard</b> as not or likely not posing the same concerns by itself." ...|$|R

Standards are defined as subjective judgments restricted only by a simple reasonableness condition. Individual standards are aggregated to form the <b>community</b> <b>standard.</b> Several axioms reflect legal concerns. These require that the <b>community</b> <b>standard</b> (a) preserve unanimous agreements, (b) become more permissive when all individuals become more permissive, and not discriminate, ex ante, (c) between individuals and (d) between works. I show that any rule which satisfies these properties must be “similar ” to unanim-ity rule.

40|$|Abstract: Although {{participation}} in multilingual {{communities around the}} world has been understood to be the raison d’être for foreign language study, the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard</b> has been portrayed as an extracurricular experience andmore difficult to weave into instruction than the other standards. This article addresses two questions: (1) Does a study abroad experience facilitate meeting the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard?</b> and (2) How can collegiate foreign language curricula enhance the study abroad experience and fulfillment of the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard?</b> Current trends in study abroad participation by U. S. undergraduates and key research findings on study abroad related to the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard</b> are reviewed. Numerous recommendations for programmatic courses of action at home and abroad targeting a fuller consideration of the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard</b> in collegiate foreign language study are offered.
