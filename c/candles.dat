5000|$|A <b>candle</b> wick {{is usually}} a braided cotton that holds the flame of a oil lamp or <b>candle.</b> A <b>candle</b> wick works by {{capillary}} action, conveying ("wicking") the fuel to the flame. When the liquid fuel, typically melted <b>candle</b> wax, reaches the flame it then vaporizes and combusts. The <b>candle</b> wick influences how the <b>candle</b> burns. Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, fire-resistance, and tethering.|$|R

5|$|Barker was cremated at {{a private}} humanist funeral at Banbury Crematorium, which was {{attended}} only by family and close friends. A public memorial service for Barker was held on 3 March 2006 at Westminster Abbey, with some 2,000 people in attendance. Corbett, Richard Briers, Josephine Tewson, Michael Grade, and Peter Kay all read at the service, while others in attendance included David Jason, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin, Leslie Phillips, Lenny Henry, Dawn French and June Whitfield. A recording of Barker's rhyming slang sermon from The Two Ronnies was played, and while the cross was in procession in the aisle of the abbey, it was accompanied by four <b>candles</b> {{instead of the usual}} two, in reference to the Four <b>Candles</b> sketch. Barker was the third comedy professional to be given a memorial at Westminster Abbey, after Joyce Grenfell and Les Dawson.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the eighteenth}} century, the Russian Orthodox Church did not assign any {{particular}} symbolism to the exterior {{shape of a}} church. Nevertheless, onion domes are popularly believed to symbolise burning <b>candles.</b> In 1917, noted religious philosopher Prince Yevgeny Trubetskoy argued that the onion shape of Russian church domes may not be explained rationally. According to Trubetskoy, drums crowned by tapering domes were deliberately scored to resemble <b>candles,</b> thus manifesting a certain aesthetic and religious attitude. Another explanation {{has it that the}} onion dome was originally regarded as a form reminiscent of the edicula (cubiculum) in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} supercapacitor behaviour of bare, {{washed and}} nitric acid functionalized <b>candle</b> flame carbon soots were reported. Crystallinity and the morphology of the <b>candle</b> soots were recorded using X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The nitric acid functionalized <b>candle</b> soot showed an improved Brunauer-Emmett-Teller {{surface area of}} 137. 93 from 87. 495 m 2 g - 1 of washed <b>candle</b> soot. The presence of various functional groups in <b>candle</b> soots {{and the development of}} oxygen functionalities in the functionalized <b>candle</b> soot were examined through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Raman spectra showed the characteristic peaks corresponding to the D (diamond) and G (graphite) phase of carbon present in the <b>candle</b> soots. The electrochemical characterization was performed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge test and impedance spectroscopy in 1 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. The functionalized <b>candle</b> soot electrode showed an enhanced specific capacitance value of 187 F g - 1 at 0. 15 A g - 1 discharge current density, which is much higher than that of bare and washed <b>candle</b> soot electrodes...|$|R
