40|$|The Toronto Pedestrian Charter {{was adopted}} by Toronto City Council in May, 2002, and was officially {{launched}} by Jane Jacobs. The Charter constitutes a statement of commitment {{on the part of}} the City to address the needs of pedestrians, and what residents have a right to expect from the City. It has become a model for similar charters in other municipalities in Canada and the United States. The Charter was a citizen-led effort to establish a benchmark that would usher in a new policy and regulatory framework to halt the erosion of pedestrians ’ rights that followed the advent of the automobile and an era of city planning whose hallmark was planning for cars. This paper will look at how the Charter was developed and how it has started to affect planning and transportation policy and practice in the city. Janice Etter is a founding member of the Pedestrian Planning Network. She is the Chair of the Union Station Revitalization Public Advisory Group and the <b>Community</b> <b>Chair</b> of the Toronto Food Policy Council.

40|$|This {{research}} had two purposes: to determine <b>community</b> college department <b>chair</b> roles {{and to determine}} whether role conflict exists for the status of Illinois public <b>community</b> college department <b>chair.</b> The research was divided into two phases. In Phase I, <b>community</b> college department <b>chair</b> role factors were determined. Using ratings of importance reported by a sample of Illinois public <b>community</b> college department <b>chairs</b> on {{a modified version of}} Carroll and Gmelch???s (1992) department chair duty questionnaire, principal components analysis was employed to determine an underlying factor structure. Five factors were determined and interpreted as department chair roles: Department Leader, Resource Manager, Faculty Leader, Instructional Manager, and Teacher and Student Adviser. It was also determined whether the importance placed on department chair roles varied by department chair characteristic variables of academic discipline, departmental disciplinary composition, size of department, length of service as chair, whether the chair was elected by faculty or selected by administration, number of years served as a full-time faculty member prior to becoming department chair, and teaching load. Results indicated that certain characteristic variables of Illinois public <b>community</b> college department <b>chairs</b> influence the importance they ascribe to department chair roles. It was also determined in Phase I that role conflict and role overload exist to a mild to moderate extent for the Illinois public <b>community</b> college department <b>chair</b> status. In addition, a specific expression of role overload, namely, department chairs spending an inordinate amount of time performing roles they find of greater importance, may have been determined. In Phase II, the complete role set of department chairs, faculty, and the chief academic officer at one Illinois public community college was studied. It was determined that with minor exceptions, full-time faculty, part-time faculty, and the chief academic officer ascribed the same level of importance to the roles determined in Phase I as did the department chairs. Additionally, no statistically significant differences were found on the importance ascribed to department chair roles based on departmental disciplinary composition or length of faculty service by full and part-time faculty. unpublishedis peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the role that <b>community</b> college <b>chairs</b> play in the change process at two community college areas in a midwestern state. Each college was considered successful within their area, but there were marked differences in how the people at the colleges approached change. By focusing on the chairs, lessons were raised that may be applicable to many community colleges. ^ The two community college areas (and their associated four campuses) were identified from a survey of <b>community</b> college <b>chairs</b> in five college areas in a midwestern state. A qualitative case study methodology was used to systematically study the issues raised in the change process. The study was conducted in three phases. The first phase of the study was a review of related literature in the areas of the approaches to planned change, the evolution of the quality movement, leadership, and the roles played by <b>community</b> college <b>chairs.</b> The second phase consisted of semi-structured interviews conducted on-site during a field study at each of the four campuses. During the third phase, the collected data were assessed to develop a cultural picture of the campuses, determine the use or non-use of quality theory and tools by chairs on these campuses, and determine their roles in implementing change. ^ Research questions examined the characteristics of the colleges and the chairs who worked there; the knowledge and attitudes of the chairs regarding TQM, and the training that chairs had attended. ^ The published works of Deming, Juran, and Crosby, as well as case studies of quality application in industry and higher education, and studies of <b>community</b> college <b>chairs,</b> formed the theoretical foundation for the study. ^ A conceptual framework for proactive change was developed from analysis of the data. Under this framework, visionary leadership drives proactive change in a culture that supports empowerment, teaming, quality focus, and use of data. The results of proactive change are innovation and satisfied constituents. ...|$|R
