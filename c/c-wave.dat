Additionally, preliminary electroretinographic and histopathologic investigations were performed. There is a variable degree of vision loss in rge/rge chicks at 1 day of age with further chicks losing vision {{over the next few weeks}} until all chicks become functionally blind by 30 days of age (although some optokinetic responses remain in some of the rge/rge chicks). Over the first few weeks of life rge/rge chicks develop thicker corneas with a larger radius, hyperopia, shallower anterior chambers and enlarged globes both radially and axially, compared to controls. A preliminary ERG study showed that 1 day old rge/rge chicks have an elevated response threshold, a lower amplitude a-wave with a markedly shallow leading slope, a lack of both oscillatory responses and <b>c-waves</b> and, at brighter flashes, an increased b-wave amplitude.

40|$|Common-conversion-point binning {{associated}} with converted-wave (<b>C-wave)</b> processing complicates {{the task of}} parameter estimation, especially in anisotropic media. To overcome this problem, we derive new expressions for converted-wave prestack time migration (PSTM) in anisotropic media and illustrate their applications using both 2 D and 3 D data examples. The converted-wave kinematic response in inhomogeneous media with vertical transverse isotropy is separated into two parts: the response in horizontally layered vertical transverse isotrophy media and the response from a point-scatterer. The former controls the stacking process and the latter controls the process of PSTM. The <b>C-wave</b> traveltime in horizontally layered vertical transverse isotrophy media is determined by four parameters: the <b>C-wave</b> stacking velocity VC 2, the vertical and effective velocity ratios γ 0 and γeff, and the <b>C-wave</b> anisotropic parameter χeff. These four parameters {{are referred to as}} the <b>C-wave</b> stacking velocity model. In contrast, the <b>C-wave</b> diffraction time from a point-scatterer is determined by five parameters: γ 0, VP 2, VS 2, ηeff and ζeff, where ηeff and ζeff are, respectively, the P- and S-wave anisotropic parameters, and VP 2 and VS 2 are the corresponding stacking velocities. VP 2, VS 2, ηeff and ζeff are referred to as the <b>C-wave</b> PSTM velocity model. There is a one-to-one analytical link between the stacking velocity model and the PSTM velocity model. There is also a simple analytical link between the <b>C-wave</b> stacking velocities VC 2 and the migration velocity VCmig, which is in turn linked to VP 2 and VS 2. Based on the above, we have developed an interactive processing scheme to build the stacking and PSTM velocity models and to perform 2 D and 3 D <b>C-wave</b> anisotropic PSTM. Real data applications show that the PSTM scheme substantially improves the quality of <b>C-wave</b> imaging compared with the dip-moveout scheme, and these improvements have been confirmed by drilling. ...|$|E

This membrane also has a large relative K ' conductance so that lowering [K'] o hyperpolarizes it and therefore increases the transepithelial potential (TEP). Ba t+, a K+ channel blocker, eliminated these normal K +-evoked responses; in their place, lowering [K+] o evoked an apical depolarization and TEP decrease that were blocked by apical ouabain or strophanthidin. These data indicate that Bat+ blocked the major K + conductance(s) of the RPE apical membrane and unmasked a slowing of the normally hyperpolarizing electrogenic Na''-K + pump caused by lowering [K+] o. Evidence is also presented that [K +]o modulates the pump in the isolated RPE under physiological conditions (i. e., without Ba t+). In the intact retina, light decreases subretinal [K+], and produces the vitreal-positive <b>c-wave</b> of the electroretinogram (ERG) that originates primarily in the RPE from a hyperpolarization of the apical membrane and TEP increase.

Methods: The 35 mg/kg NaIO 3 -induced RPE degeneration rat eyes were instilled with 1 % Guanabenz eye drops 3 times a day for 7 days before NaIO 3 injection, and then 2 to 4 weeks thereafter. RPE function was measured with <b>c-wave</b> of electroretinogram (ERG). Male Brown Norway rats were anesthetized to receive Nd:YAG laser to break the Bruch’s membrane.

The development of CNV was determined by fluorescein angiography performed on week 2 and week 4 using sodium fluorescein (FA) or fluorescein isothiocyanatedextran (FD 70 -FA). Colored microsphere technique was used for in vivo experiments to determine the choroidal blood flow in ocular hypertensive (40 mmHg) rabbit eyes.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that the cat retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (RPE) is the source of two potential changes that follow the absorption of light by photoreceptors: a hyperpolarization of the apical membrane, peaking in 2 - 4 s, which leads to the RPE component of the electroretinogram (ERG) <b>c-wave,</b> and a depolarization of the basal membrane, peaking in 5 min, which leads to the light peak. This paper describes a new basal membrane response of intermediate time course, called the delayed basal hyperpolarization. Isolation of this response from other RPE potentials showed that with maintained illumination the hyperpolarization begins- 2 s after light onset, peaks in 20 s, and slowly ends as the membrane repolarizes over the next 60 s. The delayed basal hyperpolarization is very small for stimuli < 4 s in duration and grows with duration, becoming ^- 15 % as large as the preceding apical hyperpolarization with stimuli longer than 20 s. Extracellularly, this response contributes to the transepithelial potential (TEP) across the RPE. In response to light the TEP first rises to a peak, the <b>c-wave,</b> as the apical membrane hyperpolarizes. For stimuli longer than- 4 s, the decline of the TEP from the peak of the <b>c-wave</b> results partly from the recovery of apical membrane potential and partly from the delayed basal hyperpolarization. For long periods of illumination (300 s) the delayed basal hyperpolarization leads to a trough in the TEP between the <b>c-wave</b> and light peak. This trough is largely responsible for a corresponding trough in vitreal recordings, which has been called the "fast oscillation.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of anisotropic parameters {{in the shallow}} subsurface becomes increasingly important for 4 C seismic data processing {{in order to obtain}} accurate images in both time and depth domain. I focus on two approaches to evaluate anisotropy in seismic data: using P-wave data and PS-converted (<b>C-wave)</b> data. To gain better insight into the accuracy and sensitivity of anisotropic parameters to for instance layering and compaction gradients, I undertake numerical modelling studies and verify the results with full-wave modelling as well as findings from the real data from a 4 C data set from the Alba field. The focus of this thesis is on vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) which widely occurs in marine sediments and cannot be neglected in seismic processing. P-wave data alone cannot constrain the vertical velocity and the depth scale of the earth model for a VTI medium. Therefore, the joint inversion of non-hyperbolic P- and converted wave (<b>C-wave)</b> or S-wave data from long offsets has been suggested. I carried out a detailed analysis of the resolution and accuracy of non-hyperbolic moveout inversion for P-, S- and C-waves for a single VTI layer in two parts. First, I introduce the concept of the inherited error delta inh as a measure of the possible resolution of the moveout approximations for the different wave types. The range of this error stays constant regardless of the magnitude of the anisotropic parameter for each wave type. Second, I analyse the accuracy of non-hyperbolic moveout inversion. I find that for anisotropy parameter eta the error of estimation from <b>C-wave</b> data is in most cases about half that from P-wave data. Inversion of non-hyperbolic S-wave moveout data does not resolve the anisotropy parameter due to the presence of cusps in the data. The study is then extended to a multilayered medium considering only P- and C-waves. The results confirm the findings from the single layer case. Furthermore, I investigate phase effects on parameter estimation for P- and C-waves. It is suggested that eta estimated from <b>C-wave</b> data gives a better description of the anisotropy found in a medium than the eta values picked from P-wave data. To verify the above findings near-surface effects are studied on the 4 C data from the Alba field and accompanied by a full-waveform modelling study. I find that the picked eta values from P-wave data are distinctly larger than the eta values from <b>C-wave</b> data and also larger than the eta values from VSP data. The full-wave modelling study shows that picked eta values from P-wave data may account for influence of structure such as velocity gradients in the near-surface and are influenced by high velocity ratios and phase reversals. Finally, I have carried out an integrated analysis of the Alba 4 C data to demonstrate how seismic anisotropy can be estimated from 4 C seismic data and how such information can be used to improve subsurface imaging. The results are presented in two parts. The first part deals with non-hyperbolic moveout analysis for estimating anisotropic parameters to gain improved stacked sections. The second part describes migration model building and final imaging. The models are evaluated by comparison with VSP data results and with a synthetic modelling study for three events of the overburden. The evaluation confirms that the anisotropy parameter obtained from <b>C-wave</b> moveout corresponds better with the VSP data than the values directly estimated from P-wave data.

40|$|PURPOSE. A {{preferential}} loss of ERG b-wave {{was detected}} in a substrain of C 57 BL/ 10 mice. Electroretinographic and histologic techniques {{were used to}} investigate this hitherto unknown retinopathy. METHODS. ERGs were obtained from normal and affected C 57 BL/ 10. C 57 BL/ 6 mice served also as controls. a-Wave and <b>c-wave</b> analyses were performed. Microscopic investigations were done at two different ages. RESULTS. In the scotopic ERG, a severe reduction of the b-wave amplitude could be observed, whereas the a-wave was only moderately attenuated (“negative ERG”). With age, the a-wave amplitude further decreased, but the rate of reduction was comparable to normals. Oscillatory potentials were severely altered, and the photopic ERG was absent. The ERG <b>c-wave</b> was comparable to normal. ERG a-wave analysis also revealed a reduced maximum amplitude, but no significant difference of receptor sensitivity. Light microscopy revealed a thinning of all retinal layers but mostly of the outer plexiform layer. The number of photoreceptor nuclei was reduced by one third. Electron microscopy revealed a profound loss of ribbon-shaped synapses between rod and rod-bipolar cells and severely abnormal ribbons {{in the case of}} cones...|$|E
40|$|Light-evoked {{changes in}} pigment {{epithelial}} cell membrane potentials and retinal extracellular potassium ion concentration, [K+] 0, were measured in an in vitro frog retina-pigment epithelium-choroid preparation. Light stimuli hyperpolarized the apical membrane of the pigment epithelium. Through an electrical shunt pathway connecting the apical and basal membranes, the basal membrane also hyperpolarized, {{but to a}} lesser degree than the apical membrane. This differential hyperpolariation of the two membranes increased the transepithelial potential (TEP). This increase in TEP was shown to be the major voltage source of the <b>c-wave</b> of the electroretinogram (ERG). Direct measurement of [K+] 0 in the distal retina, made with K+-specific microelectrodes, showed a light-evoked decrease in [K+] 0 having an identical time course to the apical hyperpolarization. There was a linear relationship between the light-evoked change in TEP and the logarithm of [K+] 0. This exact relationship was also found when the apical membrane was perfused directly with solutions of varying [K+] 0. The change in TEP associated with the ERC <b>c-wave,</b> therefore, was explained solely by the response of the pigment epithelium to the light-evoked decrease in [K+] 0 in the distal retina...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of reflex myoclonus {{in response to}} touching and pin-pricking the wrist or stretching the fingers and to photic stimulation was assessed in 24 patients with a presumed diagnosis of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) and in 30 age matched control subjects. Reflex myoclonus to soma-esthetic stimulation was found in 23 patients and in none of the controls. Photic myoclonus was present in 12 patients and in none of the controls. Electrophysiological study of the reflex myoclonus showed enhanced (> 10 microV) somatosensory evoked potentials and an associated reflex electromyographic discharge (<b>C-wave)</b> in 15 patients. These findings indicate that reflex myoclonus is common in OPCA and probably of cortical origin...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} comprises a {{study of}} venous pulse, carotid, cardiographic, and heart sound records from twenty-one men with normal hearts. The heart sounds were recorded by the method of Einthoven. When correction is made for transmission, the first heart sound begins, on an average, 0. 131 of a second before the <b>c-wave</b> of the venous pulse, and has an average duration of 0. 128 of a second. The second heart sound begins a few hundredths of a second before the v-wave and has a duration of 0. 091 of a second. The third heart sound occurs shortly before or is coincident {{with the beginning of}} the h-wave. It has an average duration of about 0. 03 of a second. Considerable variation from the average positions are noted in individual cases. This is especially true in the relation between the second heart sound and the v-wave. Measurements of the venous pulse and heart sound intervals show that the a-c, c-v, and v-h venous pulse intervals, the first to second and the second to third heart sound intervals, and systole tend to remain fairly constant in length when cardiac cycles of different length are considered. The v-a, h-a, and x-a venous pulse intervals, the third to first heart sound interval, and diastole tend to vary in length with variations in total length of the cycle. Records of the venous pulse and heart sound obtained from dogs show a similar relation to that found in man. The main difference observed was an earlier occurrence of the first heart sound before the <b>c-wave</b> of the venous pulse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} {{sympathetic}} stimulation by Dobutamine were investigated {{in order to}} expand {{our knowledge of the}} mechanical heart action and to improve the understanding of Impedance Cardio-graphy (ICG). US Doppler and ICG signals were recorded at baseline without Dobutamine, after ap-plication of 5 g (g=µg×kg- 1 ×min- 1) and subsequently of 10 g Dobutamine in 20 healthy male subjects. As a result we found a highly reproducible double peak in the <b>C-wave</b> of the ICG, which is dependent on the concentration of Dobutamine and the respiration cycle. We therefore conclude, that Dobutamine may be an appropriate agent for detecting different physiological components within the ICG and may also reveal important information about the me-chanical properties of the heart, like contractility...|$|E
40|$|The {{data used}} in this study were {{acquired}} by nine-component (9 C) vertical seismic profile (VSP), using three orthogonal vector sources. The 9 C vertical seismic profile is capable of generating P-wave mode and the fundamental S-wave mode (SH-SH and SV-SV) directly at the source station and permits the basic components of elastic wavefield (P, SH-SH and SV-SV) to be separated from one another for the purposes of imaging. Analysis and interpretations of data from the study area show that incident full-elastic seismic wavefield is capable of reflecting four different wave modes, P, SH, SV and C which can be utilized to fully understand the architecture and heterogeneities of geologic sequences. The conventional seismic stratigraphy utilizes only reflected P-wave modes. The notation SH mode is the same as SH-SH; SV mode means SV-SV and C mode which is a converted shear wave is a special SV mode and is the same as P-SV. These four wave modes image unique geologic stratigraphy and facies {{and at the same time}} reflect independent stratal surfaces because of the unique orientation of their particle-displacement vectors. As a result of the distinct orientation of individual mode. s particle-displacement vector, one mode may react to a critical subsurface sequence more than the other. It was also observed that P-wave and S-wave do not always reflect from the same stratal boundaries. At inline coordinate 2100 and crossline coordinates of 10, 380, 10430, 10480 and 10, 520 the P-wave stratigraphy shows coherency at time slice 796 m/s and <b>C-wave</b> stratigraphy shows coherency at time slice 1964 m/s at the same inline coordinate and crossline coordinates of 10, 400 to 10470. At inline coordinate 2800 and crossline coordinate 10, 650, P-wave stratigraphy shows coherency at time slice 792 m/s and <b>C-wave</b> stratigraphy shows coherency at time slice 1968 m/s. The utilization of full-elastic seismic wavefield needs to be maximized in oil and gas explorations in order to optimize the search for hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|Deep-water 4 C {{data are}} {{collected}} with sources and receivers at different depths. Seismic velocity estimation algorithms {{commonly used in}} data processing assume that sources and receivers are at the same datum. To satisfy this requirement, vertical time shifts are applied to the data or straight ray projections are performed to bring shots and receivers to the same datum. If the sampling of the acquisition geometry is adequate then wave-equation datuming can also be applied. In this paper, we present formulae for P-wave and <b>C-wave</b> migration velocity analysis directly from different source and receiver datum levels. We demonstrate that these equations are more accurate than the static shifts or the straight-ray projection for reflection travel times of deep-water seafloor recording. We use pseudo-offset migration (POM) (Wang and Pham, 2001) to estimate the migration velocities. Model data and field data examples show that accurate migration velocities can be obtained using POM...|$|E
40|$|There {{are various}} types of converted-wave (<b>C-wave)</b> traveltime equations: for example, two-term or three-term Taylor series {{expansions}} (e. g. Thomsen, 1999), and double-squared-root (DSR) equations (e. g. Li and Yuan, 1999). These different types of equations often have different kinds of parameterization and applicability. In this paper, we examine the accuracy and limitations of these existing equations and present two improved equations under an unified system for both single- and multi-layered anisotropic media. One is a four-parameter Taylor-series equation, {{and the other is}} a five-parameter DSR equation. These two equations are different from those in Thomsen (1999) and Li and Yuan (1999), and are more accurate for far offsets up to twice reflector depth. The improved Taylor series equation can be used for velocity analysis and parameter estimation, and the improved DSR equation can be used for prestack migration. Field data examples are used to illustrate the applications...|$|E
40|$|A B STRACT Receptor {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} extracellularly from the all-rod retina of the skate after {{the application of}} sodium aspartate. This agent suppresses the responses of proximal elements, but leaves relatively unaffected the electrical activity of the photoreceptors (a-wave) and pigment epithelium (<b>c-wave).</b> Since the latter develops too slowly {{to interfere with the}} receptor response, it was possible to isolate receptor potentials and to compare their behavior in light and dark adaptation with earlier observations on the S-potential, b-wave, and ganglion cell discharge. The results show that the photoreceptors display the full complement of adaptational changes exhibited by cells proximal to the receptors. Thus, it appears that visual adaptation in the skate is governed primarily by the photoreceptors themselves. Of particular interest was the recovery of sensitivity in the presence of background fields that initially saturate the receptor potential. Analysis of this recovery phase indicates that a gaincontrol mechanism operates within the receptors, at a distal stage of the visual process...|$|E
