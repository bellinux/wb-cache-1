Furthermore, substantial cash prizes should be awarded to designers and builders of prototypes of “the world's quietest airplanes” for selected <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The manufacturers <b>of</b> such <b>aircraft</b> should be granted significant tax benefits and other competitive advantages by Congress.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final stage}} in the S.7's {{development}} was the Supersette (Super 7), two standard S.7s, one re-engined with a 380 hp de Havilland Gipsy Queen with a unique four-piece cowling that opened like a [...] "flower petal", the other with an Alfa Romeo 121. Both were modified and refined several times, and in the latter aircraft, Guidantonio Ferrari increased the international airspeed record for this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> to 419.482 km/h at Rome on December 3, 1952. Despite this, the air force was no longer interested in buying piston-engined trainers, and no further Supersettes were built. Both are preserved in museums.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to describe}} Nikolsky's technical achievements {{is to say that}} he dominated a new and important field. His domain was the field of rotary wing aircraft, exemplified first and most strikingly by the helicopter, and later by the new <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> known as vertical takeoff and landing machines. His original work with the small group at Sikorsky created a technical breakthrough. At Princeton, as a research team leader, he provided information crucially important to rotary wing aircraft designers, and pioneered the development of a facility for the dynamic simulation of those aircraft which was unique in the world. He profoundly influenced the growth of research in the expanding Aeronautical Engineering Department, especially with rotary wing, to the point where Princeton became the foremost center of knowledge in that area. At Princeton, Nikolsky wrote two books, including the first definitive text on the analysis and design of rotary-wing aircraft: Notes on Helicopter Design Theory (1945) and Helicopter Analysis (1951).|$|E
5000|$|American Champion Aircraft Corporation {{acquired}} the Champ and related designs in 1989. In 2001, they were {{rumored to be}} considering a reintroduction of the Champ design as a 7EC powered by a Jabiru Aircraft engine. While a test version was flown, this combination was not put into production. With {{the creation of the}} light-sport aircraft (LSA) <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the United States by the FAA, American Champion in late 2007 began producing a revised version of the 7EC powered by the [...] Continental O-200-A. The new production aircraft are type certified, but also qualify to be flown by sport pilots in the United States. Although the fuselage and cowling contours are similar to the original-production models, the new aircraft uses the windows, interior, door, and windscreen of the modern Citabria. Fuel capacity is reduced to [...] to conserve weight; despite this measure and various others, {{such as the use of}} aluminum landing gear legs and bare birch floorboards rather than carpet, the aircraft's payload is inadequate to carry two adults and full fuel simultaneously. The manufacturer is considering various further weight-reduction measures including the use of the lightened Continental O-200D engine previously offered in the Cessna 162 Skycatcher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aircraft {{noise is}} the chief source of the airport and its {{peripheral}} areas. CCAR imposes restriction on specific <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> and requires more strict measurements of the noise. More scientific measurement method is required to meet the progressively tighter certification standards. Test noise procedures for transport category and turbojet airplanes are analyzed in this paper. The main aspects involved are: test sit requirements, aircraft flight path guidance, aircraft position determination, take off tests, lateral tests and approach tests...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} robust control strategies to augment an identified state-space model of a civil light helicopter. The {{aim of this study}} is to augment the helicopter model to achieve response types and handling qualities of a new <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> called personal aerial vehicles, which can be flown even by inexperienced pilots. Two control methods are considered to augment the helicopter model, Hâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆eand Î¼ synthesis. Differences, advantages, and limitations of the implemented control architectures are highlighted with respect to the personal aerial vehicle reference dynamics in terms of robust stability, nominal performance, and handling qualities. Furthermore, results are presented of an experiment performed with the Max Planck Institute CyberMotion Simulator. The aim of the experiment is to assess the discrepancies between the two augmented systems and the personal aerial vehicle reference model. The experiment consists of piloted closed-loop control tasks performed by participants without any prior flight experience. The results show that the two implemented augmented systems allow inexperienced pilots to achieve workload and performance levels comparable to those defined for personal aerial vehicles...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} advanced forms of aircraft control to civil operation {{appears to be}} capable of being split into two areas. First, those aircraft which are very large, whose rotary inertia tends to reduce the effectiveness of conventional controls. Second, those aircraft whose specification dictates that the aeroplane be flown at very low speed. Again conventional controls become inefficient due to decreased aerodynamic efficiency. The second <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> has been considered {{in the form of an}} STOL aircraft. The control problems of an STOL aircraft with a 2000 ft runway capability (Ref. 10) have been examined. It has been found that the aircraft is unstable and could require autostabilisation. None of the conventional controls were satisfactory and each required augmentation. The single strip crosswind requirement penalises the design most heavily since this requires over half of the extra control power necessary. The total augmentation for blowing air amounts to an equivalent thrust of approximately 6700 lb. This is equivalent to 11. 5 per cent of the total installed aircraft thrust...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} {{of fossil fuels}} in commercial aviation was investigated.

It is concluded that the hydrogen fueled aircraft can perform at reduced size and gross weight the same payload/range mission as conventionally fueled aircraft...|$|R

50|$|In 2012 the FAA {{authorized}} Memphis, Tennessee {{air traffic}} controllers to begin applying revised criteria, which retained the previous weight categories but also addressed differences in approach speeds and wing configuration. This resulted in six <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and the revised spacing allowed among these categories was soon shown to increase airport capacity. The gain in capacity at Memphis was significant, with an FAA-estimated increase in capacity of 15%, and average taxi time for FedEx (Memphis' largest carrier), with about 500 operations per day in 2012) aircraft was cut by three minutes.|$|R
