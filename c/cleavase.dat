5000|$|In {{the basic}} Invader assay, a FEN called <b>cleavase</b> is {{combined}} with two specific oligonucleotide probes, that together with the target DNA, can form a tripartite structure recognized by <b>cleavase.</b> [...] The first probe, called the Invader oligonucleotide is complementary to the 3’ end of the target DNA. The last base of the Invader oligonucleotide is a non-matching base that overlaps the SNP nucleotide in the target DNA. The second probe is an allele-specific probe which is complementary to the 5’ end of the target DNA, but also extends past the 3’ side of the SNP nucleotide. The allele-specific probe will contain a base complementary to the SNP nucleotide. If the target DNA contains the desired allele, the Invader and allele-specific probes will bind to the target DNA forming the tripartite structure. This structure is recognized by <b>cleavase,</b> which will cleave and release the 3’ end of the allele-specific probe. If the SNP nucleotide in the target DNA is not complementary allele-specific probe, the correct tripartite structure is not formed and no cleavage occurs. The Invader assay is usually coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system to detect the cleavage event. In this setup, a quencher molecule {{is attached to the}} 3’ end and a fluorophore is attached to the 5’ end of the allele-specific probe. If cleavage occurs, the fluorophore will be separated from the quencher molecule generating a detectable signal.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} here a {{new approach}} for analyzing nucleic acid sequences using a structure-specific endonuclease, <b>Cleavase</b> I. We have applied this technique to the detection and localization of mutations associated with isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and for differentiating bacterial genera, species and strains. The technique described here {{is based on the}} observation that single strands of DNAs can assume defined conformations, which can be detected and cleaved by structure-specific endonucleases such as <b>Cleavase</b> I. The patterns of fragments produced are characteristic of the sequences responsible for the structure, so that each DNA has its own structural fingerprint. Amplicons, containing either a single 5 '-fluorescein or 5 '-tetramethyl rhodamine label were generated from a 620 -bp segment of the katG gene of isoniazid-resistant and -sensitive M. tuberculosis, the 5 ' 350 bp of the 16 S rRNA genes of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella arizonae, Shigella sonnei, Shigella dysenteriae, Campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus, hominis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus aureus and an approximately 550 -bp DNA segment comprising the intergenic region between the 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella arizonae, Shigella sonnei, and Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 1, 2, and 8. Changes in the structural fingerprints of DNA fragments derived from the katG genes of isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates were clearly identified and could be mapped {{to the site of the}} actual mutation relative to the labeled end. Bland patterns which clearly differentiated bacteria to the level of genus and, in some cases, species were generated from the 16 S genes. <b>Cleavase</b> I analysis of the intergenic regions of Salmonella and Shigella species differentiated genus, species, and serotypes. Structural fingerprinting by digestion with <b>Cleavase</b> I is a rapid, simple, and sensitive method for analyzing nucleic acid sequences and may find wide utility in microbial analysis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cleavase</b> {{fragment}} length polymorphism (CFLP) is a subtyping {{system based}} on {{the property of the}} enzyme <b>cleavase</b> to recognize junctions between single- and double-stranded regions of DNA formed after denaturation and cooling. To assess the capacity of CFLP for discriminating Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strains belonging to the electrophoretic type (ET) 5 (ET- 5) complex from other serogroup B strains, 30 serogroup B N. meningitidis isolates were subtyped by CFLP with internal fragments of five housekeeping genes, adk, aspC, carA, dhp, and glnA. Two genes (glnA and carA) which demonstrated a high degree of diversity for the serogroup B isolates were then used to further evaluate the suitability of CFLP for screening 50 serogroup C N. meningitidis outbreak-associated and sporadic-case isolates with a single metabolic gene. The results were compared to those from multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MEE), the current standard subtyping method. CFLP was able to distinguish the ET- 5 complex isolates from other serogroup B isolates as efficiently as MEE. Furthermore, CFLP analysis of a single gene was sufficient to identify and cluster the serogroup C isolates belonging to the ET- 37 complex from other, unrelated serogroup C isolates but was not capable of differentiating between the isolates of the major individual ETs of this complex (ET- 17 and ET- 24) causing most serogroup C meningococcal disease outbreaks in the United States. CFLP based on a single gene {{with a high degree of}} diversity but not under selective pressure can be applied to the rapid screening of a large number of isolates related to the recognized epidemic complex ET- 5 or ET- 37. Additionally, CFLP can be used as an initial screening tool to survey the amount of diversity in genes that might be used to develop a DNA sequence-based subtyping system...|$|E
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} adrenal steroid 21 -hydroxylase, CYP 21, {{is located}} in the MHC class III region. Most cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are caused by mutations in this gene, and most mutations appear to arise from gene conversion-like events involv-ing the transfer of deleterious sequences from the pseu-dogene, CYP 21 P, which is located within 30 kb of CYP 21. Approximately 20 – 30 % of mutations are caused by deletions of CYP 21. The second intron of CYP 21 is polymorphic, and several base substitutions that in-clude nt 395, nt 453, and nt 601 have been reported; how-ever, the frequencies of these polymorphisms are un-known. Using a combination of <b>cleavase</b> fragment length polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing, we examined the sequence of intron 2 in seven wild...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{targeting}} by {{homologous recombination}} (HR) can be induced by double-strand breaks (DSBs), however these breaks can be toxic and potentially mutagenic. We investigated the I-AniI homing endonuclease engineered to produce only nicks, {{and found that}} nicks induce HR with both plasmid and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector templates. The rates of nick-induced HR were lower than with DSBs (24 -fold lower for plasmid transfection and 4 - to 6 -fold lower for AAV vector infection), but they still represented a significant increase over background (240 - and 30 -fold, respectively). We observed severe toxicity with the I-AniI ‘cleavase’, but no evidence of toxicity with the I-AniI ‘nickase. ’ Additionally, the frequency of nickase-induced mutations at the I-AniI site was at least 150 -fold lower than that induced by the <b>cleavase.</b> These results, and the observation that the surrounding sequence context of a target site affects nick-induced HR but not DSB-induced HR, strongly argue that nicks induce HR through a different mechanism than DSBs, allowing for gene correction without the toxicity and mutagenic activity of DSBs...|$|E
40|$|A {{panel of}} Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV, genus Closterovirus, family Closteroviridae) isolates of different origins and with different biological properties were compared for polymorphisms {{in the major}} coat protein (CP) gene by <b>cleavase</b> fragment length polymorphism (CFLP) and single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. The similarity between the CFLP patterns, which consisted of 15 to 20 bands, was estimated by the Pearson coefficient. The clustering patterns from the CFLP data were {{very similar to those}} from sequence data in an experiment with 16 cloned standards of the CP gene. By SSCP analysis on the other hand, most of the clones were not clustered in the same way. To assess the ability of CFLP to analyse biological samples, which may consist of a mixture of genomic variants, the CP gene of 12 CTV isolates was obtained directly from infected plants by immunocapture/ RT-PCR and analysed. With few exceptions, the isolates were correctly clustered according to the sequences of the variants composing the isolates. In artificial mixed infections of mild and severe isolates the patterns obtained were more closely related to the severe isolate. Thus the CFLP method was an accurate method for the identification, typing and clustering of CTV isolates. The usefulness of this technique as an alternative to SSCP analysis is suggested and discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the Multiple-Dye <b>Cleavase</b> Fragment Length Polymorphism (MD-CFLP) method {{set up for}} a sensitive and preliminary rapid screening of BRCA 1 mutations. We analysed exons 11 and 16, which are known to cover slightly more than 70 % of the whole coding region of the gene, subdivided into 4 amplicons and labelled with different fluorescent dUTPs. MD-CFLP was first utilised on a panel of 30 DNA samples in which the presence of single-base substitutions or small deletions/insertions had been previously identified by direct sequencing as gold standard, in order to define the optimal conditions in terms of PCR amplification and temperature of digestion. In a second step, we blindly analysed 21 DNA samples by MD-CFLP to verify its reliability. The sensitivity and specificity of MD-CFLP were both 100 % in the first study, and 80 % and 94 %, respectively, in the blind sample assay. Our results demonstrate the capability of the MD-CFLP method to detect DNA sequence alterations in fragments of more than 1  kb. We conclude that CFLP is a powerful tool in mutational analysis, offering reliable results in a shorter time and {{at a lower cost}} than conventional methods, and its potential can be enhanced when internal fluorescent labelling and laser detection are used. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign[URL]...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{a recently}} described linear signal amplification method for {{sensitivity and specificity}} in detecting mutations associated with resistance to rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The assay utilizes the thermostable flap endonuclease <b>Cleavase</b> VIII, derived from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, which cleaves a structure formed by the hybridization of two overlapping oligonucleotide probes to a target nucleic acid strand. This method, termed the Invader assay, can discriminate single-base differences. Nine pairs of probes, encompassing five mutations in rpoB and katG {{that are associated with}} resistance to either RIF or INH, as well as the corresponding wild-type (drug-susceptible) alleles, were tested using amplified DNA. Fluorescent-labeled cleavage products, ranging from 4 to 13 nucleotides in length, depending on the genotype of the test sample, were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide (20 to 24 %) gel electrophoresis and then detected by scanning. All nine alleles could be identified and differentiated on the basis of product size. Multiple mutations at a specific rpoB nucleotide in target PCR products could be identified, as could mutants that were present at ≥ 0. 5 % of the total population of target sequences. The Invader assay is a sensitive screen for some mutations associated with antituberculosis drug resistance in amplified gene regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} multicenter {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the second-generation Invader technology for detecting the factor V (Leiden) mutation directly from genomic DNA of different sample types. Invader assay results were compared with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) or allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) analysis. The Invader assay is a PCR-independent methodology that uses a microtiter plate format. In the assay, a specific upstream Invader oligonucleotide and a downstream probe hybridize in tandem to a complementary DNA template and form a partially overlapping structure. The <b>Cleavase</b> VIII enzyme recognizes and cuts this structure to release the 5 ′ flap of the probe. This flap then serves as an Invader oligonucleotide to direct cleavage of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe in a second invasive cleavage reaction. Cleavage of this FRET probe results in the generation of a fluorescent signal. The results of the Invader assay were 99. 5 % concordant with the PCR-based methods. Of the 372 samples tested once, only two gave discordant results (one from operator error and one from unknown causes), but were concordant on retesting. These results indicate that a simple microtiter plate-based Invader assay can reliably genotype clinical patient samples for the factor V (Leiden) point mutation directly from genomic DNA without prior target amplification...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the application of}} a new DNA-scanning method, which has been termed <b>Cleavase</b> Fragment Length Polymorphism (CFLP; Third Wave Technologies, Inc., Madison, Wis.), for the determination of the genotype of hepatitis C virus (HCV). CFLP analysis results in the generation of structural fingerprints that allow discrimination of different DNA sequences. We analyzed 251 -bp cDNA products generated by reverse transcription-PCR of the well-conserved 5 '-noncoding region of HCV. We determined the genotypes of 87 samples by DNA sequencing and found isolates representing 98 % of the types typically encountered in the United States, i. e., types 1 a, 1 b, 2 a/c, 2 b, 3 a, and 4. Blinded CFLP analysis of these samples was 100 % concordant with DNA sequencing results, such that closely related genotypes yielded patterns with strong familial resemblance whereas more divergent sequences yielded patterns with pronounced dissimilarities. In each case, the aggregate pattern was indicative of genotypic grouping, while finer changes suggested subgenotypic differences. We also assessed the reproducibility of CFLP analysis in HCV genotyping by analyzing three distinct isolates belonging to a single subtype. These three isolates yielded indistinguishable CFLP patterns, as did replicate analysis of a single isolate. This study demonstrates the suitability of this technology for HCV genotyping and suggests that it may provide a low-cost, high-throughput alternative to DNA sequencing or other, more costly or cumbersome genotyping approaches...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze the feasibility and validity of using <b>Cleavase</b> Fragment Length Polymorphism (CFLP) analysis as an alternative to DNA sequencing for high-throughput screening of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes in a high-volume molecular pathology laboratory setting. By using a 244 -bp amplicon from the 5 ′ untranslated region of the HCV genome, 61 clinical samples received for HCV reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were genotyped by this method. The genotype frequencies assigned by the CFLP method were 44. 3 % for type 1 a, 26. 2 % for 1 b, 13. 1 % for type 2 b, and 5 % type 3 a. The results obtained by nucleotide sequence analysis provided 100 % concordance with those obtained by CFLP analysis at the major genotype level, with resolvable differences as to subtype designations for five samples. CFLP analysis-derived HCV genotype frequencies also concurred with the national estimates (N. N. Zein et al., Ann. Intern. Med. 125 : 634 – 639, 1996). Reanalysis of 42 of these samples in parallel in a different research laboratory reproduced the CFLP fingerprints for 100 % of the samples. Similarly, the major subtype designations for 19 samples subjected to different incubation temperature-time conditions were also 100 % reproducible. Comparative cost analysis for genotyping of HCV by line probe assay, CFLP analysis, and automated DNA sequencing indicated that the average cost per amplicon was lowest for CFLP analysis, at $ 20 (direct costs). On the basis of these findings we propose that CFLP analysis is a robust, sensitive, specific, and an economical method for large-scale screening of HCV-infected patients for alpha interferon-resistant HCV genotypes. The paper describes an algorithm that uses as a reflex test the RT-PCR-based qualitative screening of samples for HCV detection and also addresses genotypes that are ambiguous...|$|E
