40|$|The {{application}} of a higher-order subsonic potential flow panel method to the solution of three-dimensional flow about wing and wing-body combinations with leading-edge vortex separation is presented. The governing equations are the linear flow differential equation and nonlinear boundary conditions which require that the flow be parallel to the wing and body surfaces and that the free vortex sheet, springing from the leading and trailing edges, be aligned with the local flow and support no pressure jump. The vortex core is modeled as a simple line vortex which receives vorticity from the free sheet through a <b>connecting</b> <b>sheet.</b> The Kutta condition is imposed on all appropriate edges of the wing. This set of nonlinear equations is solved by an iterative procedure. The Goethert rule accounts for compressibility. The method has been programmed for the CDC 6600. Delta wings, gothic wings, arrow wings, cambered wings, and wing with body have been analyzed. Initial studies involving variations of panel density, vortex sheet sizing, Jacobian update, and initial geometry demonstrate that the present method generally exhibits good convergence characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} design {{provision in}} North American Specification for Cold- Formed Steel Structural Member (AISI S 100) for the bearing strength of bolted connections were developed from tests on bolted <b>connected</b> <b>sheets</b> which were restrained by bolt nut and head {{with or without}} washers. However, in the cold-formed assemblies, particularly in trusses, the single bolt goes through {{both sides of the}} connected sections, making the <b>connected</b> <b>sheets</b> on each side unrestrained. the warping of the unrestrained sheet may reduce the bearing strength of the bolted connection. This research investigates the behavior and strength of bearing failure in bolted connections in cold-formed steel trusses. Tensile tests were conducted on trusses connections with various material thicknesses. It was found that the AISI S 100 works well for thick connections but provides unconservative predictions for thin materials. Based on the experimental results, a modified bearing strength method is proposed for calculating the bearing strength of bolted truss connections. the proposed method can be used for any cold-formed steel connections with unrestrained sheet...|$|R

40|$|The early {{development}} of vertebrate embryos {{is characterized by}} massive, coordinated cell movements. These movements shape the embryo, distribute different cell types, shape complex tissues, and bring tissues into their correct spatial relationships. We have examined two early cell movements: the dorsal mesoderm of the frog embryo during gastrulation {{as a model for}} the coordinated movement of <b>connected</b> <b>sheets</b> of cells and the neural crest in the chicken embryo, as a model for cell migration. The dorsal mesoderm in the frog embryo moves as a sheet of cells, due to strong connections among the cells. Cell intercalation within this sheet drives the elongation of the embryo during the process of gastrulation, whereby the round, morphologically symmetric early embryo is converted into a tadpole. We have demonstrated the existence of propagating intercellular waves of calcium within the dorsal mesoderm during gastrulation. These waves appear to be specific to the dorsal mesoderm and directly required for the cell movements of gastrulation. To build an integrated picture of how different signaling pathways interact to control gastrulation, we have developed a novel means of quantitatively imaging whole embryos with subcellular resolution. We have used this digital atlas to carefully examine the major events of gastrulation in normal embryos and embryos overexpressing a mutant form of the Disheveled protein. The neural crest is a transient population of cells in the vertebrate embryo that arises in the neural tube and migrates to give rise to neurons, glia, bone and other cell types. During migration individual neural crest cells make extensive temporary connections with other cells, but migrate as individuals, rather than as a <b>connected</b> <b>sheet.</b> We have used patterned substrates and optical tweezers to present them with carefully controlled molecular stimuli.

40|$|Resistance welding {{ranks among}} {{progressive}} and in practice often used manufacturing techniques of rigid joints. It is applied in single‑part production, short‑run production {{as well as}} in mass production. The basis of this method is in the utilization of the Joulean heat, which arises at the passage of current through <b>connected</b> <b>sheets</b> at collective influence of compressive force. The aim of the carried out tests was the determination of the dependence between the rupture force of spot welds made using steel sheets of the same and different thickness for different welding conditions. For carrying out of this aim 360 assemblies were prepared. The sheets (a total of 720 pieces) of dimensions 100 × 25 mm and thickness of 0. 8 mm, 1. 5 mm and 3. 0 mm were made from low carbon steel. In the place determined for welding the test specimens were garnet blasted and then degreased with acetone. The welding of two specimens always of the same (0. 8 + 0. 8 mm, 1. 5 + 1. 5 mm a 3. 0 + 3. 0 mm) and different (0. 8 + 1. 5 mm, 0. 8 + 3. 0 mm a 1. 5 + 3. 0 mm) thickness was carried out using the welding machine type BV 2, 5. 21. At this type the welding current value is constant (Imax = 6. 4 kA). The welding time (the time of the passage of the current) was changed in the whole entirety, namely 0. 10 s, 0. 15 s, 0. 20 s, 0. 25 s, 0. 3 s, 0. 4 s, 0. 6 s, 0. 8 s, 1. 0 s, 1. 3 s, 1. 6 s and 2. 0 s. The compressive force was chosen according to the thickness of the <b>connected</b> <b>sheets</b> in the range from 0. 8 to 2. 4 kN. From the results of carried out tests it follows that using the working variables recommended by the producer we obtain the quality welds. But it we use the longer welding times, we can obtain stronger welds, namely up to 21 % compared to welds made using working variables recommended by the producer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—It {{is unknown}} which {{computational}} method the brain uses to perceive a visual scene. Given current advancements, {{it is now}} possible to model perceptual processes of the brain using spiking neural network models. We have developed a computational model for robust figure/ground separation. The model is based on a laterally <b>connected</b> <b>sheet</b> of spiking neurons. The sheet of neurons receives its visual input from a virtual retina. It is assumed to be located inside V 1 or a higher visual area. The neurons are assumed to be laterally connected to their nearest neighbors through gap-junctions. These lateral connections allow the neurons to exchange information and therefore allow for robust figure/ground separation. Even though we only show results for visual signals, the method is quite general and may be used in various areas of the brain. A result of the lateral coupling is that the neurons synchronize their firing behavior resulting in the so called gamma-synchrony which is also a result of our computational model.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the accuracy of}} design equations specified in the North American, European, and Australasian codes for cold-formed steel structures in determining the ultimate tilt-bearing capacity of single-shear bolted connections without washers in flat steel sheets. It points out that all the code equations do not properly distinguish the tilt-bearing failure mode from the conventional bearing failure mode. While the latter takes place downstream of the bolt, the former takes place upstream. Unlike the conventional bearing capacity, the tilt-bearing capacity {{is affected by the}} width of the <b>connected</b> <b>sheet</b> and does not vary linearly with either the sheet thickness or the bolt diameter. Furthermore, it is not affected by material ductility. Based on the test results of 156 specimens composed of G 2 and G 450 sheet steels having various dimensional configurations, this paper proposes a design equation that is dimensionally consistent and that is considerably more accurate than all the code equations. The proposed equation was also verified against single-shear single-row bolted connections tested by independent researchers which failed in the tilt-bearing mode. The verified thicknesses ranged from 0. 92 to 3. 0 mm, and the bolt diameters ranged from 6. 4 to 16 mm. An additional finding is that the tilt-bearing capacity is not significantly affected by the orientation of the bolt head or nut. A resistance factor of 0. 75 is recommended for use with the proposed equation for determining the tilt-bearing capacity of single shear single-row bolted connections in cold-reduced steel sheets...|$|R
