5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Roman god Consus was {{associated}} with horses: his underground altar was located in {{the valley of the}} Circus Maximus {{at the foot of the}} Palatine, the place of horse races. On the day of his summer festival (August 21), the Consualia aestiva, it was customary to bring horses and mules in procession crowned with flowers and then hold equine races in the Circus. It appears these games had a rustic and archaic character: they marked the end of the yearly agricultural cycle, when harvest was completed. According to tradition this occasion was chosen to enact the abduction of the Sabine (and Latin) women. The episode might bear a reflection of the traditional sexual licence of such occasions. [...] On that day the flamen Quirinalis and the vestal virgins sacrificed on the underground altar of Consus. The fact the two festivals of Consus were followed after an equal interval of four days by the two festivals of Ops (Opeconsivia on August 25 and Opalia on December 19) testifies to the strict relationship between the two deities as both pertaining to agricultural plenty, or in Dumezilian terminology to the third function. In Dumézil's view this fact shows the radically different symbolic value of the horse in the theology of Poseidon and of Consus. Tertullian (De Spectaculis V 7) states that according to Roman tradititon Consus was the god who had advised Romulus on the abduction of the Sabines because of his quality of god of hidden counsels and quotes an inscription that was on the southern meta of the circus corroborating his assertion: <b>Conso</b> consilio Marte duello Lares + covillo potentes: Consus is powerful in counsel, Mars in war, the Lares in meeting. A. Von Blumenthal and G. Radke have proposed to read consivio instead of consilio, though this correction is not generally accepted: the inscription is not extant and it was visible only on the days of the sacrifices to Consus, so some scholars argue it may have been misread.|$|E

Are Agricultural programmes well distributed in Uganda? Overview Overview ArƟ cle X 11 of the <b>ConsƟ</b> tuƟ on of the Republic of Uganda 1995 guarantees balanced and equitable development of the diff erent areas of Uganda and between rural and urban areas. Consequently, the fi rst objecƟ ve of the NaƟ onal Development Plan (2010 / 11 - 2014 / 15) is “Increasing household incomes and promoƟ ng equity”. Among the key indicators to measure this objecƟ ve is changes in agricultural producƟ on and producƟ vity arising from equitable uƟ lizaƟ on of naƟ onal resources and development projects. Using evidence from monitoring surveys by the Budget Monitoring and Accountability Unit (BMAU), this policy brief examines the manner of distribuƟ on of agricultural programmes in Uganda using 2 key proxy indicators: Geographical and poverty targeƟ ng of development projects in the agricultural sector.

40|$|Vowel nuclei of syllables {{appear to}} provide a {{relatively}} stable (although not stationary) frame of reference for judging consonant events. We offer evidence that reliable consonant identification demands prior or simultaneous evaluation of this "vocalic frame. " Listeners were presented a list of /bVs/, ldVsl. and lgVsl syllables and were instructed to press a response key immediately upon recognizing a particular initial consonant target. Three groups of subjects monitored for /bl, /d., and /gl, respectively. The test syllables contained 10 English vowels varying substantially in intrinsic duration. Response times to the initial consonants correlated positively with {{the duration of the}} following vowels. even when the effect of consonant-vowel formant transition duration was partialed out. The results suggest that consonant recognition is vowel dependent and. specifically. that a certain amount or proportion of the vowel formant trajectory must be evaluated before consonants can be reliably identified. r{; 1987 Academic Prt:�s. Inc A recurrent finding in speech research is that the perceptual interpretation of <b>conso</b> nant cues may depend critically on infor mation about the following vowel. To take an example from the early literature, Li berman, Delattre, and Cooper (1952) re ported that a brief filtered noise burst (cen tered at about 1440 Hz) was typically per ceived as /p / in front of a steady state Iii or lui, but as /k / in front of a steady state /a/. More recently, Mann and Repp (1980) found an effect of the following vowel on the identification of a noise segment that was perceptually intermediate between /s/ and /fl. The segment was more likely to be labeled /s / before lui than before /a/. These perceptual effects may be ex plained in terms of the listener's implicit knowledge of the normal acoustic conse...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to investigate the content, role, and effects of ancient Roman grave-inscriptions; I argue that Roman gravestones and their inscriptions were intended to serve as metonymic markers, stand-ins for their deceased subjects {{in the land of}} the living, allowing the dead to engage with the living and the living with the dead. As many previous studies of Roman grave-inscriptions have been undermined by the fact that their authors attempt to address the entire body of Roman epitaphs (a corpus too large and diverse to allow productive study of its entirety), this dissertation focuses on a smaller corpus, the forty-nine extant verse-inscriptions generally assigned to the Roman Republic. In investigating these epitaphs, I focus on the effects of the reading-act and the related issues of voice, audience, and space; my approach is informed by the works of Svenbro (1993) and Vallette-Cagnac (1997) on the readingact in ancient Greece and Rome respectively, Sourvinou-Inwood's (1995) study of voice in ancient Greek epitaphs, and Lowrie's (2006) work on deixis and its effects on the reader's perception of presence and absence. I argue that the reading-act of the passer-by activates a depiction of the deceased's life, tied to the stone as the metonymic marker of the deceased; it is through this depiction that the figure of the deceased can engage, implicitly and explicitly, with the living upon each reading of the inscription. Even among the most basic poems, devoid of any acknowledgement of a living audience, we find epitaphs that seek to connect through various devices to the real time and space of the living reader; other examples engage in what <b>Conso</b> (1994) terms "oralité fictive," allowing the epitaph to speak directly to that reader. And finally, we find examples in which the deceased's attempt to engage with the living is explicit: the deceased speaks, co-opting the voice of the reader to present his own portrait, in some cases without addressing a specific audience, but in other cases addressing the passer-by, or loved ones left behind. This study not only offers a detailed look at the content and artistry of these fascinating (and in many cases neglected) poems, but also illuminates the ways in which ancient Romans dealt with life and death. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|E
