500|$|The {{first modern}} highway {{along the path}} {{of what is now}} I-97 {{followed}} the corridor from New Cut Road to south of the intersection of MD 178 and Veterans Highway at Dorrs Corner. This highway was intended as a second route from Glen Burnie to Annapolis to complement the highway along {{the east side of the}} Severn River; this western route later became known as General's Highway, a name still applied to its MD 178 portion. Construction of this highway was underway by 1919. The new highway was completed as a gravel road from New Cut Road to north of Benfield and as a concrete road through Benfield and across Severn Run to near Dorrs Corner by 1921. In 1922, this highway was designated part of Robert Crain Highway, a new highway to connect the Baltimore area with Southern Maryland. The Glen Burnie–Dorrs <b>Corner</b> <b>portion</b> of the new highway was reconstructed and completed as a concrete road from Glen Burnie south through Millersville by 1923. Robert Crain Highway became part of MD 3 in 1927 and then US 301 in 1939 when the U.S. Highway was extended from Virginia to Baltimore. MD 3 was reconstructed in 1933 and 1934. The reconstruction eliminated several dangerous curves, particularly near Severn Run, and expanded the highway from a width of [...] Veterans Highway follows much of that early 1930s course.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide an efficient and accurate finite element model to understand the behavior of cold-formed steel plain angle columns. The effects of initial local and overall geometric imperfections have been taken into consideration in the analysis. The material nonlinearities of flat and <b>corner</b> <b>portions</b> of the angle sections were incorporated in the model. Failure loads and buckling modes as well as load-shortening curves of plain angle columns were investigated in this study. Furthermore, the residual stresses of a column test specimen were measured and plotted. The effect of residual stresses on the buckling behavior was studied using the finite element model. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against experimental results. The finite element analysis was performed on plain angles compressed between fixed ends over different column lengths, and column curves were obtained. An extensive parametric study was carried out using the finite element model to study the effects of cross-section geometries on the strength and behavior of angle columns. The column strengths predicted from the finite element model were compared with the design strengths calculated using the American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. In addition, the results obtained from the finite element model were also compared with the design strengths obtained from the design rules proposed by other researchers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} column tests on cold-formed steel I-shaped open {{sections}} with edge and web stiffeners has been conducted. The test specimens were firstly brake-pressed from high strength zinc-coated steel sheets {{and then two}} of the same members were connected back-to-back by self-tapping screws to form an I-shaped section with edge and web stiffeners. The members had the nominal thicknesses of 0. 48, 1. 0 and 1. 2 mm. The column length of the test specimens varied from 300 to 3200 mm with an increment of approximately 600 mm. The column specimens were compressed between fixed ends. Tensile coupon tests were also conducted to obtain the material properties at both flat and <b>corner</b> <b>portions</b> of the sections. Initial local and overall geometric imperfections were measured. The columns were failed by local, distortional, flexural buckling and the interaction of these buckling modes. The failure modes and ultimate strengths of the column specimens were presented. The direct strength method in the North American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard was {{used to calculate the}} design strengths of the I-shaped open section columns. The appropriateness of the direct strength method for I-shaped open sections with edge and web stiffeners was evaluated. In addition, the reliability of the direct strength method for the I-shaped open sections was evaluated using reliability analysis. It is shown that the direct strength method can be used for cold-formed steel I-shaped open sections with edge and web stiffeners. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an accurate {{finite element model}} for the structural performance of cold-formed high strength stainless steel columns. The finite element analysis was conducted on duplex stainless steel columns having square and rectangular hollow sections. The columns were compressed between fixed ends at different column lengths. The effects of initial local and overall geometric imperfections have been taken into consideration in the finite element model. The material nonlinearity of the flat and <b>corner</b> <b>portions</b> of the high strength stainless steel sections were carefully incorporated in the model. The column strengths and failure modes {{as well as the}} load-shortening curves of the columns were obtained using the finite element model. Furthermore, the effect of residual stresses in the columns was studied. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against experimental results. An extensive parametric study was carried out using the verified finite element model to study the effects of cross-section geometries on the strength and behaviour of cold-formed high strength stainless steel columns. The column strengths predicted from the parametric study were compared with the design strengths calculated using the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Code for cold-formed stainless steel structures. The results of the parametric study showed that the design rules specified in the American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications are generally conservative for cold-formed high strength stainless steel square and rectangular hollow section columns, but unconservative for some of the short columns. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of residual stresses on the buckling behavior was investigated. The material nonlinearities of flat and <b>corner</b> <b>portions</b> of the angle sections were considered in the analysis. The finite element analysis was performed on equally lipped angles compressed between fixed ends for different column lengths, and column curves were obtained. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against recent experimental results. An extensive parametric study was carried out using the finite element model to study the effects of cross section geometries on the strength and behavior of lipped angle columns. The column strengths predicted by the finite element model were compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. In addition, the results obtained from the finite element model were also compared with the design strengths obtained from proposed design rules.

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{investigations of}} cold-formed stainless steel square and rectangular hollow sections subjected to concentrated bearing load {{are presented in}} this paper. A total of 124 data are presented that include 64 test results and 60 numerical results. The tests were performed on austenitic stainless steel type 304, high strength austenitic and duplex material. The measured web slenderness value of the tubular sections ranged from comparatively stocky webs of 6. 2 to relatively more slender webs of 61. 4. The tests were carried out under end and interior loading conditions. A non-linear finite element model is developed and verified against experimental results. Geometric and material non-linearities {{were included in the}} finite element model. The material nonlinearity of the flat and <b>corner</b> <b>portions</b> of the specimen sections were carefully incorporated in the model. It was shown that the finite element model closely predicted the web crippling strengths and failure modes of the tested specimens. Hence, the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries, and the web slenderness value ranged from 52. 0 to 206. 7. The test results and the web crippling strengths predicted from the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths obtained using the American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for stainless steel structures. A unified web crippling equation with new coefficients for cold-formed stainless steel square and rectangular hollow sections subjected to concentrated bearing load is proposed. It is demonstrated that the proposed web crippling equation is safe and reliable using reliability analysis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
