5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is no <b>change</b> <b>if</b> the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E
5|$|Peter, Brian, Cleveland and Joe are annoyed when Quagmire {{adopts a}} stray cat named James and prefers {{to spend more}} time with him than with them. When Quagmire goes to Vermont to buy him a {{birthday}} present, they decide to shave James as a prank, but it backfires when Peter accidentally kills him. He and Brian decide to hide his body, but are pulled over by the police who, after ignoring Peter's blood stains and beer, arrest Brian when they find him in possession of cannabis. He is bailed out by the family and put on probation for drug use. He attempts to use Stewie's urine when Joe arrives to perform a drug test, only to be caught by Lois, who chastises him for going to such lengths and tells him that he has to <b>change</b> <b>if</b> he intends on doing so. However, Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog. He and Stewie perform an enthusiastic musical number, and soon after the entire town rallies behind them in their cause.|$|E

25|$|Humans {{have had}} a {{dramatic}} effect on the environment. Humans are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.

25|$|Hydrolysis {{breaks the}} glycosidic bond {{converting}} sucrose into glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis is, however, so slow that solutions of sucrose can sit {{for years with}} negligible <b>change.</b> <b>If</b> the enzyme sucrase is added, however, the reaction will proceed rapidly. Hydrolysis can also be accelerated with acids, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, both weak acids. Likewise, gastric acidity converts sucrose to glucose and fructose during digestion, the bond between them being an acetal bond {{which can be broken}} by an acid.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this straightforward mass-action effect, the rate coefficients themselves can change due to pressure. The rate coefficients and products of many high-temperature gas-phase reactions <b>change</b> <b>if</b> an inert gas {{is added to the}} mixture; variations on this effect are called fall-off and chemical activation. These phenomena are due to exothermic or endothermic reactions occurring faster than heat transfer, causing the reacting molecules to have non-thermal energy distributions (non-Boltzmann distribution). Increasing the pressure increases the heat transfer rate between the reacting molecules {{and the rest of the}} system, reducing this effect.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{a member}} {{of any of these}} subgroups moves to a {{different}} region, they will still be known by the name of their ancestral region. For example, if a Gurian moves to Tbilisi (part of the Kartli region) he will not automatically identify himself as Kartlian despite actually living in Kartli. This may, however, <b>change</b> <b>if</b> substantial amount of time passes. For example, there are some Mingrelians who have lived in the Imereti region for centuries and are now identified as Imeretian or Imeretian-Mingrelians.|$|E

25|$|Diệm {{rejected}} these moderate policies, {{believing that}} a militantly anti-Communist stance was the solution for South Vietnam. This {{coincided with a}} fact finding mission by Democratic Party U.S. Senator Mike Mansfield, a Roman Catholic and strong Diệm supporter, who advocated a suspension of U.S. aid if Diệm were removed. L'Express, the newspaper in Paris which printed his ideas, {{was considered to be}} friendly with French Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France. As a result, the US State Department interpreted it as a French manoevre to replace Diệm with Hội. Strongly disapproving of Hội's foreign policies, the State Department warned Mendes-France that U.S. policy would <b>change</b> <b>if</b> Hội became Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|In most of Canada, either partner may informally {{assume the}} spouse's surname after marriage, {{so long as}} it is not for the {{purposes}} of fraud. The same is true for people in common-law relationships, in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia. For federal purposes, such as a Canadian passport, Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship. In the province of British Columbia, people have to undergo a legal name <b>change</b> <b>if</b> they want to use a combined surname after marriage. Their marriage certificate is considered proof of their new name.|$|E

The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to <b>change</b> <b>if</b> he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus' letter framed in his home.|$|E
