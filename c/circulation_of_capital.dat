Volume II of Capital was prepared and published by Engels in July 1893 under the name Capital II: The Process of <b>Circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capital.</b> Volume III of Capital was published a year later in October 1894 under the name Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole. Theories of Surplus Value was developed from the Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863 which comprise Volumes 30, 31 32 and 33 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels and from the Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1864 which comprises Volume 34 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels. The exact part of the Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863 which makes up the Theories of Surplus Value are the last part of Volume 30 of the Collected Works, the whole of Volume 31 of the Collected Works and the whole of Volume 32 of the Collected Works. A German language abridged edition of Theories of Surplus Value was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London, but the complete unabridged edition of Theories of Surplus Value was published as the [...] "fourth volume" [...] of Capital in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.|$|E

The framework of restructuring of banks during capitalist capital accumulation process has been explicated after expressing the relation between money capital and real capital. Consequently, in the last section, Turkish banking system in the period after 1980 has been analysed. Afterwards the number and the distribution of banks are studied with the purpose of explaining the transformation in this sector. Additionally the development of concentration trends during the same period are examined by means of general concentration rate and the effects of the crisis are put forward in this way...|$|R

It suggests that the transnational way of life of migrants is leading {{to the creation of a}} European space conceived in terms of a new kind of socio-cultural configuration. The paper draws on the concept <b>of</b> <b>capitals</b> (economic, social and cultural) derived from the work of Pierre Bourdieu. In particular, it uses these concepts to reflect on the gains and losses in <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> Polish migrants in Scotland and in their home country.

40|$|As we all know, the {{theories}} of economic location both in their classic shape and the more recent updatings mainly investigate the distribution of production and exchange in their physical dimension. Although the central place theory deals with the location of services, often immaterial, the {{attention is focused on}} the structures. The key concept remains the economic distance, linked to the transfer of goods. This approach cannot explain a world geography where the friction of space is continuously shrinking while the international distribution of activities is commanded by the management of financial assets. The paper tries to point out some basic concepts, the objects characterizing this kind of space, and the flows connecting them.

50|$|Activists {{argue that}} {{corporate}} globalization {{corresponds to a}} displacement in {{the transition from a}} highly industrial-based economy to one where trade development is connected with the financial deregulation on the basis of <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> An increasing number of diverse societies have been changed to free-market structure, leading to displacement. As this expansion has occurred, market-governed regulation has outrun the grasps of the state. Opponents of corporate globalization hold that the government needs greater power to control the markets, that income inequality is increasing, and that corporations have gained too much power. As part of the political left, activists against corporate power and influence support a decreased income gap and improved economical equity.|$|E
5000|$|In {{assessing}} {{the effect of}} these [...] "omissions", one ought {{to keep in mind that}} when Marx discussed the intertwining of the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> with the reproduction processes that occur in any kind of society, he was primarily concerned with the functional requirements of the capitalist mode of production and not with the reproduction of the whole of society. At any time, a fraction of the population is not working or [...] "economically active" [...] (children, students, the sick and disabled, the unemployed, volunteer workers, housewives, pensioners, idlers, etc.), and assets are maintained or accumulated that are unrelated to the sphere of production. These were generally outside the scope of Marx's analysis, even if he occasionally mentioned them.|$|E
5000|$|In Capital, Volume III, Marx {{considers}} {{the operation of}} capitalist production as the unity of a production process and a circulation process involving commodities, money, and capital. Capitalist production cannot exist without market sales, and therefore it {{is a type of}} production that fully depends on market trade. For the purpose of the analysis of the immediate process of capitalist production, which is the main subject of Capital, Volume I, successful market transactions are assumed and market fluctuations are initially mostly disregarded - but that gives only one half of the story. The products have to be sold at a profit, and purchased at a competitive price, through market trade and the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|E
40|$|The author {{reflects}} {{about the}} overthrow, {{occurred in the}} last two decays, of the legal principles ruling international exchanges. The liberalization of exchanges has become as such a value, contrary to the principles of social justice included in the Philadelphia Declaration of 1944. Economic competition has become the ultimate purpose of each legal order, according to the dogma of the expansion as an absolute value achievable only by a globalized competition. This normative schizophrenia, which separates economic and social dimension of the process of globalization, could be surmounted only restoring social justice as founding principle of international trade. In this perspective, liberalization is only one possible instrument to attain the aim of social justice. In order to abridge the difference between the rights of companies, which can be exerted at international level, and the rights of workers, which remain confined at domestic scope, the author proposes to create an "international social citizenship" as a corollary <b>of</b> free <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capitals</b> and goods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an unsettling example of {{experimental}} labour – the Human Landing Catch (HLC). The HLC is a cheap and reliable technique to produce data on mosquito densities in a defined area. It requires only a human volunteer to sit over night {{with his legs}} exposed, a headlamp to spot mosquitoes, and a rubber tube and plastic cup to catch them as they come to feed on him. The HLC formed the central methodological and operational strategy for a malaria control {{that took place in}} Dar es Salaam, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This paper analyses the epistemic and economic value of this experimental scenario by examining in detail the work it entails. In conceptualizing the different species of productivity associated with the HLC, of particular interest is the surprising fact that he is there. This paper argues that the interplay of mobility and immobility offers a way to rethink the value of research within interlocking <b>circulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> science, mosquitoes and men...|$|R

5000|$|Bernard Mandeville, (15 November 1670 - 21 January 1733), was an Anglo-Dutch philosopher, {{political}} {{economist and}} satirist.

The higher life of man is a mere fiction introduced by philosophers and rulers to simplify government and the relations of society. In fact, virtue (which he defined as [...] "every performance by which man, contrary to the impulse of nature, should endeavour the benefit of others, or the conquest of his own passions, out of a rational ambition of being good") is actually detrimental to the state in its commercial and intellectual progress.

50|$|Capital, Volume II, subtitled The Process of <b>Circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Capital,</b> was {{prepared}} by Friedrich Engels from notes left by Karl Marx {{and published in}} 1885. It {{is divided into three}} parts: The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits, The Turnover of Capital, and The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital. In Volume II, the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found: how value and surplus-value are realized. Its dramatis personae are not so much the worker and the industrialist (as in Volume I), but rather the money owner (and money lender), the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or 'functioning capitalist.' Moreover, workers appear in Volume II, essentially as buyers of consumer goods and, therefore, as sellers of the commodity labour power, rather than producers of value and surplus-value — though this latter quality, established in Volume I, remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based.|$|E
40|$|Discussion of {{the horror}} film fanzine culture of the 1980 s and early 1990 s has been {{dominated}} by an emphasis on questions around the politics of taste, considerations <b>of</b> subcultural <b>capital</b> and cultism in fan writing, and processes of cultural distinction and the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> Sconce’s concept <b>of</b> ‘paracinema’ has come to shape the conceptual approach to fanzines.

5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{continuous}} innovation ... is to devalue, if not destroy, past investments and labour skills. Creative destruction is embedded within the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> itself. Innovation exacerbates instability, insecurity, {{and in the}} end, becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis. ... The struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore {{all kinds of other}} possibilities. New product lines are opened up, and that means the creation of new wants and needs. Capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others .... The result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability, as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another, leaving whole sectors devastated .... The drive to relocate to more advantageous places (the geographical movement of both capital and labour) periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour, adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity. The resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension, as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to [...] "the twinkling of an eye".|$|E
50|$|In this case, {{models of}} {{economic}} reproduction {{are not a}} useful guide to understanding economic crises because, it is argued, Marx only intended them to show how {{it was possible for}} the whole economic reproduction process to be accomplished {{on the basis of the}} <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> by stating the minimum requirements (not the equilibrium conditions) for it. If certain quantitative assumptions are made about the growth rates of different sectors and about capital compositions, it can be proved that certain disproportions must necessarily develop. But in reality, the economic reproduction process could be interrupted or break down for all kinds of reasons (including non-economic causes, such as wars or disasters). And if disproportions occur, the economic system can also adjust to them, within certain limits. If vastly more capital assets are created than are invested in production, one cannot explain economic crises simply in terms of disproportionalities in the sphere of production; one has to look at the process of capital accumulation as a whole, which includes the financial system, non-productive assets, and real estate. This becomes particularly important when large debt crises occur. These debt crises signal that serious misallocations of capital have occurred, which impact negatively on economic reproduction.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of these}} effects also act as causative factors. This induces {{progressively}} greater stratification unless action {{is taken to}} limit a runaway condition. Corruption of the feedback mechanism {{is the most dangerous}} threat to any balanced system, since it can lead to economic oscillations of increasing magnitude until runaway inflation or depression results. A historical example of runaway stratification is the Great Depression of the late 1920s and 1930s. As monopolies gained increasing power and influence, the working class gradually lost purchasing power until other factors, such as the bank failures, coincided to produce an economic collapse. Such collapses can occur because the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> (M1) in such systems becomes highly dependent upon continually increasing apparent quantities of M2. A percentage of M2 is continually being converted into M1 until a point is reached in which the rate of conversion of M2 into M1 cannot be sustained by the available quantity of M1. In the case of the Great Depression, M2 refers to stocks and bank notes. When it became apparent that the valuation of M2 exceeded the supply of M1, a panic ensued to convert M2 to M1, resulting in the rapid apparent devaluation of M2, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929. In the case where M1 is increased to support the increasing conversion of M2 into M1, inflation increases until the physical supply of M1 becomes unwieldy and the result is also economic collapse, {{as was the case in}} Germany during the same period.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} emergence of Phnom Penh as a city of speculation. It focuses, in particular, on the formation of speculative markets in real estate {{and the politics of}} urban renewal financed over the last decade in large part by Asian developers. Positioned as the next "Asian" city in a region of booming metropolises, the city's promise lies in its economic and spatial future. As such, this dissertation pays close attention to the city's integration into inter-Asian <b>circulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and imaginaries <b>of</b> urban modernity. Speculation organizes all economies functioning as the linchpin between risk and reward. But in a city without a master plan or without the formal valuation of property, speculation in Phnom Penh functions in various formats. It is a logic based on the overregulation of law. It is a platform in the production of space with property - its commodification and exchange - central to creating value. It is a form of governance structured as networks of relations between Asian investors, state officials, and Cambodian power brokers who negotiate opportunities and access to the economy. It is based on social ties that shape markets and mitigate risk through intimate and unofficial knowledge of the economy. It is the politics of anticipation in which claims to the future must be staked in the present. In a context where the city's real estate is among the most expensive in Southeast Asia, this dissertation is designed to help illuminate the productive life of speculation not only as the urbanization <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> but as an inter-Asian capitalization of growth...|$|R

The fact that Arriaga has crossed the lines between writing, adapting, and directing his own works in Spanish and English leads me to review the current relations of film and literature in general. Finally, by comparing Arriaga’s novels and films, I propose that the contemporary practice of film adaptation contributes to the “flexibilization” in the roles writers, actors, and directors play in filmmaking and in the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>capital</b> between film and literature in the current media markets...|$|R
