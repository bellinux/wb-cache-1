5|$|Early on, {{the economy}} {{depended}} greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city {{was the largest}} in Mississippi around {{the start of the}} 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out daily. The city's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.|$|E
5|$|Marcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) {{were some}} of the {{recognized}} musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|E
5|$|The airport {{has three}} {{scheduled}} flights to the Vancouver International Airport every day, with one fewer on Sunday, provided by Air Canada Express. There {{is also a}} daily flight to the Calgary International Airport provided by WestJet Encore. The airport typically also has a few flights a week leaving Calgary at 8:45 PM and arriving in Penticton {{later on in the}} night, the plane then stays at the Penticton Airport and leaves for Calgary at 7:00 AM and arrives in Calgary around 9:00 AM. However, these flights were cancelled due to runway safety issues (See Airlines and destinations, below). Kelowna International Airport has affected traffic at the Penticton Regional Airport, with the former providing more direct flight and connection options for travellers. Penticton Regional Airport also recently underwent an expansion to add more seating area in the main terminal building as an addition to the extra WestJet Encore flights on certain days <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of Penticton.|$|E

He then added that similar to Chute Boxe, Hammer House is also like a family, and thanked Baroni for <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> watching his back. An outraged Chute Boxe refused to accept Coleman's backstage apology. The Chute Boxe team was assigned a yellow card for instigating this infraction.|$|E

25|$|French {{reinforcements}} {{continued to}} arrive through to 20 April, and {{the capture of}} an outer Spanish fort guarding the road through to the Puerto Real helped to facilitate the arrival of these forces.

25|$|Oyo {{became the}} {{southern}} emporium of the Trans-Saharan trade. Exchanges {{were made in}} salt, leather, horses, kola nuts, ivory, cloth and slaves. The Yoruba of metropolitan Oyo were also highly skilled in craft making and iron work. Aside from taxes on trade products <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the empire, Oyo also became wealthy off the taxes imposed on its tributaries. Taxes on the kingdom of Dahomey alone brought in an amount estimated at 638 thousand dollars a year.|$|E
25|$|While Chatelain and Jenks {{collected}} survivors, an eight-man {{party from}} Pillsbury led by Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Albert David came alongside U-505 {{in a boat}} and entered through the conning tower. The body of Oberfunkmaat (Signalman First Class) Gottfried Fischer, the only fatality of the action, {{was found on the}} deck. U-505 was otherwise deserted. The boarding party secured charts and codebooks, closed scuttling valves, and disarmed demolition charges. They stopped the water <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> although low in the water and down by the stern, U-505 remained afloat. They also stopped her engines.|$|E

25|$|Marsh {{was also}} {{drawn to the}} ports of New York. In the 1930s the harbors were {{extremely}} busy with people and commerce due to the country's necessity for economic recovery. The Great Depression brought about a decline in raw materials and therefore the demand for those materials grew dramatically, resulting in bustling harbors in big cities such as New York. Marsh would sketch the seaports, focusing on the tugboats <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the harbor, and capturing {{the details of the}} boats such as the masts, the bells, the sirens, and the deck chairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} grew organically {{starting in}} 1990 {{with the first}} cassette tape. Connections were made when women in colleges started duplicating and sharing tapes. Offers to play at colleges started <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> her popularity grew largely {{by word of mouth}} and through women's groups or organizations. Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women's music, started carrying DiFranco's music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women's book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with Koch International for DiFranco's release of Not a Pretty Girl. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.|$|E

The video then continues on with each member interacting with their animated counterparts and the animations <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the green screens around them. Maruyama has super human strength, Yasuda can fly, Shibutani is an ace marksman, Yokoyama is a peeping tom with X-Ray vision, Nishikido is a skateboarder, Murakami {{has the ability to}} control weather, and Ohkura can control fire. Whenever they walk behind a green screen, their animated form is shown. Occasionally, their outfits flicker in color, alluding to the possibility that they're animated characters in the real world.|$|E

25|$|On 4 January 1804 Raven sailed from Malta as escort to the {{merchant}} ship Dolphin, bound for Naples. She was following a course {{along the south}} coast of Sicily that would take her between the islands of Favignana and Marettimo. In {{the evening of the}} next day master's mate Robert Incledon had the watch and saw a light shape in the moonless night. He thought it was a sail {{but it turned out to}} be a tower on the cliffs near Mazari, on the south west coast of Sicily. At 11pm she ran aground. Despite efforts to lighten and free her, efforts that extended into the afternoon of 6 January, the pumps were unable to clear the water that was <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> she had to be abandoned. Dolphin rescued her crew. The court martial on 10 February 1805 admonished the master for having steered too near the land.|$|E

500|$|Canvaswork, {{in which}} thread is {{stitched}} through a foundation fabric, and surface embroidery, {{in which the}} majority of the thread sits on top of the fabric, exist side-by-side in the English tradition, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of fashion over the years. [...] In the 19th century, the craze for Berlin wool work, a canvaswork style using brightly coloured wool, contrasts with art needlework, associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, which attempted to resurrect the artistic and expressive styles of medieval surface embroidery {{under the influence of the}} Gothic Revival and the Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E

500|$|The ingots {{are then}} heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs, billets, or blooms. Slabs are {{hot or cold}} rolled into sheet metal or plates. Billets are hot or cold rolled into bars, rods, and wire. [...] Blooms are hot or cold rolled into {{structural}} steel, such as I-beams and rails. [...] In modern steel mills these processes often occur in one assembly line, with ore <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> finished steel products coming out. Sometimes after a steel's final rolling it is heat treated for strength, however this is relatively rare.|$|E
500|$|Later that day, Solanas {{arrived at}} the Factory and waited outside. Morrissey arrived and {{asked her what she}} was doing there, and she replied [...] "I'm waiting for Andy to get money".

Morrissey told her again that Warhol was not <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> that she had to leave. She left but rode the {{elevator}} up and down until Warhol finally boarded it.|$|E

Budington ordered cargo to be thrown onto the ice to buoy the ship. Men began throwing goods overboard, as Tyson put it, [...] "with no care taken as to how or where these things were thrown".
