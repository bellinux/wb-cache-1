It includes low carbon power generation sources such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and, including fuel preparation and decommissioning, nuclear power. The term largely excludes <b>conventional</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> plant sources, and is only used to describe a particular subset of operating <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> power systems, specifically, those that are successfully coupled with a flue gas {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) system.|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} {{of renewable energy}} has experienced significant growth recently due to the foreseeable exhaustion of <b>conventional</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> power generation methods and increasing realization of the adverse effects that <b>conventional</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> power generation has on the environment. Among the renewable energy sources, wind power generation is rapidly becoming competitive with <b>conventional</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> sources. The wind turbines in the market {{have a variety of}} innovative concepts, with proven technology for both generators and power electronics interfaces. Recently, variable-speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion systems (WECS) is becoming more attractive in comparison to the fixed-speed WECS. In the variable-speed generation system, the wind turbine can be operated at maximum power operating points over a wide speed range by adjusting the shaft speed optimally. This thesis presents both wind and rotor speed sensorless control for the direct-drive interior permanent magnet synchronous generator (IPMSG) with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. The proposed method, without requiring the knowledge of wind speed, ai...|$|R

25|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP), {{also known as}} cogeneration, {{is the use of}} a thermal power station to provide both {{electric}} power and heat (the latter being used, for example, for district heating purposes). This technology is practiced not only for domestic heating (low temperature) but also for industrial process heat, which is often high temperature heat.

25|$|Climate change {{concerns}} {{and the need}} to reduce carbon emissions are driving increasing growth in the renewable energy industries. Low-carbon renewable energy replaces <b>conventional</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> in three main areas: power generation, hot water/ space heating, and transport fuels. In 2011, the share of renewables in electricity generation worldwide grew for the fourth year in a row to 20.2%. Based on REN21's 2014 report, renewables contributed 19% to supply global energy consumption. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from burning biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% as electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass thermal power plants.|$|E

25|$|A {{cement plant}} consumes 3 to 6 GJ of fuel per tonne of clinker produced, {{depending}} on the raw materials and the process used. Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels, {{and to a lesser}} extent natural gas and fuel oil. Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln (referred to as co-processing), replacing a portion of <b>conventional</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium, silica, alumina, and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln, replacing raw materials such as clay, shale, and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value, the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example, sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value, and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix.|$|E
