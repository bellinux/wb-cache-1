25|$|This {{concept was}} further fleshed out with more {{specific}} and stringent conditions in 1972 when Kupfermann and Weiss published The Command Neuron Concept.

The concept of command neuron-mediated behaviors was both ground breaking and controversial, since determining command neuron-mediated behaviors was a problematic process due to difficulties in understanding and interpreting anatomical and behavioral data.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{projects}} {{to create new}} variants {{were based on the}} original Schneider CA design. On 27 September 1916 Estienne wrote a memorandum to the General Headquarters outlining his thoughts about a possible command tank. Considering that tank units would not only attack static enemy positions but also had to manoeuvre on the battlefield against moving hostile troops, he foresaw that their commanders would need more agile vehicles with armament and armour concentrated in the front, to lead a pursuit or cover a retreat. [...] Therefore, a variant was needed fitted with a turret featuring a 37mm gun and one or two machine-guns in the front instead of the sides, protected by 15mm front armour, with a crew of four and with a top speed of at least 10km/h. Fifty such vehicles should be constructed. [...] On 2 October, Joffre demanded the production of fifty voitures cuirassées de commandement. On 13 October Schneider had a paper design ready; on 17 October the order was confirmed by Mourret. Towards the end of 1916 a [...] "mock-up" [...] was ready under the designation of Schneider CA2. On 26 and 27 March 1917 a prototype made of boiler-plate, perhaps identical to the [...] "mock-up", was tested at Marly. It had the standard suspension of the Schneider CA but its hull was strongly shortened so that the overhanging nose had disappeared. The 75mm cannon had been replaced by a cylindrical turret, intended to be armed with a 47mm gun and a machine-gun, close {{to the rear of the}} hull. The hull was further diminished in size and weight by a considerable narrowing, and closing of the roofed skylight slit, which lowered its height. As a result, the type weighed only eight tonnes. [...] During the testing the vehicle, though no longer getting itself stuck on an overhanging nose, still proved unable to climb out of muddy shell craters. [...] It was concluded that the suspension should be lengthened by the equivalence of three track links, about forty centimetres, and on 13 April 1917 a quick commencement of production was envisaged. In reality Estienne had already on 22 March decided to discontinue this project in favour of a Renault FT <b>command</b> (<b>signal)</b> version. The CA2 prototype was subsequently used as a training and test bed vehicle and the immediate need for command vehicles was met by fitting two standard Schneider CAs with radio sets. On 29 December 1916 it was proposed to develop from the Schneider CA2 two light tank prototypes.|$|E

50|$|An {{electric}} <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> (flow rate set point) {{is applied}} to the integrated position controller which drives the pilot stage. The thereby deflected nozzle flapper system produces a pressure difference across the drive areas of the spool and affects its movement. The position transducer (LVDT) which is excited via an oscillator measures the position of the spool (actual value, position voltage). This signal is then demodulated and fed back to the controller where it is compared with the <b>command</b> <b>signal.</b> The controller drives the pilot stage until the error between <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> and feedback signal will be zero. Thus the position of the spool is proportional to the electric <b>command</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E

A sensor attached to the servo motor reports the motor's actual status back to the servo drive. The servo drive then compares the actual motor status with the commanded motor status. It then alters the voltage frequency or pulse width to the motor so as to correct for any deviation from the commanded status.|$|E

50|$|Input Shaping is an {{open-loop}} control technique for reducing vibrations in computer-controlled machines. The method works {{by creating a}} <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> that cancels its own vibration. That is, vibration caused by {{the first part of}} the <b>command</b> <b>signal</b> is cancelled by vibration caused by the second part of the command. Input shaping is implemented by convolving a sequence of impulses, an input shaper, with any desired command. The shaped command that results from the convolution is then used to drive the system. If the impulses in the shaper are chosen correctly, then the system will respond without vibration to any unshaped command. The amplitudes and time locations of the impulses are obtained from the system's natural frequencies and damping ratios. Shaping can be made very robust to errors in the system parameters.|$|E
