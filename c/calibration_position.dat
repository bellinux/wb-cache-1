40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} method for automatic calibration of robots which are designed for space applications. The necessary lightweight design of robots for extraterrestrial applications or the use of robots in unmanned space stations require measures which approximate the absolute positioning accuracy to the order of magnitude of repetition precision as system limit. Alternatively to robot <b>calibration,</b> <b>position</b> correcting sensor systems can be used. To relieve crew workload in space stations or for completely autonomous operation in unmanned capsules, one has to assume that robots in these modes of operation are predominantly programmed off-line (from the ground). The calibration method developed for this purpose is capable of precisely positioning a robot even if the latter exhibits considerable deformations. Derived from a literature search and the specifications, the development approach under the CAROS project refers to a mixed form of forward calibration and inverse calibration. (orig.)

40|$|BACKGROUND: Portable {{respiratory}} inductive plethysmography (RIP) {{is promising}} for noninvasive monitoring of breathing patterns in unrestrained subjects. However, its use has been hampered by requiring recalibration after changes in body position. OBJECTIVES: To facilitate RIP application in unrestrained subjects, {{we developed a}} technique for adjustment of RIP <b>calibration</b> using <b>position</b> sensor feedback. METHODS: Five healthy subjects and 12 patients with lung disease were monitored by portable RIP with sensors incorporated within a body garment. Unrestrained individuals were studied during 40 - 60 min while supine, sitting and upright/walking. Position was changed repeatedly every 5 - 10 min. Initial qualitative diagnostic calibration followed by volume scaling in absolute units during 20 breaths in different positions by flow meter provided position-specific volume-motion coefficients for RIP. These were applied during subsequent monitoring in corresponding positions according to feedback from 4 accelerometers placed at the chest and thigh. Accuracy of RIP was evaluated by face mask pneumotachography. RESULTS: Position sensor feedback allowed accurate adjustment of RIP <b>calibration</b> during repeated <b>position</b> changes in subjects and patients as reflected in a minor mean difference (bias) in breath-by-breath tidal volumes estimated by RIP and flow meter of 0. 02 liters (not significant) and limits of agreement (+/- 2 SD) of +/- 19 % (2, 917 comparisons). An average of 10 breaths improved precision of RIP (limits of agreement +/- 14 %). CONCLUSIONS: RIP <b>calibration</b> incorporating <b>position</b> sensor feedback greatly enhances the application of RIP as a valuable, unobtrusive tool to investigate respiratory physiology and ventilatory limitation in unrestrained healthy subjects and patients with lung disease during everyday activities including position change...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{multiple}} cameras visual servoing system {{is presented to}} correct the pose of robot end-effector in large scale 3 D positioning in robot manufacturing system. A 3 D CAD laser projector is used to provide four target points on the projection screens for four cameras respectively. Eye-in-hand architecture is used to perform visual servoing and the image based visual servoing (IBVS) is adapted as the control strategy. This paper is focused on detecting the four target points by four cameras respectively. Theoretically, the image Jacobian matrix doesn't hold in this configuration because the target points are floating in base frame along the laser beam during the visual servoing process. But in a step of iteration, the target points on the projection screens can be referred as fixed points which are also called local desired target points. The image features of local desired target points in image planes of cameras are the desired features in this iteration. By observing the four target points on projection screens, the IBVS controller can drive the end-effector of robot to its local desired position in each step of iteration and ultimately to its <b>calibration</b> <b>position.</b> In this configuration, the simple constant depths are adopted for obtaining the image Jacobian matrix during visual servoing.

40|$|A {{proposed}} optoelectronic instrument {{would perform}} several different spectroscopic and imaging functions that, heretofore, {{have been performed}} by separate instruments. The functions would be reflectance, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopies; variable-color confocal imaging at two different resolutions; and wide-field color imaging. The instrument was conceived for use in examination of minerals on remote planets. It {{could also be used}} on Earth to characterize material specimens. The conceptual design of the instrument emphasizes compactness and economy, to be achieved largely through sharing of components among subsystems that perform different imaging and spectrometric functions. The input optics for the various functions would be mounted in a single optical head. With the exception of a targeting lens, the input optics would all be aimed at the same spot on a specimen, thereby both (1) eliminating the need to reposition the specimen to perform different imaging and/or spectroscopic observations and (2) ensuring that data from such observations can be correlated with respect to known positions on the specimen. The figure schematically depicts the principal components and subsystems of the instrument. The targeting lens would collect light into a multimode optical fiber, which would guide the light through a fiber-selection switch to a reflection/ fluorescence spectrometer. The switch would have four positions, enabling selection of spectrometer input from the targeting lens, from either of one or two multimode optical fibers coming from a reflectance/fluorescence- microspectrometer optical head, or from a dark <b>calibration</b> <b>position</b> (no fiber).

40|$|Surgical {{debridement}} is {{the process}} of removing dead or damaged tissue to allow the remaining parts to heal. Automating this procedure could reduce surgical fatigue and facilitate teleoperation, but doing so is challenging for Robotic Surgical Assistants (RSAs) such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) due to inherent non-linearities in cable-driven systems. Consequently, we propose and evaluate a two-phase calibration process. In Phase I, the robot performs a set of open-loop trajectories to obtain abundant, cheap but coarse data of camera pixels and internal robot joint values, and learns a nonlinear transformation. In Phase II, the robot uses Phase I to move systematically to target points in a printed array. Each time, a human operator manually adjusts the end-effector position by direct contact (not through teleoperation), resulting in a small, high-quality dataset. Experiments suggest that without <b>calibration,</b> <b>position</b> errors are 4. 55 mm. Phase I alone can reduce average error to 2. 14 mm, but the combination of Phase I and Phase II reduces average error to 1. 08 mm. We apply this combination to an approximation of debridement with randomly oriented raisins and pumpkin seeds. Using an endoscopic stereo camera with standard edge detection, experiments with 120 trials achieved success rates of 91. 7 % to 99. 2 %, slightly exceeding prior results (89. 4 %) and more than 2. 1 x faster, decreasing the time per fragment from 15. 8 seconds to 7. 3 seconds.

Attention is paid to testing the functionality of the HMI of thermostats, especially to the part of the system, that deals with activation of touchscteen, but no other part of the problem are omitted in the text. Discussions of the problematic passes into the design and implementation of specific design solutions. The selected design of 3 D-router, which moves in three orthogonal coordinates and resembles to a coordinate drill for example. First, it describes the basic concepts of mechanic and electronic part of equipment, and subsequently is designed and implemented control electronics for mechanical activator HMI. Each of the electronics components are described in detail and values of parts are based on the calculation with the exception of finished parts. The proposal of the electronics follows the possibility of maximization of universality module for applications in similar applications. The functionality of the electronics is controlled by a microprocessor with a custom program that is described in the work. Source code of some the programs is not available because it is know-how of the company.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the algorithms, data processing and {{software for the}} video photogrammetry ("videogrammetry") system developed at Cranfield University. Cranfield's system has been used successfully since 1999 {{on a range of}} measurement projects. Videogrammetry typically uses two video cameras to film the motion of target objects in stereo, and then with suitable image processing and data analysis the targets' 3 d trajectories are measured to good precision. The main features of the Cranfield systems are that it is based on consumer electronics devices (e. g. digital camcorders and PC's), and that it is designed as an experimental tool. Using consumer electronics provides good performance at low cost. Its experimental character means that an expert user is required, but does allow great flexibility. Current system performance derives from the image resolution of 1 mrad per pixel over a field of view 720 by 576 pixels, and a frame rate of 25 Hz. Two areas of work are described: (1) the mathematical models and algorithms used for <b>calibration,</b> <b>position</b> measurement and trajectory extraction, and (2) the software tools written to manipulate images and process the data. The model of the imaging system can be adapted {{for a wide range of}} applications, and is explicitly developed in this report for a single camera position and pose calibration, a two-camera system calibration, and a measurement sys- tem using two or more cameras (either the general non-linear case or a linear approximation). The image calibration (which converts image coordinates to geometrical angles of inclination and azimuth) is based on a 3 rd order polyno- mial and achieves an accuracy equivalent to better than 1 pixel. Trajectories are obtained by either labelling targets or using kinematic rules. Two programs (AVI 1 and mfitvid) have been written for the videogrammetry system and are described in outline (for a user and to support future development).

A strong correlation was found between the hip flexion angle and marker displacement (r 2 = 0. 70). While the estimated impact of pelvic STA on gait kinematics was relatively small, the findings suggest that activities with large hip flexion would cause larger STA with a greater impact on pelvic kinematics.
