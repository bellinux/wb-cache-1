50|$|The vineyards, which {{during the}} Ancien Régime were partly owned by Fribourg, Bern, Lausanne and Yverdon patricians and partly {{owned by the}} {{citizens}} of Lutry, became the most important source of income in 19th century and {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. The construction of a harbor (1836-38), a quay (1863) and a dock (1816, 1912) opened the city to the lake. In 1822 the market building was changed into a school. In 1885, the former school building was demolished to make way for a customs house. The train station of Lutry on the Lausanne-Brig line opened in 1861. Followed in 1862 by the La <b>Conversion</b> <b>station</b> on the Bern rail line, followed in 1920 by the stop at Bossière. Starting in 1896, a tram line connected Lutry with Lausanne.|$|E

50|$|The CU Project {{consists}} of three parts: the Falkirk Mine, the Coal Creek Generating Station, and the CU Powerline. A subsidiary of North American Coal Corporation runs the Falkirk Mine, a lignite coal strip mine in North Dakota that covers over twenty-five square miles and uses {{two of the biggest}} dragline excavators ever assembled. The lignite uncovered by the draglines travels by conveyor belt to Coal Creek Station, the largest lignite-fired plant in North Dakota. The Coal Creek Station produces AC current which is converted into DC current at a <b>conversion</b> <b>station.</b> This DC current is transmitted from Coal Creek Station in North Dakota 440 mi to a station near Buffalo, Minnesota where it is converted back into AC current.

40|$|International {{audience}} Future {{offshore wind}} farms {{are expected to}} be placed further away from shore, which will give rise to more employment of HVDC transmission. However, HVDC transmission requires a bulky and expensive power conversion substation at offshore as well as a dedicated supporting platform. Potential elimination of the platform and centralized <b>conversion</b> <b>station</b> leads to great cost savings. Recent proposals of pure dc series offshore wind farms are due to this motivation. The series connection of the wind turbines enables to establish the HVDC transmission voltage level with no extra voltage step-up substation, which makes it attractive for distant large wind farm. However, as series connected in one cluster, wind turbines are not possible to operate independently. Severe wind variation imposes overvoltage on the wind turbines and may provoke a cascade of failures of other series connected units. This paper describes the operating behaviour of dc series offshore wind farm as well as correspondent control strategies in both sound and fault conditions. A simulation of the dc series wind farm is carried out and validates the feasibility of the proposed control strategy. DC series offshore wind farms with proposed control imply competitive economic advantages of future integration of remote energy generation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Space Solar Power (SSP), a {{technology}} {{based on the}} collection and aggregated transmission {{of light from the}} sun, offers an opportunity to create a deep space electrical infrastructure in order to provide the required level of power to a prospective Mars settlement. Several approaches to this challenge are presented and compared. Under the first approach, several Solar Powered Satellites (SPSs) are positioned in space between the Earth and Mars. These SPSs will capture large amounts of solar energy and transmit this energy in a focused beam via laser or microwave to relay SPSs until the energy finally reaches its Mars destination SPS. The Mars SPS will transmit the energy to a receiver and <b>conversion</b> <b>station</b> on the surface of Mars where it will be utilized for continuous operations. A second prospective approach is to place a constellation of SPSs in orbit of Mars which collect solar energy and transmit it (in aggregate form) to one or more ground stations, when they are overhead of them. Both of these prospective approaches are compared (in terms of cost, benefit and system reliability) to a technically simpler solution of placing a collection of solar panels on the surface of Mars for energy collection. This paper considers the logistical requirements for maintaining a deep space electrica...|$|E

The Gotland HVDC system (Gotland 1) used mercury-arc valves to convert and transfer 20 MW of power over its 98 km, with a 100 kV submarine cable—connecting Västervik on the mainland with Ygne {{on the island of}} Gotland. In 1970, the <b>conversion</b> <b>stations</b> were supplemented with thyristor valves connected in series with the mercury-arc valves, raising the voltage to 150 kV and the transmission capacity to 30 MW [2]. This was the first time worldwide that thyristor valve technology was used in a commercial HVDC transmission system.|$|R

40|$|A rise of {{electric}} vehicles and consequent increase of charging {{stations in the}} UK has widely been acknowledged due to its negligible carbon emissions leading to the transformation of low-carbon economy. A dynamic increase {{in the wind and}} solar power systems installation and grid-integration to the charging stations {{of electric}} vehicles has led uncertainty issues in the power distribution grid e. g voltage fluctuations, transients/harmonics. This paper addresses the uncertainty scenario aiming to contribute and propose a potential model focusing on the design of the route in which solar electric power is delivered to the electric vehicle charging station. A specialised system containing an electrical control system is proposed using MATLAB and SIMULINK. A system was designed for improving the interaction among electric-vehicle charging points and battery storage system in which electrical control system assists in developing the correct duty cycle in order to stabilise and regulate the voltage at the DC/DC power <b>conversion</b> <b>station.</b> The proposed system is very effective and significant contribution in understanding and reducing the load on the converter untimely enabling reduction of charging time for electric vehicles. The implemented electrical control system manages the electric power on the grid such as during the peak times it draws power from the batteries and then charges up the batteries in the off-peak times. A constant voltage is achieved on the micro grid irrespective of fluctuations in solar energy generation and in the load...|$|E

50|$|The {{electrical}} grid, {{which is}} normally three-phase AC, can be severely disrupted {{by the presence}} of a large DC bias. This is caused by strong solar flares hitting the Earth's atmosphere, which in turn creates strong electromagnetic fields. This induces voltages in long-distance electrical lines, which can be strong enough to arc across transformers. (Even pipelines, such as the mostly above-ground Alaska Pipeline, are prone to this, and must be tied to electrical ground with zinc sacrificial anodes.) This is a rare but serious problem, mostly for far northern locations like Canada and Scandinavia, where a strong aurora borealis will cover much lower latitudes than normal during such a situation. Space weather forecasts are used to predict when these geomagnetic storm events might occur. High-voltage direct current systems have their own control gear at <b>conversion</b> <b>stations</b> and can adapt somewhat better to such conditions. However, large and often widely fluctuating voltages can still cause problems like harmonics.|$|R

30|$|Three main fault {{types are}} {{expected}} {{to take place in}} MTDC grids. Firstly, faults can occur on the AC side of the power <b>conversion</b> <b>stations.</b> This fault type can be single- or multi-phase, leading to a loss of generation or load in the MTDC grid. For the successful development of MTDC grids, it is imperative that a fault in one AC power system does not propagate through the MTDC grid to another AC system. Secondly, faults may occur at the power converter DC side. This fault type is much more challenging to handle than AC faults. During a DC fault, all interconnected power converters’ DC buses severely contribute to the fault current and, due to the low impedance characteristic of DC cables, the direct bus voltages in the MTDC grid are thereby substantially reduced, nearly stopping the power flow. Finally, a fault can occur inside the power converter station itself, which can trip a section of the MTDC grid, and may lead to loss of generation or load.|$|R
