40|$|The {{utilization}} of biomass for Dimethyl ether production via gasification faces {{the problem of}} a large excess carbon in form of {{carbon dioxide in the}} produced synthesis gas. The stoichiometric adjustment can be accomplished either by adding hydrogen or by removing carbon in form of carbon dioxide. But hydrogen admixture to the syngas requires supplementary investments for an electrolysis unit. The removal of carbon dioxide, due to the extremely low carbon conversion efficiency of about 20 % of the biomass carbon content, makes the DME production cost very high. The novel stoichiometric adjustment concept was investigated by dry reforming carbon dioxide with methane. The addition of methane for reforming allows a nearly complete {{utilization of}} the carbon contained in the biomass. At 750 °C, the CO 2 content of the gas stream was completely consumed via dry reforming reaction. This concept is an acceptable way for avoiding about 60 % the <b>carbon</b> <b>removing</b> from the biomass and avoiding extreme high investment for electrolytic hydrogen...|$|E
40|$|The {{constant}} {{reliance on}} fossil fuel energy resources is unsustainable, due to both depleting world reserves and increasing green house gas emissions {{associated with their}} use and thus there are dynamic research {{at the global level}} envisioned at developing alternative renewable and potentially carbon neutral solid, liquid and gaseous biofuels as alternative energy resources. The contemporary knowledge and technology predictions have proved that among the third generation biofuels especially those derived from microalgae are considered the best reasonable alternative energy resource compared to undeniable drawbacks of first and second generation biofuels. Moreover, its efficiency to sequester carbon from the atmosphere and industrial gases which can efficiently utilize the nutrients present in wastewater and industrial effluents. Therefore, culturing algae provide several benefits such as providing biomass for the production of biofuels to sequester the atmospheric <b>carbon,</b> <b>removing</b> the nutrients from the wastewater and is not competing with agricultural land, water resources and food crops. This study reviewed the technologies underneath the microalgae-to-biofuels processes, focusing on the biomass production, harvesting, conversion technologies, and the lipid extraction methods. The genetics and molecular biotechnology aspects have also been briefly discussed. Though the economical assessment of algal biofuels is not attractive, it suggests them to be environmentally better than the fossil fuels...|$|E

40|$|Diuron (DR) and hexazinone (HX) are potent {{herbicides}} worldwide consolidated {{in agricultural}} practices. In Brazil, their mixed formulation has been intensively applied to cultures of sugar cane crops. However, when detected in agricultural watersheds, these compounds are potentially toxic to aquatic organisms {{and may be}} potentially carcinogenic. Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) is an alternative treatment of DR/HX in aqueous environment. In this study, we evaluate the H 2 O 2 /UV simultaneous degradation and photolysis process of DR/HX using central composite design. The HX and DR initial concentrations were close to 7 and 20 mg L- 1, respectively. In the system, the planning showed that the H 2 O 2 concentration has bigger influence than pH. The optimum degradation conditions (7 mmol L- 1 of H 2 O 2 and pH 2. 8) provide a total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>removing</b> of 96. 4 % while the photolysis process only 17. 2 %. Since neither of the herbicides were detected after 2 min of reaction, {{it was not possible}} to differ kinetics degradation process of DR and HX during the process. After the treatment, the toxicity was tested using Vibrio fischeri bioluminescent bacteria and showed a decrease when H 2 O 2 /UV is applied. Degradation H 2 O 2 /UV was successfully employed, showing excellent performance due to increased mineralization...|$|E
40|$|A pH buffer {{capacity}} based method for multivariate monitoring of tertiary algal wastewater treatment systems is presented. A pilot plant with algal biomass receiving the effluent of a <b>carbon</b> <b>removing</b> activated sludge municipal {{wastewater treatment plant}} was used for the experimental work. Two types of {{buffer capacity}} profiles are considered, first resulting from a titration from the actual pH to pH 2. 5 (down titration), and second {{as a result of a}} titration from pH 2. 5 to pH 11 (up titration). The experiments were conducted with a laboratory titrator and the buffer capacity profiles were processed by fitting mathematical models of buffer systems to them. This allowed quantification of the inorganic carbon (IC) buffer from the down titration profiles. IC is of major importance because it is the only carbon source used by algae. It is shown that the IC concentration derived from the buffer capacity profile gives different process information than a standard alkalinity measurement. The up titration profiles were successfully used for the quantification of NH 4 - and o-PO 4, although an exact comparison of the laboratory results and the buffer capacity based results is difficult, because of the filtration step preceding laboratory analyses and possible interferences caused by unmodeled buffer systems. No filter device was used, which makes it possible to implement this measurement method in a robust and field applicable sensor. The complete measurement cycle (down titration followed by up titration and data interpretation) can be performed in less than 1 hour, with little manipulation, and could easily be automated...|$|E

However, when the chlorine atom is separated by several bonds, the effect is much smaller. Bromine is much more electronegative than either carbon or hydrogen, but not as electronegative as chlorine, so the pKa of 2-bromobutanoic acid is slightly greater than the pKa of 2-chlorobutanoic acid.|$|R
