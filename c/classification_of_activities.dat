Both entail costs involved in production processes that are related to the exploitation of the environment in different ways. On the one hand, environmental protection expenditures record spending on measures aimed at improving the environment, while on the other hand, taxes record the costs set by a government for the exploitation of the environment. Thus, in the total cost of production, the environmental taxes paid can be added to expenditure on environmental protection.|$|E

Vocational and technical education is mainly provided by Technical schools (technikum) and/or basic vocational schools (zasadnicza szkoła zawodowa). Technical schools last 4 years and lead to the Matura. Their primary goal is to teach occupations and trades, the most popular being: accountant, mechanic, electronics specialist, and salesperson. [...] Basic vocational schools also provide a vocational education lasting 2 years and grant a certificate of competence in various fields, the most popular being: shop-assistant, cook, gardener, automobile mechanic, hairdresser and baker. Graduates from basic vocational schools can pass the Matura after an extra-curriculum of {{two years in a}} general secondary school, or, since 2004, of three years in a Technical school. Profiled general secondary schools (liceum profilowane) provide a vocational education in three years, but only in fields described by the Polish <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Activities</b> (PKD). In addition, mentally and/or physically handicapped students can join special schools (szkoła specjalna) which prepare to the Matura in three years.|$|E

The ground truth of activities is provided by the participants themselves using an experience sampling application running on mobile phones. The original data is discretized by the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) into different activity levels and the number of levels is inferred automatically.

By exploiting a publicly available benchmark HAR dataset, we show the benefits of adding smartphones gyroscope signals into the recognition system against the traditional accelerometer-based approach, and explore two feature selection mechanisms for allowing a radically faster recognition: the utilization of exclusively time domain features and the adaptation of the L 1 SVM model which performs comparably to non-linear approaches while ne- glecting a large number of non-informative features...|$|E

This classification makes it more effective in modeling the construction workflow and reengineering the {{construction process}}. It also avoids the confusion of the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> into value-adding and non-value-adding activities encountered in the construction industry. In addition, computer simulation techniques are incorporated into the framework to virtually simulate and assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the reengineered construction process that is achieved based on lean principles.

(2) FCF accounting is the one that include an item peculiar to each activity as a constituent factor in each classification of operating, investing, and financing activities. (3) On FCF accounting, in each <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities,</b> a corporation tax is appropriately taken into consideration, and deduction is carried out.

The findings showed statistically significant association between non-productive activities and each of the above factors. The effect of these factors on involvement in non-productive activities was tested through a logistic regression. The results revealed that residence and gender have significant effect on non-productive activities while education has an insignificant effect (p= 0. 07). In particular the findings showed that respondents in rural areas are 1. 5 times less likely to be involved in non-productive activities than those in urban areas. With regard to gender the results suggested that women are 2. 4 {{times more likely to be}} involved in non-productive activities than men...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{variety of}} {{activities}} in workplaces {{that can lead to}} emission of substances. Coding systems based on determinants of emission have so far not been developed. In this paper, a sys-tem of Activity Classes and Activity Subclasses is proposed for categorizing activities involving chemical use. Activity Classes share their so-called ‘emission generation mechanisms ’ and physical state of the product handled and the underlying determinants of emission. A number of (industrial) stakeholders actively participated in testing and fine-tuning the system. With the help of these stakeholders, it was found to be relatively easy to allocate a large number of activities to the Activity Classes and Activity Subclasses. The system facilitates a more struc-tured <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities</b> in exposure databases, a structured analysis of the analogy of exposure activities, and a transparent quantification of the activity emission potential in (new) exposure assessment models.
