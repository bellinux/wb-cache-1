40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{discretization}} scheme tailored {{to a class}} of multiphase models that regard the physical system as consisting of multiple interacting continua. In the framework of mixture theory, we consider a general mathematical model that entails solving a system of mass and momentum equations for the mixture and {{for one of the}} phases. The model results in a strongly coupled and nonlinear system of partial differential equations that are written in terms of phase and mixture (barycentric) velocities, phase pressure, and saturation. We construct an accurate, robust and reliable hybrid method that combines a mixed finite element discretization of the momentum equations with a primal discontinuous finite volume-element discretization of the mass (or transport) equations. The scheme is devised for unstructured meshes and relies on mixed Brezzi-Douglas-Marini approximations of phase and total velocities, on piecewise constant elements for the approximation of phase or total pressures, as well as on a primal formulation that employs discontinuous finite volume elements defined on a dual diamond mesh to approximate scalar fields of interest (such as volume fraction, total density, saturation, etc.). As the discretization scheme is derived for a general formulation of multicontinuum physical systems, it can be readily applied to a large class of simplified multiphase models; on the other, the method {{can be seen as a}} generalization of these models that are commonly encountered in the literature and employed when the latter are not sufficiently accurate. An extensive set of numerical test cases involving two- and three-dimensional porous media are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the method that displays an optimal convergence rate, the physics-preserving properties of the mixed–primal scheme, as well as the the robustness of the method, which is successfully applied to diverse physical phenomena such as density fingering, Terzaghi’s consolidation, deformation of a <b>cantilever</b> <b>bracket,</b> and the Boycott effects. The applicability of the method is not limited to flow in porous media, but can be also employed to describe many other physical systems that are governed by a similar system of equations, e. g., to model multi-component materials...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} new active MHD antennas for JET is described and the structural/mechanical analysis for the antennas is presented. These new antennas replace the existing n = 1 or 2 saddle coils {{with a set of}} eight smaller antennas designed to excite Toroidal Alfven Eigenmodes (TAE's) with high toroidal mode number (n ~ 10) in the frequency range of 30 kHz- 500 kHz. TAE's with these higher mode numbers are expected in ITER and could enhance the loss of fast alpha particles in a burning plasma regime. By studying the properties of stable TAE's excited actively by these antennas, high performance regimes of operation avoiding unstable fast particle driven modes can be found. A more complete overview of the experiment may be found in Reference[1] Two antenna assemblies will be installed at toroidally opposite positions. Antenna wires are protected from the plasma heat flux by CFC tiles mounted on mini-limiters, located between the individual windings. The main structural element is a box section. The support scheme utilizes <b>cantilevered</b> <b>brackets</b> that connect to the saddle coils, and “wing ” brackets which add support {{to the top of the}} frame. Conservative estimates of the disruption currents in the MHD antennas and frame were used to calculate loading and resulting stress in the antenna structure. Fields, field transients, and halo current specifications were provided by JET. The frame originally was designed as a continuous loop, and was converted to an open structure to break eddy current loops. Antenna eddy currents were computed assuming the antenna is shorted. In thefinaldesign, frame forces primarily result from halo currents entering around the mini limiters that now protect the antenna windings. Accelerations due to the vessel disruption dynamic response were included in the loading. The antenna mechanical design has been shown to perform adequately for all identified disruption loading.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the shape optimization of structural members frequently found in critical area in a structure system, that is, highly stressed zone. Isogeometry analysis is well known to be the very efficient way to integrate the geometric modeling(CAD) and computational analysis(CAE). This can be accomplished by directly using the geometric modeling by NURBS(Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline). In this study, an efficient computer code adopting the isogeometry concept has been developed for the structural analysis, in which CAD information can be directly used in the finite element modeling. In order to show the validity of the present code, the present results are compared with those by using the commercial package, that is, MSC/NASTRAN. The present isogeometric analysis procedure has been integrated with the optimization procedure to deal with the optimization problem found in the context of structural mechanics. The present system has been successfully applied to the shape optimization of <b>cantilever</b> structure having <b>bracket.</b> From the present study, it can be seen the validity of the present approach and computer codes developed in this study.

40|$|Polystal [2]) was {{developed}} using glass fibres pultruded with resin {{to form a}} round rod. Much research was carried out to determine the system’s proper-ties, including quantification of the stress-rupture phenomenon. An an-chorage {{was developed}} using a resin cast around bundles of pultrusions in-side a steel tube. This steel tube pro-vided confinement and {{could be used as}} a mechanical fastening. A number of bridges were built using these tendons: a simple footbridge was followed by a two-span continuous structure with internal tendons, both in Düsseldorf. Both are believed to have had considerable amounts of unten-sioned reinforcement and were de-signed as partially prestressed. These examples were followed by a bridge in Berlin with external tendons, and by others elsewhere in Germany and in Austria. Despite the technical success of the system it has not proved a com-mercial success, and production of the tendons has been discontinued. Aramid Rods for Prestressing In the early 1980 s research began in the Netherlands into the use of aramid fib-res for prestressing in the form of pul-trusions, both as flat strips and as round bars, under the name Arapree [3]. The surface of the bars can be indent-ed or coated with sand to improve the bond. As with the Polystal tendons, it is difficult to provide long-term an-chorages for permanent loads, since the force has to be transferred through the resin, which is susceptible to creep and temperature effects. However, an-choring systems have been developed that are adequate for short-term load-ings. These rods are ideally suited for use as pretensioning tendons in pre-cast concrete. The system has been used to build a variety of structures in Europe and Japan. These range from non-structur-al components, such as noise barriers and fish-weir planks, to housing com-ponents and principal elements of quayside developments. The system has also been used in <b>cantilever</b> sup-port <b>brackets</b> on a highway scheme in Barcelona. During early trials, some problems were noted with the transverse expan-sion of the tendons due to thermal ef-fects [4]. Cracking of the concrete along the line of the tendon was noted when the tendons were close to the surface. This was overcome by coating the tendon with a resin that contains microscopic air bubbles...|$|R
