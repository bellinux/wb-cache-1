5|$|After the war trains faced {{competition}} from aviation and automobiles, and serving trolleys were installed on Norwegian trains. In 1965 cart service on trains was centralised and standardised; food service was faster, and prices were lowered. During the 1970s cafeteria cars were used, where passengers <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> themselves.|$|E

5000|$|They <b>Could</b> Still <b>Serve</b> is a {{painting}} by Ellen Gallagher. It is {{in the collection of}} the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, New York in the United States. They <b>Could</b> Still <b>Serve</b> represents Gallagher's biggest focused body of work: large scale pieces that explore racial stereotypes of African Americans, specifically those seen in minstral shows.|$|R
5|$|Influenced by the Völkisch movement, {{the regime}} was against {{cultural}} modernism {{and supported the}} development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism. Creativity and art were stifled, except where they <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as propaganda media. The party used symbols such as the Blood Flag and rituals such as the Nazi Party rallies to foster unity and bolster the regime's popularity.|$|E
5|$|Julian also {{extracted}} stigmasterol, {{which took}} {{its name from}} Physostigma venenosum, the west African calabar bean that he hoped <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time, in 1934, Butenandt and Fernholz, in Germany, had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to progesterone by synthetic organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Royal Society {{is head of}} {{both the}} society and the council. The details for the {{presidency}} were {{set out in the}} second charter and initially had no limit on how long a president <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> for; under current society statute, the term is five years.|$|E

5|$|After the Stoke line opened, {{the station}} was rebuilt {{north-east}} at the junction so it <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> both lines. The new station opened on 9June 1845; at first, southbound services ran to Crewe and Poynton. By November the line had been extended to Macclesfield, and by 1849, when the original station closed, it had reached Stoke-on-Trent. The new station had four platforms, and was served by trains running between Manchester and Crewe or Stoke-on-Trent. It was renamed Cheadle Hulme in 1866, to avoid confusion with Cheadle LNW railway station which opened the same year.|$|E
5|$|David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent {{the next}} Heartbleed {{analyzes}} why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, and suggests several techniques {{which could have}} led to a faster identification, as well as techniques which could have reduced its impact. According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique which could have prevented Heartbleed is an atypical test suite thoroughly performing what he calls negative testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as a base for all TLS implementations.|$|E
5|$|Despite the passed balls, Wilhelm won the American League ERA {{title with}} a 2.19 ERA. During the 1960 season, Orioles manager Paul Richards devised a larger mitt so his {{catchers}} {{could handle the}} knuckleball. Richards was well equipped with starting pitchers during that year. By {{the middle of the}} season, he said that eight of his pitchers <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as starters. Wilhelm started 11 of the 41 games in which he appeared. He earned an 11–8 record, a 3.31 ERA and seven saves. He only started one game the following year, but he was an All-Star, registered 18 saves and had a 2.30 ERA.|$|E

5|$|Fortune's activities—including her {{leadership}} of the new group {{and a series of}} articles that she wrote for The Occult Review—raised concerns for Alpha et Omega leader Moina Mathers. After Fortune suggested that her own organisation <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as a feeder group to Mathers's Alpha et Omega, Mathers expelled her from the order, claiming that this was necessitated by Fortune having the wrong signs in her aura. Fortune later claimed that she subsequently came under psychic attack from Mathers, during which she was confronted and assaulted by both real and etheric cats.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these offices {{there was a need}} for servants {{to take care of the}} hunting animals. The master huntsman, or the veneur, held a central position in greater noble households. Likewise, the master falconer was a high-ranking officer, often of noble birth himself. There were spiritual needs to be cared for, and a chapel was a natural part of every large household. These household chapels would be staffed by varying numbers of clerics. The chaplains, confessors and almoners <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> in administrative capacities as well as the religious ones.|$|E
5|$|The Papuan {{campaign}} led to {{a significant}} reform {{in the composition of}} the Australian Army. During the campaign, the restriction banning CMF personnel from serving outside of Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and CMF. In late 1942 and early 1943 Curtin overcame opposition within the Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> to include most of the South West Pacific and the necessary legislation was passed in January 1943. The 11th Brigade was the only CMF formation to serve outside of Australian territory, however, when it formed part of Merauke Force in the NEI during 1943 and 1944.|$|E

5|$|The {{document}} was then {{deposited in the}} temple that housed the Treasury (the aerarium). While a senatus auctoritas (vetoed Senate motion) had no legal value, it did serve to show {{the opinion of the}} Senate. If a senatus consultum conflicted with a law (lex) that was passed by a Roman Assembly, the law overrode the senatus consultum, because the senatus consultum had its authority based in precedent, and not in law. A senatus consultum, however, <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> to interpret a law.|$|E
5|$|The elderly Caxias, almost 72 and widowed since 1874, was in {{poor health}} and <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> {{only as a}} figurehead {{president}} of the government formed on 25 June 1875. Cotejipe was the de facto president. The Caxias-Cotejipe cabinet attempted to dissipate the discord created by the previous cabinet. Their measures included financial aid to coffee farmers, an amnesty for the convicted bishops, and, to please the pro-slavery Conservatives, the selection of new ministers and a call for elections. Caxias, who was a Freemason but also a staunch Catholic, threatened to resign if the Emperor did not grant the amnesty, which PedroII grudgingly issued in September 1875.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} for an airport serving Ny-Ålesund was {{launched by the}} brothers Einar Sverre Pedersen and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen. Einar worked as chief navigator in the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and was instrumental in developing the airline routes over the North Pole. He envisioned that the airport in Svalbard <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as an emergency landing aerodrome for intercontinental flights, and proposed that the Norwegian trunk airline service be extended to Svalbard.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Operation Ten-Go is revered {{to some degree}} in modern Japan as {{evidenced}} by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. One {{of the reasons the}} event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word Yamato was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship Yamato <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> {{as a metaphor for the}} end of the Japanese empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the Great Wall as a defence line against northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas {{inside and outside the}} wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E
5|$|This crater {{has also}} been {{proposed}} as a future site for a large infrared telescope. The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations, and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near-continuous power to the observatory. About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5-km tall Malapert Mountain, a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth, and which <b>could</b> <b>serve</b> as a radio relay station when suitably equipped.|$|E
