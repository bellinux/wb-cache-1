40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} {{were made to}} determine the effects of slot gap opening and flap <b>cove</b> <b>shape</b> on flap and airfoil flow fields. Test model was the GA(W) - 1 airfoil with 0. 30 c Fowler flap deflected 35 degrees. Tests were conducted with optimum, wide and narrow gaps, and with three cove shapes. Three test angles were selected, corresponding to pre-stall and post-stall conditions. Reynolds number was 2, 200, 000 and Mach number was 0. 13. Force, surface pressure, total pressure, and split-film turbulence {{measurements were}} made. Results were compared with theory for those parameters for which theoretical values were available...|$|E
40|$|Having bay and gulf {{morphology}} as cresentic beach, Parangtritis coast {{has been}} known potentially threat by rip currents hazard. This study aims to identify and detect breaking waves region and surf zone on ALOS PALSAR images, and identify and extract the <b>cove</b> <b>shape</b> shoreline morphology of Parangtritis beach. ALOS PALSAR Fine Beam Single (FBS) HH polarization acquired on 2 nd May 2007 and 17 th June 2007, off nadir angle 34. 3 º, and in descending mode level 1. 0 were utilized to derive amplitude information using Sigmasar. Shoreline morphology detection showed that the cusps system has not changed much during May to June 2007 when PALSAR images acquired, but might have shifted individually. The use of optical sensor with the same spatial resolution, ALOS AVNIR- 2, supports to distinguish the boundary and determine the shoreline morphology of Parangtritis beach...|$|E
40|$|High-lift system {{aerodynamics}} {{has been}} gaining attention in recent years. In an effort to improve aircraft performance, comprehensive studies of multi-element airfoil systems are being undertaken in wind-tunnel and flight experiments. Recent developments in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offer a relatively inexpensive alternative for studying complex viscous flows by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. Current limitations in computer resources restrict practical high-lift N-S computations to two dimensions, but CFD predictions can yield tremendous insight into flow structure, interactions between airfoil elements, and effects of changes in airfoil geometry or free-stream conditions. These codes are very accurate when compared to strictly 2 D data provided by wind-tunnel testing, as will be shown here. Yet, additional challenges must be faced {{in the analysis of}} a production aircraft wing section, such as that of the NASA Langley Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV). A primary issue is the sweep theory used to correlate 2 D predictions with 3 D flight results, accounting for sweep, taper, and finite wing effects. Other computational issues addressed here include the effects of surface roughness of the geometry, <b>cove</b> <b>shape</b> modeling, grid topology, and transition specification. The sensitivity of the flow to changing free-stream conditions is investigated. In addition, the effects of Gurney flaps on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil system are predicted...|$|E
50|$|Bononia Cove (залив Бонония, ‘Zaliv Bononia’ \'za-liv bo'no-ni-ya\) is the 3.1 km wide cove {{indenting}} for 1.1 km {{the southeast}} coast of Nelson Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. It is entered west of Ivan Alexander Point. The <b>cove’s</b> <b>shape</b> is enhanced {{as a result}} of glacier retreat in the late 20th and early 21st century.|$|R

Wordsworth here describes Red Tarn, under Helvellyn, to the east; but Charles Gough was killed on the Kepplecove side of Swirell Edge, and not at Red Tarn. Bishop Watson of Llandaff, writing to Hayley (see 'Anecdotes of the Life of Bishop Watson', p. 440), writes about Charles Gouche (evidently Gough). He had been lodging at [...] "the Cherry Inn," [...] near Wytheburn, sometime before his death.--Ed.] ...|$|R
5000|$|Ulu Peninsula (...) is {{that portion}} of James Ross Island {{northwest}} of the narrow neck of land between Rohss Bay and Croft Bay, extending from Cape Obelisk to Cape Lachman. Named descriptively by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1987. In plan view the <b>cove</b> is <b>shaped</b> like an ulu, a type of knife traditionally used by Eskimo women.|$|R
40|$|Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is an {{autosomal}} dominant channelopathy with variable penetrance affecting the sodium channel. It reduces {{the transport of}} sodium ions essential for proper generation of the cardiac action potential. The resulting inhomogeneous repolarisation {{in areas of the}} RV epicardium causes malignant ventricular arrhythmias. BrS is diagnosed by typical <b>cove</b> <b>shaped</b> ST elevation of > 2 mm in ≥ 1 RV precordial lead V 1, V 2 occurring spontaneously or after provocative drug test with IV administration of Class 1 antiarrhythmic drug such as flecainide or ajmaline. The incidence of BrS is variable being higher in South East Asians and is generally quoted as 1 : 2000. It is responsible for up to 20 % of sudden arrhythmic deaths in those without structural heart disease. Typical presentation is syncope or resuscitated sudden death and symptoms usually occur at night or at rest especially after a large meal. Fever is a common trigger, particularly in children. Genetic testing for BrS is a Class 2 A indication and the yield has increased recently to nearly 40 %. Genetic testing assists with family screening...|$|R
50|$|Anawangin Cove: It is a {{crescent}} <b>shaped</b> <b>cove</b> with a pristine white sand beach. What makes the place unique is the unusual riddle of tall pine-like trees flourishing round its vicinity. In fact {{they are not}} pine trees; they are agoho trees, a species endemic to the Philippines, some Southeast Asian countries and north-eastern parts of Australia. There are no roads leading to Anawangin. It is only accessible by a 30-minute boat ride from Pundaquit, San Antonio, or by a six-hour trek through hot, open trails thru the Pundaquit range. The cove's relative isolation has kept it free from development - as of this writing, there are no resorts on this sparkling piece of natural beauty, save for a few huts and deep wells. Just behind the beach is the pine forest and a marsh, where one can find natural springs feeding to the sea. The area {{is home to a}} number of bird species.|$|R
50|$|The {{beach in}} this rocky cove is {{probably}} the most difficult beach to access on the whole of the island. To reach it you must negotiate a rickety wooden ladder and then clamber down a rocky slope {{with the help of a}} rope installed by the local fishermen. This route was christened Heaven’s Gate by Hippies in years gone by. Visitors will understand why once they have made this tricky descent as the cove is a secluded, spectacular place. Once at the shoreline the horseshoe <b>shaped</b> <b>cove’s</b> cliffs tower above the very small strip of sand and pebbles. The rock formations in the cliff face are in layers which were formed by layers of sediment laid down between 65 and 195 million years. Surprisingly, given the difficulty in getting here, local fishermen have built sheds and slipways here, by building simple walls across the natural caves at the base of these cliffs.|$|R
50|$|Epoxy resins and hardeners are universally used in boat {{building}} due {{to their}} superior holding power and ease of use. In its thickened state it {{is used as a}} strong filler and for a range of joints that do away with more traditional fastenings. A large supply of cheap wooden tongue depressors is useful for mixing and applying epoxy resin. The curved ends are useful for <b>shaping</b> <b>coved</b> joints with epoxy. Silicon bronze ring nails are excellent for permanent fastening of wood and ply as they are strong and easily driven. Many small boats are almost entirely fastened by epoxy resin. In stitch and glue construction the hull panels are temporarily held together with either copper wire, nylon fishing line or plastic cable ties, until the epoxy cures, after which the stitching material is removed. Polyester filler is a quick setting (20mts), softer filler, suited to very small holes and scratches and is far more easily sanded to a fair shape than harder, stronger epoxy filler which takes 24 hours to set hard.|$|R
40|$|Vegetation in mountainous regions {{responds}} to small-scale variation in terrain, {{largely due to}} effects on both temperature and soil moisture. However there are few studies of quantitative, terrain-based methods for predicting vegetation composition. This study investigated relationships between forest composition, elevation, and a derived index of terrain shape, and evaluates methods for predicting forest composition. Trees were measured on 406 permanent plots {{within the boundaries of}} the Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, located in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, USA. All plots were in control watersheds, without human or major natural disturbance since 1923. Plots were 0. 08 ha and arrayed on transects, with approximately 380 meters between parallel transects. Breast-height diameters were measured on all trees. Elevation and terrain <b>shape</b> (<b>cove,</b> ridge, sideslope) were estimated for each plot. Density (trees/ha) and basal area were summarized by species and by forest type (cove, xeric oak-pine, northern hardwoods, and mixed deciduous). Plot data were combined with a digital elevation data (DEM), and a derived index of terrain shape at two sampling resolutions: 30 m (US Geological Survey), and 80 m (Defense Mapping Agency) sources. Vegetation maps were produced using each of four different methods: 1) linear regression with and without log transformations against elevation and terrain variables combined with cartographic overlay, 2) kriging, 3) co-kriging, and 4) a mosaic diagram. Predicted vegetation was compare...|$|R
