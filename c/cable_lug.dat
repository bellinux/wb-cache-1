5000|$|One special {{silver brazing}} method is called [...] or [...] It has been {{developed}} especially for connecting cables to railway track or for cathodic protection installations. The method uses a silver- and flux-containing brazing pin, which is melted {{in the eye of}} a <b>cable</b> <b>lug.</b> The equipment is normally powered from batteries.|$|E
50|$|Within a {{cathodic}} protection system {{there are a}} multitude of connection requirements for anode cables, measuring posts etc., being extremely versatile, the pin brazing system is ideally suited to this. Attachments can be made vertically, horizontally or even overhead. If preferred, threaded pins with nuts can be attached or cable bonded directly onto the pipe {{by means of a}} special <b>cable</b> <b>lug</b> which can be crimped on site or supplied complete as a unique integrally crimped attachment. The pin brazing unit contains all the equipment and tools required to make safe cable connections. A welding generator may also be utilized as a power source wherever a battery unit may be impractical or a great many connections need to be made in such places as pipe-coating yards or lay-barges etc.|$|E

40|$|An {{electrical}} contact interface is visualized by rendering 'contact maps' from x-ray computer tomography images {{without the need}} for dismantling the specimens. The contact maps consist of approximately 1500 × 1500 pixels with each pixel relating to a 8. 0 µm × 8. 0 µm area at the interface. The specimens consist of bolting a <b>cable</b> <b>lug</b> to a printed circuit board at various contact normal forces between 0. 8 and 3. 2 kN. Quantitative analysis of the contact maps gives values for the mechanical area of contact and the size distribution of the contact spots. The size distribution of the spots shows a fractal behaviour analogous to the size distribution of islands on Earth. Data on the spot size distribution of the {{electrical contact}} interface are presented. The contact maps also give information on the geometry of contact spots and their spatial distribution over the apparent area of contac...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrical}} contact interface is visualized by rendering “contact maps” from X-ray Computer Tomography(CT) images {{without the need}} for dismantling the specimens. The contact maps consist of approximately 1500 pixels× 1500 pixels with each pixel relating to an 8. 0 m× 8. 0 m× 8. 0 mvolume at the interface. The specimens consist of bolting a <b>cable</b> <b>lug</b> to a printed circuit board. The resolution dependence of measured fractal characteristics is studied for a contact interface with a normal force of 1. 6 kN. The total mechanical area of contact, Am, is found to be invariant with resolution whereas the largest contact spot size, AL, is found to decrease with higher resolution. The number of spots on the apparent area of contact is found to increase with resolution but a spot increasingly has areas of noncontact within itself at higher resolution. The fractal dimension, D, of the spot area is found to converge to 1 at lower resolution consistent with self-affinity behaviour. At higher resolution D converges to a value < 2...|$|E
