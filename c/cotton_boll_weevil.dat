50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Georgia {{experienced}} economic expansion {{in both the}} manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The cotton industry benefited from the depredations of the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> further west. In 1911, Georgia produced a record 2.8 million bales of <b>cotton.</b> However, the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> arrived in Georgia four years later. By 1921, infestation had reached such epidemic proportions that 45% of the states' cotton crop was destroyed. Demand during World War I drove cotton prices {{to a high of}} $1 a pound. After 1919, however, cotton quickly fell to 10 cents per pound. Landowners ruined by the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> and declining prices expelled their sharecroppers.|$|R
40|$|For decades {{considerable}} {{research has}} focused on improving the efficiency of crop protection. Many naturally occurring biodegradable compounds have often been used as pesticides and with increased environmental concerns, the identification of biologically active natural products has attracted significant attention. Fish toxicity has often been used as a measure of pesticidal activity. Several Southeast Asian mangrove species have been shown to possess ichthyotoxic properties. A bioassay of the extracts obtained from Heritiera littoralis, a Philippine mangrove plant, indicated toxicity toward fish thus suggesting the possibility of their use as pesticides. Three sesquiterpene lactones, Heritianin, Vallapin, and Vallapianin have been isolated from H littoralis. Vallapin showed activity against the <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevils.</b> The aim of this project is to attempt the total synthesis of these lactones. The key reaction in the total synthesis is the construction of the lactone moiety. Based on literature precedent it appeared that an intramolecular Reformatsky reaction is the method of choice to construct the lactone. Model studies were carried out successfully with 6 methoxy- l-tetralone. The total synthesis of the target molecules is now underway and seven steps in the proposed ten step synthesis have been completed in 27 % overall yield. The asymmetric synthesis of the target molecules will also be carried out...|$|R

Fipronil mixed with mineral oil was not as effective as fipronil mixed with cottonseed oil. Results of low volume aerial application of fipronil in aqueous mixtures with drift retardants showed that drift retardants slightly increased deposition of fipronil on cotton leaf surfaces compared to the standard application with water. <b>Boll</b> <b>weevil</b> mortalities from drift retardant-fipronil mixtures were slightly greater than an aqueous mixture of fipronil immediately after application.

50|$|Cotton farming {{became even}} more of an uphill {{struggle}} {{with the onset of}} the <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil.</b> During the Depression, farmers left their fields for opportunities elsewhere. Several of the farms which were in the area were purchased in the late 1930s by an Atlanta attorney named Hugh Howell. The tract of land he assembled near Stone Mountain seems to have been intended for hunting and entertaining purposes. He built a country house with access to the road that would become the Stone Mountain Freeway. The road that bears his name was a later addition, a dirt track which connected Lawrenceville Highway and the village by the mountain.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, in Rosebud, Alabama, Rosa J. Young, an African-American and the {{daughter}} of a Methodist minister, had started a school in 1912 to give African-American children in the area a good Christian education. The Rosebud Literary and Industrial School soon had over 200 students, but in 1914 the <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> infested Wilcox County, and the resulting economic hardship meant that students' families were unable to afford the tuition. Desperate to keep the school open, she requested aid from the Methodist Church, but to no avail. She wrote to Booker T.

50|$|The coal boom {{ended in}} the 1910s, as railroads {{switched}} to cheaper fuel oil to power their trains. In the early 1920s, the railroads closed their mines in Lehigh. Declining crop prices and damage to the <b>cotton</b> crop from <b>boll</b> <b>weevils</b> further weakened the economy. The Merchants National Bank closed in 1923. The building subsequently housed a grocery store. Many of the other buildings on main street were abandoned. As part of New Deal projects during the Great Depression, most of the abandoned buildings on Main Street were torn down. During World War II, there was again a demand for coal in the area, {{and many of the}} town's buildings were torn down or moved so the ground underneath them could be readily mined.|$|R

It also had access to two railways for shipping cotton bales. Its most famous attribute was the dance hall, a family activity in those days. Due {{to the failure of}} the <b>cotton</b> crop from <b>boll</b> <b>weevils,</b> and the failure of the banks after 1929, commercial activity slowed to a crawl.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the economy was based on agriculture: large-scale cotton farming, coffee and cereals, and cattle raising, goats, sheep and cattle, favoring the export of sheep skins raw or tanned, dry leather and salty, as well as lump cotton and live cattle. Cotton was the culture that most contributed to the economic development of the municipality. Between 1930 and 1955, the production was so great that the producers started to benefit it in the field even using handmade machines. Faced with the success of cotton growing, modern cotton factories were installed in the city. The municipality had six plants in operation. Since 1980, the crop has declined, due to several factors, as an interruption of financial aid by the government, (such as crop insurance), <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> (pests that destroy crops), high interest rates for production financing, and of the processing. Currently, the production of passion fruit has been outstanding, in the district of Itaquaraí, one of the largest production locations in Brazil.In 1930, two important events marked the economic history of the municipality: the arrival of the mining company Magnesita S.A., founded by two French friends naturalized Brazilian and resident in Brazil, Miguel Pierre Cahen and Georges Louis Minviele - in partnership with Antônio Mourão Guimarães -, a politician of the time, and the construction of the Federal Railroad Network (RFFSA), which would facilitate the transportation of the newly discovered ore to the port of Aratu in Salvador. Both events occurred in 1939. The Magnesita company was authorized to operate in 1940 through Decree nº 6220 and since then, it has exploited most of the magnesite and mineral talc reserves contained in Serra das Éguas. In the 1970s Brumado arrived at the Brazilian Refractory Products Industries (IBAR S.A.). The company interested in extracting magnesite has established its facilities {{in the northern part of}} the saw. In the following years, the municipality witnessed great changes, such as large-scale population growth, construction of houses and commercial establishments. Faced with this great attraction, people from other cities were arriving, commerce strengthened, and the city of Brumado became known by recent events. To the south of the former Serra das Éguas farm was formed a kind of closed condominium: the Catiboaba village; The Presidente Getúlio Vargas village was also formed around the company, fruit of the flow of workers who came from the most varied places to work in the mines of magnesite and mineral talc. In 1969, it was the turn of Xilolite S.A., which also settled on the north side of the mountain range and has since exploited magnesite and mineral talc, with the acquisition of one of the mines in 1973. In 1993, Matsulfur, a cement factory, later acquired by Lafarge, under the name Cement Brumado, today Cimpor (Cement of Portugal), belonging to InterCement (Grupo Camargo Corrêa).|$|E
40|$|<b>Cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> Anthonomus grandis causes severe cotton {{crop losses}} in North and South America. This report {{demonstrates}} {{the presence of}} cysteine proteinase activity in <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil,</b> an essential enzyme of protein metabolism for many crop pests. A cysteine proteinase cDNA from A. grandis larvae (Agcys 1) was isolated using RT-PCR followed by 5 ’ and 3 ’ RACE techniques.

Cysteine proteinase inhibitors from different sources were assayed against A. grandis proteinases but, unexpectedly, no inhibitor tested was highly effective. Despite none of the inhibitor tested was effective against A. grandis cysteine proteinases, the molecular and biochemical data of Agcys 1 provided a characterization framework of this target enzymes. These data are mostly readily interpreted by proposing a molecular model of Agcys 1, which shares the Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad characteristic of this proteinase family.

The <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> first appeared in Thomasville in 1915, and cotton production began declining rapidly, from a historical high of 2. 8 million bales in 1914 to 600, 000 bales in 1923.

This helped increase yields somewhat, but the industry never really recovered, and overall production continued declining steadily for another 60 years. In 1983 Georgia produced only 112, 000 bales on 115, 000 harvested acres. The active treatment and trapping phase of the eradication program began in 1987 and was completed in 1990. Since then, cotton production has increased dramatically each year. Average yield has increased from 482 pounds per acre in the pre-eradication period (1971 to 1986) to 733 pounds per acre in the post-eradication period (1991 to 1995).

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> (Anthonomus grandis) is {{a serious}} insect-pest in the Americas, {{particularly}} in Brazil. The use of chemical or biological insect control is not effective against the <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> because of its endophytic life style. Therefore, the use of biotechnological tools to produce insect-resistant transgenic plants represents an important strategy to reduce the damage to cotton plants caused by the boll weevil. The present study focuses on the identification of novel molecules that show improved toxicity against the <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil.</b> In vitro directed molecular evolution through DNA shuffling and phage display screening was applied to enhance the insecticidal activity of variants of the Cry 8 Ka 1 protein of Bacillus thuringiensis. Results Bioassays carried out with A. grandis larvae revealed that the LC 50 of the screened mutant Cry 8 Ka 5 toxin was 3. 15 -fold higher than the wild-type Cry 8 Ka 1 toxin. Homology modelling of Cry 8 Ka 1 and the Cry 8 Ka 5 mutant suggested that both proteins retained the typical three-domain Cry family structure. The mutated residues were located mostly in loops and appeared unlikely to interfere with molecular stability. Conclusions The improved toxicity of the Cry 8 Ka 5 mutant obtained in this study will allow the generation of a transgenic cotton event with improved potential to control A. grandis. </p...|$|E

40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an {{important}} agricultural commodity, which is attacked by several pests such as the <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> Anthonomus grandis. Adult A. grandis feed on fruits and leaf petioles, reducing drastically the crop production. The predominance of boll weevil digestive serine proteinases has motivated inhibitor screenings in order to discover new ones with the capability to reduce the digestion process. The present study describes a novel proteinase inhibitor from chickpea seeds (Cicer arietinum L.) and its effects against A. grandis. This inhibitor, named CaTI, was purified by using affinity Red-Sepharose Cl- 6 B chromatography, followed by reversed-phase HPLC (Vydac C 18 -TP). SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analyses, showed a unique monomeric protein with a mass of 12, 877 Da. Purified CaTI showed significant inhibitory activity against larval <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> serine proteinases (78 %) and against bovine pancreatic trypsin (73 %), when analyzed by fluorimetric assays. Although the molecular mass of CaTI corresponded to a-amylase/trypsin bifunctional inhibitors masses, no inhibitory activity against insect and mammalian a-amylases was observed. In order to observe CaTI in vivo effects, an inhibitor rich fraction was added to an artificial diet at different concentrations. At 1. 5 % (w/w), CaTI caused severe development delay, several deformities and a mortality rate of approximately 45 %. These results suggested that CaTI could be useful {{in the production of}} transgenic cotton plants with enhanced resistance toward <b>cotton</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil...</b>|$|E

40|$|Reintroductions of the <b>boll</b> <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, {{into areas}} of the United States {{where it has been}} {{eradicated}} or suppressed are very expensive to mitigate. There is concern that a cotton gin in an eradication zone may serve as a site of <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> reintroductions when processing cotton harvested in a neighboring infested zone. Similarly, there is a question whether weevil-free areas can safely import gin products, such as cottonseed and baled lint, from infested areas without risking an introduction. Many countries require fumigation of imported U. S. cotton bales to protect against <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> introductions, costing the U. S. cotton industry millions of dollars annually. In previously reported experiments, we quantified the potential for <b>boll</b> <b>weevils</b> to survive passage through precleaning machinery in the gin.
