40|$|The <b>closure</b> <b>{{statement}}</b> is {{the basic}} statement when programming with assooons Its execution may revolve a very high degree of concurrency The state of a computation is represented {{as a set of}} assocmns. The <b>closure</b> <b>statement</b> transforms this set into a closure thereof. The defimtmn and the mathematical properUes of these closures are presented Dljkstra's weakest precondmons are used to define the semanUcs of the <b>closure</b> <b>statement</b> In terms of the closure concept The theorems on closures are then translated into theorems on closure statements It is shown, by means of four examples, how these theorems can be used for the construction of correct assocmn programs...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} four stratifications in the {{reduction}} modulo $p$ {{of a general}} Shimura variety are studied: the Newton stratification, the Kottwitz-Rapoport stratification, the Ekedahl-Oort stratification and the Ekedahl-Kottwitz-Oort-Rapoport stratification. We formulate a system of axioms and show that these imply non-emptiness <b>statements</b> and <b>closure</b> relation <b>statements</b> concerning these various stratifications. These axioms are satisfied in the Siegel case. Comment: 19 page...|$|R
5000|$|While {{there are}} reports of this type of {{instrument}} being used in humans, {{it is more likely that}} these were reserved for veterinary use, while the common thumb lancet was the instrument of choice for use in people. A survey of 100 fleams found thumb lancets in 6%. [...] These instruments with their triangular-shaped blades were designed to be placed over the vein (most commonly the jugular or saphenous) and struck with a fleam stick. This would ideally result in a rapid penetration of the vein with minimal risk to the operator and minimal dissection of the subcutaneous tissues. This latter point would have been considered important in minimizing the formation of a dissecting hematoma. Once the desired blood was drained from the patient, the operator would place a pin through the edges of the incision. A figure eight of tail hair or thread would then be placed over the pin to retain <b>closure.</b> <b>Statements</b> from Mayhew in his 1864 treatise would indicate that the perceived benefits of these procedures were coming into great question in the latter half of the 19th century for all conditions except laminitis.|$|R
50|$|On January 2, 2013, owner Matt Vaughan {{announced}} {{the closure of}} Easy Street's Queen Anne store, effective January 18, 2013. Vaughan cited {{a significant increase in}} rent as the primary reason for the <b>closure.</b> In his <b>statement</b> Vaughan added that Chase Bank would be the new tenant. On closing night, Yo La Tengo played to a packed house for the final in-store at the Queen Anne location.|$|R
40|$|A program {{notation}} without variables is proposed. The {{state of}} a computation is recorded {{as a set}} of 2 ̆ 2 associons. 2 ̆ 2 Each associon is a tuple of names representing a relation between the entities with those names. The state of the computation can be changed by the creation of new associons representing new relations deducible from those already recorded. The building block prescribing such deductions is called the 2 ̆ 2 <b>closure</b> <b>statement.</b> 2 ̆ 2 The notation proposed is the result of our search for a basic statement the execution of which may employ more concurrency than is the case for the traditional assignment statement. Some possible extensions to the notation are discussed...|$|E
50|$|The company {{announced}} its <b>closure</b> in a <b>statement</b> on October 23, 2015. All of the company's intellectual property and technology assets were donated to The Reach Trust, an independent public benefit organisation. While initially the organisational changes {{did not affect}} the mobile social network, and users were still able to access and use all its services, in September 2016 it was announced that the service would be closing on 30 September.|$|R
25|$|Ruby {{has been}} {{described}} as a multi-paradigm programming language: it allows procedural programming (defining functions/variables outside classes makes them part of the root, 'self' Object), with object orientation (everything is an object) or functional programming (it has anonymous functions, <b>closures,</b> and continuations; <b>statements</b> all have values, and functions return the last evaluation). It has support for introspection, reflection and metaprogramming, as well as support for interpreter-based threads. Ruby features dynamic typing, and supports parametric polymorphism.|$|R
5000|$|The European Broadcasting Union {{was quick}} to criticise the <b>closure,</b> issuing a <b>statement</b> the same evening where they {{expressed}} [...] "profound dismay on behalf of Europe’s entire public service media" [...] and urged the prime minister to reverse the decision. The EBU made the ERT stream available on satellite to its members, declaring as well that [...] "to be in the EBU, {{you must be a}} broadcaster, and so we will continue keeping ERT on the EBU council" [...] as said by the director, Ingrid Delterne.|$|R
5|$|While {{performing}} a test run prior to the park opening on July 9, 2013, one of the roller coaster trains became stuck {{near the top of}} the lift hill. The train was eventually brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed for more than two months. Kings Dominion later explained the <b>closure</b> through a <b>statement</b> released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem with the weight distribution on the gearbox caused a part to warp and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|R
40|$|Research on VDAC has {{accelerated}} as evidence grows of its importance in mitochondrial function and in apoptosis. New investigators entering {{the field are}} often confounded by the VDAC literature and its many apparent conflicts and contradictions. This review {{is an effort to}} shed light on the situation and identify reliable information from more questionable claims. Our views on the most important controversial issues are as follows: VDAC is only present in the mitochondrial outer membrane. VDAC functions as a monomer. VDAC functions normally with or without Ca 2 +. It does not form channels that mediate the flux of proteins through membranes (peptides and unfolded proteins are excluded from this <b>statement).</b> <b>Closure</b> of VDAC, not VDAC opening, leads to mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis.

40|$|A {{scalable}} algorithm for modeling dynamic fracture and {{fragmentation of}} solids {{in three dimensions}} is presented. The method {{is based on a}} combination of a discon- tinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation of the continuum problem and Cohesive Zone Models (CZM) of fracture. Prior to fracture, the flux and stabilization terms aris- ing from the DG formulation at interelement boundaries are enforced via interface elements, much like in the conventional intrinsic cohesive element approach, albeit in a way that guarantees consistency and stability. Upon the onset of fracture, the traction-separation law (TSL) governing the fracture process becomes operative without the need to insert a new cohesive element. Upon crack <b>closure,</b> the rein- <b>statement</b> of the DG terms guarantee the proper description of compressive waves across closed crack surfaces. The main advantage of the method is that it avoids the need to propagate topo- logical changes in the mesh as cracks and fragments develop, which enables the indistinctive treatment of crack propagation across processor boundaries and, thus, the scalability in parallel computations. Another advantage of the method is that it preserves consistency and stability in the uncracked interfaces, thus avoiding issues with wave propagation typical of intrinsic cohesive element approaches. A simple problem of wave propagation in a bar leading to spall at its center is used to show that the method does not affect wave characteristics and as a consequence properly captures the spall process. We also demonstrate the ability of the method to capture intricate patterns of radial and conical cracks arising in the impact of ceramic plates which propagate in the mesh impassive to the presence of processor boundaries.
