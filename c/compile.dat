5|$|At <b>compile</b> time, the {{interpreter}} parses Perl code into a syntax tree. At run time, it executes {{the program by}} walking the tree. Text is parsed only once, and the syntax tree is subject to optimization before it is executed, so that execution is relatively efficient. Compile-time optimizations on the syntax tree include constant folding and context propagation, but peephole optimization is also performed.|$|E

5|$|Perl has a Turing-complete grammar because parsing can be {{affected}} by run-time code executed during the <b>compile</b> phase. Therefore, Perl cannot be parsed by a straight Lex/Yacc lexer/parser combination. Instead, the interpreter implements its own lexer, which coordinates with a modified GNU bison parser to resolve ambiguities in the language.|$|E
5|$|Python uses duck typing and has {{typed objects}} but untyped {{variable}} names. Type constraints are not checked at <b>compile</b> time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object {{is not of}} a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting {{to make sense of}} them.|$|E
