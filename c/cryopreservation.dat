5|$|In the 1980s, the Conservancy began a {{gene bank}} {{designed}} {{to preserve the}} genetic material of rare breeds. After collecting genetic material from over a dozen rare breeds, the bank {{was transferred to the}} USDA National Animal Germplasm Program (NAGP). It maintains a close relationship with the NAGP, including assisting in the collection of genetic material from additional rare breeds. The conservation list published by the Conservancy is also used by the SVF Foundation, an organization that uses <b>cryopreservation</b> to preserve germplasm from rare breeds. In the early 1990s, the organization mounted displays of historic rare breed livestock illustrations at the National Agricultural Library and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, designed to raise public awareness of the declining populations of rare livestock breeds.|$|E
5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the <b>cryopreservation</b> of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
5|$|Sovereign {{reveals that}} the Reapers remain outside the Milky Way waiting for organic life to develop and {{discover}} the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, with the bomb about to explode, Shepard hears that Ashley and Kaidan have both been pinned down, and must choose which one to rescue. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating their usefulness to the Reapers. Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the Normandy: a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that the Citadel Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the Reapers use to invade the galaxy. During the last extinction cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via <b>cryopreservation</b> and then re-entered the Citadel Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged the Citadel to prevent the Reapers from remotely activating the Citadel Mass Relay. Saren plans to reach the Citadel by using the Conduit to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel Mass Relay and trigger the Reaper invasion.|$|E

25|$|Typically, genetic parents {{donate the}} eggs to a {{fertility}} clinic {{or where they}} are preserved by oocyte <b>cryopreservation</b> or embryo <b>cryopreservation</b> until a carrier is found for them. Typically the process of matching the embryo(s) with the prospective parents is conducted by the agency itself, at which time the clinic transfers ownership of the embryos to the prospective parents.|$|E
25|$|By <b>cryopreservation,</b> eggs, {{sperm and}} {{reproductive}} tissue can be preserved for later IVF.|$|E

25|$|The leech Ozobranchus jantseanus {{has been}} shown to survive for 24 hours at −321°F (−196°C) and for nine months at −130°F (−90°C), a finding that could yield {{insights}} into <b>cryopreservation</b> for humans.|$|E
25|$|Cryobiology as an {{applied science}} is {{primarily}} concerned with low-temperature preservation. Hypothermic storage is typically above 0°C but below normothermic (32°C to 37°C) mammalian temperatures. Storage by <b>cryopreservation,</b> on the other hand, {{will be in the}} 80 to 196°C temperature range. Organs, and tissues are more frequently the objects of hypothermic storage, whereas single cells have been the most common objects cryopreserved.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} single embryo {{transfer}} is highest in Sweden (69.4%), but {{as low as}} 2.8% in the USA. Access to public funding for ART, availability of good <b>cryopreservation</b> facilities, effective education {{about the risks of}} multiple pregnancy, and legislation appear {{to be the most important}} factors for regional usage of single embryo transfer. Also, personal choice plays a significant role as many subfertile couples have a strong preference for twins.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not unusual}} that after the PGD, there are more embryos {{suitable}} for transferring back to the woman than necessary. For the couples undergoing PGD, those embryos are very valuable, as the couple's current cycle may not lead to an ongoing pregnancy. Embryo <b>cryopreservation</b> and later thawing and replacement can give them {{a second chance to}} pregnancy without having to redo the cumbersome and expensive ART and PGD procedures.|$|E
25|$|Embryos who {{reach the}} day 3 cell stage {{can be tested}} for {{chromosomal}} or specific genetic defects prior to possible transfer by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Transferring at the blastocyst stage confers {{a significant increase in}} live birth rate per transfer, but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and embryo <b>cryopreservation,</b> so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer. Transfer day 2 instead of day 3 after fertilization has no differences in live birth rate.|$|E
25|$|For several decades, {{researchers}} have also pursued various forms of suspended animation as {{a means by which}} to indefinitely extend mammalian lifespan. Some scientists have voiced support for the feasibility of the <b>cryopreservation</b> of humans, known as cryonics. Cryonics is predicated on the concept that some people considered clinically dead by today's medicolegal standards are not actually dead according to information-theoretic death and can, in principle, be resuscitated given sufficient technological advances. The goal of current cryonics procedures is tissue vitrification, a technique first used to reversibly cryopreserve a viable whole organ in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Somatic {{cells are}} an {{additional}} resource {{which can be}} retrieved for gene banking, particularly {{in the cases of}} emergency wherein gametes cannot be collected or stored. Tissues can be taken from living animals or shortly after death. These tissues can be saved via <b>cryopreservation</b> or dehydrated. Blood cells can also be useful for DNA analysis such as comparing homozygosity It is recommended by the FAO that two vials of blood be drawn to reduce the chance that all samples will be lost from a particular animal. DNA can be extracted using commercial kits, making this an affordable and accessible strategy for collecting germplasms.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{may choose}} between several methods of {{fertility}} preservation prior to chemotherapy, including <b>cryopreservation</b> of semen, ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos. As {{more than half}} of cancer patients are elderly, this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients. A study in France between 1999 and 2011 came to the result that embryo freezing before administration of gonadotoxic agents to females caused a delay of treatment in 34% of cases, and a live birth in 27% of surviving cases who wanted to become pregnant, with the follow-up time varying between 1 and 13 years.|$|E
25|$|Assisted {{reproductive}} technology (ART) is {{the technology}} used to achieve pregnancy in procedures such as fertility medication, {{in vitro fertilization}} and surrogacy. It is reproductive technology used primarily for infertility treatments, and {{is also known as}} fertility treatment. It mainly belongs to the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and may also include intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and <b>cryopreservation.</b> Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons (preimplantation genetic diagnosis). ART is also used for couples who are discordant for certain communicable diseases; for example, HIV {{to reduce the risk of}} infection when a pregnancy is desired.|$|E
25|$|Cryonics is the {{low-temperature}} {{preservation of}} humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, {{with the hope}} that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future. Cryonics procedures ideally begin within minutes of cardiac arrest, and use cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation during <b>cryopreservation.</b> However, the idea of cryonics also includes preservation of people long after death because of the possibility that brain encoding memory structure and personality may still persist or be inferable in the future. Whether sufficient brain information still exists for cryonics to successfully preserve may be intrinsically unprovable by present knowledge. Therefore, most proponents of cryonics see it as an intervention with prospects for success that vary widely depending on circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The main {{durations}} of {{embryo culture}} are until cleavage stage (day {{two to four}} after co-incubation) or the blastocyst stage (day five or six after co-incubation). Embryo culture until the blastocyst stage confers {{a significant increase in}} live birth rate per embryo transfer, but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and embryo <b>cryopreservation,</b> so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer. Transfer day two instead of day three after fertilisation has no differences in live birth rate. There are significantly higher odds of preterm birth (odds ratio 1.3) and congenital anomalies (odds ratio 1.3) among births having from embryos cultured until the blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage.|$|E
25|$|Cryoconservation {{is limited}} by the cells and tissues that can be frozen and {{successfully}} thawed. Cells and tissues that can be successfully frozen are limited by their surface area. To keep cells and tissues viable, they must be frozen quickly to prevent ice crystal formation. Thus, a large surface area is beneficial. Another limitation is the species being preserved. There have been difficulties using particular methods of cryoconservation with certain species. For example, artificial insemination is more difficult in sheep than cattle, goats, pigs, or horses due to posterior folds in the cervix of ovines. <b>Cryopreservation</b> of embryos is dependent on the species and the stage of development of the embryo. Pig embryos are the most difficult to freeze, thaw, and utilize produce live offspring due to their sensitivity to chilling and high lipid content.|$|E
25|$|Cryoconservation is {{the process}} of {{freezing}} cells and tissues using liquid nitrogen to achieve extreme low temperatures with the intent of using the preserved sample to prevent the loss of genetic diversity. Semen, embryos, oocytes, somatic cells, nuclear DNA, and other types of biomaterial such as blood and serum can be stored using <b>cryopreservation,</b> in order to preserve genetic materials. The primary benefit of cryoconservation is the ability to save germplasms for extended periods of time, therefore maintaining the genetic diversity of a species or breed. There are two common techniques of cryopreservation: slow freezing and vitrification. Slow freezing helps eliminate the risk of intracellular ice crystals. If ice crystals form in the cells, there can be damage or destruction of genetic material. Vitrification {{is the process}} of freezing without the formation of ice crystals.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{is active}} in {{conservation}} and species-preservation efforts. Its Institute for Conservation Research (formerly the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species) raises California condors, giant pandas, tigers, black rhinos, polar bears, orangutans, peninsular pronghorn, desert tortoises, African penguins, mountain yellow-legged frogs, Pacific pocket mice, Francois' langurs, giraffes, quino checkerspot butterflies, Hawaiian crows, light-footed clapper rails, Gray's monitors, tree lobsters, clouded leopards, Galapagos tortoises, Tahiti lorikeets, lion-tailed macaques, mhorr gazelles, gorillas, Przewalski's horses, koalas, burrowing owls, elephants, Tasmanian devils, okapi, southwestern pond turtle, and 145 other endangered species. As a result, they have reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and have conserved habitat at 50 field sites. They also have over 200 conservation scientists working in 35 countries around the world. It employs numerous professional geneticists, cytologists, and veterinarians and maintains a <b>cryopreservation</b> facility for rare sperm and eggs called the frozen zoo.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the use of {{cryoconservation}} to prevent the extinction of a livestock breed is the case of the Hungarian Grey cattle, or Magya Szurke. Hungarian Grey cattle were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of World War II and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970. The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the mechanization of agriculture and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production. The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates. The government program included various conservation strategies, including the <b>cryopreservation</b> of semen and embryos. The Hungarian government's conservation effort brought the population up to 10,310 in 2012, which shows significant improvement using cryoconservation.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of various methods of <b>cryopreservation</b> of bovine embryos improved embryo transfer technique considerably efficient technology, no longer {{depending on the}} immediate readiness of suitable recipients. Pregnancy rates are just slightly less than those achieved with fresh embryos. Recently, the use of cryoprotectants such as ethylene glycol has permitted the direct transfer of bovine embryos. The world's first live crossbred bovine calf produced under tropical conditions by Direct Transfer (DT) of embryo frozen in ethylene glycol freeze media was born on 23 June 1996.Dr.Binoy Sebastian Vettical of Kerala Livestock Development Board Ltd has produced the embryo stored frozen in Ethylene Glycol freeze media by slow programmable freezing (SPF) technique and transferred directly to recipient cattle immediately after thawing the frozen straw in water {{for the birth of}} this calf. In a study, in vivo produced crossbred bovine embryos stored frozen in ethylene glycol freeze media were transferred directly to recipients under tropical conditions and achieved a pregnancy rate of 50 percent. In a survey of the North American embryo transfer industry, embryo transfer success rates from direct transfer of embryos were as good as to those achieved with glycerol. Moreover, in 2011, more than 95% of frozen-thawed embryos were transferred by Direct Transfer.|$|E
25|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{group of}} researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, developed a novel <b>cryopreservation</b> method {{that helps to}} protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, and facilitates real-time assessments of cell viability. The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response. The use of a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet processing procedure prior to transplantation. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy.|$|E
