40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of south china {{electricity}} market, the concept of <b>contract</b> <b>transfer</b> and replacement deal is set forth in advance which is specialized in electricity treatment. Then, the feasibility of conducting an inter-provincial <b>contract</b> <b>transfer</b> and replacement is analyzed according to the aspects of physical characteristics, economics and policies within the china southern power grid. In addition, the advantage and disadvantage are also presented in terms of bilateral negotiation and centralized biding transaction modes. After that, the pricing mechanism and transaction mode are deliberately designed pertaining to three different situations including a party power shortage and a party "abandon water", a party power supply shortage and a party power surplus and a party power surplus and a party "abandon water". Finally, the realistic feasibility of the proposed schemes is verified through an employed numerical example...|$|E

30|$|Certificate chains {{have been}} used in the {{literature}} to support degrees of accountability of authorisation [16]–[18]. The micro-billing scheme [16] uses KeyNote to help determine whether a micro-check (a KeyNote credential, signed by a customer) should be trusted and accepted as payment by a merchant. In [17], delegation credentials are used to manage the transfer of micropayment contracts between public keys; delegation chains provide evidence of <b>contract</b> <b>transfer</b> and ensure accountability for double-spending. The mechanisms that underly these schemes are similar to our service-reselling example in that there can be misinterpretation as to which principal (bank) originates the permission (authority for payment). These systems are also vulnerable to delegation subterfuge (leading to a breakdown in accountability) if care is not taken to properly identify the permissions indicating the payment authorizations when multiple banks and/or provisioning agents are possible.|$|E

Shortly thereafter {{the management of}} Amax closed this R&D facility and the PI moved to the Colorado School of Mines. The project was begun again after <b>contract</b> <b>transfer</b> via a novation agreement. Experimental work began with testing of vandyl pyrophosphate (VPO), a well known alkane selective oxidation catalyst. It was found that VPO was not a selective catalyst for methane conversion yielding primarily CO. However, promotion of VPO with Fe, Cr, and other first row transition metals led to measurable yields for formaldehyde, {{as noted in the}} summary table.

40|$|Recent {{social science}} {{research}} shows that children from as young as 7 are avid users of Social Networking Sites (SNS) such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. The involvement of minor users on SNS platforms raises significant legal challenges, for instance regarding their capacity {{to enter into a}} membership agreement, consenting to share or be tagged in photographs and liability for certain actions. This contribution aims to identify relevant legal issues related to SNS use by (young) children and to assess the applicability of existing legal frameworks at European and national level with regard to the capacity to <b>contract,</b> <b>transfer</b> of intellectual property rights, right to image, and the liability of children and parents for certain breaches of legislative provisions or acts that cause damage. The second part contains an exploration of user empowerment mechanisms {{such as the use of}} innovative information provision tools or awareness-raising to achieve better informed decision-making by children (and parents) with regard to their SNS use. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Propagation-based X-ray phase {{contrast}} enables nanoscale imaging of biological tissue by probing {{not only the}} attenuation, but also the real part of the refractive index of the sample. Since only intensities of diffracted waves can be measured, the main mathematical challenge consists in a phase-retrieval problem in the near-field regime. We treat an often used linearized version of this problem known as <b>contract</b> <b>transfer</b> function model. Surprisingly, this inverse problem {{turns out to be}} well-posed assuming only a compact support of the imaged object. Moreover, we establish bounds on the Lipschitz stability constant. In general this constant grows exponentially with the Fresnel number of the imaging setup. However, both for homogeneous objects, characterized by a fixed ratio of the induced refractive phase shifts and attenuation, {{and in the case of}} measurements at two distances, a much more favorable algebraic dependence on the Fresnel number can be shown. In some cases we establish order optimality of our estimates.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of transaction costs prompts higher requirements {{and results in}} split of resources and production for an enterprise. However, {{in the process of}} globalisation, when trade barriers are falling down, transaction costs are becoming an increasingly important issue. Transaction costs are connected with searching and upholding reliable business partners, negotiation, formation of the contract and its control. For evaluation the negative factors of the economic decline, it is discussed whether it is worth joining in associations and making different procurement transactions during this period of the economic decline. Most companies in this period concentrate their effort on survival, but not on development, so business initiative obviously shrinks during such economic periods. What is more, it is significantly limited by increasing costs for credits and low liquidity of the stock markets. That is why transaction costs emerge because of the formal trade barriers such as import restrictions and tariffs. Transaction costs are inevitable as well as transport costs, and they take the significant part of all costs of any <b>contract.</b> <b>Transfer</b> costs economics, which previously was mostly used for the evaluation of outsourcing decision processes, now is considered to be an applicable theoretical background for outsourcing decisions...|$|E

In eggs obtained from mutant females (af eggs), polar body formation and cytokinesis are completely inhibited while nuclear division continues uninterrupted.

The factor responsible for contraction promoting activity was present in wild-type eggs throughout the first cell division cycle and induced contraction in a dose dependent manner. The factor was characterized as a high molecular weight protein complex that was associated with particulate fraction in the extract. The recovery of contraction was associated with accumulation of filamentous actin and WGA-binding sites within the cleavage furrow of the af eggs which were normally not enriched for these components. Formation and contraction of a filamentous actin ring during cortical wound healing in af eggs was indistinguishable from that of wild-type eggs. From these results, the af gene product may be specifically required for reorganization of the actin filaments and WGA-binding sites in the cleavage furrow and contraction through these structures during cytokinesis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of performance appraisal on improving teacher’s job performance systems on teacher’s performance in the public schools. It specifically assesses the teacher’s evaluation and perception on performance appraisal system, knowledge of teachers on performance appraisal system and performance appraisal management that leads to effective teachers’ performance in public primary and secondary schools. This study was used descriptive design in analyzing data from the findings in multiple units of enquiry, also qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in data presentation. Questionnaires, interviews and documentation were the main methods of data collection in which 120 respondents were asked from primary and secondary schools as well as supervisors. Moreover, the data collected were analyzed and processed by using computer software known as Statistical Packages for Social Science (SPSS. V. 16. 0) {{and the results were}} indicated clearly on tables and figures. The study assessed and PA for teacher’s and the results revealed that OPRAS implementation at schools is not effective and not very well utilized by the supervisors. The majority of the teachers mentioned that they were not received feedback about (90. 0 %) were not aware of PA and they lack knowledge of OPRAS in their school organizations. They were not involved in discussing individual performance objectives with supervisors, the evidence was shown from the results that about (54. 5 %) and they were not given enough time to prepare for the meeting as a result, The current OPRAS system is not used by the government authority for making official decision such as demotion, termination of <b>contract,</b> <b>transfer</b> and promotion in this the response of the respondents is about (86. 2 %).
