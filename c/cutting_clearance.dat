It reviews the result between mechanical and hydraulic presses and between SPCC (Cold rolled material) and SPHC (Hot rolled material) which are commonly used in automotive industry. The chosen of these two materials are because of its high usage in automotive industries in Malaysia. SPCC is most popular because of its attractive surface finished. It is suitable for bending and simple drawing operations. For SPHC, suitable mainly for flat sheets or simple bending operations and simple drawing operations are also possible...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{patented}} {{and transferred}} to industry an abrasive-enhanced water-jet rock drill. This drill incorporates three novel components: a collimator, jet deflectors for <b>cutting</b> <b>clearance,</b> and an unpressurized swivel, which rotates at 1, 000 rpm while passing 20 gpm of an abrasive slurry flowing at 1, 000 ft/s. Drilling occurs through the action of a 10, 000 -psi, 2 O-gpm water jet into which is entrained 72 lb/min of abrasives. The pumps, hoses, and fittings are those commonly used in the water-jet-cleaning industry. Only inexpensive, common sandblasting abrasives are used. This drill can cut through hard rocks with moderate-pressure jets; e. g., rocks with a compressive strength of 73, 000 psi can be drilled with a 1 O,OOO-psi abrasive jet. In addition to drilling holes, the drill can cut deep, narrow kerfs; collar a hole at any angle; drill through rubble; and chamber holes. The development of the abrasive jet drill is a significant advance {{in the state of}} the art of hard-rock drilling. The Government of the United States has licensed the abrasive jet drill patent to Weatherford Water Jetting Systems...|$|E

50|$|The {{second type}} of cold saw blade, {{tungsten}} carbide-tipped (TCT), are made with an alloy steel body and tungsten carbide inserts brazed to {{the tips of the}} teeth. These tips are ground on all surfaces to create tangential and radial clearance and provide the proper <b>cutting</b> and <b>clearance</b> angles on the teeth. The alloy body is generally made from a wear-resistant material such as a chrome vanadium steel, heat treated to 38/42 HRC. The tungsten carbide tips are capable of operating at much higher temperatures than solid HSS, therefore, TCT saw blades are usually run at much higher surface speeds. This allows carbide-tipped blades to cut at faster rates and still maintain an acceptable chip load per tooth. These blades are commonly used for cutting non-ferrous alloys, but have gained significant popularity for ferrous metal cutting applications in the last 10 years. The tungsten carbide inserts are extremely hard (98 HRC) and capable of very long wear life. However, they are less resistant to shock than solid HSS cold saw blades. Any vibration during the cutting process may severely damage the teeth. These cold saw blades need to be driven by a backlash free gear box and a constant feed mechanism like a ball-screw feed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Extremely high {{strength}} of the ultra-high-strength steels leads to increased load factors on the sheet metal machinery and punching tools. This experimental study examines how much the convex punch geometry affects on cutting forces when punching ultra-high-strength steels. Tools used in the punching tests were four different convex sheared rooftop punches and one conventional flat end punch, which rooftop punches were compared to. The material in the punching tests was ultra-high-strength steel DQ 960, with a thickness of 4 mm. The material in punching tests was sheared with rooftop punches and a flat end punch and the cutting forces were measured. The quality of punched holes was evaluated visually and the roundness measurements were also performed. The {{results show that the}} cutting forces of DQ 960 can be reduced radically with optimal convex punch geometry. Using 14 ° shear angle at the punch end, the cutting forces reduced up to 57 % compared to the ones of the conventional flat end tool. However, the largest tested shear angles caused several negative effects on the cutting quality of the holes and hence they are not suitable in all applications. The punching tests proved that the <b>cutting</b> <b>clearance</b> had no appreciable effect on cutting forces when ultra-high-strength steel was punched. Instead there was a noticeable effect {{on the quality of the}} punched hole, especially when large shear angles were used...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{usage of}} high-strength-steels {{allows for the}} {{reduction}} of a component's weight by reducing the sheet thickness. During the production process of such components, shear cutting is commonly used for the initial cutting process. One of the main challenges in the production process is imposed by the shearing operation, which yields high tensile loads on the parts’ edges. During the subsequent forming process, edge-cracks occur and therefore limit the forming potential of these materials. Studies at our institute focus on developing a new measuring method to investigate the formation of edge-cracks. This procedure called, an edge-fracture-tensile-test, helps to identify relevant parameters of the shearing process to avoid edge-cracks. The sample geometry resembles the shape of tensile-test-samples. The following test parameters can then be varied: die <b>clearance,</b> <b>cutting</b> edge geometry, and open or closed cutting line. The results show {{it is possible to}} influence the formability of cut edges by varying the process parameters...|$|R
40|$|The cut-edge {{characteristic}} properties of automotive structures formed during the mechanical blanking and laser-cutting processes significantly influence fatigue life performance. This factor {{is becoming increasingly}} important as S 355 MC and DP 600 high strength steels (HSS) grades under investigation exhibit an increased sensitivity to fatigue cracks initiating from cut-edge regions. It was determined that by manipulating the critical <b>cutting</b> process parameters, <b>clearance</b> in terms of mechanical blanking, and by controlling the interrelationship between power and traverse cutting speed during the laser cutting process can result in optimised fatigue lives being achieved. Optimal fatigue lives were attained by minimising the cut-edge surface damage and by controlling the near edge microstructural deformations during each cutting process. It is the critical significance of fatigue which is the limiting factor towards being able to effectively downgauge steel grades used as automotive chassis and suspension components. This research {{is some of the}} first that considers the influence of mechanical and laser cut-edge surface quality and internal properties, which has then been partnered to the critical fatigue performance of HSS grades.

40|$|Zimbabwe, {{like any}} other country in Sub-Saharan Africa, is {{experiencing}} deforestation and environmental degradation at a rate which is believed to be not sustainable. Renewable and non- renewable natural resources are being depleted faster than they could be replaced. At the centre of the debate on deforestation are rural communities, who, as part of their livelihoods, depend on forest natural resources. This research is about understanding peasant behaviour around deforestation. The researcher carried out observations and took photographs in order to augment in-depth and key informant interviews. For findings, the study shows that: the farmers in ward six are engaging in various practices in forest use that include land <b>clearance,</b> <b>cutting</b> down of trees for fire wood for sale,domestic use and tobacco production, clearing forests for hunting using fire. They also graze their livestock in the forests. There are two models of farmers, the A 1 and A 2 and both engage in these practices albeit with different zeal but the same outcomes. Deforestation and degradation are a cause for concern. Policies in forest management come from the top, and traditional leaders are side lined in the formulation of policies and are thus reduced to mere implementers of state laws. If developmental interventions are to work, they should incorporate indigenous knowledge systems and decentralise decision-making to the local levels...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in commercializing functional nanostructured devices heightens {{the need for}} cost-effective manufacturing approaches for nanostructures. This paper presents an investigation of a scale-up manufacturing approach for nanostructures through diamond turning using a nanoscale multi-tip diamond tool (four tip tool with tip width of 150 nm) fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB). The manufacturing capacity of this new technique is evaluated {{through a series of}} cutting trials on copper substrates under different cutting conditions (depth of cut 100 – 500 nm, spindle speed 12 – 120 rpm). The machined surface roughness and nanostructure patterns are measured by using a white light interferometer and a scanning electron microscope, respectively. Results show that the form accuracy and integrity of the machined nanostructures were degraded with the increase of the depth of cut and the cutting speed. The burr and the structure damage are two major machining defects. High precision nano-grooves (form error of bottom width < 6. 7 %) was achieved when a small depth of cut of 100 nm was used (spindle speed[*]=[*] 12 rpm). Initial tool wear was found at both the <b>clearance</b> <b>cutting</b> edge and the side edges of tool tips after a cutting distance of 2. 5 km. Moreover, the nanometric cutting process was emulated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The research findings obtained from MD simulation reveal the underlying mechanism for machining defects and the initialization of tool wear observed in experiments...|$|R
40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming cutting {{technologies}} {{are the most important}} procedures, because every single component has to be cut minimum once. Increasing standards in terms of safety and crash performance in the automotive industries leads to material toughness as well as more complex part geometries. Most of these parts are made by press-hardening. As a pre-process a new and innovative contact heating devise were developed. To post-process this ultra high strength steels (UHSS) common shear cutting technologies, like shearing or fine blanking, are not suitable any more. Production processes by laser trimming are still state of the art in this field of industries. But this is suboptimal in terms of time-, material- and energy-efficiency. Substitution of these laser procedures by economical cutting technologies is essential more than ever. The innovative High Speed Impact Cutting (HSIC), with cutting velocities up to 10 m/s, could be an alternative to process these UHSS. Advantages of the HSIC are the fine grained cutting surface, which can be directly used as a function surface and the oil free cut. Detailed pre-investigations to process UHSS by HSIC were made. It is shown how process parameters like die <b>clearance,</b> <b>cutting</b> velocity, suitable tool materials and design are determined. Based on this knowledge, the applicability of HSIC of directly, inline press-hardened materials is shown {{with the help of a}} crash relevant serial component of a car B-pillar. Next to an improved cutting quality, a significant shortened process time were indicated by using the new HSIC technology and machinery (laser process time: 1 : 20 min vs: HSIC process time: 20 ms) [1]. It is scientifically shown how it is possible to reach a significant increase in productivity by developing and using innovative contact heating and cutting technologies. This leads to huge saving effects in terms of energy, time as well as material...|$|R
