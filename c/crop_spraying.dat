5|$|Commercial {{operations}} are remunerated activities which {{fall within the}} ICAO definition of CAT. Some are, however, closely aligned to, and considered part of, the GA sector. Public transport {{operations are}} non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than airline travel. Air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include business jets, helicopters, and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people. An example {{of this type of}} operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British Formula One grand prix at Silverstone. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world's busiest airport. Aerial work is a small but important component of the commercial GA sector, characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non-transport activities, such as surveying, <b>crop</b> <b>spraying,</b> and emergency services work (air ambulance and police).|$|E

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} influence of four commercially available film-forming polymers (Bond [alkyl phenyl hydroxyl polyoxyethylene], Newman <b>Crop</b> <b>Spray</b> 11 E™ [paraffinic oil], Nu-Film P [poly- 1 -p menthene], and Spray Gard [di- 1 -p menthene]) on reducing salt spray injury on two woody species, evergreen oak (Quercus ilex L.) and laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.). Irrespective of species, the film-forming polymers Nu-Film-P and Spay Gard did not provide any significant degree of protection against salt spray damage irrespective of concentration (1 % or 2 %) applied as measured by leaf chlorophyll concentrations, photosynthetic efficiency, visual leaf necrosis, foliar sodium and chloride content, and growth (height, leaf area). The film-forming polymer Newman <b>Crop</b> <b>Spray</b> 11 E™ provided only 1 -week protection against salt spray injury. The film-forming polymer Bond provided a significant (P < 0. 05) degree of protection against salt spray injury 3 months after application as manifest by higher leaf chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, height and leaf area, and lower visual leaf necrosis and foliar Na and Cl content compared with nontreated controls. In conclusion, results indicate that application of a suitable film-forming polymer can provide a significant degree of protection of up to 3 months against salt spray injury in evergreen oak and laurel. Results also indicate that when applied at 1 % or 2 % solutions, no problems associated with phytotoxicity and rapid degradation on the leaf surface exist...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Pest {{and disease}} control in {{vineyards}} and orchards {{is a key}} feature for obtaining healthy and economically efficient <b>crops,</b> <b>spraying</b> equipments being widely used for plant protection. The technical performance of the spraying equipment has a significant effect over the efficiency indices of the plant protection methods: specific consumption of chemical solution, working capacity of the spraying units, fuel consumption, homogeneity of distribution over the entire foliage system etc. In this paper a new design of the vineyard spraying equipment was investigated, aiming for the partial recovery of the chemical solution, which otherwise would be lost; thus the consumption of chemical substance was decreased. The sprayer was equipped with recovery panels, mounted sideways, in order to retain the liquid droplets which would otherwise pass through the foliar system. he above-mentioned system can be mounted on different types of universal vineyard spraying machines. The laboratory tests confirmed that the consumption of liquid substance was significantly reduced, while the working parameters of the spraying equipment were not affected...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{importance}} of phenoxy herbicides (hormone herbicides) in Scottish Agriculture with specific reference to the spring barley crop, the most important cereal crop in Scotland. In 2013 the agricultural census figures showed that to 296, 000 hectares of spring barley were planted in 2013. Of this area pesticide usage surveys estimate that 72 % of the spring barley <b>crop</b> was <b>sprayed</b> with a metsulfuron-methyl, (sulfonylurea/ALS inhibitor), the most common sulfonylurea in Scotland in 2012. There was a similar area of <b>crop</b> <b>sprayed</b> with a phenoxy herbicide, a figure that has remained fairly constant over the last 10 years. The phenoxy herbicides are important as standalone products {{but they also have}} an important use in resistance management of the sulfonylurea herbicide group. Sulfonylureas are the foundation of herbicide use in the spring barley crop in Scotland. The use of phenoxy herbicides in spring barley has not prevented the development of resistant to the sulfonylureas in the Stellaria media (common chickweed) population in the Scottish spring barley crop. Sulfonylurea resistant chickweed is not confined to the spring barley crop but is a problem in other crops in Scotland such as potatoes and maize where sulfonylureas are used. Resistance to the sulfonylurea group of herbicides {{has been shown to be}} target site occurring as result of a single mutation. The multi site mode of action of the phenoxy herbicides are useful anti-resistance options with the sulfonylureas offering control of sulfonylurea resistant Stellaria media. The phenoxy herbicides are also particularly useful in increasing the weed spectrum of the sulfonylureas and the use to control difficult weeds such as Fumaria officinalis (common fumitory) in spring barley crop...|$|R

40|$|One to two ppm of Pyronyl <b>Crop</b> <b>Spray</b> (Pyronyl) {{effectively}} controlled larvae of the Asian {{tiger mosquito}} Aedes albopictus (Skuse). The mean LT 99 was 35. 8 hrs for 1. 0 ppm and 2. 3 hrs for 2. 0 ppm Pyronyl. Pyronyl concentrations of 0, 0. 062, 0. 125 and 0. 25 ppm resulted in similar {{time to the}} LT 99 (greater than 200 hrs). Pyronyl mixed in the nutrient solution at 1. 25, 2. 5 and 5. 0 ppm did not reduce the mean head weight of lettuce grown in the nutrient solution for 5 weeks. Pyronyl at these concentrations did not affect root weight at 1. 25 and 2. 5 ppm, but a slight reduction in root weight was observed at 5. 0 ppm. Based on these results, Pyronyl is an effective compound for commercial non-circulating hydroponic lettuce growers to use against A. albopictus. Growers typically add approximately 4. 0 L of nutrient solution per plant, utilizing this approximation, 1. 0 ml of Pyronyl solution per 125 plants would provide A. albopicuts control...|$|R
40|$|Canopy {{characteristics}} and their variation at all growth stages, {{together with the}} spatial distribution of plants in the field {{need to be considered}} in determining the application volume rate in fruit <b>crops.</b> <b>Spray</b> volume calculation in a vineyard needs to take into account concepts such as tree row volume (TRV), leaf wall area (LWA) and leaf area index (LAI). The objective of this work was to develop one protocol to characterize the canopy geometry of grapevine to determine BBCH stages using data sets measured manually and with LIDAR scanning. With this aim, a package called PROcess TO LIdar Data v. 0. 1 (PROTOLIDAR) was created in R environment to process the LIDAR scan information. Results showed a significant correlation between LIDAR impacts and LAI at each growth stage. The relationship between the estimated values of TRV or LWA, and the growth stage of the vine was statistically significant (R 2 = 0. 99 and R 2 = 0. 95, respectively).
