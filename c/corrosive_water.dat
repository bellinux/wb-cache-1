The deposits investigated include those of a porous, friable sedimentary nature, grey-coloured calcitic marble and a white-coloured crystalline deposit.

Recently, increased sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidification (OA) due to increased levels of {{carbon dioxide in the}} seawater have been described as selective agents that may affect the biological processes underlying shell formation in calcifying marine organisms. The benthic snail Concholepas concholepas (Muricidae) is widely distributed along the Chilean coast, and so is naturally exposed to a strong physical-chemical latitudinal gradient. In this study, based on elliptical Fourier analysis, we assess changes in shell morphology (outlines analysis) in juvenile C. concholepas collected at northern (23 °S), central (33 °S) and southern (39 °S) locations off the Chilean coast. Shell morphology of individuals collected in northern and central regions correspond to extreme morphotypes, which is in agreement with both the observed regional differences in the shell apex outlines, the high reclassification success of individuals (discriminant function analysis) collected in these regions, and the scaling relationship in shell weight variability among regions. However, these extreme morphotypes showed similar patterns of mineralization of calcium carbonate forms (calcite and aragonite). Geographical variability in shell shape of C. concholepas described by discriminant functions was partially explained by environmental variables (pCO 2, SST). This suggests the influence of <b>corrosive</b> <b>waters,</b> such as upwelling and freshwaters penetrating into the coastal ocean, upon spatial variation in shell morphology.

Here, we used a natural gradient in calcium carbonate saturation, caused by shallow-water CO 2 seeps in the Mediterranean Sea, to assess whether seaweed that is resistant to acidification (Padina pavonica) could prevent adverse effects of acidification on epiphytic foraminifera.

It is expected that ocean acidification will result in changes in foraminiferal assemblage composition and agglutinated forms may become more prevalent.

Sets with four rigs operated under different flow regimes (high, low, variable, stagnant) were installed in two locations (chemically treated surface water and groundwater) of a drinking water supply networks, and weight loss of the iron coupons was monitor over the period of one year. During the initial phase of corrosion (about 200 days), {{the results showed that}} in water which can be considered more corrosive (undersaturated in respect to calcium carbonate, high sulphate concentration) the corrosion rate of iron increased by 20 - 50 % at low or variable flow regimes compared to at high flow rate. The chemical water quality was less important for the overall corrosion of iron coupons at high flow rate, however, it was very important for the occurrence of pitting and localized corrosion. Pitting of iron surface occurred in the more <b>corrosive</b> <b>water.</b> The influence of natural organic matter (NOM) on the corrosion of iron was studied in batch experiments by measuring the weight loss of coupons after three weeks of exposure to water containing similar concentrations but different types of NOM. The results showed that the composition of NOM affected the corrosion rate of iron pipes. Nonhumic hydrophilic NOM fractions were more corrosive than humic substances towards iron pipes at stagnant conditions. Comparing to copper pipes, iron were more affected by the type of NOM. The study allowed us to conclude that high corrosion rate and corrosion problems (new or aggressively cleaned old pipes) are more likely to occur in service pipes (low or variable flow rate) supplied with water containing high level of NOM composed of non-humic compounds.

40|$|Ideally, {{networks}} of marine protected areas {{should be designed}} with consideration for future changes. We examine how this could be tackled using the example of cold-water coral reefs which provide a number of ecosystem services but are vulnerable to both managed pressures (e. g. deep-water trawling) and unmanaged pressures (e. g. ocean acidification). We collated data on the known and predicted distribution of Northeast Atlantic coral reefs, their protected areas, and fishing effort. We modelled the effects of ocean acidification on aragonite saturation to examine whether existing protected areas will ensure adequate protection for cold-water coral reefs under four possible future scenarios across two models. The best-case scenario suggests only minor impacts of ocean acidification, and that trawling remains the main threat to these reefs. However, in the worst-case scenario, by 2060, over 85 % of these reefs {{are expected to be}} exposed to <b>corrosive</b> <b>waters.</b> We argue that unmanaged pressures such as ocean acidification and global warming should be incorporated into marine management decisions, with a focus on the protection of cold-water coral reefs to ensure long-term survival of these habitats.

40|$|Coralline algae are {{expected}} to be adversely impacted by global warming and ocean acidification, although there has been no synthesis of these effects on habitat-forming species. We compiled published responses of maërl and rhodolith-forming species to ocean acidification and warming. Although the response is variable among species, their recruitment, growth, health and survival are usually negatively affected under elevated CO 2. Most studies show that coralline algal calcification is adversely affected under near-future ocean acidification scenarios and that in combination with a 1 – 3 °C increase in seawater temperature this has an even larger impact. Most research has involved relatively short-term experiments on single species, which makes it difficult to predict long-term effects at the ecosystem level because the impact of global changes on coralline algal habitats will depend on the direct impacts on individual species and the indirect effects of altered interspecific interactions. Studies in areas with naturally high CO 2 levels show that coralline algae are adversely affected by long-term acidification through increased competition from non-calcified competitors. Coralline algal habitats such as vermetid reefs, coralligene and beds of rhodoliths or maerl are likely to decline in the near future as higher CO 2 levels benefit fleshy algae and <b>corrosive</b> <b>waters</b> reduce calcareous habitat complexity and associated biodiversity...|$|R
