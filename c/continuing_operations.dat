5|$|Mölders {{and members}} of JG 53 {{spent a couple of}} weeks of R skiing in the Vorarlberg before <b>continuing</b> <b>operations</b> against the RAF over the Channel and {{occupied}} France during early 1941. His new wingman from January 1941 was Oberleutnant Hartmann Grasser. Mölders claimed his first aerial victory after the lengthy vacation on 10 February 1941; his tally reached 60 on 26 February and stood at 68 when the Geschwader was recalled from the Channel front. His logbook showed 238 combat missions plus an additional 71 reconnaissance flights; he had engaged in aerial combat 70 times.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The <b>continuing</b> <b>operations</b> of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting that sales were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E

25|$|Julian won {{victories}} against Germans who {{had invaded}} Gaul. He launched an expensive {{campaign against the}} Persians, which ended in defeat and his own death. He succeeded in marching to the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, but lacked adequate supplies for an assault. He burned his boats and supplies to show resolve in <b>continuing</b> <b>operations,</b> but the Sassanids began a war of attrition by burning crops. Finding himself cut off in enemy territory, he began a land retreat during which he was mortally wounded. His successor Jovian, acclaimed by a demoralized army, began his brief reign (363–364) trapped in Mesopotamia without supplies. To purchase safe passage home, he had to concede areas of northern Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, including the strategically important fortress of Nisibis, which had been Roman since before the Peace of Nisibis in 299.|$|E
500|$|In 1954 the Hilton Hotels Corporation assumed {{management}} of the hotel and bought the property at a discount from its construction costs in 1955 but also struggled to find a profitable model for the huge facility, later shown to be isolated from both downtown Houston and its growing system of freeways. Moreover the Shamrock was overwhelmed by competition from many much smaller, cheaper and automobile-friendly motels. A low two-story [...] "lanai" [...] wing {{in the form of}} a motel was added next to the swimming pool in 1957. Meanwhile affluent suburban home buyers bypassed the area and the planned shopping and entertainment center was never built (although McCarthy's concept influenced the successful Houston Galleria which opened near an intersection of freeways on the city's west side in 1970). In about 1965 the first Trader Vic's restaurant in Texas was launched at the Shamrock where it did business until after 1985. The hotel remained popular for Houston social events such as debutante balls, barbecues and business meetings, <b>continuing</b> <b>operations</b> as the Shamrock Hilton until 1986, by which time even its local reputation had long since faded.|$|E

The FER–Japanese talks resumed on 10 July, five days later the Gongota Agreement of 1920 was signed. Japanese withdrawal from Transbaikal, deprived the Whites from much needed support.|$|E
