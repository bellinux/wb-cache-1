60|$|The poor fictionist very {{frequently}} finds himself {{to have been}} wrong in his description of things in general, and is told so, roughly by the critics, and tenderly by the friends of his bosom. He is moved to tell of things of which he omits to learn the nature before he tells of them--as should be done by a strictly honest fictionist. He catches salmon in October; or shoots his partridges in March. His dahlias bloom in June, and his birds sing in the autumn. He opens the opera-houses before Easter, and makes Parliament sit on a Wednesday evening. And then those terrible meshes of the Law! How is a fictionist, in these excited days, to create the needed biting interest without legal difficulties; and how again is he to steer his little bark clear of so many rocks,--when the rocks and the shoals have been purposely arranged to make the taking of a pilot on board a necessity? As to those law meshes, a benevolent pilot will, indeed, now and again give a poor fictionist a helping hand,--not used, however, generally, with much discretion. But from whom is any assistance {{to come in the}} august matter of a <b>Cabinet</b> <b>assembly?</b> There can be no such assistance. No man can tell aught but they who will tell nothing. But then, again, there is this safety, that let the story be ever so mistold,--let the fiction be ever so far removed from the truth, no critic short of a Cabinet Minister himself can convict the narrator of error.|$|E

50|$|Lock mitred, {{monocoque}} construction is an intricate woodworking method {{in which a}} zigzag pattern is cut into the ends of panels so they provide substantially more surface area on each joining piece and in turn have more area to grip and physically lock together in a much stronger fashion. They are finally glued together at a 90-degree angle, making the Totem cabinet up to 5 times stiffer than conventional <b>cabinet</b> <b>assembly.</b> The medium density fiberboard (MDF) used is a unique recipe with a density of 90% on the exterior speaker side and 65% towards the interior. The denser extremities increase strength and help maintain shape whereas the less dense interior is acoustically preferred. One the cabinet is built, both the exterior and interior are veneered, an expensive step that’s invisible to the consumer so every other company doesn’t bother but it increases cabinet strength so it’s almost invulnerable to warping, maintaining its acoustic and cosmetic integrity for literally decades.|$|E

50|$|Assemblies {{are elected}} for a {{four-year}} term during nationwide local elections. Similar to nationwide elections for Sejm members, councillors for provincial assemblies are elected from party lists using proportional representation within a five percent voting threshold {{for each individual}} voivodeship.

40|$|In typical {{household}} refrigeration systems, {{the compressor}} is structurally {{connected to the}} <b>cabinet</b> through an <b>assembly</b> composed of rubber mounts and a steel support plate, usually called base-plate. This plate works as a vibration energy path from the compressor to other refrigerator components, and its dynamic behavior must be known {{in order to avoid}} the coincidence of resonances and operational frequencies, a situation in which the energy flow is maximized. One way to design a support that satisfies this requirement is to optimize the shape of the plate, locating its structural modes as far as possible from the operational frequency and first harmonics. In this work, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to solve the eigenvalue problem and to parameterize the optimization procedure, which is based on positioning of the nodes of a design region (the plate) in a FEM simplified model. Due to the large number of variables, a gradient-based method is adopted. The objective of the methodology is to maximize the difference between two adjacent eigenvalues near the fundamental operation frequency of the compressor, in order to obtain a large and effective bandgap. A geometrical constraint is imposed to the problem and it is represented by a maximum allowed deformation of the plate. The gradients needed are obtained using elementary stiffness and mass matrices information. The obtained results show that the procedure leads to a new shape which ensures the desired dynamic characteristics for the support plate...|$|R

It also grants every Guyanese citizen the right to work, to obtain a free education and free medical care, and to own personal property; it also guarantees equal pay for women.

40|$|There is {{consensus}} in Turkey that the archiving studies {{started in the}} second half of the XIXth century. The historical signs of these studies go back to beginning of the XVth century. It is seen that there is necessity for modern archiving since the documents preserved in sealed sacks and chests in rolls has died out because of negligence and bad conditions. These studies had been continued only with a view to preservation-protection with various attempts until the declaration of Turkish Republic. In this period; the most important attempt in Turkish archiving was founding Hazine-i Evrak in 1846 and collecting the governmental documents there. In Turkish Republic period; the Turkish National Assembly protected the documents of Bab-ı Ali Hazine-i Evrakı, important ministries and institutions after the abolition of Ottoman Sultanate on November 1, 1922. On March 1, 1923, “Mahzen-i Evrak Mümeyyizliği”, which was attached to the Office of the Executive Assistant of Turkish National <b>Assembly</b> <b>Cabinet</b> of Government Ministers, was founded. This situation formed the core of today’s General Directorate of State Archives. The documents taken over from the Ottoman Empire and the documents produced by the institutions of Turkish Republic had been passed through various cleaning and destruction methods until 1931. The most important one of this is; the sale of nearly 1, 5 million documents, most of which belonging to the Ministry of Finance, 30 - 50 tons in weight, to Bulgaria in May 1931 and the developments after this event. This event was experienced due to “negligence and indifference” and “deficiency of regulations” which had caused loss of many documents before. After this distressing event, legal precautions for not destructing of the state documents were taken, but the private archives were not included in the frame of these precautions. In order not to experience such events, controlling important – unimportant governmental documents of private persons and institutions and taking necessary legal precautions for using them against to the government are necessary. In this study, suggestions about these precautions will be presented and evaluations on the subject will be made...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M.

The greatest challenge of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) {{continues to be the}} need to build a life for its people free from poverty, diseases, human rights abuses, gender inequality and environmental degradation. Gender activists played a lead role in innuencing the development and adoption, on the 17 August 2008. of the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development. In 2005, they undertook comprehensive regional research on sector-specific gender equality issues and gaps. Following the adoption of the SADC Gender and Development Protocol, gender activists came together between 2005 and 2008 to form cross-border and national alliances to undertake a campaign to inl 1 uence the content of the Protocol, as well as lobby for its adoption. The adoption of the Gender and Development Protocol is one of the fastest in SADC Protocol history. This study is an evaluation of the SADC Gender and Development Protocol. focusing on gender eq uality, women's empowerment and the reduction of gender based violence in South Africa. The protocol has a direct bearing on all its signatories in both the "developed" and ''developing'' countries within the SADC region. Furthermore, this research focused only on South Africa, one SADC country, in order to evaluate the progress made since the adoption of the Protocol in 2008. The most salient progress has been made with regards to women's representation and participation in state and political governance. Target-setting within the structures of the Protocol greatly contributed to appointment and promotion of women into leadership and decision-making positions. The target of 50 % representation of women has already been achieved in <b>Cabinet,</b> the National <b>Assembly,</b> Provincial Premiers, Provincial Council of Provinces and Provincial Legislatures. Policies. strategies and plans have been put in place to address gender based violence. Despite legislative reform, trends continue to indicate that in South Africa there is still a gender division of labour. Fear of gender-based violence on the one hand. and real life experiences of gender-based violence continue to be deterring factors that keep women from progressing and advancing in the workplace, in schools and institutions of learning in business and in governance.
