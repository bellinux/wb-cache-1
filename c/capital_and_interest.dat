5|$|Following the {{takeover}} of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout {{was approved by the}} council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc.. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If the new stadium is built, Anfield would be demolished. The land would become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would include a hotel, restaurants, and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' <b>capital,</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> rates were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian {{theory of}} <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> was first {{developed}} by Eugen Böhm von Bawerk. He stated that {{interest rates and}} profits are determined by two factors, namely, supply and demand {{in the market for}} final goods and time preference.|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} effect that the process of <b>capital</b> {{controls}} lifting <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> rate deregulation have brought about on growth in the EU- 15 over the period 1960 - 2001.

These financial liberalization measures affect growth even after controlling for other growth policies and they are robust to business cycle effects that could spuriously drive the relation. Some tentative evidence indicates that the liberalization of <b>capital</b> controls <b>and</b> the deregulation of interest rates have effected growth through the increase in the efficiency of financial intermediation. ...|$|R

Book III (part of the second volume), Value and Price, developed Menger's ideas of marginal utility outlined in his Principles of Economics, to develop the idea of subjective value as related to marginalism, in that things only have value insofar as such people want such goods. To illustrate the principle, Böhm-Bawerk used a practical example of a farmer who was left with five sacks of corn after harvest to provide for his needs until the next harvest: ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{shows that}} global {{financial}} markets cannot, by themselves, achieve net transfers of financial <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> real <b>interest</b> rate equalisation across countries {{and that the}} integration of both global financial markets and global goods markets is needed to achieve net transfers of <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> real <b>interest</b> rate equalisation across countries.

Moreover, frictions in global goods markets can explain why real exchange rates deviate from PPP (purchasing power parity) for extended periods of time and can therefore also explain the PPP puzzle.

2500|$|Compared to France, the British {{government}} relied more {{on short-term}} financing {{in the form}} of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I. Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916, and were available for terms of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at an interest rate of 5%. Although these were not formally designated as war bonds, advertising was explicit about their purpose. This April 1916 advertisement for 5% Exchequer bonds was typical of the time: [...] "LEND YOUR MONEY TO YOUR COUNTRY. The soldier does not grudge offering his life to his country. He offers it freely, for his life may be the price of Victory. But Victory cannot be won without money as well as men, and your money is needed. Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.

There will be a great incentive to them to seek their friends in other directions, and any future rupture of peaceable relations will always carry with it the enormous advantage of escaping the payment of external debts, if, on the other hand, these great debts are forgiven, a stimulus will be given to the solidarity and true friendliness of the nations lately associated.|$|E
