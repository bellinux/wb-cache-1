40|$|Teleconnections have {{traditionally}} been studied for the case of dry dynamical response to a given diabatic heat source. Important anomalies often occur within convective zones, for instance, in the observed remote response to El Niño. The reduction of rainfall and teleconnection propagation in deep convective regions poses theoretical challenges because feedbacks involving convective heating and cloud radiative effects come into play. Land surface feedbacks, including variations of land surface temperature, and ocean surface layer temperature response {{must be taken into}} account. During El Niño, descent and negative precipitation anomalies often extend across equatorial South America and the Atlantic intertropical convergence zone. Analysis of simulated mechanisms in a case study of the 1997 / 98 El Niño is used to illustrate the general principals of teleconnections occurring in deep convective zones, contrasting land and ocean regions. Comparison to other simulated events shows similar behavior. Tropo-spheric temperature and wind anomalies are spread eastward by wave dynamics modified by interaction with the moist convection zones. The traditional picture would have gradual descent balanced by radiative damping, but this scenario misses the most important balances in the moist static energy (MSE) budget.

By unmasking the buoyancy effects in coupled flow, phase change and heat transport phenomena, {{a better understanding of}} melting rate in non-thermal <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>convective</b> conditions can be studied. A series of flight experiments were conducted onboard the NASA KC- 135 Microgravity Research Airplane. The Particle Melting in Plow (PMF) module was designed to allow flow through the initially packed ice particles at controlled temperature and velocity. To achieve this, a close-loop flow system was designed. Video images were taken to record the visualization of the melting process, from which a time variation of packed particle thickness distribution at different times can be obtained by the image analysis method. The fluid temperature distribution within the melting zone is measured by thermocouples. An infrared camera was mounted {{from the top of the}} test section to record the ice-water thermal images at a given location. The results from thermal images yield local temperature variation between melting solid and liquid and local Stephan number. Typical results for a number of cases are presented. The mathematical model, describing mass, energy, and momentum balance equations for the liquid and solid phases, is presented. It is found that melting rate is influenced mainly by the ratio of Reynolds number (based on the initial particle diameter) to the Froud number, and Stephan number. At the absence of gravity, Froud number approaches zero, Reynolds number and Stephan number become dominant factors governing the melting rate. The numerically determined results are compared with the experimental ones. It is found that the discrepancy between the predicted and measured melting rate is largely due to the inaccuracy in the constitutive equations for effective thermal physical properties, such as effective thermal conductivity and diffusivity, and transport properties, such as particle interaction coefficient, and local heat transfer coefficient of particles...|$|R
40|$|A cumulus {{ensemble}} model {{is used to}} study the tropical water and energy cycles and {{their role in the}} climate system. The model includes cloud dynamics, radiative processes, and microphysics that incorporate all important production and conversion processes among water vapor and five species of hydrometeors. Radiative transfer in clouds is parameterized based on cloud contents and size distributions of each bulk hydrometeor. Several model integrations have been carried out under a variety of imposed boundary and large-scale conditions. In Part 1 of this paper, the primary focus is on the water and heat budgets of the control experiment, which is designed to simulate the <b>convective</b> - radiative <b>equilibrium</b> response of the model to an imposed vertical velocity and a fixed sea surface temperature at 28 C. The simulated atmosphere is conditionally unstable below the freezing level and close to neutral above the freezing level. The equilibrium water budget shows that the total moisture source, M(sub s), which is contributed by surface evaporation (0. 24 M(sub s)) and the large-scale advection (0. 76 M(sub s)), all converts to mean surface precipitation bar-P(sub s). Most of M(sub s) is transported verticaly in convective regions where much of the condensate is generated and falls to surface (0. 68 bar-P(sub s)). The remaining condensate detrains at a rate of 0. 48 bar-P(sub s) and constitutes 65 % of the source for stratiform clouds above the melting level. The upper-level stratiform cloud dissipates into clear environment at a rate of 0. 14 bar-P(sub s), which is a significant moisture source comparable to the detrained water vapor (0. 15 bar-P(sub s)) to the upper troposphere from convective clouds. In the lower troposphere, stratiform clouds evaporate at a rate of 0. 41 bar-P(sub s), which is a more dominant moisture source than surface evaporation (0. 22 bar-P(sub s)). The precipitation falling to the surface in the stratiform region is about 0. 32 bar-P(sub s). The associated latent heating in the water cycle is the dominant source in the heat budget that generates a net upward motion in convective regions, upper stratiform regions (above the freezing level), and a downward motion in the lower stratiform regions. The budgets reveal a cycle of water and energy resulted from radiation-dynamic-convection interactions that maintain equilibrium of the atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate {{the influence of the}} shortwave radiation (SW) absorption by aerosols on the dynamics and heat budget of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). This study is relevant for areas characterized by large concentrations of light-absorbing aerosol, which are known to warm up the ABL 2 - 10 K/day depending on the amount and vertical distribution of the aerosols. We investigate if aerosols, by warming the ABL and the entrainment zone, contribute to a destabilization of the thermal inversion layer, either by reducing the capping inversion or by stabilizing {{the lower part of the}} entrainment zone. The impact of the reduced amount of radiation reaching the surface due to aerosols SW absorption is taken into account. As such numerical experiments are carried out by using a large-eddy simulation (LES) model (DALES code) to study the ABL vertical structure and its time evolution. Mixed-layer theory (0 -order bulk model - MXL) is also employed to support DALES results. A radiative transfer code (TUV) is used to calculate the impact of the aerosols absorption on the SW radiation field. The numerical simulations are made for a reference case of a dry, non-polluted free <b>convective</b> ABL in <b>equilibrium,</b> i. e. the boundary layer height is in steady-state. In addition, three other simulations are designed: average (AC), high and extreme aerosol concentrations. They differ from the reference case only by the increasing aerosol concentration (homogeneously distributed) within the ABL. An extra simulation (called TOP) is performed with the AC concentration placed only at the ABL top to investigate if the vertical distribution of aerosols plays a role in changing the entrainment zone dynamics. The simulations are integrated towards a new steady state. The DALES results indicate a shallower ABL for all simulations, compared to the reference case. The ABL-depth decreasing is even more pronounced for the TOP case. Different processes explain this decrease. At the surface, the reduction of SW, due to the aerosols absorption, leads to decrease the surface sensible heat flux (SH), and in consequence it yields to a shallower ABL. In turn, the aerosols absorption also weakens the capping inversion in all the experiments because of the aerosol heat absorption. The absorption also drives an increased stabilization of the upper region of the ABL. Stabilization and the reduced SH together suppress the weakening of the inversion layer, reducing the ABL height. Turbulence characteristics are further analyzed: first, the entrainment velocity increases when the aerosols are located at the top of ABL. The entrainment flux depth changes when aerosols are added, however its magnitude remains the same as for the control case, around 16 %. Second, the stabilization below the ABL top leads to a reduction of the temperature variance...|$|R
40|$|Sulfadiazine [4 -amino-N-(2 -pyrimidinyl) benzene sulfonamide] (SDZ) {{belongs to}} the widely used {{antibiotic}} veterinary pharmaceuticals. After excretion by animals, these substances and their transformation products are released into agricultural soils and adjacent environmental compartments {{through the use of}} manure and sludge as fertilizer. Knowledge of the fate of antibiotics in sediment and soil is crucial for assessing their environmental risk. Especially in China, the behavior of antibiotics in river water and sediment is still poorly known. Therefore, laboratory studies including batch and column experiments were performed to investigate the transformation, sorption and transport behavior of SDZ in Yangtze sediments and their components, such as minerals (goethite, illite, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3) and organic matter. Three abiotic transformation products were only detected in the SDZ-goethite system under the exclusion of light. All these products were found to be SO 2 extrusion from SDZ. One of these products was a new unknown transformation product, and the other two were identified by mass spectrometry as 4 -(2 -iminopyrimidin- 1 (2 H) -yl) aniline and p-(pyrimidin- 2 -yl) aminoaniline. A ligand exchange mechanism was assumed for the surface interaction between SDZ and goethite. A possible transformation pathway was proposed on the basis of monodentate inner-sphere complexation and an intramolecular SN reaction. Sorption kinetic data were fitted well by first order kinetics. Two days contact time was chosen to avoid degradation of SDZ in sorption experiments. Nearly all the adsorption isotherms determined in this study were nonlinear and could be best described by the Freundlich adsorption isotherm. Surface area and pH were found to be the dominant factors for SDZ sorption on minerals. Additionally, organic matter {{plays an important role in}} SDZ sorption on sediments. Reversible sorption was observed for minerals (Al 2 O 3 and illite) and desorption hysteresis occurred on most sediments. It was assumed that desorption was started before adsorption had been completed (non-equilibrium conditions) and slow desorption of SDZ from the sorbents. Sorption distribution coefficients (Kd) for SDZ on sediments were low (ranging from 0. 3 to 1. 1 L kg- 1), which indicates that SDZ would be highly mobile in sediments. The rate-limited sorption (RLS) model was successfully used to describe sorption data in this study. The modeling results suggested that the adsorption and desorption rates are the dominant factors for hysteresis of SDZ on sediments. In general, this experimental procedure combined with the modeling presented here is recommended for adsorption/desorption studies of unstable chemicals like antibiotics in terrestrial systems. Transport of SDZ was investigated in sediment columns with varying flow rates and input concentrations. Only weak retardation was found, which is in agreement with the low sorption amounts and low Kd values in batch experiments. Column data were modeled successfully by the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>convective</b> dispersion equation (CDE). The retardation factor R obtained from this model was about 50 % lower than that calculated from the Kd values of batch experiments. One reason is the loss of active sorption sites due to the release of colloids such as dissolved organic matter and minerals during conditioning of the sediment column. This is an important finding with respect to a new recommendation for transport experiments with sediments...|$|R

When the shear is very strong, the convection tends to organize into lines at an angle to the shear, such that the linenormal component is not far from its theoretical optimal value. Midlevel shear favors shear-parallel lines, but if it occurs in conjunction with sufficiently strong low-level shear, the convection can become very strongly organized into lines or arcs generally orthogonal to the low-level shear.

For example, it is often invoked in developing parameterizations for large-scale models. However, the equilibrium assumption may begin to break down as models are increasingly used with shorter timesteps and finer resolutions. Here we perform idealized cloud-system resolving model simulations of deep convection with imposed time variations in the surface forcing. A range of rapid forcing timescales from 1 − 36 hr are used, in order to induce systematic departures from equilibrium. For the longer forcing timescales, the equilibrium assumption remains valid, in at least the limited sense that cycle-integrated measures of convective activity are very similar from cycle to cycle. For shorter forcing timescales, cycle-integrated convection becomes more variable, with enhanced activity on one cycle being correlated with reduced activity on the next, suggesting a role for convective memory. Further investigation shows that the memory {{does not appear to be}} carried by the domain-mean thermodynamic fields but rather by structures on horizontal scales of 5 − 20 km.

These include an increase in the rain rate that is smaller than the modelled increase in precipitable water, a systematic decrease in sensible heating and an increase in clear‐sky cooling. However, in contrast to climate models, we note that tropospheric relative humidity increases and column‐integrated water vapour increases at the rate anticipated from the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship, but only when compared with the troposphere mean temperature rather than surface temperature. Also shown are results elucidating the changes in the vertically integrated water budget and the distribution of high precipitation rates shifting toward higher rates. Moist static energy distributions are analyzed and, from these, clouds are implicated in effecting the final equilibrium state of the atmosphere. The results indicate that, while there are aspects of the tropical equilibrium that are represented realistically in current general circulation model climate‐change experiments, there are potentially influential local interactions that are sufficiently important as to alter the mean response of the tropical water and energy balance to changes in sea‐surface temperature. Convection is shown to dictate the equilibrium state across all scales, including those unresolved in climate models, rather than only responding to surface‐induced changes...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} intermediate {{model for}} analyzing and parameterizing convectively coupled tropical waves is introduced here. This model has two baroclinic modes of vertical structure: a direct heating mode and a stratiform mode. The key essential parameter in these models {{is the area}} fraction occupied by deep convection, sc. The unstable convectively coupled waves that emerge from perturbation of a radiative <b>convective</b> <b>equilibrium</b> are discussed in detail through linearized stability analysis. Without any mean flow, for an overall cooling rate of 1 K day 21 as the area fraction parameter increases from sc 5 0. 0010 to sc 5 0. 0014 the waves pass from a regime with stable moist convective damping to a regime of ‘‘stratiform’ ’ instability with convectively coupled waves propagating at speeds of roughly 15 m s 21; instabilities for a band of wavelengths in the supercluster regime, O(1000) –O(2000) km; and a vertical structure with a ‘‘wave tilt’ ’ where the temperature structure in the upper troposphere lags behind that in the lower troposphere. Thus, these convectively coupled waves in the model reproduce several key features of convectively coupled waves in the troposphere processed from recent observational data by Wheeler and Kiladis. As the parameter sc is increased further to values such as sc 5 0. 01, the band of unstable waves increases and spreads toward a mesoscale wavelength of O(100) km while the same wave structure and quantitative features mentioned above are retained for O(1000) km...|$|E
40|$|Radiative <b>convective</b> <b>equilibrium</b> {{has been}} applied in past studies to various models given its {{simplicity}} and analogy to the tropical climate. At convection-permitting resolution, the {{focus has been on}} the organization of convection that appears when using fixed sea surface temperature (SST). Here the SST is allowed to freely respond to the surface energy. The goals are to examine and understand the resulting transient behavior, equilibrium state, and perturbations thereof, as well as to compare these results to a simulation integrated with parameterized cloud and convection. Analysis shows that the coupling between the SST and the net surface energy acts to delay the onset of self-aggregation and may prevent it, in our case, for a slab ocean of less than 1 m. This is so because SST gradients tend to oppose the shallow low-level circulation that is associated with the self-aggregation of convection. Furthermore, the occurrence of self-aggregation is found to be necessary for reaching an equilibrium state and avoiding a greenhouse-like climate. In analogy to the present climate, the self-aggregation generates the dry and clear subtropics that allow the system to efficiently cool. In contrast, strong shortwave cloud radiative effects, much stronger than at convection-permitting resolution, prevent the simulation with parameterized cloud and convection to fall into a greenhouse state. The convection-permitting simulations also suggest that cloud feedbacks, as arising when perturbing the equilibrium state, may be very different, and in our case less negative, than what emerges from general circulation models...|$|E
40|$|An {{uncertain}} {{representation of}} convective clouds {{has emerged as}} one of the key barriers to our understanding of climate sensitivity. The large gap in resolved spatial scales between General Circulation Models (GCMs) and high resolution models has made a systematic study of convective clouds across model configurations difficult. It is shown here that the simulated atmosphere of a GCM in Radiative <b>Convective</b> <b>Equilibrium</b> (RCE) is sufficiently similar across a range of domain sizes to justify the use of RCE to study both a GCM and a high resolution model on the same domain with the goal of improved constraints on the parameterized clouds. Simulations of RCE with parameterized convection have been analyzed on domains with areas spanning more than two orders of magnitude (0. 80 - 204 x 10 (6) km(2)), all having the same grid spacing of 13 km. The simulated climates on different domains are qualitatively similar in their degree of convective organization, the precipitation rates, and the vertical structure of the clouds and water vapor, with the similarity increasing as the domain size increases. Sea surface temperature perturbation experiments are used to estimate the climate feedback parameter for the differently configured experiments, and the cloud radiative effect is computed to examine the role which clouds play in the response. Despite the similar climate states between the domains the feedback parameter varies by more than a factor of two; the hydrological sensitivity parameter is better behaved, varying by a factor of 1. 4. The sensitivity of the climate feedback parameter to domain size is related foremost to a nonsystematic response of low-level clouds as well as an increasingly negative longwave feedback on larger domains...|$|E
40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{hydrological}} cycles and general circulations was simulated with an idealized general circulation model (GCM) by varying the optical thickness of the longwave absorber. While the idealized GCM does not capture the full complexity of the hydrological cycle, the {{wide range of}} climates simulated allows the systematic development and testing of theories of how precipitation and moisture transport change as the climate changes. The simulations show that the character of the response of the hydrological cycle to variations in longwave optical thickness differs in different climate regimes. The global-mean precipitation increases linearly with surface temperature for colder climates, but it asymptotically approaches a maximum at higher surface temperatures. The basic features of the precipi-tation–temperature relation, including the rate of increase in the linear regime, are reproduced in radiative– <b>convective</b> <b>equilibrium</b> simulations. Energy constraints partially account for the precipitation–temperature relation but are not quantitatively accurate. Large-scale condensation is most important in the midlatitude storm tracks, and its behavior is accounted for using a stochastic model of moisture advection and condensation. The precipitation associated with large-scale condensation does not scale with mean specific humidity, partly because the condensation region moves upward and meridionally as the climate warms, and partly because the mean condensation rate depends on isentropic specific humidity gradients, which do not scale with the specific humidity itself. The local water vapor budget relates local precipitation to evaporation and meridional moisture fluxes, whose scaling in the subtropics and extratropics is examined. A delicate balance between opposing changes in evaporation and moisture flux divergence holds in the subtropical dry zones. The extratropical precipi-tation maximum follows the storm track in warm climates but lies equatorward of the storm track in cold climates. 1...|$|E
40|$|Floods {{are one of}} {{the main}} natural hazards {{affecting}} worldwide population. The Western Mediterranian region is one of the areas in risk of suffering these phenomena. In this region, floods have lead in high damages in the infrastructures and agriculture terrains. Moreover, these metrological phenomena have lead in hundreds of human fatalities. For that reason, is required to take over a wide research of historical, hydraulical, hydrological and meteorological in order to analyze which was the source {{and to be able to}} predict these hazards in the future. We have focused our study in the meteorological reconstruction of these historical floods. By using the 'Prediflood' database, we have selected the 23 most catastrophic floods that affected the Northeast of Iberian Peninsula between 1874 and 2000. Then, using NOAA 6 hourly 20 th Century V 2 Reanalysis Data Composites we have analyzed the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and its evolution during all these years, the convective timescale (&# 964;c). With this calculus and the hypothesis of several authors we have tried to conclude if these floods were <b>convective</b> <b>equilibrium</b> episodes or non-equilibrium ones. As a result, we have observed that &# 964; by itself do not guarantee a correct definition of one of these regimes. Helped with CAPE, this difference could be easily determined. At the same time, it is also relevant that the hypothesis of previous authors about limit value of &# 964;c. in order to determine the regimen have been refused because the values were higher than expected. Then, we have studied the spatial evolution of convective timescale between floods with similar characteristics of CAPE and &# 964;c in the same season of the year with the intention to observe if &# 964;c varies in the same way in Catalonia and its surroundings. The obtained results in this chapter demonstrate low relation between episodes of similar characteristics. This fact have lead us to write several conclusions and eventual recommendations which would have to allow an study with better reliability, obtaining this way conclusive results...|$|E
