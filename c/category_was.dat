50|$|In mathematics, a {{complete}} <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a <b>category</b> {{in which all}} small limits exist. That <b>is,</b> a <b>category</b> C <b>is</b> complete if every diagram F : J → C where J is small has a limit in C. Dually, a cocomplete <b>category</b> <b>is</b> one in which all small colimits exist. A bicomplete <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a <b>category</b> which <b>is</b> both complete and cocomplete.|$|R

5|$|Originally {{called the}} Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female, the award was first {{presented}} to Donna Summer in 1980. Beginning with the 1995 ceremony, {{the name of}} the award was changed to Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. However, in 1988, 1992, 1994, and since 2005, this <b>category</b> <b>was</b> combined with the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and presented in a genderless category known as Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo. The solo <b>category</b> <b>was</b> later renamed to Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance beginning in 2005. This fusion has been criticized, especially when female performers are not nominated under the solo category. The Academy has cited a lack of eligible recordings in the female rock category as the reason for the mergers. While the award has not been presented since the category merge in 2005, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.|$|E
50|$|The sounds {{involved}} in alternations {{of the sounds}} of the second and the third <b>category</b> <b>are</b> known as correlatives.

Kruszewski's example for the second <b>category</b> <b>is</b> u-umlaut in Icelandic. He does not strictly separate the second and the third category.|$|R

5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Brian Bloom was {{the first}} winner of this award for his {{portrayal}} of Dusty Donovan on As the World Turns. The awards ceremony had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award <b>category</b> <b>was</b> originally called Outstanding Young Man or Outstanding Juvenile Male in a Drama Series, and began using its current title in 1991. Years before this <b>category</b> <b>was</b> introduced, networks declined to broadcast the show {{during a time of}} voting integrity rumors and waning interest. Confusion rose around the criteria of the new category due to the varying ages of the nominees. Within the first set of nominees, Bloom became the youngest actor nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award at the time at age 15, while the other actors nominated in the category were over 25. The criteria were later altered, requiring that the actor be aged 25 or below.|$|E

5000|$|In mathematics, a {{skeleton}} of a <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a subcategory which, roughly speaking, does not contain any extraneous isomorphisms. In a certain sense, the {{skeleton of a}} <b>category</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "smallest" [...] equivalent category which captures all [...] "categorical properties". In fact, two <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> equivalent {{if and only if}} they have isomorphic skeletons. A <b>category</b> <b>is</b> called skeletal if isomorphic objects are necessarily identical.|$|R
50|$|A fifth {{category}} and a sixth <b>category</b> <b>were</b> developed later.

Since 1992, the award has been presented under the category Best Bluegrass Album.

5|$|The {{opportunity}} to create an entire batch of locomotives within the 8P <b>category</b> <b>was</b> declined by the Railway Executive.

As a result, 71000 remained the solitary member of a proposed class of Standard 8P locomotives.|$|E
