25|$|Professional diver {{training}} is generally provided by schools affiliated to or approved {{by one or}} more of the commercial, scientific or other professional diver certification or registration organizations. Professional diver training standards may require a significantly higher level of over-training than most recreational certification agencies, as the professional diver is expected to manage most contingencies and still perform the planned work under difficult conditions. Professional divers may also be provided with what is variously known as confidence training or stress training, where simulated emergencies are enacted, or unlikely contingencies are simulated, with the intended result of developing the diver's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> manage contingencies while in a controlled environment. The amount of time spent on skill and confidence development is generally proportional to the length of the training programme, as the basic skills are usually learned fairly quickly.|$|E

Sportswriter John B. Sheridan was among the critics of the system, saying, [...] "The specialist in baseball is no good and won't go very far... The whole effect of the system will be to make the players affected half men... It is farewell, a long farewell to all that player's chance of greatness... It destroys young ball players by destroying their most precious quality – <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> hit any pitcher, left or right, alive, dead, or waiting to be born." [...] Baseball Magazine was supportive, pointing out that Speaker had results that backed up his system.|$|E

500|$|The Holy Jesus Hospital {{has been}} {{the centre of the}} National Trust’s Inner City Project. By August 2004, £800,000 had been spent on renovating the building. [...] Funds for the {{restoration}} of the site came from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Tyne and Wear Partnership. The project had been running since 1987 in the east end of Newcastle working with young people from 12-25 and with the over 50s, taking them out to the countryside. [...] The National Trust needed a central office to expand their work into other inner city areas, so a 25-year lease was negotiated with the council. The Exhibition Room on the site features touch screens and 3D models to help teach people about the site's history of helping the townspeople. In the book The Remains of Distant Times: Archaeology and the National Trust, Priscilla Boniface criticizes what she believes to be the National Trust's lack of interest in operating in urban environments but praises the Inner City Project as a step towards rectifying this. She wrote [...] "Its occasional ventures - such as the Newcastle Inner City Project...by their frequent mention in National Trust communications, merely serve to underline how few of their type the Trust has to call on for report." [...] She argues that although the aim of introducing town dwellers to the countryside is [...] "laudable", the [...] "respectful and serious suggestion might be made, though, that a person or person's might be usefully employed also with the objective of raising National Trust people's understanding of and <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> visit and enjoy, or at least encounter, the city." [...] However, Collins and Kay cite research suggesting that the scheme has been effective in promoting [...] "social inclusion".

2500|$|Job burnout {{stems from}} stress at work. [...] A person {{suffering}} from burnout is exhausted, cynical, and lacks motivation. [...] Similar to job stress, job burnout {{has also been}} related to the core self-evaluations construct. [...] Individuals with low core self-evaluations will consistently {{feel that they are}} unable to handle work tasks because they lack the ability or control. [...] For this reason, those with low core self-evaluations will be more susceptible to job burnout than those with high core self-evaluations, who appraise themselves positively and have <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> manage the situation. [...] This is particularly important because of job burnout's consistent relationship with voluntary turnover behavior (e.g., individuals choosing to leave the job), which is very costly for all organizations.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{scholars}} {{focused on}} self-identification {{as a good}} measure of a person's political independence. The value of self-identification {{as a measure of}} a person's political independence or partisanship is that it is seen as a proxy for the behavior which should be exhibited by the independent voter. Additionally, self-identification could be easily captured either with a nominal question ("Do you self-identify with an existing political party?", a question which is answered with a [...] "yes" [...] or a [...] "no"), or by a structured ordinal question ("Generally speaking, do you consider yourself a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or what?"). The first analyses of this measure of political independence found that there were significant differences between those individuals who self-identified as [...] "independent" [...] and those who listed [...] "no preference" [...] as to party identification. Individuals who expressed [...] "no preference" [...] usually exhibited low levels of interest in politics, low levels of knowledge about the candidates and issues, low frequency of voting, and less <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> influence politics.|$|E

We are apt to call such a one out of his name and to punish him for opinions he has never held. This may be a better reason than either given why authors do not take part in politics with us. They are a thin-skinned race, fastidious often, and always averse to hard knocks; they are rather modest, too, and distrust their fitness to lead, when they have quite a firm faith in their convictions. They hesitate to urge these in the face of practical politicians, who have a <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> settle all affairs of State not surpassed even by that of business men in dealing with economic questions.|$|E
60|$|And now the bugle plays {{a lively}} air as the coach rattles through the ill-paved streets {{of a country}} town; and the coachman, undoing the buckle which keeps his ribands together, prepares to throw them off the moment he stops.

Mr. Winkle, who sits at the extreme edge, with one leg dangling in the air, is nearly precipitated into the street, as the coach twists round the sharp corner by the cheesemonger's shop, and turns into the market-place; and before Mr. Snodgrass, who sits next to him, has recovered from his alarm, they pull up at the inn yard where the fresh horses, with cloths on, are already waiting. The coachman throws down the reins and gets down himself, and the other outside passengers drop down also; except those who have no great <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> get up again; and they remain where they are, and stamp their feet against the coach to warm them--looking, with longing eyes and red noses, at the bright fire in the inn bar, and the sprigs of holly with red berries which ornament the window.|$|E
