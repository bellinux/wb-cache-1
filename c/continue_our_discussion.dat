Not {{one of the founders}} {{comments}} concluded that the government of this nation is Christian. Some did say and others agreed that our form of government would be inadequate to govern citizens who do not embody the moral, legal, ethical and brotherly love principles that are espoused in Biblical teachings. For example, one French observer of our newly founded government observed that our form of government would persist only until citizens (lacking moral honesty) realized that they could vote themselves a living or a handout from the public dole. We have also seen the detrimental effects of our failure to insist upon moral and ethical conduct of our citizens and especially upon those ethics in our leaders. That is the unfortunate origin of the misconduct so prevalent in the leaders of our nation's governments at the national, state, and local levels as well as in our corporate settings among businesses from CEO's down to the lowliest employee.|$|E

For each vertex vi, draw an edge to vj with probability P r[(vi, vj) ∈ E] ∼ didj The above equation does not include a normalization factor that is present in the actual paper, but has little bearing on the model conceptually. There are a few key points to note about GRG: • A vertex with a high degree has a high probability of many edges. • High-degree nodes tend to pair with other high-degree nodes, due to the relatively large size of didj in the above equation. • GRG does not sample uniformly at random from all possible graphs.

40|$|A {{semiconducting}} {{material is}} defined as one that is electrically insulating at a temperature of absolute zero but that becomes conducting for temperatures below its melting point. The property that first {{attracted the attention of}} physicists {{in the early nineteenth century}} was the decreasing resistivity with increasing temperature, in stark contrast to metals where the opposite is true (Faraday 1839, Smith 1964, Ashcroft and Mermin 1976, p. 563). Both of these effects occur in semiconductors because it is possible to thermally excite charge carriers from a full energy band that prevents conduction to an unoccupied band that then allows electrons to move freely. The structure of these energy bands is used to explain most of the properties of semiconductors.

40|$|Carbohydrates {{can provide}} up to 80 % {{of the dry}} matter in animal diets, yet their {{specific}} evaluation for research and diet formulation is only now becoming a focus in the animal sciences. Partitioning of dietary carbohydrates for nutritional purposes should reflect differences in digestion and fermentation characteristics and effects on animal performance. Key challenges to designating nutritionally important carbohydrate fractions include classifying the carbohydrates in terms of nutritional characteristics, and selecting analytical methods that describe the desired fraction. The relative lack of information on digestion characteristics of various carbohydrates and their interactions with other fractions in diets means that fractions will not soon be perfectly established. Developing a system of carbohydrate analysis {{that could be used}} across animal species could enhance the utility of analyses and amount of data we can obtain on dietary effects of carbohydrates. Based on quantities present in diets and apparent effects on animal performance, some nutritionally important classes of carbohydrates that may be valuable to measure include sugars, starch, fructans, insoluble fiber, and soluble fiber. Essential to selection of methods for these fractions is agreement on precisely what carbohydrates should be included in each. Each of these fractions has analyses that could potentially be used to measure them, but most of the available methods have weaknesses that must be evaluated to see if they are fatal and the assay is unusable, or if the assay still may be made workable. Factors we must consider as we seek to analyze carbohydrates to describe diets: Does the assay accurately measure the desired fraction? Is the assay for research, regulatory, or field use (affects considerations of acceptable costs and throughput) ? What are acceptable accuracy and variability of measures? Is the assay robust (enhances accuracy of values) ? For some carbohydrates, we may have to accept that there are currently no acceptable, widely applicable analyses that meet these criteria, and seek to fill this analytical gap. Overall, there are good possibilities for accomplishing the nutritional partitioning of carbohydrates. But to ensure that this is done well, as a discipline, we need to <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> on the basis for partitioning, on what fractions are actually significant, and rigorously evaluate proposed analyses to verify that they are analytically sound...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we <b>continue</b> <b>our</b> general <b>discussion</b> of Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs), {{which has been}} carried on {{during the first two}} Ultra-Wideband, Short-Pulse Electromagnetics conferences. IRAs are a class of antennas that consist of a TEM feed section and either a lens or {{reflector}} to focus the aperture field. We summarize here much of the more recent information, including new antenna designs, new calculation methods, and an optimization of the impedance of the lens IRA. First, we explore a wide variety of new IRA designs that include two reflecting or refracting surfaces. By using two surfaces, one can achieve considerable additional flexibility in design. This flexibility allows very compact designs, and also allows additional choices of feed impedance. Next, we consider the optimal feed impedance for long TEM horns and lens IRAs. We consider both TEM horns whose plates are flat, and whose plates are confined to a circular arc. We also consider both infinite apertures and circular apertures of finite radius. The optimal impedance is determined as the impedance that provides the highest radiated field for a given input power. Finally, we calculate the field radiated from a four-wire aperture, both on- and off-boresight. This is an approximation to the aperture field of a four-armed reflector IRA. I...|$|R
