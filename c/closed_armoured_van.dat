30|$|In both cases, {{the branch}} needs help from its cash central (the closest one): {{in the first}} case, the branch {{requires}} that an <b>armoured</b> <b>van</b> evacuates the surplus of money. In the second one, that of the branch needing more cash, the cash central should move money to the branch, {{by means of an}} <b>armoured</b> <b>van</b> as well. In any case, these cash movements from the cash central to the branches take place after a concrete demand of money from branches to the cash central. Later on, we specify how it works in the real world.|$|R

50|$|Money Movers is a 1978 Australian crime action drama film {{directed}} by Bruce Beresford. The film {{was based on}} the book Money Movers by Devon Minchin, founder of Metropolitan Security Services. The story deals loosely with two real-life events, the 1970 Sydney Armoured Car Robbery where A$500,000 was stolen from a Mayne Nickless <b>armoured</b> <b>van,</b> and a 1970 incident where A$280,000 was stolen from Metropolitan Security Services' offices by bandits impersonating policemen.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, in {{the course}} of court {{proceedings}} brought against Hutch by the Irish state's anti money laundering agency, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), Detective Chief Superintendent Felix McKenna stated that Hutch had been involved in the IR£1.7 million robbery of an <b>armoured</b> <b>van</b> at Marino Mart in January 1987 and the IR£3 million armed robbery of a Brinks Allied Security Depot in Clonshaugh, County Dublin, in 1995, which had been the largest cash robbery in the State at the time.|$|R
30|$|A first {{mechanism}} of control to optimize its resources is {{set by the}} bankťs company by fixing {{a certain number of}} periodic stops: branches call stop to each of the <b>armoured</b> <b>van</b> stops next to the branch. Each branch has a certain number of stops available which might or might not be required. Let us recall that stops occur after a request of the branch, and due to both possibilities: caused by the existence of a surplus of cash or, on the contrary, caused by the absence of cash to cover all the branches necessities.|$|R
50|$|On 18 February 2013, in the 2013 Belgian diamond heist, {{eight men}} armed with {{automatic}} weapons {{and dressed in}} police uniforms seized 120 small parcels containing an estimated $50 million (£32,000,000) worth of diamonds from a Helvetic Airways Fokker 100 passenger plane loaded with passengers preparing for departure to Zurich. The men drove two vehicles through a hole they had cut in the airports perimeter fence to Flight LX789, which had just been loaded with diamonds from a Brink's <b>armoured</b> <b>van.</b> The men were able to execute the operation within five minutes with no injuries and without firing a shot.|$|R
50|$|The Bad Blue Boys {{attempted}} to storm the field {{half an hour}} later, but were quickly pushed back by the police; restraint methods used by the police included baton striking and tear gas. Within minutes, the situation spiraled beyond control as the BBB {{could no longer be}} held back by the police, and soon took to the field to reach their Serbian counterparts. All the while, the police were quickly overwhelmed by the large numbers, but came back with reinforcements, <b>armoured</b> <b>vans</b> and water cannons to disperse the violence. More than an hour later, with hundreds injured, the running battles were all over.|$|R

30|$|Turning {{again into}} the {{movement}} of money from the cash central, this event implicitly carries a cost that we analyze deeply in later sections. Mainly, it consists of a logistic cost for transport and handling, due to the costs generated by renting a security company (which includes costs for security personnel and costs for transport in <b>armoured</b> <b>vans).</b> There is involved as well an opportunity cost, derived {{from the fact that}} funds into the non interest bearing asset are loosing money while they are not in the interest bearing portfolio. One of the targets of this paper is, then, to minimize the different costs implicated in the currency management while keeping the customer satisfaction as high as usual.|$|R

Upon seeing the skyscrapers of {{downtown}} Los Angeles, Sita realizes that there are helicopters parked upon their rooftops. Struck {{by the idea of}} an escape by flight she begins to drive towards those cut-glass monoliths. In transit, Sita shoots down helicopters and, on one occasion, jumps from one skyscraper window to another hundreds of feet away - injuring herself slightly in the process, discovering that the strength of her healing factor is much greater than it was before. It is upon the roof of this second skyscraper that she comes upon the desired helicopter, the one by which she and Joel make their escape.|$|R

Melanie is muzzled and handcuffed to the gunner's chair atop the armoured vehicle and the group escapes into the wilderness. The group reach a river to collect water but are attacked by hungries who have come out of the woods. The group is surrounded. Helen removes Melanie from atop the vehicle and brings her inside.

Nigel Bloch, the head of Identicon, has his henchmen chase the agents through the streets of Hong Kong. The two steal a second case of vials from a nearby Identicon factory. They then rendezvous with R, who provides Bond with a gadget-laden BMW Z8. A limousine pulls up, and a figure inside fires a rocket at the agents, killing Zoe, and steals the case. Bond gives chase, stopping an <b>armoured</b> <b>van</b> containing the stolen vials.|$|R
5000|$|Carousel is {{an online}} {{advertisement}} launched in April 2009 by Philips to promote Philips Cinema 21:9 LCD televisions. The 139-second (2m19s) piece is a continuous tracking {{shot of a}} frozen moment after an <b>armoured</b> <b>van</b> heist gone wrong, with robbers dressed in clown masks holding a pitched battle with police officers inside a hospital. The campaign surrounding Carousel was led by the central Philips team at DDB in London and produced by advertising agency Tribal DDB in Amsterdam. It was directed by Adam Berg, with production contracted to London-based production company Stinkdigital. The ad {{went on to become}} a huge critical success, winning the advertising industry's most prestigious award: the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. It is only the second online advertisement to win in the Film category, after Dove's Evolution in 2007.

500|$|The {{development}} {{team found}} that players experienced greater freedom when controlling three characters in missions. Lead mission designer Imran Sarwar felt they opened up more strategic manoeuvres. He cited a combat scenario with the lead protagonists where Michael De Santa sets up at a sniper outpost and provides covering fire for Trevor Philips, {{who makes a}} frontal assault on the enemy position while Franklin Clinton manipulates flank points. Benzies felt that character switching streamlines the interplay between free roam and linear mission gameplay, as it eliminates San Andreas cumbersome long distance drives to mission start points. Players may [...] "explore the whole map without {{having to worry about}} the long drive back", according to Benzies. Houser noted the mechanic's use during missions negated long drives as well. The open world's dynamic mission content is a feature borrowed from Red Dead Redemption, where it was received positively. Dynamic missions present themselves while players explore the open world, and may be accepted or ignored. The team implemented dynamic content all throughout the open world. In Los Santos for example, players may encounter an <b>armoured</b> <b>van</b> and try to intercept it to steal its contents.|$|R
50|$|Squatting {{became a}} {{criminal}} offence at midnight on 1 October 2010, passing {{from the civil}} courts to the criminal courts. An Amsterdam protest numbering 800-1000 by various estimates occurred during the day. By nightfall police charged protesters initiating violence. Protesters responded throwing stones, bricks and bottles at police and vandalising cars. Protesters built ad hoc street barricades from metal fences and bicycles to repel police charges in <b>armoured</b> <b>vans</b> and on horseback. The police response included the use of bulldozers and water cannon to clear streets and extinguish fires. Another protest occurred {{the next day in}} Nijmegen. Police dispersed the protest by force and closed down the central station, arresting protesters present. In Amsterdam that same evening, the police station was attacked by Molotov cocktails. The mayor, Eberhard van der Laan appeared on television, calling for calm and claiming the unrest was due to a hard core of 150 people. Police commissioner Leen Schaap restated his intention to enforce the law, deploying riot police around the city and sending a contingent to evict a squatted house in the centre owned by ING Bank {{that turned out to be}} empty.|$|R

5000|$|The mediocre {{performance}} of improvised tank destroyers at Cuvelai convinced Ep van Lill, commander of 61 Mechanised, that his men {{could no longer}} be asked to fight tanks with <b>armoured</b> cars. <b>Van</b> Lill informed General Viljoen that the Eland-90 simply could not stand up to the heavier protection and armament of T-54/55s. [...] "Tank busting" [...] expended too much 90mm ammunition and fatigued recoil systems. As demonstrated during Askari, crew morale was also affected when ordered to take on T-55s in their vulnerable vehicles.
