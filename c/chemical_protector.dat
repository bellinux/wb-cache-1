Biological effects of these electrons are critically dependent on the cellular and subcellular localization of their emitters. In this study 123 I was used due to its relatively short half-life (13. 2 h) and ideal y-ray energy (Ey=I 59 keV). The short half-life is advantageous since it allows significant accumulation of disintegrations at normal physiological conditions without the need to freeze cells as required when long lived isotopes such as 1251 (T 1 / 2 = 60. 1 days) are used. The main objective {{of this study was to}} synthesize an organic compound that would deliver the radioactive 1231 into cellular DNA and to quantify the resulting damage from micronucleation. The higher degree of damage obtained in cell samples treated with 4 -[123 I]iodoantipyrine than with [123 I]Nal is an indication of Auger electron effect. Also, micronuclei counts showed that 4 -[123 I]iodoantipyrine and [123 I]Nal were prepared in a suitable manner and did not interfere with cellular kinetics. RBE values of 1. 8 and 1. 9 were obtained for CHO-Kl clone # 7 and # 16 cells, respectively, indicating lack of differential response for the two clones. When the current data is collectively analysed with that of other investigators using the same radiolabeled compounds, a reduction in Auger electron RBE is noticeable with radiosensitivity. This is consistent with the high-LET nature of Auger electrons. The extremely radiosensitive CHO-XRS 1 failed to give a dose-response as most cells underwent apoptosis. The significant radioprotection of CHO-K 1 cells irradiated, in the presence of a <b>chemical</b> <b>protector</b> MEA, with 4 -[123 I]iodoantipyrine than with [123 I]Nal showed that the mode by which Auger electrons cause damage is not the same as that of a-particles. Further studies involving the use of carriers that would specifically deliver radionuclides to nuclear DNA may be useful in understanding the mechanisms underlying the cellular responses to Auger electron exposure.

3000|$|Use of a {{fundamental}} concept, henceforth {{referred to as}} the scission fraction of cellulose unit (SFCU), was suggested to clarify the cleavage reactivity of cellulose during oxygen delignification (OD). According to the SFCU theory, the cleavage activity of pulp cellulose remains relatively undisturbed provided the experimental conditions are maintained regardless of pulp origin. SCFU is a universal variable for evaluating how processes and additives affect the degree of pulp cellulose degradation. Specifically in this study, the effects of the protector additives MgSO 4 and phenol on the oxygen delignification (OD) process were investigated. Both phenol and MgSO 4 retard the cleavage rate of the cellulose chain, but the retarding effect of MgSO 4 is greater than that of phenol. Phenol alone cannot significantly improve the selectivity of the OD process, whereas MgSO 4 can decrease the cleavage rate of cellulose and increase the selectivity of OD. Moreover, synergistic selectivity enhancement for pulp using a combination of MgSO 4 and phenol was observed. The protective effect of various <b>chemical</b> <b>protectors</b> was additive, whereas the retarding effect on delignification was not.|$|R
40|$|The {{advantages}} {{gained by}} a combined treatment of different <b>chemical</b> <b>protectors</b> on short-term lethality of X-irradiated adult male mice have been studied. The following compounds were given alone or {{in a mixture of}} two or three compounds: 16, 16 -dimethyl PGE 2 (PGE 2), cysteine (Cys), glucan, glutathione (GSH), 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), mercaptoproprionylglycine (MPG), or WR- 2721. The survival of mice treated before X irradiation with the optimal dose of each radioprotector given separately shows that WR- 2721 and 5 -HT yield the best protection with dose reduction factors (DRFs) of 2. 2 and 1. 7, respectively. Cysteine, glucan, PGE 2, MPG, and GSH, with DRFs of 1. 4, 1. 4, 1. 2, 1. 1, and 1. 1, respectively, are less efficient radioprotectors. When PGE 2 was combined with a low dose of WR- 2721 (200 mg/kg), the protection increased in a synergistic way. The increase in protection offered by a combination of PGE 2 with Cys, glucan, GSH, or 5 -HT is less marked and the effect obtained is only additive. A synergistic action is also obtained with a combination of WR- 2721 (200 mg/kg) and 5 -HT (8 mg/kg) (DRF 2. 7) ...|$|R
30|$|The use of pure <b>chemicals</b> as <b>protectors</b> is {{expensive}} {{and may be}} controversial in food industries, so we propose food-grade argan oil supplementation during the propagation of biomass for wine ADY production, which reproduces their beneficial effects on fermentative capacity. Argan oil contains high levels of linoleic and oleic acids and is rich in polyphenols and tocopherols, which exhibit significant antioxidant activity (Yaghmur et al. 2001). Minor compounds, such sterols, carotenoids, caffeic acid, ascorbic acid, and squalene contribute to its nutritional, dietetic and organoleptic value, and to its preservative and health properties (Bennani et al. 2007). Argan oil improved fermentative capacity in all the strains and, in most of them, also biomass yield. The beneficial effect of argan oil can be mediated by prevention of membrane damage, as it significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, an effect that {{can be attributed to}} some components (vegetable oils, tocopherols, ascorbic acid) acting as neutralizers of lipid peroxyl radicals (Sies and Stahl 1995). Additionally, argan oil also reduced GSSG levels, raised trehalose levels, and modulated the activity of enzymatic activities such as GR and catalase.|$|R
40|$|Chemiluminescence of luminol in a {{cell-free}} {{system was}} used to investigate the mechanism of alloxan-dependent free-radical generation. In the presence of alloxan and reduced glutathione (GSH), luminescence was greatly stimulated by FeSO 4. Replacing GSH by oxidized glutathione or NAD(P) (H), or replacing FeSO 4 by CuSO 4, ZNSO 4 or FeCl 3, did not yield chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescence of a mixture of alloxan. GSH, FeSO 4 and luminol was inhibited by catalase, superoxide dismutase, scavengers of hydroxyl radicals (sodium benzoate, n-butanol, D-mannitol, dimethyl sulphoxide) or metal-ion chelators (EDTA, diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid, diethyldithiocarbamate. desferroxamine), D-glucose, L-glucose, D-mannose, D-fructose, 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose, NAD+, NADH, NADP+ or NADPH, but not by urea or enzymically inactive superoxide dismutase. The results {{support the hypothesis that}} the diabetogenic action of alloxan is mediated by hydroxyl radicals generated in an iron-catalysed reaction. Protection against alloxan in vivo depends both on the <b>chemical</b> reactivity of <b>protector</b> with radicals or radical-generating systems and on the stereospecific requirement of some strategic site in the B-cell...|$|R
