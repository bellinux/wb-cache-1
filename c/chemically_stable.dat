5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not <b>chemically</b> <b>stable</b> enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E

Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed).

5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical methods {{have been developed for}} covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and <b>chemically</b> <b>stable,</b> it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{organometallic}} chemistry includes the 19th-century discoveries of Zeise's salt and nickel tetracarbonyl. These compounds posed {{a challenge to}} chemists as the compounds did not fit with existing chemical bonding models. A further challenge arose {{with the discovery of}} ferrocene, the iron analogue of rhodocene and the first of the class of compounds now known as metallocenes. Ferrocene was found to be unusually <b>chemically</b> <b>stable,</b> as were analogous chemical structures including rhodocenium, the unipositive cation of rhodocene and its cobalt and iridium counterparts. The study of organometallic species including these ultimately {{led to the development of}} new bonding models that explained their formation and stability. Work on sandwich compounds, including the rhodocenium-rhodocene system, earned Geoffrey Wilkinson and Ernst Otto Fischer the 1973 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} organic compound, methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen. Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound. Other organolead compounds are less <b>chemically</b> <b>stable.</b> For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E
40|$|Yttria {{stabilized}} zirconia (YSZ), as {{an excellent}} oxygen ion conductor, is increasingly {{used as an}} oxygen ion membrane for the anode in the FFC Cambridge process.

In this work, we report, as opposed to previous reports, that YSZ is <b>chemically</b> not <b>stable</b> in molten CaCl 2 -CaO melts. Electromigration only accelerates the instability. The degradation is seen to occur by leaching of yttria in solution leading to the formation of monoclinic zirconia which, being porous, reacts with the molten electrolyte to form calcium zirconate.

5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more <b>chemically</b> <b>stable</b> than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

The columnar {{shape of the}} original ZnO with an average diameter of 300 nm and length of 1 2 m is kept in these processes. Reactive treatment of the grown films in sulfur vapour or H 2 S gas results in complete or partial conversion to ZnS and some affection of the underlying SnO 2 substrate. The <b>chemically</b> less <b>stable</b> ZnO cores of partially converted columns can be dissolved so that ZnS tubes with wall thicknesses up to 50 nm remain.

25|$|It is {{the most}} {{thermally}} stable binary silicon compound, only decomposing through loss of silicon starting from around 2700°C. It is resistant to most aqueous acids, phosphoric acid being an exception. It forms a protective layer of silicon dioxide {{on the surface and}} hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000°C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl4 and carbon at 100°C and SiCl4 and CCl4 at 1000°C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory materia, as it is <b>chemically</b> <b>stable</b> and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge.

25|$|Photolithography {{involves}} {{exposing a}} light source to a photoresist-coated silicon wafer; a mask with the desired pattern is {{place between the}} light source and the wafer, thereby selectively allowing light to filter through and create the pattern on the photoresist. Further development of the wafer brings out the pattern in the photoresist. Photolithography performed in the near-UV is often viewed as the standard for fabricating topographies on the micro-scale. However, because the lower limit for size {{is a function of}} the wavelength, this method cannot be used to create nanoscale features. In their 2005 study, Mahoney et al. created organized arrays of polyimide channels (11µm in height and 20–60µm in width) were created on a glass substrate by photolithography. Polyimide was used because it adheres to glass well, is <b>chemically</b> <b>stable</b> in aqueous solution, and is biocompatible. It is hypothesized that the microchannels limited the range of angles that cytoskeletal elements within the neurite growth cones could accumulate, assemble, and orient. There was a significant decrease in the number of neurites emerging from the soma; however, there was less decrease as the range of angles over which the neurites emerged was increased. Also, the neurites were on average two times longer when the neurons were cultured on the microchannels versus the controls on a flat surface; this could be due to a more efficient alignment of filaments.|$|E
