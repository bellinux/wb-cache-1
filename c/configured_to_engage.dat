30|$|However, {{in order}} to {{differentiate}} between benign and malicious P 2 P traffic, PeerSharkPeerShark relies on ‘behavioral’ differences in the flows/conversations of P 2 P bots and apps. If two bot-peers mimic a benign P 2 P application, our system may fail in detecting them accurately. To elaborate more on this, consider the following scenario: a bot-master could <b>configure</b> his bots <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> in occasional file-sharing activity with each other on a regular P 2 P network (like eMule, uTorrent, etc.). Seeing such benign-like activity on a host, PeerSharkPeerShark is likely to mis-classify the flows/conversations between them as ‘benign’. But, since occasional file-sharing by bots involves network bandwidth usage (and, say, accompanying monetary charges), such an activity has the likelihood of getting noticed by {{the owner of the}} system or a network administrator and is thus fraught with risks for the bot-master. Nonetheless, we admit that it is possible for bot-masters to design smarter bots which mimic benign-like behavior and/or add noise (or randomness) to their communication patterns and thus evade the present detection mechanism of PeerSharkPeerShark. Authors in [38] argue on a similar case by building a botnet with Skype and validate their assertions with simulations.|$|R
