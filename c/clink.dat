5|$|St. Gatien {{returned}} to Newmarket on October 12 {{to attempt to}} win a second Cesarewitch. On this occasion, he was assigned a weight of 131 pounds, twenty-three pounds {{more than any of}} the seventeen other runners. He made little show in the race and finished unplaced behind Stone <b>Clink.</b> Two days later, St. Gatien was given a chance to redeem his reputation when he met Stone <b>Clink</b> again in Her Majesty's Plate over two miles. This race was at level weights and St. Gatien had no difficulty justifying his position as 4/9 favourite, taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning very easily by three lengths.|$|E

5|$|Marty Friedman {{filled the}} guitarist {{position}} at the recommendation of Ron Laffitte, a member of Capitol management. Laffitte had heard Dragon's Kiss, a solo recording by Friedman {{when he was in}} Cacophony. Mustaine and Ellefson were satisfied with Friedman's style and thought he understood Megadeth's music. With Friedman in the group, the band completed what fans consider the definitive Megadeth lineup. The revitalized band entered Rumbo Studios in March 1990 with co-producer Mike <b>Clink</b> to begin Megadeth's most critically acclaimed album to date, Rust in Peace. For the first time the band's members remained sober in the studio, alleviating many problems which plagued previous albums. <b>Clink</b> was the first producer to complete a Megadeth album without being fired. Its recording was documented in Rusted Pieces, a home video released in 1991 with six music videos and an interview with the band.|$|E

5|$|Southwark {{was settled}} by the Romans around 43 CE. It {{served as an}} entry point into London from {{southern}} England, particularly along Watling Street, the Roman road from Canterbury; this ran into what is now Southwark's Borough High Street and from there north to old London Bridge. The area became known for its travellers and inns, including Geoffrey Chaucer's Tabard Inn. The itinerant population brought with it poverty, prostitutes, bear baiting, theatres (including Shakespeare's Globe) and prisons. In 1796 there were five prisons in Southwark—the <b>Clink,</b> King's Bench, Borough Compter, White Lion and the Marshalsea—compared to 18 in London as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, <b>clink,</b> cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
25|$|Long time Guns N' Roses {{producer}} Mike <b>Clink</b> {{was reported}} to have worked on the album during its conception. Moby, Youth and Tim Palmer all briefly worked on the album. According to Rolling Stone, engineer Andy Wallace, who had worked with bands such as Nirvana, Sepultura, Slayer and Bad Religion, was working on the album in 2006. Other producers who have worked on the album include Bob Ezrin, Eric Caudieux and Sean Beavan. Caram Costanzo and Axl Rose are the final credited producers on the final album.|$|E

500|$|... …And Justice for All was {{recorded}} from January to May 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Metallica produced the album with Flemming Rasmussen. Rasmussen was initially unavailable for the planned start on January 1, 1988, {{and the band}} brought in Mike <b>Clink,</b> who had caught their attention for producing Guns N' Roses' debut Appetite for Destruction (1987). Things did not work out as planned, and three weeks later Rasmussen became available after Ulrich gave him a call. Rasmussen listened to Clink's rough mixes for the album on his February 14 flight to Los Angeles, and upon his arrival <b>Clink</b> was fired. Hetfield explained that recording with <b>Clink</b> did not work out so well, and Rasmussen came over as a last-minute replacement. However, <b>Clink</b> is credited with engineering the drums {{on two of the}} album's tracks: [...] "The Shortest Straw" [...] and [...] "Harvester of Sorrow". While waiting for Rasmussen to arrive, the band recorded two cover songs—"Breadfan" [...] and [...] "The Prince"—to [...] "fine‑tune the sound while they got into the studio vibe". Both were released as B-sides of the [...] "Harvester of Sorrow" [...] CD single, as separate B-sides for [...] "Eye of the Beholder" [...] and [...] "One" [...] respectively, and were included on the covers album Garage Inc. (1998).|$|E
500|$|The title [...] "Rust in Peace" [...] was {{inspired}} by a bumper sticker that Mustaine saw {{on the back of a}} vehicle while driving home from Lake Elsinore, California. The sticker read: 'May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace'. Mustaine liked the concept and decided to use it as a title for Megadeth's upcoming album. Rust in Peace was recorded in Rumbo Studios with producer Mike <b>Clink,</b> while the mixing was handled by Max Norman. <b>Clink</b> was brought in for his work on both Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction and UFO's Strangers in the Night. The producer's work dealt mostly with the bass, drums and Friedman's guitar. In a 2002 interview, Mustaine declared that they [...] "really didn’t make the record with [...] " [...] as at the time he was focused on Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and II — which were also being recorded at Rumbo — and stated most of the work in the album was done by himself, Norman, and engineer Micajah Ryan.|$|E

[...] Cullum's version peaked at number two on the Ultratip chart in Belgium, number 28 in the Netherlands and number 58 in Germany. A music video for the song was released on December 2, 2009 on Cullum's YouTube Vevo channel.|$|E

They recorded the album at Conway Recording Studios and The Record Plant with Mike <b>Clink</b> and Slash co-producing and Steven Thompson and Michael Barbiero mixing, {{all of whom had}} worked with Guns N' Roses on their debut album Appetite for Destruction. The album featured contributions by Duff McKagan (who co-wrote [...] "Beggars & Hangers-On"), Dizzy Reed on keyboards, Teddy Andreadis on harmonica, and Paulinho da Costa on percussion.

500|$|Mackenzie left in 1844, and {{although}} he had achieved a great deal, {{the weakness of the}} St Kildans' dependence on external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of Rev. John Mackay. Despite their fondness for Mackenzie, who stayed in the Church of Scotland, the St Kildans [...] "came out" [...] in favour of the new Free Church during the Disruption. Mackay, the new Free Church minister, placed an uncommon emphasis on religious observance. He introduced a routine of three two-to-three-hour services on Sunday at which attendance was effectively compulsory. One visitor noted in 1875 that: [...] "The Sabbath was a day of intolerable gloom. At the <b>clink</b> of the bell the whole flock hurry to Church with sorrowful looks and eyes bent upon the ground. It is considered sinful to look to the right or to the left." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the fact that Shakespeare failed twice to pay his taxes for St Helen's parish, Bishopsgate, London, where he is listed by name for the year 1596/7, and he is not among those “in any of the annual lists of residents of the <b>Clink</b> parish (St Saviour’s) compiled by the officers who made the rounds to collect tokens purchased by churchgoers for Easter Communion, which was compulsory.” An explanation is offered by historian Walter Godfrey, who suggests that the playwright's default at Bishopsgate was simply because he had moved to the <b>Clink</b> parish at the end of that year, where taxes were collected by the landowner (the bishop of Winchester) and not parish officials. The bishop then remitted the outstanding sum to Shakespeare's former parish [...] "as a matter of convenience".|$|E
2500|$|The Lee–Enfield bolt was {{shortened}} to {{feed the}} [...]45 ACP rounds; the Lee–Enfield's magazine set-up was replaced with a new assembly that held a modified M1911 magazine.

A semi-automatic weapon would not have offered this option as the cycling of the bolt coupled with rearward escaping propellant gas and the <b>clink</b> of the empty case against any hard surface would produce a noise with each shot. As silent as the carbine was, it was not very accurate.|$|E
