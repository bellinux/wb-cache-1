At times, the cap becomes widely funnel-shaped, {{and sometimes}} features a broad or pointed umbo, though {{the centre of}} the cap is typically depressed. The cap is coloured grey, sometimes with violet, flesh-coloured, pale yellowish-brown or red tints, though it is paler towards the cap margin in young mushrooms. Very pale specimens have also been recorded in the United States, though they are not true albinos. The cap's margin is curved inwards in younger specimens, and wavey. The cap surface is smooth, and can be slimey or sticky when wet. The stem measures [...] by , and is generally cylindrical in shape. Sometimes the stem narrows downwards, or is club-shaped. In colour, the stem whitish or greyish, paler at the top, and is rather weak and easily broken. The flesh is a whitish-buff colour, and is often absent in the stem, leaving it hollow. The crowded gills are can be decurrent (with the gill running down the stem) or adnate (with the entire depth of the gill connecting to the stem), and in colour are whitish to a dirty buff. They are thin and flaccid, and there are three to four tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem from the cap margin). The gills produce white milk, which dries a brownish or greenish grey after about 20 minutes. The mushroom flesh will slowly stain a greyish colour if a drop of FeSO4 solution is applied to it as a chemical <b>colour</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

40|$|Mimosa pigra is {{a member}} of Mimosa (Mimosaceae) genus. This genus is known for various members who have a {{reputation}} in indigenous medicine. The present study was carried out to identify the classes of phytochemicals present in M. pigra, since there is limited study done on identification of phytochemical composition of M. pigra. The present research involves preparation of leaf extracts by using petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water as solvent.

Mamie and Kenneth did this experiment in order to investigate the development of racial identity in African American children. The <b>colouring</b> <b>test</b> was administered to 160 African American {{children between the ages of}} five and seven years old. The children were given a piece of colouring paper with a leaf, an apple, an orange, a mouse, a boy and a girl on it. They were all given a box of crayons and asked to first colour the mouse to make sure they had a basic understanding of what colours things should be. If they pass, they were then asked to colour a boy if they were a boy and a girl if they were a girl. They were told to colour the boy or girl the colour that they are. They were then told to colour the opposite sex the colour that they want that sex to be. The children tended to colour the picture a noticeably lighter colour than what they actually were, but 88% of the children did draw themselves brown or black. They oftentimes drew themselves a lighter shade than the mouse. Children that were older generally were more accurate at determining how dark they should be. When asked to colour the picture of the child that was the opposite sex, 52% put either white or an irrelevant colour.|$|R
