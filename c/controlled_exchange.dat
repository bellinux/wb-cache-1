30|$|The {{mechanism}} proposed herein is {{also based}} on an angular metric, but as we will show in Section  3, {{it does not require}} the implementation of a local planarization procedure and still guarantees the delivery of the data packets. In Section  4, we compare the performance of the face routing variant with our proposal and show that the routing cost is significantly reduced. In our routing protocol, the nodes are not required {{to keep track of the}} links having been switched off. Moreover, the forwarder resolution protocol, also proposed in this article, is quite effective in identifying from the very first <b>control</b> <b>exchange</b> the best forwarder candidates among the neighbouring nodes. This latter feature allows that a large majority of the neighbouring nodes be released of further <b>control</b> <b>exchanges</b> which translates on significant energy savings.|$|R

Isolation of transactions, as guaranteed by the ACID transaction properties, contradicts the need of cooperation between users.

Our model ensures that the joint execution of a cooperative activity is equivalent to one that could have been carried out by a single user. This is achieved by a <b>controlled</b> <b>exchange</b> of intermediate, but semantically correct information between collaborating users. Each user participating in a cooperative activity has his own private workspace that is isolated form other users.
