5|$|Severe and {{complicated}} malaria {{are almost always}} caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease.

5|$|Severe malaria {{is usually}} caused by P.falciparum (often {{referred}} to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Systematic {{review to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between Plasmodium falciparum infection and cognitive function. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, and hand-searched journals and PhD theses. The inclusion criteria were (1) use of standardized tests for the specific populations and/or appropriate controls; (2) clear differentiation between children and adults. Eighteen studies were eligible, of which three gave information on all cognitive domains considered in the review. RESULTS: Deficits in attention, memory, visuo-spatial skills, language and executive functions may occur after malaria infection. These deficits are not only caused by <b>cerebral</b> falciparum <b>malaria,</b> but also appear to occur in less severe infections. P. falciparum seems to affect the brain globally, not in a localised fashion. Outcome depends on both biological and social risk factors.

The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause <b>cerebral</b> <b>malaria.</b>|$|E
40|$|Serum {{antibody}} {{response to}} plasmodial antigens {{was investigated in}} 97 Thai patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. No difference in immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels was detected between groups without or with <b>cerebral</b> manifestations of <b>malaria</b> (n = 40). In patients with the most severe form of the disease, i. e., those who died despite adequate therapy (n = 12), antibody detected in the immunofluorescent-antibody test was found at lower levels than in those who recovered (geometric means: IgG = 1 / 420 versus 1 / 3, 800; IgM = 1 / 15 versus 1 / 70); similarly, precipitating malarial antibodies were present in only 1 of these 12 patients, while they were detectable in 65 of the remaining 85 patients (76. 5 %). In contrast, anticytomegalovirus antibody levels were similar in the different groups of patients. Results show that depression of antibody response may extend to antiplasmodial responses during severe malaria. The link between fatality and {{a low level of}} antibody production suggests that an appropriate immune response to malarial antigens may be required to achieve recovery with drug treatment and provides a new direction for malaria therapy research...|$|R
40|$|Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} {{is a major}} human health scourge and a key cause of mortality. Its {{pathogenicity}} partly results from the phenomenon of "cytoadherence" mediated by the PfEMP 1 (Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) family. Extracellular domains of PfEMP 1 s are variable and bind various host endothelial receptors, whereas their cytoplasmic domains (VARCs) are relatively conserved. VARCs affix PfEMP 1 s in the human erythrocyte membrane by interacting with host cytoskeleton proteins and exported parasite proteins. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for PfEMP 1 phosphorylation (on VARC) and propose an important function for this modification. Specific inhibitors and enhancers {{have been used to}} identify erythrocytic casein kinase II (CKII) as the enzyme responsible for VARC modification activity. We have also delineated probable CKII target residues on VARC, which mainly reside in an N-terminal acidic cluster. Our data show that VARC phosphorylation alters its binding to parasite encoded knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP). Finally, we demonstrate reduced cytoadherence of infected RBCs to endothelial receptors like ICAM- 1 and CSA (these contribute to <b>cerebral</b> and placental <b>malaria,</b> respectively) in response to their CKII inhibition. Collectively, this study furthers our understanding of VARC function, underscores the importance of erythrocytic CKII in cytoadherence, and suggests a possible new target for anti-cytoadherence molecules...|$|R
40|$|Open access article This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. Infection by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum results in a broad spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from severe and potentially life-threatening malaria to asymptomatic carriage. In a process of naturally acquired immunity, individuals living in malaria-endemic regions build up a level of clinical protection, which attenuates infection severity in an exposure-dependent manner. Underlying this shift in the immunoepidemiology as well as the observed range in malaria pathogenesis is the var multigene family and the phenotypic diversity embedded within. The var gene-encoded surface proteins Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 mediate variant-specific binding of infected red blood cells to a diverse set of host receptors that has been linked to specific disease manifestations, including <b>cerebral</b> and pregnancy-associated <b>malaria.</b> Here, we show that cross-reactive immune responses, which minimize the within-host benefit of each additionally expressed gene during infection, can cause selection for maximum phenotypic diversity at the genome level. We further show that differential functional constraints on protein diversification stably maintain uneven ratios between phenotypic groups, in line with empirical observation. Our results thus suggest that the maintenance of phenotypic diversity within P. falciparum is driven by an evolutionary trade-off that optimizes between within-host parasite fitness and between-host selection pressure.

5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially <b>cerebral</b> <b>malaria.</b> These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>malaria,</b> toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E

40|$|Frequencies and {{absolute}} numbers of peripheral T-cell subsets were monitored closely following acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 22 Ghanaian children {{from an area}} of hyperendemicity for seasonal malaria transmission. The children presented with <b>cerebral</b> or uncomplicated <b>malaria</b> (CM or UM, respectively) or with severe malarial anemia. For all patients the frequencies {{and absolute}} numbers of peripheral T cells were lower than normal during the acute stage of disease. This lowering was most pronounced in the CM group and least pronounced in the UM group. Of particular interest, the CM patients showed markedly reduced frequencies of CD 4 + cells, the number of which also normalized slower than in the other clinical groups. In all patients, the T-cell frequencies gradually approached normal values after the initiation of therapy, whereas the absolute numbers rapidly reverted from lower than normal to higher than normal before returning to steady-state levels. Furthermore, the initially reduced T-cell surface density of the T-cell receptor/CD 3 complex, which rapidly normalized, was a general finding for all three clinical groups, suggesting a state of peripheral T-cell hyporesponsiveness during acute malaria. The data presented suggest a rapid therapy-induced reemergence of T cells that had been temporarily removed from the peripheral circulation {{as a consequence of}} the malaria attack and that the degree of the disease-induced T-cell reallocation correlates with disease severity...|$|R
40|$|The {{adhesion}} of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes {{to human}} tissues or endothelium {{is central to}} the pathology caused by the parasite during malaria. It contributes to the avoidance of parasite clearance by the spleen and to the specific pathologies of <b>cerebral</b> and placental <b>malaria.</b> The PfEMP 1 family of adhesive proteins is responsible for this sequestration by mediating interactions with diverse human ligands. In addition, as the primary targets of acquired, protective immunity, the PfEMP 1 s are potential vaccine candidates. PfEMP 1 s contain large extracellular ectodomains made from CIDR (cysteine-rich interdomain regions) and DBL (Duffy-binding-like) domains and show extensive variation in sequence, size, and domain organization. Here we use biophysical methods to characterize the entire ∼ 300 -kDa ectodomain from IT 4 VAR 13, a protein that interacts with the host receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1). We show through small angle x-ray scattering that IT 4 VAR 13 is rigid, elongated, and monomeric. We also show that it interacts with ICAM- 1 through the DBLβ domain alone, forming a 1 : 1 complex. These studies provide a first low resolution structural view of a PfEMP 1 ectodomain in complex with its ligand. They show that it combines a modular domain arrangement consisting of individual ligand binding domains, with a defined higher order architecture that exposes the ICAM- 1 binding surface to allow adhesion...|$|R

The median fever clearance time was shorter for chloroquine (27 hours) than for quinine (42 hours) or for P-S (36 hours) (P = 0. 02 and P = 0. 06, respectively). The parasite clearance times were similar for chloroquine and P-S, but significantly shorter for chloroquine compared with quinine (54 hours vs 66 hours) (P = 0. 007) and for P-S compared with quinine (42 hours vs 66 hours) (P < 0. 001). However, three children who received chloroquine and three who received P-S required a change to treatment with quinine {{because of a}} clinical failure of their initial treatment. Four children died, one in the chloroquine group, one in the quinine group and two in the P-S group. Despite {{a high level of}} chloroquine resistance in the community, the majority of Gambian {{children with}} complicated malaria responded satisfactorily to parenteral chloroquine given under supervision. The clinical failure rates of chloroquine and P-S were similar.

25|$|The most {{dangerous}} malarial infection {{is in the}} brain and is called <b>cerebral</b> <b>malaria.</b> In <b>cerebral</b> <b>malaria,</b> the PfEMP1 proteins involved are DC8 and DC13.

Initially, it was assumed that PfEMP1 binds to ICAM1 in the brain, but DC8 and DC13 were found incompatible with ICAM1. Instead DC8 and DC13 specifically bind to EPCR using CIDRα sub-types such as CIDRα1.1, CIDRα1.4, CIDRα1.5 and CIDRα1.7. However, it was later shown that DC13 can bind to both ICAM1 and EPCR.

25|$|P. falciparum works via sequestration, a {{distinctive}} property {{not shared by}} any other Plasmodium.

40|$|During the asexual cycle, Plasmodium falciparum {{extensively}} remodels {{the human}} erythrocyte {{to make it}} a suitable host cell. A large number of exported proteins facilitate this remodeling process, which causes erythrocytes to become more rigid, cytoadherent, and permeable for nutrients and metabolic products. Among the exported proteins, a family of 89 proteins, called the Plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric (PHIST) protein family, has been identified. While also found in other Plasmodium species, the PHIST family is greatly expanded in P. falciparum. Although a decade has passed since their first description, to date, most PHIST proteins remain uncharacterized and are of unknown function and localization within the host cell, and there are few data on their interactions with other host or parasite proteins. However, over the past few years, PHIST proteins have been mentioned in the literature at an increasing rate owing to their presence at various localizations within the infected erythrocyte. Expression of PHIST proteins has been implicated in molecular and cellular processes such as the surface display of PfEMP 1, gametocytogenesis, changes in cell rigidity, and also <b>cerebral</b> and pregnancy-associated <b>malaria.</b> Thus, we conclude that PHIST proteins are central to host cell remodeling, but despite their obvious importance in pathology, PHIST proteins seem to be understudied. Here we review current knowledge, shed light on the definition of PHIST proteins, and discuss these proteins with respect to their localization and probable function. We take into consideration interaction studies, microarray analyses, or data from blood samples from naturally infected patients to combine all available information on this protein family...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} river {{blindness}} (onchocerciasis) {{has been one}} of the major public health achievements of recent decades. Initially, vector control was used to stop transmission of the parasite Onchocerca volvulus by blackflies (Simulium) but the introduction of ivermectin (Mectizan) as a means of morbidity control enabled new strategies of distribution to be developed based on community directed treatment. The donation of Mectizan by Merck & Co. Inc. for onchocerciasis control in 1987 `as long as needed' was a public health landmark to be followed by a donation from GlaxoSmithKline of albendazole in 1997 for lymphatic filariasis to which Merck also responded by agreeing to extend their donation to include the coadministration of Mectizan and albendazole. Both the drugs, however, have wider impacts than those specific to filarial parasites and are effective against a range of intestinal parasites, whilst ivermectin has an important effect on ectoparasites. The wider benefits of the annual public health intervention-collateral benefits-therefore include deworming, improved nutritional status, increased growth, improved school performance and attendance, and improved haemoglobin status as a result of the impact of albendazole on hookworm, a major cause of anaemia. More recently, studies suggest that worm-free children have a significantly reduced frequency of malaria specific episodes of fever and Ascaris-infected children have a two-fold higher frequency of <b>cerebral</b> or severe <b>malaria</b> than those without Ascaris. These findings suggest that programmes based on annual interventions to control river blindness and lymphatic filariasis can contribute disproportionately more to a range of public health problems than has been hitherto recognized, thereby assisting in attaining the millennium development goal targets...|$|R

25|$|It is a {{reasonable}} assumption that until modern treatment was available {{three quarters of the}} SS homozygotes failed to reproduce. To balance this loss of sickle-cell genes, a mutation rate of 1:10.2 per gene per generation would be necessary. This is about 1000 times greater than mutation rates measured in Drosophila and other organisms and much higher than recorded for the sickle-cell locus in Africans. To balance the polymorphism, Anthony Allison estimated that the fitness of the AS heterozygote would have to be 1.26 times than that of the normal homozygote. Later analyses of survival figures have given similar results, with some differences from site to site. In Gambians, it was estimated that AS heterozygotes have 90% protection against P. falciparum-associated severe anemia and <b>cerebral</b> <b>malaria,</b> whereas in the Luo population of Kenya it was estimated that AS heterozygotes have 60% protection against severe malarial anemia. These differences reflect the intensity of transmission of P. falciparum malaria from locality to locality and season to season, so fitness calculations will also vary. In many African populations the AS frequency is about 20%, and a fitness superiority over those with normal hemoglobin of the order of 10% is sufficient to produce a stable polymorphism.|$|E
40|$|Background During intra-erythrocytic development, late asexually replicating Plasmodium falciparum parasites {{sequester}} from peripheral circulation. This facilitates {{chronic infection}} and {{is linked to}} severe disease and organ-specific pathology including <b>cerebral</b> and placental <b>malaria.</b> Immature gametocytes - sexual stage precursor cells - likewise disappear from circulation. Recent work has demonstrated that these sexual stage parasites {{are located in the}} hematopoietic system of the bone marrow before mature gametocytes are released into the bloodstream to facilitate mosquito transmission. However, as sequestration occurs only in vivo and not during in vitro culture, the mechanisms by which it is regulated and enacted (particularly by the gametocyte stage) remain poorly understood. Results We generated the most comprehensive P. falciparum functional gene network to date by integrating global transcriptional data from a large set of asexual and sexual in vitro samples, patient-derived in vivo samples, and a new set of in vitro samples profiling sexual commitment. We defined more than 250 functional modules (clusters) of genes that are co-expressed primarily during the intra-erythrocytic parasite cycle, including 35 during sexual commitment and gametocyte development. Comparing the in vivo and in vitro datasets allowed us, for the first time, to map the time point of asexual parasite sequestration in patients to 22 hours post-invasion, confirming previous in vitro observations on the dynamics of host cell modification and cytoadherence. Moreover, we were able to define the properties of gametocyte sequestration, demonstrating the presence of two circulating gametocyte populations: gametocyte rings between 0 and approximately 30 hours post-invasion and mature gametocytes after around 7 days post-invasion. Conclusions This study provides a bioinformatics resource for the functional elucidation of parasite life cycle dynamics and specifically demonstrates the presence of the gametocyte ring stages in circulation, adding significantly {{to our understanding of the}} dynamics of gametocyte sequestration in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a complex}} disease with a {{spectrum}} of symptoms and disabilities. Over the past decade TBI has {{become the focus of}} research due to growing epidemiological and clinical evidences that TBI incidences are strong risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Major pathological hallmarks of AD are massive accumulations of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) toxic oligomers and plaques. Neuroinflammation is also considered as a common denominator in AD and aging. The epidemiological and experimental studies have supported that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs markedly reduce the age-related prevalence of AD and can slow amyloid deposition by mechanisms that still remain elusive. S 100 A 9 is a multifunctional cytokine with diverse roles in the cell signaling pathways associated with inflammation and cancers. A widespread expression of S 100 A 9 was also reported in many other ailments involving inflammatory processes, such as AD, <b>malaria,</b> <b>cerebral</b> ischemia and TBI, implying that S 100 A 9 may be a universal biomarker of inflammation. The distinctive feature of S 100 A 9 compared to other pro-inflammatory cytokines is its ability to self-assemble into amyloids, which may lead to the loss of its signaling functions and acquired amyloid cytotoxicity, exceeding that of Aβ. Methods S 100 A 9 properties was studied under various ex vivo and in vitro conditions. First, human and mouse tissues with TBI and AD were subjected to microscopic, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques. Then, aged mouse treated with native, oligomeric and fibrillary S 100 A 9 was also studied by using behavioral and neurochemical analysis. Moreover, S 100 A 9 was established as a biomarker of dementia progression and compared with others such as Aβ 42 and tau proteins, by studying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from different stages of dementia. Finally, in vitro experiments on S 100 A 9 amyloidogenesis, co-aggregation with Aβ 40 and Aβ 42, digestion and cytotoxicity were also performed by using spectroscopic, atomic force microscopy and cell biology methods. Results S 100 A 9 -driven amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade serves as a link between TBI and AD. We have found that S 100 A 9 contributes to the plaque formation and intraneuronal responses in AD, being a part of the amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade. In TBI we have found that extensive S 100 A 9 neuronal production and amyloid self-assembly is triggered immediately after injury, leading to apoptotic pathways and neuronal loss. S 100 A 9 is an integral component of both TBI precursor-plaques, formed prior to Aβ deposition, and AD plaques, characterized by different degree of amyloid maturation, indicating that all plaques are associated with inflammation. Both intra- and extracellular amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascades are intertwined and showed similar tendencies in human and mouse tissues in TBI and AD. Ex vivo findings are further supported by in vitro experiments on S 100 A 9 amyloidogenesis, digestion and cytotoxicity. Importantly, being highly amyloidogenic itself, S 100 A 9 can trigger and aggravate Aβ amyloid self-assembly and significantly contribute to amyloid cytotoxicity. Moreover, the CSF dynamics of S 100 A 9 levels matches very closely the content of Aβ 42 in AD, vascular dementia and mild cognitive impairment due to AD, emphasizing the involvement of S 100 A 9 together with Aβ in the amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade in these ailments. Conclusions The conclusions of this thesis is that the inflammatory pathways and S 100 A 9 specifically represent a potential target for the therapeutic interventions during various post-TBI stages and far prior AD development to halt and reverse these damaging processes.

For examples, in the most severe cases of malaria, such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>malaria,</b> only the var genes for the PfEMP1 proteins DC8 and DC13 are switched on. Upon the synthesis of DC8 and DC13, their CIDRα1 domains bind to EPCR, which brings about the onset of severe malaria. The abundance of the gene products (transcripts) of these PfEMP1 proteins (specifically the CIDRα1 subtype transcripts) directly relates to the severity of the disease. This further indicates that preventing the interaction between CIDRα1 and EPCR would be good target for a potential vaccine. In pregnancy-associated malaria, another severe type of falciparum malaria, the gene for VAR2CSA (named var2csa) is activated in the placenta. Binding of VAR2CSA to CSA is the primary cause of premature delivery, death of the foetus and severe anaemia in the mother. This indicates that drugs targeting VAR2CSA will be able to prevent the effects of malaria, and for this reason VAR2CSA is the leading candidate for development of a PAM vaccine.|$|E
