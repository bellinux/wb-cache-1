5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> its presence in neighbouring trees.|$|E
5|$|The North-West Mounted Police set up control posts at {{the borders}} of the Yukon Territory or, where that was disputed, at easily {{controlled}} points such as the Chilkoot and White Passes. These units were armed with Maxim guns. Their tasks included enforcing the rules requiring that travellers bring a year's supply of food with them to be allowed into the Yukon Territory, <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> illegal weapons, preventing the entry of criminals and enforcing customs duties.|$|E
5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E

5|$|After causing {{severe damage}} in the United States, the {{remnants}} of Hurricane Bob moved into Atlantic Canada. The highest rainfall amount in the country was 4.37in (111mm) in northern New Brunswick. St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador recorded a record 1inch (26mm) of rainfall during the storm's passage. Gusty winds were observed across the region, and winds reached 68mph (109km/h) in Digby, Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, two 17-year-old girls were washed out to sea near Cape Forchu after being caught in rough swells produced by the storm. Rescue officials quickly began searching operations; however, it was later confirmed that the two had drowned. In Fredericton, New Brunswick, tropical storm-force winds downed trees and power lines, resulting in scattered power outages. Lightning associated with strong storms also reportedly struck some trees in the area. A two-story home in Pointe-Verte collapsed due to high winds. In Petit-Rocher, five fishing boats sank after being overwhelmed by large swells at port. Firefighters in the area were surveying the town all night on August20, <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> downed power lines and trees. Power outages were also reported on Prince Edward Island. The storm left about $1million in damage (1991CAD) on Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy.|$|E

25|$|Every 4,000 kilometres, an {{inspection}} taking about 1½ hours is undertaken. The waste collection tanks are emptied and fresh water tanks are refilled. Acute defects (e.g. malfunctioning doors) are rectified. Furthermore, safety tests are conducted.

50|$|Diagnosis of aquagenic {{urticaria}} {{will begin}} with {{an evaluation of the}} patient's clinical history looking for any signs of what might be causing this severe reaction. The patient will then be put to a water treatment test where water will be applied to the upper body for 30 minutes. Water may be placed directly on the skin or a soaked paper towel may be applied. In many cases distilled water, tap water and saline will be used to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> a difference in reaction. After this is removed the skin will be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> a reaction for the next 10-15 minutes. Because aqugenic urticaria frequently accompanies other types of physical urticaraia, the doctor may perform tests to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> these other conditions. An ice cube may be placed on the forearm for a few minutes to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> cold urticarial, exposure to a hot bath will be used to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> Cholinergis uticaria and the lesions will be inspected to determine the root cause of their appearance.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of the unsuitability of {{microbiological}} techniques, milk pasteurization efficacy is typically monitored by <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which is denatured by pasteurization. B. tuberculosis, the bacterium that requires the highest temperature to be killed of all milk pathogens is killed at ranges of temperature and time similar to those that denature alkaline phosphatase. For this reason, presence of alkaline phosphatase is an ideal indicator of pasteurization efficacy.|$|E

30|$|Considering the {{independent}} set problem as an example, the independence criterion {{does not need}} to be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> every vertex because all vertices that have the same properties in this regard will have the same label.
