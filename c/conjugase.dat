Attachment of SUMO to target proteins is catalyzed by SUMO E 2 <b>conjugase.</b> All haploid or diploid eukaryotes studied to date possess a single indispensable SUMO <b>conjugase.</b> We report here the unanticipated isolation of a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (mutant 5 [mut 5]), in which the previously identified SUMO <b>conjugase</b> gene C. reinhardtii ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (CrUBC 9) is deleted. This surprising mutant is viable and unexpectedly displays a pattern of protein SUMOylation at 25 °C that is essentially identical to wild-type cells. However, unlike wild-type cells, mut 5 fails to SUMOylate a large set of proteins in response to multiple stress conditions, a failure that results in a markedly reduced tolerance or complete lack of tolerance to these stresses. Restoration of expected stress-induced protein SUMOylation patterns as well as normal stress tolerance phenotypes in mut 5 cells complemented with a CrUBC 9 gene shows that CrUBC 9 is an authentic SUMO <b>conjugase</b> and, more importantly, that SUMOylation is essential for cell survival under stress conditions. The presence of bona fide SUMOylated proteins in the mut 5 mutant at 25 °C can only {{be explained by the}} presence of at least one additional SUMO <b>conjugase</b> in C. reinhardtii, a <b>conjugase</b> tentatively identified as CrUBC 3. Together, these results suggest that, unlike all other nonpolyploid eukaryotes, {{there are at least two}} distinct and functional SUMO E 2 conjugases in C. reinhardtii, with a clear division of labor between the two sets: One (CrUBC 9) is involved in essential stress-induced SUMOylations, and one (CrUBC 3) is involved in housekeeping SUMOylations...|$|E

40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} protein {{post-translational modification}} by SUMOylation {{is involved in}} a diverse array of cellular processes, including various stress responses. A fully functional SUMOylation system is present in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and SUMOylation of multiple high molecular weight proteins is induced in response to abiotic stress in this organism. We report here the characterization of a SUMO E 2 <b>conjugase</b> deletion mutant in C. reinhardtii, mut 5. SUMO E 2 <b>conjugase</b> enzymes are responsible for the conjugation of the protein SUMO to a lysine residue within a target protein. C. reinhardtii mutants in which the SUMO E 2 <b>conjugase</b> CrUBC 9 has been deleted (mut 5) fail to modify proteins with SUMO in response to multiple stress conditions, and this failure to SUMOylate generally results in a reduced tolerance to a given stress. Complementation of CrUBC 9 mutants with the deleted gene demonstrates that CrUBC 9 is solely responsible for SUMOylation under stress conditions, and that it predominantly localizes to the nucleus. ^ In addition, we identify the likely presence of two distinct SUMO E 2 <b>conjugase</b> proteins in the C. reinhardtii genome. This is in marked contrast to virtually all other organisms studied to date, in which a single essential SUMO E 2 <b>conjugase</b> has been identified. Bioinformatic analyses allowed the identification of the likeliest candidate for this second SUMO E 2 <b>conjugase,</b> CrUBC 3. Comparison of CrUBC 3 and CrUBC 9 reveals that they have distinct sequence features that distinguish them from other known SUMO E 2 conjugases. In addition, we show that the transcripts encoding these proteins are regulated in a distinct and opposite manner in response to stress, consistent with separate functions for these proteins within the cell. Expression of these proteins in a heterologous yeast system allowed the examination of the functionality of these two proteins as SUMO E 2 conjugases, and suggests that the two likely function in distinct, non-overlapping capacities within C. reinhardtii. ...|$|E

Degradation products of [14 C]PG- 7 which were produced during perfusion were identified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Jejunal mucosal activities of folate <b>conjugase,</b> lactase, sucrase, and maltase were measured in every patient. Malabsorption of both [3 H]PG- 1 and [14 C]PG- 7 was found in every untreated patient, with significant improvement after therapy. The urinary excretion of 3 H and 14 C paralleled the luminal disappearance of both isotopes. The chromatographic patterns of intraluminal degradation products of [14 C]PG- 7 obtained during perfusion {{did not differ from}} those previously found in normal subjects and were similar in studies performed before and after treatment. The activity of folate <b>conjugase</b> was increased in the mucosa of the untreated patients when compared to the post-treatment levels while the activities of mucosal lactase, sucrase, and maltase were originally low and increased significantly after therapy. These observations suggest that folate <b>conjugase</b> originates at a different mucosal locus than the brush border disaccharidases, and are consistent with previous evidence that folate <b>conjugase</b> is an intracellular enzyme. The present studies have demonstrated unequivocal malabsorption of both simple and conjugated folates in tropical sprue.

40|$|The Drosophila morgue gene was {{identified}} as a regulator of programmed cell death and encodes a novel ubiquitination (Ub) protein. Morgue protein contains a distinct combination of functional domains including: a zinc finger, F box, and variant Ub E 2 <b>conjugase</b> domain. This unique combination suggests that Morgue may influence protein ubiquitination and targeting to the 26 S proteasome for degradation. Morgue has been shown to promote turnover of a conserved anti-apoptotic protein, DIAP 1. In {{the first part of this}} study, I present a published paper that describes the isolation and initial analysis of morgue. ^ In the second part of this thesis, I present a published review that discusses different models for Morgue function and describes the identification of a morgue orthologue in mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. This study compares the architecture of the two Morgue proteins, as the F box and <b>conjugase</b> domain within the two proteins are located in similar positions, and the F box and <b>conjugase</b> domains of AgMorgue exhibit 54 % and 66 % amino acid sequence identity to Morgue. Interestingly, the glycine substitution for the active site cysteine in AgMorgue is conserved. A zinc finger motif located at the NH 2 -terminus was also identified in both Morgue proteins. ^ In the third part of this study, I performed additional P-element excision screens to generate specific loss-of-function morgue alleles. Several viable alleles were obtained; however, the mutants appeared weak and were shown to exhibit decreased locomotor capabilities in adult climbing assays. Analysis of mutant embryos using a number of cell-type specific markers revealed partially penetrant disruptions in the number, position, and morphology of specific neurons and glia in both the central and peripheral nervous system. ^ Lastly, I describe strong genetic interactions between morgue mutants and mutations in the effete gene, which encodes a conserved Ub E 2 <b>conjugase</b> that also influences DIAP 1 levels and programmed cell death. Thus, in contrast to either morgue or effete mutants alone, animals homozygous for mutations in both these genes exhibit major disruptions in life cycle progression as they arrest in the third instar larval stage.

We investigated whether ubiquitin <b>conjugase</b> 9 (Ubc 9), the E 2 <b>conjugase</b> for SUMOylation, {{is associated with}} neuro-protection induced by isoflurane preconditioning (IsoPC). In vitro, Ubc 9 protein expression was evaluated at 4 and 24 h after reoxygenation. The role of Ubc 9 in the neuroprotective effect was assessed in {{the presence or absence}} of Ubc 9 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In vivo, rats were preconditionally exposed for 1 h to 2 % isoflurane for five consecutive days followed by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurobehavior-al scores and infarction volume were determined at different times after reperfusion. The role of Ubc 9 in ischemic tolerance was evaluated by intracerebroventricular microinjection with the Ubc 9 siRNA. We showed that isoflurane preconditioning improved the cell viability of the SH-SY 5 Y cells that were challenged by oxygen-glucose deprivation. It also reduced brain infarct volumes and improved neurologic outcomes in the focal cerebral ischemic rat. The expression of Ubc 9 was upregulated by isoflurane preconditioning. Knockdown of Ubc 9 significantly attenuated the isoflurane preconditioning-induced neuroprotective effects. Isoflurane preconditioning-induced neuroprotection against ischemic injuries is mediated by Ubc 9. These results suggest a novel mechanism for isoflurane preconditioning-induced tolerance to cerebral ischemia...|$|E

Its protein product contains a domain, Ubc, characteristic of the catalytic domain of ubiquitin <b>conjugase</b> (E 2) enzymes but lacking an active-site cysteine crucial for ubiquitin <b>conjugase</b> activity.

Conversely, pulse–chase and Western blot experiments in wild-type and mutant fibroblasts indicate that elevation of MDM 2 by overexpression of wild-type p 53, by amplification of the endogenous MDM 2 gene, or by transfection of MDM 2 -expressing constructs promotes TSG 101 loss, which we show occurs by 26 S proteasome-dependent decay.

40|$|Drosophila Morgue is {{a unique}} ubiquitination protein that {{facilitates}} programmed cell death and associates with DIAP 1, a critical cell death inhibitor with E 3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Morgue possesses a unique combination of functional domains typically associated with distinct types of ubiquitination enzymes. This includes an F box characteristic of the substrate-binding subunit in Skp, Cullin, and F box (SCF) -type ubiquitin E 3 ligase complexes and a variant ubiquitin E 2 <b>conjugase</b> domain where the active site cysteine {{is replaced by a}} glycine. Morgue also contains a single C 4 -type zinc finger motif. This architecture suggests potentially novel ubiquitination activities for Morgue. In this study, we address the evolutionary origins of this distinctive protein utilizing a combination of bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches. We find that Morgue exhibits widespread but restricted phylogenetic distribution among metazoans. Morgue proteins were identified {{in a wide range of}} Protostome phyla, including Arthropoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Nematoda, and Platyhelminthes. However, with one potential exception, Morgue was not detected in Deuterostomes, including Chordates, Hemichordates, or Echinoderms. Morgue was also not found in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, Placozoa, or Porifera. Characterization of Morgue sequences within specific animal lineages suggests that gene deletion or acquisition has occurred during divergence of nematodes and that at least one arachnid expresses an atypical form of Morgue consisting only of the variant E 2 <b>conjugase</b> domain. Analysis of the organization of several morgue genes suggests that exon-shuffling events have contributed to the evolution of the Morgue protein.

The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) pho 2 mutant overaccumulates Pi in leaves in Pi-replete conditions.

In pho 2 mutants, Pi does not repress a set of Pi starvation-induced genes, including AtIPS 1, AT 4, and Pi transporters Pht 1; 8 and Pht 1; 9. Map-based cloning identified PHO 2 as At 2 g 33770, an unusual E 2 <b>conjugase</b> gene. It was recently shown that Pi deprivation induces mature microRNA (miRNA [miR 399]) and that overexpression of miR 399 in Pi-replete conditions represses E 2 <b>conjugase</b> expression and leads to high leaf Pi concentrations, thus phenocopying pho 2. We show here that miR 399 primary transcripts are also strongly induced by low Pi and rapidly repressed after addition of Pi. PHO 2 transcripts change reciprocally to miR 399 transcripts in Pi-deprived plants and in miR 399 overexpressers. However, responses after Pi readdition and in β-glucuronidase reporter lines suggest that PHO 2 expression is also regulated by Pi in a manner unrelated to miR 399 -mediated transcript cleavage. Expression of miR 399 was strongly reduced in Pi-deprived Arabidopsis phr 1 mutants, and a subset of Pi-responsive genes repressed in Pi-deprived phr 1 mutants was up-regulated in Pi-replete pho 2 mutants. This places miR 399 and PHO 2 in {{a branch of the}} Pi-signaling network downstream of PHR 1.

We have identified a protein, RWD-containing sumoylation enhancer (RSUME), that enhances overall SUMO- 1, - 2, and - 3 conjugation by interacting with the SUMO <b>conjugase</b> Ubc 9. RSUME increases noncovalent binding of SUMO- 1 to Ubc 9 and enhances Ubc 9 thioester formation and SUMO polymerization. RSUME enhances the sumoylation of IkB in vitro and in cultured cells, leading to an inhibition of NF-kB transcriptional activity. RSUME is induced by hypoxia and enhances the sumoylation of HIF- 1 α, promoting its stabilization and transcriptional activity during hypoxia. Disruption of the RWD domain structure of RSUME demonstrates that this domain is critical for RSUME action.

The luminal disappearance of each folate was markedly impaired after exposure of the patients to dietary gluten and improved by gluten restriction, but not to within the range found in the normal subjects. The luminal disappearance of each folate was markedly impaired after exposure of the patients to dietary gluten and improved by gluten restriction, but not to within the range found in the normal subjects. In each experiment, column chromatography of the luminal aspirates revealed similar spectra of hydrolytic products of [14 C]PG- 7, whereas the fraction of the distal aspirate chromatogram appearing as pteroyl-micron[14 C]glutamyl-gamma-monoglutamate ([14 C]-PG- 1) was similar in all three groups. By accounting for the variable effects of absorption on the luminal appearance of [14 C]PG- 1 and by correcting for mucosal hydrolysis which was not followed by release of [14 C]PG- 1 to the luminal contents, the calculated rate of in vivo hydrolysis of [14 C]PG- 7 to [14 C]PG- 1 was found impaired in both celiac sprue groups, with significant improvement on treatment. In mucosal biopsies from the sprue patients, the in vitro activity of folate <b>conjugase</b> in whole homogenates was higher and the activity of disaccharidase lower than {{in a group of}} 12 normal mucosal biopsies. These in vitro data suggest that the predominant cellular location of mucosal folate <b>conjugase</b> is different from that of disaccharidase, whereas comparison with the results of in vivo hydrolysis suggests that measurement of the enzyme in whole mucosal homogenates overestimates its significant digestive activity. The present studies indicate that (a) the mucosal lesion of celiac sprue significantly limits the intestinal absorption of both simple and conjugated folate, and (b) malabsorption of conjugated folate results from a combination of impaired hydrolysis and decreased mucosal uptake of hydrolytic product...|$|E

The folate content was determined by microbiological assay (Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus) and tri-enzyme (protease, α-amylase and chicken pancreas <b>conjugase)</b> extraction treatment. The folate loss varied among the vegetables from 10 – 64 % on boiling while 1 – 36 % on frying. The higher folate loss was observed during boiling. The folate content in the water derived after boiling different vegetables ranged from 11. 9 ± 0. 5 to 61. 6 ± 2. 5 μg/ 100 mL. The folate loss on boiling was accounted for in the cooking water. The predominant way of folate loss on boiling was leaching rather than thermal degradation which makes boiling the better choice of cooking the studied vegetables for folate intake, provided the cooking water is consumed together with the vegetables...|$|E
40|$|Two {{homologous}} cDNAs, CoFad 2 and CoFac 2, {{were isolated}} from a Calendula officinalis developing seed by a polymerase chain reaction-based cloning strategy. Both sequences share similarity to FAD 2 desaturases and FAD 2 -related enzymes. In C. officinalis plants CoFad 2 was expressed in all tissues tested, whereas CoFac 2 expression was specific to developing seeds. Expression of CoFad 2 cDNA in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) indicated it encodes a Δ 12 desaturase that introduces a double bond at the 12 position of 16 : 1 (9 Z) and 18 : 1 (9 Z). Expression of CoFac 2 in yeast {{revealed that the}} encoded enzyme acts as a fatty acid <b>conjugase</b> converting 18 : 2 (9 Z, 12 Z) to calendic acid 18 : 3 (8 E, 10 E, 12 Z). The enzyme also has weak activity on the mono-unsaturates 16 : 1 (9 Z) and 18 : 1 (9 Z) producing compounds with the properties of 8, 10 conjugated dienes...|$|E
40|$|Upon infection, human {{adenovirus}} (HAdV) must block interferon signaling and {{activate the}} expression of its early genes to reprogram the cellular environment to support virus replication. During the initial phase of infection, these processes are orchestrated by the first HAdV gene expressed during infection, early region 1 A (E 1 A). E 1 A binds and appropriates components of the cellular transcriptional machinery to modulate cellular gene transcription and activate viral early genes transcription. We have identified hBre 1 /RNF 20 as a novel target of E 1 A. hBre 1 is an E 3 ubiquitin ligase which acts with the Ube 2 b E 2 <b>conjugase</b> and accessory factors RNF 40 and WAC 1 to monoubiquitinate H 2 B at K 120 (H 2 B-ub), a mark of chromatin which is highly transcriptionally active. hBre 1 and {{the activity of the}} hBre 1 complex to monoubiquitinate H 2 B, was found to be critical for interferon mediated induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and the establishment of an anti-viral state. During infection, E 1 A targets hBre 1 at ISG gene bodies and blocks the catalytic component of the hBre 1 complex, Ube 2 b from being recruited to ISGs. As a result, E 1 A can antagonize the innate antiviral response by blocking H 2 B monoubiquitination and, as such, ISG transcription. In contrast to blocking hBre 1 activity at ISGs, E 1 A is able to recruit hBre 1 to viral chromatin where hBre 1 participates in the transactivation of HAdV early genes. As E 1 A blocks the catalytic activity of the hBre 1 complex, E 1 A retasks hBre 1, altering hBre 1 function from an E 3 <b>conjugase</b> to a scaffold which recruits the cellular transactivator, hPaf 1. hPaf 1 is recruited by hBre 1 and E 1 A to HAdV early genes to induce activating histone posttranslational modifications, H 3 K 4 trimethylation and H 3 K 79 trimethylation. The ability of E 1 A to target hBre 1 to simultaneously repress cellular IFN dependent transcription while activating viral transcription represents an elegant example of the incredible economy of action accomplished by a viral regulatory protein through a single protein interaction...|$|E
40|$|Synapses are the {{functional}} units of neuronal circuits and {{the sites of}} integration for multiple signaling pathways. Understanding the molecular basis of synaptic function is critical to understanding the bigger picture of how we think, learn, remember and how neurological diseases and disorders disrupt these faculties. Here we characterize the role of bendless (ben) in central synapse formation by utilizing the giant fiber system (GFS), a well established neuronal network in Drosophila melanogaster. Ben is an E 2 <b>conjugase</b> and a key member of the enzyme cascade involved in ubiquitin dependent regulation. Ben was originally identified {{more than two decades}} ago and was believed to be involved in axon guidance as mutants lacked a synaptic connection between the giant fiber (GF) and its target, the jump motor neuron (TTMn). We have been able to redefine Ben function by demonstrating that an incipient GF-TTMn synaptic connection is present in ben mutants. We have also analyzed the synapse with the help of synaptic markers as well as studied its features at an ultrastructural level. By conducting cell autonomous rescue experiments we have spatially determined that ben has a presynaptic function in the GFS. We then used the TARGET system to temporally characterize the gene and have isolated a critical period for Ben function during development. We further assayed protein localization by generating GFP-tagged Ben constructs and have found the protein to be nuclear as well as cytoplasmic. Subsequent studies have identified two multifunctional proteins—Semaphorin 1 a and Distracted—to be putative targets of Ben action. We have also carried out a preliminary characterization of the synaptic roles other components of the ubiquitin system have in the GFS, such as the ubiquitin ligase highwire and the deubiquitinating proteases, fat facets and UBP 2. In summary, we have found the ubiquitin <b>conjugase</b> Ben to have a novel and distinct role as a developmental switch in the establishment of a central synapse. The identification of likely downstream targets of Ben and comparison with related ubiquitin associated proteins suggest that a delicate regulatory balance has to be maintained in order for a synapse that is functionally and morphologically normal to be sculpted. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} HPLC {{method for}} rapid determination of folates in yeast with ultraviolet and fluorescence detection without sample purification has been developed. By {{use of the}} column Aquasil C- 18, specially designed for polar analytes, and gradient elution, {{it was possible to}} separate and determine five folate derivatives: tetrahydrofolate, 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate, and 5 -formyltetrahydrofolate with fluorescence detection, and 10 -formylfolic acid and folic acid with ultraviolet detection. The sample preparation required only a small amount of dry yeast (25 - 50 mg) and included an extraction of folates by heat treatment and deconjugation of folate polyglutamates to monoglutamates with the use of rat serum <b>conjugase.</b> Validation involved investigation of matrix effects, determination of recovery by standard addition method, repeatability, and stability tests. The dominating folate forms in commercial dry baker's yeast were found to be tetrahydrafolate and 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate with a total folate content of 2890 mu g/ 100 g (63. 4 nmol/g). The simplicity of the method makes it suitable for folate screening studies of different yeast strains...|$|E
40|$|Ubiquitination is a {{critical}} posttranslational regulator of protein stability and/or subcellular localization. Here we show that ubiquitination can also regulate proteins by transiently inactivating enzymatic function through conformational change in a dimeric enzyme, which can be reversed upon deubiquitination. Our model system is the thyroid hormone-activating type 2 deiodinase (D 2), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident type 1 integral membrane enzyme. D 2 exists as a homodimer maintained by interacting surfaces at its transmembrane and globular cytosolic domains. The D 2 dimer associates with the Hedgehog-inducible ubiquitin ligase WSB- 1, the ubiquitin <b>conjugase</b> UBC- 7, and VDU- 1, a D 2 -specific deubiquitinase. Upon binding of T 4, its natural substrate, D 2 is ubiquitinated, which inactivates the enzyme by interfering with D 2 's globular interacting surfaces that are critical for dimerization and catalytic activity. This state of transient inactivity and change in dimer conformation persists until deubiquitination. The continuous association of D 2 with this regulatory protein complex supports rapid cycles of deiodination, conjugation to ubiquitin, and enzyme reactivation by deubiquitination, allowing tight control of thyroid hormone action...|$|E
40|$|PIAS (protein {{inhibitor}} of activated STAT) proteins {{interact with}} and modulate {{the activities of}} various transcription factors. In this work, we demonstrate that PIAS proteins xα, xβ, 1, and 3 interact with the small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO- 1 and its E 2 <b>conjugase,</b> Ubc 9, and that PIAS proteins themselves are covalently modified by SUMO- 1 (sumoylated). PIAS proteins also tether other sumoylated proteins in a noncovalent fashion. Furthermore, recombinant PIASxα enhances Ubc 9 -mediated sumoylation of the androgen receptor and c-Jun in vitro. Importantly, PIAS proteins differ in their abilities to promote sumoylation in intact cells. The ability to stimulate protein sumoylation and the interaction with sumoylated proteins are dependent on the conserved PIAS RING finger-like domain. These functions {{are linked to the}} activity of PIASxα on androgen receptor-dependent transcription. Collectively, our results imply that PIAS proteins function as SUMO- 1 -tethering proteins and zinc finger-dependent E 3 SUMO protein ligases, and these properties are likely to explain their ability to modulate the activities of various transcription factors...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{previous}} studies of the folate content of human milk, samples were prepared for assay by a method {{that resulted in a}} turbid solution that was then assayed by a turbidimetric microbiological method. We have used an improved microbiological assay in which the milks were treated with rennin to precipitate casein and heated in a buffered ascorbate to coagulate lactalbumin and lactoglobulin. Milks were obtained serially from nursing mothers for periods ranging from 1 day to 6 months postpartum. The results showed that the folate in human milk has few glutamate residues since treatment with a purified folate <b>conjugase</b> preparation released no additional folate activity for Lactobacillus casei. Colostrum is relatively low in folate, but milk folate increases as lactation proceeds. During each stage of lactation there was great variation in milk folate content among the women. In the case of a folate-deficient woman, supplementation with folic acid resulted in a prompt increase in milk folate level. Am J Clin Nuir 1982 : 36 : 576 - 580.
