40|$|Since {{the birth}} of the republic, the United States has relied on {{contractors}} on the battlefield to meet logistical shortfalls. The use of contractors has proven to {{be an integral part of}} the militarygass warfighting capability. Americagass forces are now deployed in greater frequency and length, than at the height of the Cold War. As a result of this phenomenon and other related factors, the military is now more reliant than ever on contractors. This thesis analyzes the legal issues associated with using <b>Contracted</b> <b>Logistics</b> Support in operational environments. These issues are: that the military does not possess the authority to discipline contractors, that the military can not command and control contractors, that commanders must ensure contractors maintain their noncombatant status, and commanders must consider the risk of contractor nonb 1 sperformance. This thesis also analyzes the decision process of employing contractors using the Recognitionb 1 sPrimed Decision Model. This research offers recommendations and conclusions on improving the use of <b>Contracted</b> <b>Logistics</b> Support from a legal standpoint. Recommendations include revising U. S. law to address the current jurisdictional gap, redefining contractors that accompany the force as combatants, and revising doctrine to reflect the recommended changes to U. S. law and the Law of War...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>logistics</b> <b>contract</b> {{that is to}} say a <b>contract</b> where a <b>logistics</b> operator regulates for the customer the flows of goods from the place of materials’ purchase to the place of distribution of final products. The services performed by the logistics operator generally are: transportation, warehousing, cargo handling, inventory management, etc. No one service prevails over another. So a <b>logistics</b> <b>contract</b> is a mixed contract involving numerous activities of an extremely diverse nature which are no longer considered as stages of the supply chains but as the constituent parts of a complete interrelated logistics activity. There is no legal source for this contract and {{it is for this reason}} that it is necessary to define the legal nature of the contract and to identify the law applicable in order to regulate the logistics provider’s liability and other issues not covered in the contract. In particular this paper illustrates the origin of <b>logistics</b> <b>contracts,</b> the <b>contract</b> parts (<b>logistics</b> operator and customer), the logistics activities, the issue relating the law applicable to this contract, the theses of the doctrine, the absence of case law, the attempt to elaborate standard forms and the inopportunity of a legal regulation because of the presence of many contracts of different content...|$|R
