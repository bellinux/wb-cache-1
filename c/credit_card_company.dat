5|$|The bank's origins {{date back}} to 1658 with the {{foundation}} of Smith's Bank of Nottingham. The creation of the modern bank was announced in 1968, and National Westminster Bank Limited commenced trading on 1 January 1970, after the statutory process of integration had been completed in 1969. The famous three arrowheads symbol was adopted as the new bank's logo; {{it is said to}} symbolise either the circulation of money in the financial system or the bank's three constituents, National Provincial Bank, Westminster Bank, and District Bank (established 1829): the latter had been taken over by National Provincial Bank in 1962 and was allowed to operate under its own name until the formation of National Westminster Bank. The District, National Provincial, and Westminster Banks were fully integrated in the new firm's structure, but Coutts & Co. private bankers (a 1920 National Provincial acquisition, established 1692), Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland (a 1917 Westminster acquisition, established 1836) and the Isle of Man Bank (a 1961 National Provincial acquisition, established 1865) continued as separate operations. Westminster Foreign Bank (established 1913) was restyled International Westminster Bank in 1973. Duncan Stirling, outgoing chairman of Westminster Bank, became first chairman of the fifth largest bank in the world. In 1969 David Robarts, former chairman of National Provincial, assumed Stirling's position. In 1975 {{it was one of the}} first London banks to open a representative office in Scotland. It was a founder member of the Joint <b>Credit</b> <b>Card</b> <b>Company</b> (with Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank and Williams & Glyn's Bank) which launched the Access credit card (now part of MasterCard) in 1972 and in 1976 it introduced the Servicetill cash machine. The same banks, excluding Lloyds, were later responsible for the introduction of the Switch debit card (later branded Maestro) in 1988.|$|E

This agreement required MBNA to pay this sum if it were ever sold to a competitor. In late 2005 Wachovia announced that it would end its relationship with MBNA and start up its own credit card division so that the bank could issue its own Visa cards.|$|E

25|$|Getting {{a higher}} credit limit {{can help a}} credit score. The higher the credit limit on the credit card, the lower the {{utilization}} ratio average for all of a borrower's credit card accounts. The utilization ratio is the amount owed divided by the amount extended by the creditor and the lower it is the better a FICO rating, in general. So if a person has one credit card with a used balance of $500 and a limit of $1,000 as well as another with a used balance of $700 and $2,000 limit, the average ratio is 40 percent ($1,200 total used divided by $3,000 total limits). If the first <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>company</b> raises the limit to $2,000, the ratio lowers to 30 percent, which could boost the FICO rating.|$|E

The deal {{was signed in}} August 2006 under which Itaú agreed to purchase Bank of America's operations in Chile and Uruguay. Prior to the transaction, BankBoston's Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>company,</b> OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks {{were not part of}} the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Itaú stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America's stake in Itaú to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947.|$|E

2500|$|The PayPal Buyer Protection Policy {{states that}} the {{customer}} may file a buyer complaint {{if he or she}} did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described. The customer can open a dispute within 180 days (for registered UK residents 180 days, changed 14 June 2014) from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within 20 days from opening the dispute. [...] If the buyer used a credit card, he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her credit-card company. However, in the UK, where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections (that the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>company</b> is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation) under Section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1979, the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal.|$|E

In 1986, <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>company</b> American Express—rival to official sponsor Visa Inc., began a marketing campaign in Asia promoting merchandise from a fictitious [...] "Olympic Heritage Committee," [...] supposedly based in Switzerland. American Express halted the campaign following complaints by the International Olympic Committee, who threatened to denounce the company's actions with ads and media events in which sports ministers and Olympic athletes from the countries involved in the campaign would cut American Express credit cards into pieces, if they did not withdraw the ads. In a follow-up, American Express released ads featuring a photo from the opening ceremony of the 1986 Asian Games held in the same city, captioned [...] "Amex welcomes you to Seoul," [...] which implied that it was a photo of the Olympics' opening ceremony.|$|E

50|$|Settlement {{companies}} generally package their settlements into {{a larger}} bulk settlement with the creditor for 35% - 50% of the existing balances. The debt settlement companies typically have built up a relationship during their normal business practices with the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> and can come to a settlement agreement quicker and at a more favorable rate than a debtor acting on their own.

25|$|Merchants in the United States {{have been}} {{fighting}} what {{they consider to be}} unfairly high fees charged by <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>companies</b> in a series of lawsuits that started in 2005. Merchants charged that the two main <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> processing <b>companies,</b> MasterCard and Visa, used their monopoly power to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the National Retail Federation and major retailers such as Wal-Mart. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion settlement in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Amazon, chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Before the {{computerization}} {{of credit}} card systems in America, using a credit card to pay at a merchant was significantly more complicated than it is today. Each time a consumer wanted to use a credit card, the merchant would have to call their bank, who in turn had to call the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>company,</b> which then had to have an employee manually look up the customer's name and credit balance. This system was computerized in 1973 {{under the leadership of}} Dee Hock, the first CEO of Visa, allowing transaction time to decrease substantially to less than one minute. [...] However, until always-connected payment terminals became ubiquitous {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, it was common for a merchant to accept a charge, especially below a threshold value or from a known and trusted customer, without verifying it by phone. [...] Books with lists of stolen card numbers were distributed to merchants who were supposed in any case to check cards against the list before accepting them, as well as verifying the signature on the charge slip against that on the card. [...] Merchants who failed to take the time to follow the proper verification procedures were liable for fraudulent charges, but because of the cumbersome nature of the procedures, merchants would often simply skip some or all of them and assume the risk for smaller transactions.|$|E
