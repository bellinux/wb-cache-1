5|$|Islamic society paid <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> medicine, {{following}} a hadith enjoining {{the preservation of}} good health. Its physicians inherited knowledge and traditional medical beliefs from the civilisations of classical Greece, Rome, Syria, Persia and India. These included the writings of Hippocrates such as {{the theory of the}} four humours, and the theories of Galen. al-Razi (ca. 854–925/935) identified smallpox and measles, and recognized that fever {{was a part of the}} body's defenses. He wrote a 23-volume compendium of Chinese, Indian, Persian, Syriac and Greek medicine. al-Razi questioned the classical Greek medical theory of how the four humours regulate life processes. He challenged Galen's work on several fronts, including the treatment of bloodletting, arguing that it was effective.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made his History of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his History of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the Optics convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT] Groundwater is one {{of major}} water {{resources}} in the North China Plain (NCP). The area from Taihang Mountain to Buohaiwan along 38 °N latitude in NCP has been chosen to analyze the evolution of groundwater quality. In viewpoint of water cycle, the authors of present paper paid <b>careful</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that the}} basic characteristics of groundwater qualities are in close relation to groundwater flow system. It was found that groundwater quality changed from Ca-HCO_ 3 type to NaCl type, which matches well with groundwater flow direction from recharge area to discharge area. Based on the results of groundwater usage as well as chemical analysis, it is clearly that both nature and human activities effected greatly on the groundwater quality in NCP...|$|R

25|$|Ngũgĩ is {{regarded}} as one of the most significant interpreters of Frantz Fanon, an influential figure in the field of post-colonial studies. Fanon gave <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the violent ramifications of colonialism on the psyches of the colonized, and that the colonized individual was “stunted” by a “deeply implanted sense of degradation and inferiority.” Ngũgĩ builds upon Fanon’s post-colonial psychoanalysis by proposing art as a means of healing the trauma of colonialism. In Decolonising the Mind, Ngũgĩ discusses, true to Fanon's form, the negative ramifications on the national consciousness as a result of racism, legalized bigotry, and dispossession.|$|E
25|$|Her {{second group}} of paintings, portraits of {{the women of the}} Gonzaga family, was highly {{considered}} by Margherita Gonzaga and she commissioned many paintings from Lucrina. However, her painting had a greater increase in quality after Margherita’s death in 1618. For instance, it was widely known that portraits of important women demanded <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail and a thorough visual record of the model’s costume and accessories. These two qualities were clearly evident in Lucrina’s portrait of Eleonora Gonzaga during her marriage to Emperor Ferdinando II. Some other portraits she did included Margherita Gonzaga when she was a widow and Caterina de’ Medici Gonzaga with a striking resemblance to Saint Helena.|$|E

The {{meaning of a}} portion of Scripture is discerned by paying <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> grammar, syntax, vocabulary and context. In this regard, the historical setting forms part of the context of Scripture, the text itself indicating how important a part. The ELCA, on the other hand, has been open to Historical-Critical Methods of Biblical interpretation which seek to understand the scriptures with primary reference to historical and social context. Most other specific doctrinal {{differences between the two}} churches stem from this overarching disagreement.|$|E
