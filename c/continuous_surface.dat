5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded {{the question of}} whether or not, and to what degree, Heterodontosaurus showed the continuous tooth replacement that is typical for other dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known at that time lacked any indications of continuous tooth replacement: The cheek teeth of the known skulls are worn uniformly, indicating that they formed simultaneously. Newly erupted teeth are absent. Further evidence was derived from the wear facets of the teeth, which were formed by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. The wear facets were merged into one another, forming a <b>continuous</b> <b>surface</b> along the complete tooth row. This surface indicates that food procession was achieved by back and forth movements of the jaws, not by simple vertical movements which was the case in related dinosaurs such as Fabrosaurus. Back and forth movements are only possible if the teeth are worn uniformly, again strengthening the case for the lack of a continuous tooth replacement. Simultaneously, Thulborn stressed that a regular tooth replacement was essential for these animals, as the supposed diet consisting of tough plant material would have led to quick abrasion of the teeth. These observations led Thulborn to conclude that Heterodontosaurus must have replaced its entire set of teeth at once on a regular basis. Such a complete replacement could only have been possible within phases of aestivation, when the animal did not fed. Aestivation also complies with the supposed habitat of the animals, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when food was scarce.|$|E

Polynomial curvature <b>continuous</b> <b>surfaces</b> Constructing low degree polynomial curvature <b>continuous</b> <b>surfaces</b> is a difficult problem. Existing parametric solutions [3, 6, 5] require both {{a large number of}} patches and high degree.

Two variants are developed. One variant {{applies to the}} conventional sprocket subdivision layout, say of Catmull-Clark subdivision, i. e. nested rings consisting of N copies of L-shaped segments with three patches. The curvature <b>continuous</b> <b>surfaces</b> are of degree (6, 6). A second variant, called polar guided subdivision, is particularly suitable for high valences N and to cap cylindrical structures. It yields curvature <b>continuous</b> <b>surfaces</b> of degree (4, 3). Additionally, we discuss a scheme that samples with increasing density to generate a C 2 surface of piecewise degree (3, 3). Curvature continuity is verified by showing convergence of anchored osculation paraboloids. ...|$|R
25|$|Crystalline bulk silicon {{is rather}} inert, but becomes more {{reactive}} at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, <b>continuous</b> <b>surface</b> layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) {{that protects the}} metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900nbsp&°C, but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950nbsp&°C and 1160nbsp&°C and when 1400nbsp&°C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si3N4. Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600nbsp&°C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000nbsp&°C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300nbsp&°C, and bromine and iodine at about 500nbsp&°C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction can be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive in the liquid state, alloying with most metals to form silicides, and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.|$|E

500|$|These derived cheek {{teeth were}} overlapping, {{so that their}} crowns formed a <b>continuous</b> <b>surface</b> on which food could be chewed. The tooth rows were {{slightly}} inset {{from the side of}} the mouth, leaving a space outside the teeth that may have been bounded by a muscular cheek, which would have been necessary for chewing. The hadrosaurs and ceratopsians of the Cretaceous Period, as well as many herbivorous mammals, would convergently evolve somewhat analogous dental batteries. As opposed to hadrosaurs, which had thousands of teeth constantly being replaced, tooth replacement in heterodontosaurids occurred far more slowly and several specimens have been found without a single replacement tooth in waiting. Characteristically, heterodontosaurids lacked the small openings (foramina) on the inside of the jaw bones which are thought to have aided in tooth development in most other ornithischians. Heterodontosaurids also boasted a unique spheroidal joint between the dentaries and [...] the predentary, allowing the lower jaws to rotate outwards as the mouth was closed, grinding the cheek teeth against each other. Because of the slow replacement rate, this grinding produced extreme tooth wear that commonly obliterated most of the denticles in older teeth, although the increased height of the crowns gave each tooth a long life.|$|E

The {{head was}} very {{elongated}} and flat, {{and carried a}} much longer snout than its relative Iguanodon: this rostrum was not curved but straight, off-set {{from the back of}} the skull in an oblique line. The snout was toothless and covered in a horny sheath during life, forming a very wide beak together with a comparable sheath on the short predentary bone at the extreme front of the lower jaws. However, after a rather large diastema with the beak, there were large batteries of cheek teeth on the sides of the jaws: the gaps between the teeth crowns were filled by the points of a second generation of replacement teeth, the whole forming a <b>continuous</b> <b>surface.</b> Contrary to the situation with some related species, a third generation of erupted teeth was lacking.

This land was very fertile; and as both the soil itself and the rocks from which it was formed were of a rich brown color, the country looked even more fertile than it really was. The road was excellent. Indeed, as Philippe had said, it was as hard and smooth as a floor.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper, we analyze the {{relation}} between local image structures (i. e., homogeneous, edge-like, corner-like or texture-like structures) and the underlying local 3 D structure (represented in terms of <b>continuous</b> <b>surfaces</b> and different kinds of 3 D discontinuities) using range data with real-world color images. We find that homogeneous image structures correspond to <b>continuous</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and discontinuities are mainly formed by edge-like or corner-like structures, which we discuss regarding potential computer vision applications and existing assumptions about the 3 D world. In the second part, we utilize the measurements developed in {{the first part}} to investigate how the depth at homogeneous image structures is related to the depth of neighbor edges. For this, we first extract the local 3 D structure of regularly sampled points, and then, analyze the coplanarity relation between these local 3 D structures. We show that the likelihood to find a certain depth at a homogeneous image patch depends on the distance between the image patch and a neighbor edge. We find that this dependence is higher when there is a second neighbor edge which is coplanar with the first neighbor edge. These results allow deriving statistically based prediction models for depth interpolation on homogeneous image structures...|$|R
