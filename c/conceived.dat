5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be <b>conceived</b> not to exist. He argued that if something can be <b>conceived</b> not to exist, then something greater can be <b>conceived.</b> Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be <b>conceived</b> cannot be <b>conceived</b> not to exist and so it must exist. This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E

5|$|After leaving TSR in 1985 {{over issues}} {{with its new}} {{majority}} owner, Gygax continued to create role-playing game titles independently, beginning with the multi-genre Dangerous Journeys in 1992.

30|$|Let NCB {{denote the}} set of {{individuals}} that would exist if Eve and Frank were not to <b>conceive</b> Doris, but not {{if they were to}} <b>conceive</b> Doris. The intersection CB∩NCB is always empty. It seems realistic to think that NCB is non-empty. If Doris were never to exist, the person with whom she eventually would have had children if she had existed, might then find another partner, and <b>conceive</b> children with different identities. It might be that NCB, if Eve and Frank were not to <b>conceive,</b> would contain more people than would CB, if they were to <b>conceive,</b> living under the lower bound, a, of the neutral range, or that any person in NCB would live at a lover level of well-being than any person in CB. Then, we have different types of Non-Identity Cases, and it seems plausible to claim that there are moral reasons for Eve and Frank to <b>conceive.</b> But it seems that Eve and Frank cannot in any simple way appeal to the neutrality intuition, in order to claim that <b>conceiving</b> is something morally optional: they have significant moral reasons against <b>conceiving,</b> which may, or may not, be outweighed by considerations about the well-being of e.g. people that would exist if they were not to <b>conceive.</b>|$|R

25|$|Edwards {{syndrome}} {{occurs in}} {{about one in}} 5,000 live births, but more conceptions {{are affected by the}} syndrome because the majority of those diagnosed with the condition prenatally will not survive to birth.
