40|$|The {{objective}} of this study is, by using finite element analysis (FEA), to characterize the effects of <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> on the thermal stress distribution in a prototypical planar solid oxide fuel cell (pSOFC) stack with compliant mica-based seal gaskets. A three-dimensional (3 -D) FEA model was constructed for a multiple-cell stack to perform comprehensive thermal stress analyses at steady operation and shutdown stages. The constructed 3 -D FEA model consists of complete components in a practical pSOFC stack, including positive electrode-electrolyte-negative electrode (PEN) assembly, interconnect, nickel mesh, glass-ceramic seals, and compressive mica seals. Five different compressive loads (0. 06, 0. 1, 0. 6, 1, and 6 MPa) were applied in the modeling to clamp the given integrated pSOFC stack. Simulation results indicate that increasing the applied <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> from 0. 06 to 0. 6 MPa could eliminate bending deformation in the PEN plate and its supporting frame. For a further increase of the applied <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> to 1 and 6 MPa, the critical stresses in the glass-ceramic and mica sealants increased to a potential failure level. In this regard, a 0. 6 -MPa <b>clamping</b> <b>load</b> is considered an optimal assembly load that can both eliminate bending deformation in the PEN-frame assembly plate and maintain acceptable critical stresses in the glass-ceramic and mica sealants...|$|R
50|$|Clamp loader is {{a generic}} term {{that refers to}} {{replication}} factors called gamma (prokaryotes) or RFC (eukaryotes). The combination of template DNA and primer RNA {{is referred to as}} 'A-form DNA' and it is thought that <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> replication proteins (helical heteropentamers) want to associate with A-form DNA because of its shape (the structure of the major/minor groove) and chemistry (patterns of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors). Thus, <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> proteins associate with the primed region of the strand which causes hydrolysis of ATP and provides energy to open the clamp and attach it to the strand.|$|R

50|$|Processivity {{refers to}} both speed and {{continuity}} of DNA replication, and high processivity {{is a requirement}} for timely replication. High processivity is in part ensured by ring-shaped proteins referred to as 'clamps' that help replicative polymerases stay associated with the leading and lagging strands. There are other variables as well: from a chemical perspective, strand binding proteins stimulate polymerisation and provide extra thermodynamic energy for the reaction. From a systems perspective, the structure and chemistry of many replisome factors (such as the AAA+ ATPase features of the individual <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> sub-units, along with the helical conformation they adopt), and the associations between <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> factors and other accessory factors, also increases processivity.|$|R
50|$|To this point, {{according}} to research by Kuriyan et al., due to their role in recruiting and binding other factors such as priming enzymes and replicative polymerases, clamp loaders and sliding clamps {{are at the heart}} of the replisome machinery. Research has found that <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> and sliding <b>clamp</b> factors are absolutely essential to replication, which explains the high degree of structural conservation observed for <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> and sliding <b>clamp</b> factors. This architectural and structural conservation is seen in organisms as diverse as bacteria, phages, yeast, and humans. That such a significant degree of structural conservation is observed without sequence homology further underpins the significance of these structural solutions to replication challenges.|$|R

Using mutant clamp loaders that are deficient in either ATP binding or hydrolysis in different subunits, we show how the different subunits of an archaeal clamp loader use ATP binding and hydrolysis in distinct ways at different steps in the loading process. Binding of nucleotide by the large subunit {{and three of the}} four small subunits is sufficient for <b>clamp</b> <b>loading.</b> However, ATP hydrolysis by the small subunits is required for release of PCNA to allow formation of the complex between PCNA and the polymerase, while hydrolysis by the large subunit is required for catalytic <b>clamp</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli DNA {{polymerase}} III holoenzyme contains 10 different subunits which assort {{into three}} functional components: a core catalytic unit containing DNA polymerase activity, the beta sliding clamp that encircles DNA for processive replication, and a multisubunit clamp loader apparatus called gamma complex that uses ATP {{to assemble the}} beta clamp onto DNA. We examine here {{the function of the}} psi subunit of the gamma complex clamp loader. Omission of psi from the holoenzyme prevents contact with single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and lowers the efficiency of <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> and chain elongation under conditions of elevated salt. We also show that the product of a classic point mutant of SSB, SSB- 113, lacks strong affinity for psi and is defective in promoting <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> and processive replication at elevated ionic strength. SSB- 113 carries a single amino acid replacement at the penultimate residue of the C-terminus, indicating the C-terminus as a site of interaction with psi. Indeed, a peptide of the 15 C-terminal residues of SSB is sufficient to bind to psi. These results establish a role for the psi subunit in contacting SSB, thus enhancing the <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> and processivity of synthesis of the holoenzyme, presumably by helping to localize the holoenzyme to sites of SSB-coated ssDNA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Sliding clamps, such as Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in eukaryotes, are {{ring-shaped}} protein complexes that encircle DNA {{and enable}} highly processive DNA replication by serving as docking sites for DNA polymerases. In an ATP-dependent reaction, clamp loader complexes, {{such as the}} Replication Factor-C (RFC) complex in eukaryotes, open the <b>clamp</b> and <b>load</b> it around primer-template DNA. Results We built a model of RFC bound to PCNA and DNA based on existing crystal structures of clamp loaders. This model suggests that DNA would enter the clamp at an angle during <b>clamp</b> <b>loading,</b> thereby interacting with positively charged residues {{in the center of}} PCNA. We show that simultaneous mutation of Lys 20, Lys 77, Arg 80, and Arg 149, which interact with DNA in the RFC-PCNA-DNA model, compromises the ability of yeast PCNA to stimulate the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of RFC when the DNA is long enough to extend through the clamp. Fluorescence anisotropy binding experiments show that the inability of the mutant clamp proteins to stimulate RFC ATPase activity is likely caused by reduction in the affinity of the RFC-PCNA complex for DNA. We obtained several crystal forms of yeast PCNA-DNA complexes, measuring X-ray diffraction data to 3. 0 &# 197; resolution for one such complex. The resulting electron density maps show that DNA is bound in a tilted orientation relative to PCNA, but makes different contacts than those implicated in <b>clamp</b> <b>loading.</b> Because of apparent partial disorder in the DNA, we restricted refinement of the DNA to a rigid body model. This result contrasts with previous analysis of a bacterial clamp bound to DNA, where the DNA was well resolved. Conclusion Mutational analysis of PCNA suggests that positively charged residues {{in the center of the}} clamp create a binding surface that makes contact with DNA. Disruption of this positive surface, which had not previously been implicated in <b>clamp</b> <b>loading</b> function, reduces RFC ATPase activity in the presence of DNA, most likely by reducing the affinity of RFC and PCNA for DNA. The interaction of DNA is not, however, restricted to one orientation, as indicated by analysis of the PCNA-DNA co-crystals...|$|R

The <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> consistency concern is founded {{in the fact that}} a portion of the input torque used to create <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> is also used to create threads. The torque used for thread forming may not be consistent due to variations in casting material, hole size and shape due to tooling wear and process variation (thermal and mechanical). There is little data available to understand the magnitude of this concern or to form the basis of potential solutions if the range of <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> variation is very high (> +/- 30 %). The range of variation that can be expected in as-cast hole size and shape over the full life cycle of a high pressure die casting die was established in previous work completed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, (PNNL). This established range of variation was captured in a set of 12 cast bosses by designing core pins at the size and draft angles identified in the sited previous work.

There were two sets of experiments run. First, a series of cast aluminum nuts were made reflecting the range of shape and size variations to be expected over the life cycle of a die casting die. Taptite thread forming fasteners, (a widely used thread forming fastener suitable for aluminum applications), were driven into the various cored, as-cast nuts at a constant input torque and resulting clamp loads were recorded continuously. The <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> data was used to determine the range of clamp loads to be expected. The bolts were driven to failure. The <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> corresponding to the target input of 18. 5 Nm was recorded for each fastener. In a like fashion, a second set of experiments were run with cast magnesium nuts and ALtracs thread forming fasteners, (a widely used thread forming fastener suitable for magnesium applications). Again all clamp loads were recorded and analyzed similarly to the Taptites in aluminum cast nuts. Results from previous work performed on the same test cell for a Battelle project using standard M 8 bolts into standard M 8 nuts were included as a comparator for a standard bolt and nut application. The results for the thread forming fasteners in aluminum cast holes were well within industry expectations of +/- 30 % for out of the box and robustness range testing. The results for the dry and lubed extreme conditions were only slightly higher than industry expectations at +/- 35. 6 %. However, when compared to the actual Battelle results (+/- 40 %) for a standard bolt and nut the tread forming fasteners performed slightly better. The results for the thread forming fasteners in magnesium cast holes were all well within industry expectations of +/- 30 % for all three conditions. The robustness range (. 05 mm larger and smaller holes than the expected wear pattern of a die casting die at full life cycle) results also fell within the industry expectations for standard threaded fasteners. These results were very encouraging. It was concluded that this work showed that <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> variation with thread forming fasteners is consistent with industry expectations for standard steel bolts and nuts at +/- 30 %. There does not appear to be any significant increase in <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> variation due to the application of thread forming fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum or magnesium over the effective life of a die casting mold. The fully implemented potential benefit of thread forming fasteners in as-cast holes of aluminum and magnesium is estimated to be 6 trillion Btu per year for North America. Economic benefit is estimated to be nearly $ 800 million per year. Environmental benefits and quality improvements will also result from full implementation of this technology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of tests in which high strength fasteners, socket head set screws (SHCS), were tightened to yield as a means of generating maximum clamping force.

The results obtained established that the lubrication conditions dramatically affect the magnitude of the maximum <b>clamp</b> <b>load</b> achieved on the joint and the torque distribution on the fastener. The results also enabled an estimate to be made of the coefficient of friction on the various mating surfaces during the tightening and loosening of the fastener.
