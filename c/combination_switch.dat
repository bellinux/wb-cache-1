Participants: A total of 14 consecutive patients were enrolled who had been previously treated with monotherapy or any combination of a beta blocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and/or prostaglandin analog for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG; n= 4) or normal-tension glaucoma (NTG; n= 10). Methods: Patients were switched to DTFC from their prior glaucoma therapy. The IOP was measured at intervals of 4 – 6 weeks, and the visual fields were examined {{at least twice a}} year for 3 years. The annual change of mean deviation (MD slope) was used to quantify visual field loss. Results: The mean MD value was – 5. 9 ± 5. 0 dB at baseline; it was – 5. 6 ± 4. 8 dB at 12 months, – 5. 9 ± 5. 0 dB at 24 months, and – 5. 6 ± 5. 1 dB at 36 months after switching. The mean MD slope was – 0. 2 ± 0. 8 dB/year before switching and 0. 3 ± 1. 3 dB/year from baseline to 1 year, – 0. 3 ± 1. 1 dB/year from 1 – 2 years, and 0. 3 ± 0. 9 dB/year from 2 – 3 years after switching. The mean MD slope from baseline to 36 months was correlated with the IOP reduction rate at 36  months after switching. Visual field progression was associated with the IOP reduction rate at 12 months after switching. Conclusion: Switching to DTFC from prior glaucoma therapy improved the MD slope for at least 3 years. Reduction of the IOP after switching to DTFC was effective for delaying visual field progression. Although our study was not nonrandomized and was small in scale, the findings suggest that DTFC might have a beneficial effect on the visual fields in patients with open-angle glaucoma.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed by formulating an algorithm to reconfigure distribution networks for loss minimization. An efficient technique is used to determine the <b>switching</b> <b>combinations,</b> select the status of the switches, and find the best <b>combination</b> of <b>switches</b> for minimum loss. In the first stage of the proposed algorithm, a limited number of <b>switching</b> <b>combinations</b> is generated and the best <b>switching</b> <b>combination</b> is determined. In the second stage, an extensive search is employed to find out any other <b>switching</b> <b>combination</b> that may give rise to minimum loss compared to the loss obtained in the first stage. The proposed method has been tested on a 33 -bus system, and the test results indicate that it is able to determine the appropriate switching-options for optimal (or near optimal) configuration with less computation. The results have been compared with those of established methods reported earlier and a comparative study is presented. With the proposed method, for any input load conditions of the system, the optimum switching configuration can automatically be identified within a reasonable computer time and hence the method can be effectively employed for continuous reconfiguration for loss reduction. The method can be effectively used to plan and design power systems before actually implementing the distribution networks for locating the tieswitches and providing the minimum number of sectionalking switches in the branches to reduce installation and switching costs...|$|R

By reconfiguring the network, voltage stability can be maximised {{for a particular}} set of loads in distribution systems. A new algorithm is formulated for enhancement of voltage stability by network reconfiguration. Initially, a certain number of <b>switching</b> <b>combinations</b> is generated using the combination of tie and its two neighbouring switches, and the best <b>combination</b> of <b>switches</b> for maximising the voltage stability in the network among them is determined.

By transferring loads from the heavily loaded feeders to the lightly loaded ones, network reconfiguration can balance feeder loads and alleviate overload conditions of a network. In this paper a novel method is proposed by formulating an algorithm to reconfigure distribution networks for load balancing. Systematic logical approach is used to determine the feasible <b>switching</b> <b>combinations,</b> select the status of the switches, and find the best <b>combination</b> of <b>switches</b> for maximum improvement in load balancing. The algorithm has been developed in two stages. In the first stage, a limited number of <b>switching</b> <b>combinations</b> is formed by trinary logic principle. A simultaneous switching approach is applied logically to find the best combination by selecting the appropriate switching options, connecting the switches accordingly, and assigning the loads for the newly formed combinations. In the next stage, the search is extended to investigate whether any other <b>switching</b> <b>combination</b> gives rise to maximum improvement in load balancing, compared to the improvement obtained in the first stage. This is carried out by considering one after another, the branches next to the open-branches of the best configuration, and the switching configuration that gives the maximum improvement in load balancing is identified.
