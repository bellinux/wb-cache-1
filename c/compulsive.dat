The Lottery supports National Problem Gambling Awareness Month.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as <b>compulsive</b> sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Dopaminergic {{medications}} {{that are used}} to treat Parkinson's disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced <b>compulsive</b> engagement in natural rewards like gambling and sexual activity. The latter behaviors are similar to those observed in individuals with a behavioral addiction.|$|E
5|$|Patricia McKinsey Crittenden has {{elaborated}} classifications {{of further}} forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as <b>compulsive</b> {{compliance with the}} wishes of a threatening parent (A4).|$|E

5|$|A week later, {{plans for}} an as yet unnamed second {{documentary}} about <b>compulsive</b> male masturbators were announced, to be produced by the independent company Spun Gold. The film was to be an hour long and focus on men trying to cut down excessive masturbatory habits of up to twenty times a day, using methods developed in the United States. In September 2006, the final film in the series was announced. Entitled Masturbation For Girls, it was also to be produced by Spun Gold, and focus on female masturbation. It was to feature the sex educationalist Dr Betty Dodson, although the format had yet not been finalised. It was reported after the postponement of their airing that {{the second and third}} films were to be entitled I Can't Stop Wanking and Masturbation for Women respectively.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive <b>compulsive</b> disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
5|$|British law {{requires}} that temazepam (but not midazolam) be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority). Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and <b>compulsive</b> drug abuse of high doses.|$|E

5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, <b>compulsive</b> behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms {{give way to}} late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and slowed speech, an expressionless face, tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E
5|$|Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} {{extensive damage}} during the war, and Smith {{and his wife}} often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in their garden. Smith was called up for military service, but was discharged three years later, and subsequently worked in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of}} the war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led his wife to complain that Smith was a <b>compulsive</b> gambler, and had lost most of their money. During 1942–1943, Mimi's sister Julia lived with Lennon at The Dairy Cottage; 120a Allerton Road, Woolton, which was owned by the Smith family.|$|E
5|$|Mimi and Smith {{were finally}} married on 15 September 1939. They bought a semi-detached house called Mendips—named after {{the range of}} hills—at 251 Menlove Avenue, in a middle class area of Liverpool. Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} extensive damage during World War II, {{and she said that}} she often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in the garden. During the war the government took over the Smiths' farmland for war work, and Smith was called up for service, but was discharged three years later, working in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of the}} war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led Mimi to complain later that he was a <b>compulsive</b> gambler, and had lost most of their money.|$|E
5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and <b>compulsive</b> behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.|$|E
5|$|Several sources {{reported}} that Friedrich, his father, and his aunt were all named Trump, thus placing the name change before the 18th century. Genealogy organization FamilySearch provided information on Friedrich Trump, listing {{his father as}} Johann Ii Trump. A genealogist at Dotdash, which was then called About.com, listed Donald Trump's grandfather as Friederich Trump and great-grandfather as Christian Johannes Trump. In his 2013 book America's Obsessives: The <b>Compulsive</b> Energy That Built a Nation, Joshua Kendall wrote that Frederick's father and aunt, and by extension Donald Trump's great-grandfather and great-grandaunt, were called John Trump and Charlotte Luise Trump, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's <b>compulsive</b> greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team discovers a Triad {{gang member}} and ties to several shell {{companies}} the gang {{has set up}} in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis (Ingrid Torrance), one of the companies' large investors, but she seems unaware of her investment's criminal background. While at her house, Peter (Joshua Jackson) observes signs of obsessive <b>compulsive</b> and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of hand sanitizer. Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) back to Jarvis' house, and they learn that her son (Colby Paul) has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him {{to be able to go}} outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is unaware of the medicine's origins.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was {{involved}} in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a <b>compulsive</b> Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or temporary, admission to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore’s criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's temporary admission to the state bar.|$|E

He says he owes his father everything and he is not willing to hurt him. Dan attempts to woo Shirley again, forcing her to confess her relationship with Ash. This causes friction between the Ferreiras, and Ash breaks up with Shirley to keep the peace.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of her position, Tsunade tends to laze around and avoid her everyday duties, instead leaving them for her assistant Shizune. She does however take her role very seriously in situations where Konoha is in danger, and throughout Part II leads the village in combating the Akatsuki. Tsunade is a <b>compulsive</b> gambler with terrible luck, though with a rare winning streak perceived by her as a bad omen. Despite her odd personality, Tsunade is a highly talented medical ninja who can heal injuries that most others would consider incurable, and also possesses superhuman strength that allows her to reduce buildings to rubble. The pinnacle of her skills is the Creation Rebirth and its derived technique, the Strength of a Hundred Technique, which she taught to her disciple Sakura and use mitotic regeneration to make them nearly unkillable in battle. In the Japanese anime, Tsunade's voice actress is Masako Katsuki, and her English voice actress is Debi Mae West. In some of the video games, however, her English voice actress is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again {{employed}} Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon {{to catch}} balls fended {{off by the}} batsman, {{in an attempt to}} curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. McCabe came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence if he was hit, McCabe took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. McCabe hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, McCabe and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. McCabe reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and <b>compulsive</b> hooking of short-pitched deliveries in front of his face, unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.|$|E

25|$|<b>Compulsive</b> {{shopping}} {{or buying}} {{is characterized by}} a frequent irresistible urge to shop even if the purchases are not needed or cannot be afforded. The prevalence of <b>compulsive</b> buying in the U.S. has been estimated to be 2–8% of the general adult population, with 80–95% of these cases being females. The onset is believed to occur in late teens or early twenties and the disorder is considered to be generally chronic.|$|E
25|$|A {{chromosome}} {{has been}} located in dogs that confers {{a high risk}} of susceptibility to OCD. Canine chromosome 7 {{has been found to be}} most significantly associated with obsessive <b>compulsive</b> disorder in dogs, or more specifically, canine <b>compulsive</b> disorder (CCD). This breakthrough helped further relate OCD in humans to CCD in canines. Canine chromosome 7 is expressed in the hippocampus of the brain, the same area that Obsessive <b>Compulsive</b> Disorder is expressed in human patients. Similar pathways are involved in drug treatment responses for both humans and dogs, offering more research that the two creatures exhibit symptoms and respond to treatment in similar ways. This data can help scientists to discover more effective and efficient ways to treat OCD in humans through the information they find by studying CCD in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>compulsive</b> buying {{falls under}} the {{category}} of Impulse-control disorder – Not Otherwise Specified in the DSM-IV-TR, some researchers have suggested that it consists of core features that represent impulse-control disorders which includes preceding tension, difficult to resist urges and relief or pleasure after action. The efficiency of Cognitive Behavior Therapy for <b>Compulsive</b> Buying is not truly determined yet however common techniques for the treatment include exposure and response prevention, relapse prevention, cognitive restructuring, covert sensitization, and stimulus control.|$|E

25|$|Involvement of OFC {{is often}} implicated in {{addictive}} behavior {{in addition to}} the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. The striato-thalamo-orbitofrontal circuit of the OFC has been implicated in the development of addictive behavior via dopaminergic activation of reward circuits as supported by brain imaging studies. The OFC has been associated with <b>compulsive</b> behavior and repetitive behavior, as well as with drive; in drug dependent individuals, disruption of the striato-thalamo- orbitofrontal circuit leads to <b>compulsive</b> behavior and increased motivation to take the drug.|$|E
