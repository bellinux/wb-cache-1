40|$|This Local Government Association {{commissioned}} report helps collate {{case study}} examples of local authorities supporting schools in their enhanced role to provide independent and impartial <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> to young people. Eight LAs were {{selected by the}} LGA and NFER carried out telephone interviews with the key strategic lead on the transition of <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> from local authorities to schools. LAs nominated a school in their authority and NFER carried out telephone interviews with senior leaders and careers coordinators in seven schools. Key findings LAs are supporting schools to meet their new <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> duty firstly by encouraging the continued participation {{of young people in}} learning, tracking young people’s destinations, and identifying those with no clear pathways. Secondly, by providing direct support to schools, for example updates on policy matters and training on commissioning independent external <b>careers</b> <b>guidance.</b> Thirdly, LAs are supporting schools with the commissioning of <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> services from external providers. The schools in this study report that what has helped them to feel well prepared to take on their new statutory duty is: being well informed and supported by the LA and local partnerships; embracing the new legislation and carrying out their own preparation for the transition; having a well-qualified careers coordinator on their staff: and building on their current <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> systems. Schools are collaborating with a variety of different organisations to provide <b>careers</b> <b>guidance.</b> However, on the whole, schools indicated that they do not work with other schools to commission <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> provision because their priority is to procure <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> that is designed {{to meet the needs of}} their own students...|$|R

25|$|Velásquez began {{assisting}} {{his parents}} in the fields when he was four years old. His family traveled from the Southwest to Midwest each year, following the harvest season for various crops. They rode with other migrant workers in a pickup truck with a canvas-covered bed, huddling around a can of hot ashes and covering themselves in blankets to stay warm. Often, the family would have only a single room for the parents and all their children. One winter, he and his siblings had gathered together for warmth while snow drifted into their one-room shack through gaps in the walls. The family's poverty worsened one year when an employer paid his father only half the wages he was owed. In 1954, his parents settled permanently in Gilboa, Ohio, where they worked in the fields {{in the summer and}} in a cannery during the winter. Baldemar knew almost no English when he entered the first grade, and struggled academically. He was a good athlete, playing several sports, but was often ridiculed for his Mexican American heritage. Velásquez led his first strike at the age of 12, helping pickers at his summer job win better wages. He began to excel in his studies in the eighth grade, making honor roll. He attended Pandora-Gilboa High School, where he participated in baseball, basketball, football, and track and field, and took college preparatory courses. His high school <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> counselor advised him to only focus on industrial arts courses, but Velásquez refused.|$|E

It is argued that <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> generally responds to such challenges by seeing them as external problems rather than as changes which may alter its very assumptions and methods. Two particular taboos are noted in this context concerning the value of work and of working for an organisation. The questioning of these taboos leads to four models of alternative careers: the Uncareer, the Guerilla Career, the Cop-Out Career, and the Non-Career.

2500|$|In {{response}} to the strategic plan, an Academic Strategic Plan was drafted by Provost Martha Potvin and the deans of the university's colleges in late 2012. The academic plan put maintaining MSU's research funding and activity as its top goal. Other top goals included expanding enrollment by 15 percent by 2019 (to 16,000 students), enhancing research even further, and improving community service by faculty and staff. To achieve the research goal, the plan called for {{increasing the number of}} graduate students by 20 percent, increasing the number of doctoral students by 43 percent, and renovating lab space. Other goals in the plan included improving faculty salaries, improving financial aid to students, enhancing <b>career</b> <b>guidance</b> and counseling to graduating students, hiring more minority faculty (including Native Americans), renovating classrooms, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent, and reducing landfill waste by 25 percent. But comments on the draft academic plan said MSU had no plan to pay for the additional faculty, classrooms, and laboratories that a greatly expanded student body would require. Potvin said the university would pay for them by [...] "prioritizing". A member of the Board of Regents said the plan did not take into account initiatives by the regents or legislature, such as improving the time to graduation (as of 2012 between five and six years).|$|E

40|$|The recent {{privatisation}} of <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> {{provision in}} the United Kingdom has resulted in major cultural change in the organisation of guidance companies. This research examines the effect this external change has had {{on the quality of}} working life for professionals engaged in the practice of <b>careers</b> <b>guidance.</b> The intention of the policy was to improve service delivery not the quality of <b>careers</b> <b>guidance.</b> Nevertheless, the implementation of the policy has had a discernible effect on the way professionals experience work and on the guidance they give. Questions of professional ownership and protectionism arise and are addressed with reference to guidance and ethical frameworks. Field research was undertaken with careers practitioners working in the South East and in the North of England. The data collection comprised a questionnaire administered to these two groups, followed by focus groups conducted with some respondents from the South East sample. The concern was to understand how these careers professionals are finding their way in changed circumstances; the approach was phenomenological and interpretative (Huberman & Miles, 1994). The findings demonstrate that guidance professionals are feeling under pressure from targets introduced after contracting out. Practitioners are struggling to satisfy the individual needs of their clients against policy requirements for standardised outcomes: a tension familiar in the professionalism and managerialism debate (Friedson, 1994; Edwards, 1998 and Becher, 1999). This pressure is exacerbated by the anticipation of further policy changes for <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> delivery. Where the organisation sees the strategic imperative as contract compliance, commercial success has been at some cost to guidance professionals and their practice. A more explicit consideration of ethical practice during strategy formulation might be a way forward in the management of change in careers companies. There is evidence that policy fails fully to understand how <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> works...|$|R

40|$|Dyslexic people face {{particular}} {{problems in}} employment. These problems, {{coupled with a}} lack of specialist support, create a critical need for specially tailored computer assisted <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> (CACG) systems. The primary objective of this thesis is to establish guidelines for the design of such a system. Section one examines the possibility of providing training or guidance for dyslexic people via computer, and focuses on the use of symbolic information. The results of Study 1, using British road traffic signs, indicate that dyslexic people are deficient in implicit learning, even for symbolic information. Consequently, despite the advantage of symbol based systems for dyslexics, explicit training in system use is likely to be essential. Section two examines the potential of such systems for delivering specially tailored CACG to dyslexic people. The literature on <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> for dyslexic people suggests that they particularly benefit from increased insight into the nature of their disability, and knowledge of its implications. <b>Careers</b> <b>guidance</b> for dyslexics would therefore be optimised by guidance in: the nature of their disabilities; likely effects of their disabilities; implications for careers decisions; and opportunities for overcoming dyslexia-related difficulties. It is argued that multimedia systems, encapsulating an open learning approach, are particularly appropriate for dyslexic people. Modern multimedia computer assisted <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> (CACG) systems have the potential to facilitate these beneficial processes, and to provide valuable information and support materials. However, presently available systems of this sort are far from suitable for dyslexics. Unfortunately, little information on multimedia or CACG relates directly to dyslexia. To counter this, three studies were conducted; an interview study of selected dyslexia professionals, a questionnaire study of a wider range of dyslexia professionals, and a questionnaire study of dyslexic adults. Each was designed to establish: how <b>careers</b> <b>guidance</b> for dyslexic people can be improved; the feasibility and desirability of multimedia CACG for dyslexic people; and the design characteristics of such a CACG system. Not only was it generally agreed that such a system is feasible, and desirable, but also strong support was voiced for the central use of video resources. However, it was stressed that the system {{should not be allowed to}} replace human guidance. The results of these studies are combined with the conclusions from the literature, to construct a detailed design and description of a multimedia CACG system for dyslexic people...|$|R
