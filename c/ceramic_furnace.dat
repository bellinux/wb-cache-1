50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1906, after Gies had {{completed}} his studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule and at Winhart's, and had spent {{a few months in}} Mindelheim in order to learn how to work in copper, he was employed at Winhart's until 1908 as a chaser. In May 1908, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich (Akademie der Bildenden Künste München). Gies presumably studied sculpture there for four semesters until 1910. The reasons why he so quickly abandoned his studies are unclear. There is evidence that in 1909 he was again working at Winhart's and also returned there in 1912 as a freelance artist. In the years to 1914, he began a stylistic self-discovery and won several awards, primarily for new developments in medal working. A collaboration with the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory extended his capabilities of dealing with ceramics such as majolica. A <b>ceramic</b> <b>furnace</b> came out of the experience, which attracted attention at the Swiss National Exhibition, Berne, in 1914. Shortly afterwards, World War I broke out, in which Gies did not participate as a combatant for reasons of health but was conscripted for labour. In his works of this period, he distanced himself from patriotism and represented the suffering of war, which led to a partial censorship of his works.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the structure, {{chemical}} composition and topography of oxide layers produced {{on the surface}} of the AISI 321 austenitic steel in the annealing process were analyzed. Heat treatment was done at 980 °C temperature for 1 hour time in different conditions. The annealing was done in a <b>ceramic</b> <b>furnace</b> in oxidation atmosphere and in vacuum furnaces with cylindrical molybdenum and graphite chambers. The analysis was carried out using the following methods: a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), a transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX), an X-ray diffractometer (XRD), a secondary ion mass spectrometer with time-of-flight mass analyzer (TOF SIMS) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The oxide layer formed during annealing of the AISI 321 steel at 980 °C consisted of sub-layers, diversified in the {{chemical composition}}. The thickness of the oxidized layer is depended on the annealing conditions. In a <b>ceramic</b> <b>furnace</b> in oxidation atmosphere, the thickness of the oxide layer was of 300 - 500 nm, in a vacuum furnace with molybdenum and graphite heating chambers, it ranged from 40 to 300 nm and from a few to 50 nm, respectively.

This study aims to investigate numerically the problem of NOx pollution by providing the influence of different operating conditions on temperature and NO distributions. The study is conducted by means of numerical simulations in presence of a reactive flow using the commercial code FLUENT. The 3 D Navier-Stokes equations and species transport equations are solved with the eddy-dissipation (ED) combustion model. We use k-ε RNG turbulence models and the DTRM radiation models. The obtained results demonstrate that the combustion chamber average temperature and NO concentration decrease as the excess air factor increases for a given air mass flow. As the combustion air temperature increases, combustion chamber temperature increases and the NO concentration increases sharply. Combustion, simulation, burner, NOx emission. I...|$|R
5000|$|Young's {{experience}} of firing ceramics, {{together with his}} familiarity with {{the region as a}} local surveyor and his amateur interests in geology enabled him to conceive of a heat-proof, blast-furnace brick, using silica found in large deposits {{at the head of the}} Neath Valley. The process of [...] "vitrifying" [...] the walls of a <b>ceramic</b> brick-built <b>furnace</b> had been patented by William Harry, of the Swansea Valley in 1817, but Young's solution was to build the whole furnace from a [...] "silica firebrick," [...] made with a 1% addition of lime, to bind the blue-grey [...] "clay" [...] of the Dinas rock. The idea being that the interior of the blast furnace would vitrify and be vastly more durable and ultimately economical, than a mere veneer of silica within a comparatively fragile ceramic shell. Young made early experiments with the recipe and fired his trial bricks at the Nantgarw Pottery kilns, while he and Pardoe finished the Billingsley porcelain for sale between 1820 and 1821 when he finalised his recipe.|$|R
40|$|Effective {{sintering}} of titanium {{requires the}} use of a high sintering temperature (>= 1200 degrees C), preferably in high vacuum (< 10 (- 2) Pa). This confines the heating and cooling rates to similar to 4 degrees C/min because of the limited thermal shock resistance of <b>ceramic</b> tube <b>furnaces.</b> Consequently, it leads to lengthy sintering cycles (10 - 12 hr). This work presents an assessment of microwave (MW) sintering of titanium. Titanium powders in the size ranges of < 20 mu m, 45 - 63 mu m, and 100 - 150 mu m were used to make green samples with compaction pressures ranging from 200 - 800 MPa. Sintering was carried out at 1200 degrees C for 2 hr in a 3 kW MW furnace with a 2. 45 GHz multimode cavity under a vacuum of 2 - 6 x 10 (- 3) Pa. The characteristics of MW heating of green titanium samples in vacuum are described in terms of the heating rate, vacuum fluctuations, and sparking discharge. The actual MW heating rate achieved from 350 degrees C to 1200 degrees C was 34 degrees C/min. The attendant densities are comparable to those attained by conventional vacuum sintering.

40|$|Cement paste was {{replaced}} with kaolin-bentonite. The specimens were exposed to elevated temperature for 3 hours in a <b>ceramic</b> <b>furnace</b> and cooled down to room temperature. After cooling, the effect of kaolin-bentonite (particles sized of < 45 μm) on hydration, rehydration, surface roughness and compressive strength of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste were investigated. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to study surface roughness of OPC paste-additive mixture. The application of fire on OPC paste was analyzed. The results showed imposed heat (500 oC for 3 hours) accelerates the hydration process of OPC, and reduces setting time. Increased heat to 1000 oC, leads to zero compressive strength of specimens, the compressive strength of OPC continuously reduces after specimen has fully cooled down. A method for recovery of compressive strength of OPC after offing fire has been suggested. The method of offing fire has important effects on the compressive strength of concrete. The best results for specimen content are cement-kaolin-bentonite paste, exposure to 500 o C, after 90 days of curing, and cooling down in water. In this case the compressive strength has been increased around 60 % compared to not using additive and not exposing to heat...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of firing positions on the bonding strength of metal ceramic restorations. For this purpose a series of six SCHWICKERATH discs was prepared on the honeycomb firing tray {{and a series of}} six SCHWICKERATH discs on the ceramic firing tray in three different <b>ceramic</b> <b>furnaces</b> (Vacumat® 300, Programat® P 90, Vario Press® 300). The series was labelled according to position (rear, right, front, left, middle) : rear series, right series, front series, left series, middle 1 series, middle 2 series. A series, therefore, consisted of six test specimens whereby each of them underwent the separate firing processes in the same firing positions. This was achieved by appropriately labelling the test specimens so that any confusion was eliminated. In addition, two series in position middle 1 in the furnace Programat® P 90 were prepared which, unlike all the other series, were not fired according to the manufacturer‘s instructions, but fired with + 20 °C or - 20 °C respectively, from all of the firings according to the manufacturer‘s instructions. The bond strength was tested using the SCHWICKERATH-test which is defined in DIN EN ISO 9693 [DIN, 2000] and is established as a suitable method of determining the bond strength in the German speaking world [DÖRFLER et al., 1995]. All of the tested shear bond strength values, including those that deviated from the firing temperatures in the manufacturer‘s instructions were, without exception, above the minimum specification of 25 MPa. Most of the series did not vary significantly. The significant variations could not be explained by the different firing positions. The cause was rather more to do with practice in manufacturing test specimens and associated greater shear bond strength, along with the concomitant decrease in standard deviation. Each time a comparison of the furnaces revealed a significant variation only in furnace Programat® P 90 with the ceramic tray, as described above. In summary, it can be asserted that the firing position in the furnace had no influence on the bonding strength. Similarly, the type of firing tray or furnace used had no effect on the bond strength. The visual impact on the aesthetic appearance was also assessed along with the bond strength. This showed that the firing conditions which differed from the manufacturer‘s instructions had an effect on the gloss characteristics of the ceramic. Series + 20 °C showed a more pronounced gloss characteristic of the ceramic, series 20 °C less gloss characteristic with a duller appearance, than the series fired according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The test specimens fired according to the manufacturer‘s instructions for the various firing positions, furnaces and firing trays showed no visual variations. Prior to the clinical application of known <b>furnace</b> fired metal <b>ceramic</b> restorations, the influence of the firing position on the bonding of the ceramic should be investigated. Furthermore, the influence of the firing position on the metal ceramic bonding under varying temperature conditions and after storage in a corrosive solution should be ascertained before clinical use can be recommended...|$|R
40|$|Rare-earth oxides used in oxide {{dispersion}} strengthening {{are known to}} provide excellent strength and deformability over ordinary {{dispersion strengthening}}. It {{has been suggested that}} {{this may be due to}} the development of molybdate compounds instead of pure dispersed oxide particles. These alloys are produced by dispersing particles of certain rare-earth oxides in a molybdenum matrix and forming the mixture into a composite ingot. During the high-temperature consolidation process, the oxides are converted into rare-earth molybdates. With subsequent processing, these molybdate phases undergo deformation to form high-surface-area ribbons that serve to inhibit dislocation movement, thus improving the mechanical properties of the molybdenum matrix. It is still unknown what specific compounds, phases, and crystal structures provide these metal-oxides with their high strength and deformability. Because the molybdate phases are formed at high temperatures and low oxygen partial pressures, little is also known of the high-temperature phase equilibria of the REO-Mo systems under these conditions. The primary goal of this study was to deifine phase equilibria on systems of Mo with rare-earth oxides. The project aimed to identify compounds, phases, and specific oxidation states of molybdenum at various processing conditions. Systems of LaO 1. 5 -MoOx, YO 1. 5 -MoOx, and ZrO 2 - MoOx were investigated at temperatures of 1000 ??nd 1200 ??and O 2 partial pressures ranging from 10 - 4 Pa to 10 - 13 Pa.

None of the five particle samples tested showed any sign of defluidization in oxidizing atmosphere at any of the temperatures tested, i. e. up to 1175 – 1185  ∘C. However, under reducing conditions or in the oxidizing-reducing sequences, shortly after changing the atmosphere from oxidative to reducing, some of the spray-dried samples agglomerated causing defluidization. To study the structure of the carrier particles and to clarify the agglomeration phenomena, SEM and EDX analysis of the initial and treated samples was carried out. It was shown that agglomerates are formed through small bridges between the particles which consist of pure Ni phase. Three samples which were produced using MgO as an additive were tested. For these no defluidization was observed at any of the temperatures tested, i. e. up to 1175 – 1185  ∘C, neither in oxidizing, nor in reducing atmosphere.

The production of glass ceramics from industrial waste such as fly ash, red mud, blast furnace slag gaining more importance now a days because of their availability and low cost. In the present work an attempt has been made to produce glass ceramic with high alumina content using blast furnace slag. Generally alumina is very difficult to melt. To produce base glass for glass <b>ceramic</b> from blast <b>furnace</b> slag, an additional low melting phase which aid in dissolving the alumina can be provided by blast furnace slag. Blast furnace slag is generally produced at the temperature range 1300 oC to 1400 oC. High alumina content glass with alumina percentage as high as 30 % (more alumina content in E-glass) requires melting temperature as high as 1600 oC. Therefore using blast furnace slag as one of the main constituents can help in reducing the melting temperature of the precursor glass prior to glass ceramic production. More over high alumina content in the glass as well as in glass ceramic can enhance different physical properties, like high mechanical strength, high durability, low thermal expansion co efficient which are very suitable for cooktop application.

40|$|Dental alloys, {{and later}} zirconia, {{have been used}} in {{dentistry}} as frameworks for many years in making crowns and bridges veneered with ceramic e. g. feldspathic porcelain. Such methods of restoring teeth have been extensively studied both in the laboratory and clinically. Although such substructures have excellent strength there remains a large properties mismatch between these materials and bone or dentine e. g. elasticity. Furthermore, other drawbacks have been documented such as possible allergies, colouring of alloy margins, veneer chipping and excessive wear to opposing natural dentition. Polyaryletherketone (PAEK) thermoplastic biomaterial polymers such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) have been successfully applied in different medical applications with the latter recently being introduced to dentistry as a restorative material. The material is called Pekkton® ivory (Cendres+Métaux, SA, Switzerland) and is proposed to be used for fabricating both monolithic and bi-layered structures veneered with indirect composite resin. The manufacturer recommends methods similar to well-established restorations such as alloy and ceramic based crowns which makes it a user friendly material for both dental clinics and laboratories. Furthermore, the material’s properties such as high strength, low elastic modulus close to that of dentine, high temperature, chemical, hydrolysis and wear resistance, makes it a promising material for the replacement of tooth material. There is little published data about this material and hence the aim of this research was to evaluate the manufacturing process, aesthetic properties, structural integrity and durability of bi-layered crowns made from PEKK based thermoplastic high performance polymer (Pekkton® ivory, Cendres+Métaux, SA) and veneered with indirect light cured composite (Vita VM LC, VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH & Co. KG, DE). The processing route for Pekkton® ivory is either via milling or hot-pressing and the procedures were compared. The polymer-based restoration was compared to equivalent zirconia and metal based bi-layered restoration systems veneered with either light cured composite resin or feldspathic porcelain. Optical properties of each crown system were compared using a UV and visible light spectrophotometer. Structural integrity was compared for each system by testing the fracture resistance of the crowns using a universal testing machine and durability was evaluated by testing the fatigue limit and fatigue life using a fatigue chewing apparatus. The research hypothesis is that the PEKK polymer as anunderlying substructure material will perform equivalently to metal and zirconia substructures when veneered with light cured composite in the aspects of optical properties, strength and durability. The outcome of the study established a pressing protocol for PEKK using a standard <b>ceramic</b> pressing <b>furnace</b> where the pressed samples showed no significant differences in the CIEL*a*b* colour values, hardness or biaxial flexural strength to those samples produced via milling. There was no significant optical difference between the systems compared, the study found no evidence of difference in the CIEL*a*b* colour value of PEKK, zirconia or metal based samples when veneered with the same composite veneer. However, zirconia based groups displayed greater translucency with the composite veneer and feldspathic porcelain veneer. The fracture resistance of the PEKK and metal composite veneered crowns showed to be comparable, whereas zirconia based crowns demonstrated significantly lower fracture resistance. The durability of the PEKK composite veneered crowns showed the highest fatigue limit in comparison to the zirconia and metal composite veneered crowns. Similarly they showed the highest survival rate in the fatigue life assessment under the same cyclic load. Furthermore, the fracture mode was significantly different than observed with the zirconia and metal based crowns. The conclusion was that this material is promising for use as a restorative material and that clinical evaluation should be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Global {{air traffic}} is {{predicted}} to rise long-term (2012 - 2031) {{at an annual rate}} of almost 5 %, signifying a 100 % increase in passenger and freight volumes over the next 15 - 20 years. In view of the environmental consequences, 2011 saw the release by the EU of Vision Flightpath 2050, which sets ambitious goals for pollution and noise reduction (including a 75 % reduction in CO 2, taking the year 2000 as benchmark). A potential CO 2 emission saving in the order of 15 - 20 % is achievable simply by stepping up the efficiency and optimizing the weight of aircraft jet en-gines. One promising option for achieving these targets is the substitution of the very heavy iron and nickel-based super alloys currently in use for high temperature applications by new, lighter materials. Alongside the general weight-saving achievable, this development will also enable an increase in the response times for movable components by up to 50 %. The current work focuses on titanium aluminide alloys based on gamma-TiAl and alpha 2 -Ti 3 Al, which combine the attributes „light, corrosion-protected and extremely tough“. The application potential of this material at moderate to high temperatures (500 °C- 800 °C) makes it a particularly attractive option for manufacturing rotating turbine blades and wheels. The main barrier to the general introduction of TiAl components is the nature of this material: very hard and brittle, and, in a melt, extremely reactive. Cost-effective manufacture of TiAl low pressure turbine blades on the industrial scale is achievable by the near-net shape casting approach. The manufacture of single near net shape prototypes using centrifugal casting has already been successfully demonstrated. However, transferring this approach to industrial standard has not hitherto been possible. Starting from the current technological platform already achieved, this work aims to develop a stable and reproducible manufacturing process chain, thus laying the foundation for future series casting of near-net shape TiAl low pressure turbine blades (up to approx. 300 mm in length) for jet engines. This will enable the transfer of the huge potential of this difficult-to-process intermetallic material to a broad field of application within the aerospace industry. This calls for close investigation of component, material and the various process steps as a complex, rather than in isolation. Alongside the fundamental definition of a casting concept and corresponding process parameters, and the subsequent technology transfer to production plant specifically developed for the production of TiAl components, an essential focus of the technology development within the scope of this paper is an all-round optimization of the casting process. Not only the melt flow up to the shell mould but also mould-filling of the cavities is covered in this research. It is demonstrated that modelling a complex, thin-walled blade geometry is only achievable by goal-oriented adaptation of the crucible tilt process and the gating and feeder technology. Verification of the suitability of both the <b>ceramic</b> material and <b>furnace</b> used in being able to meet the dimensional tolerances demanded then provides the basis for the production of a small series of 600 turbine blades, the setting up of which is based on bringing together knowledge previously obtained.
