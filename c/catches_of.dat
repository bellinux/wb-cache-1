5|$|Sand whiting are {{commonly}} sought after by anglers {{due to their}} reputation as a food fish, and due to their relative accessibility, with large catches possible from many shore-based locations. The <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> recreational fishermen may exceed the <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> professionals, with studies showing Queensland had over twice the amount of fish taken by anglers in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to attracting predators {{such as the}} Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.|$|E

40|$|Volatile {{chemicals}} increased trap <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> flies {{from the}} families Lauxaniidae [Homoneura bispina (Loew) and Camptoprosopella borealis Shewell], Chloropidae (Olcella sp.), and Anthomyiidae (Delia spp.) in field crops. With lauxaniids, baiting with 2 -phenylethanol on cotton-roll dispensers increased <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> H. bispina in two corn plot tests, and methyl salicylate increased trap catch in one test. Traps baited with methyl salicylate increased the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> C. borealis. When using plastic-sachet dispensers, traps baited with methyl salicylate caught more H. bispina than ones baited with 2 -phenylethanol, whereas traps baited with 2 -phenylethanol caught more C. borealis {{than those with}} methyl salicylate. For chloropids, traps baited with 2 -isopropyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine greatly increased <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> Olcella flies in corn and soybean. With anthomyiids, <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> male Delia flies in wheat increased with 2 -phenylethanol on cotton rolls and with either 2 -phenylethanol or methyl salicylate using plastic dispensers. In soybean, 2 -phenylethanol formulated on cotton rolls or in plastic dispensers increased <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> male Delia flies, but methyl salicylate did not affect trap <b>catch.</b> Trap <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> female Delia flies did not vary among chemicals. In another test in soybean, trap <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> {{both male and female}} Delia flies was greater with 2 -phenylethanol than with other volatile chemicals...|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the effect of weather {{conditions}} on the light trap <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> 2 caddisflies (Trichoptera) species: Hydropsyche bulgaromanorum and Setodes punctatus. We found that the light trap <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> both species increased when the daily maximum temperature, minimum and average values of temperature was higher. The results can be written down with second- or third-degree polynomials. The fluctuation in temperature had no clear influence on the catch. The hydrothermal quotient has a strong influence on the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> both species. Precipitation has no significant influence on the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> the tested species...|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> scombroid mackerels {{is divided}} equally between the Atlantic mackerel {{and all other}} scombroid mackerels. Just two species account for about 75% <b>of</b> the total <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> scombroid mackerels.|$|R
5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} black dogfish under Least Concern worldwide; it is {{minimally}} affected by fishing activity across {{many parts of}} its range, while its population in the northwestern Atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995. By contrast, the intensity of deepwater fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic has led the IUCN to give this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened. The reproductive characteristics of the black dogfish, such as a large female maturation size, may render it susceptible to overfishing, though it is more fecund than other deep-sea dogfish sharks. In the northeastern Atlantic, <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> this species are managed {{as part of the}} total allowable catch for deep-sea sharks set by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and perhaps other demersal fishing gear. It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
40|$|Experimental light luring {{fishing was}} {{conducted}} in west coast of the Gulf of Thailand using a stick-held cast net. A variety of fishes were simultaneously caught with {{a higher proportion of}} commercially important Indian squid Loligo duvauceli. Three trends in <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> squid observed might directly be correlated to the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> other species simultaneously captured. It was clearly shown that the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> Indian squid reached its maximum level (10 - 20 kg/haul) at the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> other species approximately 0. 5 - 1. 0 kg/haul. The relationship between the presence of other species and the amount of squids caught were analyzed in consideration of size structure of both Indian squid L. duvauceli, and Indian mackerel Rastrelliger kanagurta, commonly apperaring in the <b>catches.</b> The <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> larger size squid more than about 15 cm mantle length seemed to be correlated with the presence of Indian mackerel...|$|R

5000|$|Cod {{remains the}} most {{important}} species harvested by Icelandic fisheries, with a total <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> 178,516 tonnes in 2010. The <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> cod has stagnated in recent years due to quotas, and was supplemented by the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> blue whiting, which is used mainly for processing. The Icelandic <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> this previously insignificant fish increased from a negligible 369 tonnes in 1995 to a peak of 501,505 tonnes in 2003. Subsequently, the stock showed signs of instability and quotas were reduced, leading {{to a decline in}} the catch to 87,121 tonnes in 2010. There have been increased numbers of Atlantic mackerel, the [...] "Miracle of the Mackerel." [...] in the 21st century as the Atlantic Ocean has slightly warmed.|$|R
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales, with <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{delivered}} a record-setting performance against #23 North Carolina State, {{in which he}} collected a career-high 14receptions for 224yards and four touchdowns. Smith scored on <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> 10, 11, 12, and 71yards, and his performance helped Maryland win, 38–31, despite amassing negative rushing yards. During the game, Smith set the school record for career all-purpose yardage, which surpassed Lamont Jordan's previous mark of 4,960 yards. His four touchdown receptions in a single game also set a school record, which surpassed the previous mark of three shared by Vernon Davis, Guilian Gary, Jermaine Lewis, and James Milling. Smith's season tally of twelvetouchdowns also set a school record, which surpassed the mark of nine shared by Jermaine Lewis and Marcus Badgett. He also joined Marcus Badgett as just the second Maryland receiver to accumulate over 1,000yards in a single season. For his performance, the Atlantic Coast Conference named him the Offensive Back of the Week.|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{of known}} records of {{commercial}} hunting of killer whales {{date to the}} 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, {{and the difficulty of}} taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. (Compare with the situation on land, Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Under most circumstances, the {{blacktip reef shark}} has a timid {{demeanor}} and is easily frightened away by swimmers. However, its inshore habitat preferences bring it into frequent contact with humans, and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous. As of early 2009, 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total (none fatal) were listed on the International Shark Attack File that are attributable to the blacktip reef shark. Most attacks involve sharks biting the legs or feet of waders, apparently mistaking them for their natural prey, and do not result in serious injury. In the Marshall Islands, native islanders avoid blacktip reef shark attacks by swimming rather than wading through shallow water, {{and a way of}} discouraging these sharks is to submerge one's body. The blacktip reef shark has also been known to become aggressive in the presence of bait, and may pose a threat while attempting to steal the <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> spear fishers.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Soldier Field for week four, the Bears {{hosted the}} Oakland Raiders, who held a 7–6 all-time lead {{entering}} the game. This {{was the first}} game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24–21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25–20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> at least 25 yards, {{with a total of}} 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray – who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 – ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O’Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka’Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive.|$|E
