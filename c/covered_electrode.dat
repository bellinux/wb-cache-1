The impermeable <b>covered</b> <b>electrode</b> was produced using the commercial E 7018 formula. Preliminary tests with different polymers and formulation changes were realized to meet the satisfactory weld ability. The best <b>covered</b> <b>electrode</b> at the first stage was evaluated at the second stage. Weld metal diffusible hydrogen, microstructure and mechanical properties were evaluated and compared with traditional low hydrogen covered electrodes. In addition, it were made tests to evaluate the slag and fumes generated during the welding. The impermeable <b>covered</b> <b>electrode</b> diffusible hydrogen content was less than 4 mL/ 100 g of weld metal. This is very low if compared to conventional low hydrogen covered electrodes.
