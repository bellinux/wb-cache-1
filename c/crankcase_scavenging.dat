50|$|Using a {{separate}} blower avoids {{many of the}} shortcomings of <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenging,</b> {{at the expense of}} increased complexity which means a higher cost and an increase in maintenance requirement. An engine of this type uses ports or valves for intake and valves for exhaust, except opposed piston engines, which may also use ports for exhaust. The blower is usually of the Roots-type but other types have been used too. This design is commonplace in CI engines, and has been occasionally used in SI engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{hot-bulb}} engine shares its basic layout with nearly all other internal combustion engines, {{in that it}} has a piston, inside a cylinder, connected to a flywheel by a connecting rod and crankshaft. Akroyd-Stuart's original engine operated on the four-stroke cycle (induction, compression, power and exhaust), and Hornsby continued to build engines to this design, as did several other British manufacturers such as Blackstone and Crossley. Manufacturers in Europe, Scandinavia and in the United States built engines working on the two-stroke cycle with <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The latter type formed the majority of {{hot-bulb engine}} production. The flow of gases through the engine is controlled by valves in four-stroke engines, and by the piston covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder wall in two-strokes.|$|E
50|$|The twingle engine (U.S. English) or split-single engine (British English) is a twin {{cylinder}} (or more) two-stroke engine; more precisely, {{it has one}} or more U-tube cylinders that each use a pair of pistons, one in each arm of the U. However, both pistons in each pair are used for power (and the underside of both supplies fuel air mixture, if <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenging</b> is used), and they only differ in that one piston works the transfer port to provide the fuel air mixture for use in both cylinders and the other piston works the exhaust port, so that the burnt mixture is exhausted via that cylinder. Unlike the Scuderi both cylinders {{are connected to the}} combustion chamber. As neither piston works as a displacer piston at all, this engine has nothing whatsoever to do with the split cycle engine apart from a purely coincidental similarity of the names.|$|E

50|$|Most {{hot-bulb}} engines {{were produced}} as one-cylinder, low-speed two-stroke <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> units.|$|R
50|$|In {{this period}} Diesel and hot bulb engines were four stroke. In 1902 F. Rundlof invented the {{two-stroke}} <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> engine {{that went on}} to become the prevalent hot bulb type engine.|$|R
50|$|With {{hindsight}} it can {{be considered}} East Germany's response to West Germany's 'Peoples Car', the VW Beetle. Its purpose {{was to provide a}} cheap but still reliable car that was very affordable and also easy to repair and maintain. Still, it was {{at the time of its}} release rather modern in many ways, with front wheel drive, a low maintenance engine, unitary construction, composite bodywork and independent suspension all around. The main letdown was the pre-war DKW based engine that was competitive when launched, but from the late 1950s into the 1960s, small economy cars in western countries that used two-stroke engines, were replaced with cleaner and more efficient four-stroke engines, as employed from the start in the Volkswagen Beetle. Two-stroke engines of this sort, with <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenging</b> and lubricating oil provided during fuel intake, burn their lubricating oil by design and produce smoky tailpipe emissions. However, two-stroke engines were also to be found in cars like the Western German Auto Union 1000 that ended production in 1963, and the Swedish Saab 96 that changed to four-stroke in 1967. The lack of development funds in East Germany forced the continued use of a two-stroke engine in the Trabant, thus causing this vehicle to become obsolescent in the 1960s and extremely obsolete by the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Development of {{a method}} for calculating the {{volumetric}} efficiency of piston engines with intake pipes. Application of this method to the scavenging pumps of two-stroke-cycle engines with <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenging</b> and to four-stroke-cycle engines.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the combustion evolution and the engine performance parameters of a two-stroke engine with direct injection and jet ignition. Two-stroke engines are lightweight, simple to construct, high power- to- weight ratios and offer low cost to manufacture. The main problems with two-stroke engines are emissions and low fuel-efficiency. This research used a two-stroke engine with <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenging.</b> It also adopted an exhaust reed valve and lamellar intake, accommodating a high pressure direct injector as used in the latest two-stroke gasoline engines. The jet ignition device is replacing traditional spark plug. The main chamber and jet ignition use hydrogen as fuel. The jet ignition instrument is a pre-chamber accommodating a high-pressure injector operated with hydrogen fuel, and an 8 mm racing spark plug. The pre-chamber inside the jet ignition device {{is connected to the}} main combustion chamber through calibrated orifices. Lubrication is performed by selective oil injection where needed, rather than oil mixed with fuel. A two-stroke engine CAD model has been designed by using 3 D CAD software SolidWorks. Included are a jet ignition device, fuel injector, gas exchange system, combustion systems, lubricating system and other major engine components. The CFD simulations were performed in Star CCM+ to analyse the combustion evolution with hydrogen fuel in the cylinder from exhaust port closure to exhaust port opening. The obtained combustion rate results from CFD simulation were transferred into 1 D software to investigate and analyse the performance of the two-stroke engine. This research has shown good modelling results with efficiencies well in excess of 30 % in the area of best engine operation, and reduced energy penalties when changing load and speed. The solution offers the opportunity to produce an efficient alternative to four- stroke engines with improved power density running an alternative fuel with better combustion properties and reduced pollution than traditional diesel and gasoline fuels...|$|E
50|$|In 2-stroke <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> engines, the {{interior}} of the crankcase, and therefore the crankshaft, connecting rod and bottom of the pistons are sprayed by the 2-stroke oil in the air-fuel-oil mixture which is then burned along with the fuel. The valve train may be contained in a compartment flooded with lubricant so that no oil pump is required.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} make clear how the efflux angle changes in a small <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> engine {{cylinder}} and in a large loop scavenged engine cylinder, the inlet flow pattern in the single cycle model cylinder has been observed by a high speed motion camera. In general, the scavenging air stream is not effluent in the designed direction of the scavenging port at comparatively slight opening, and the efflux angle changes in proportion to port opening advance. In a small <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> engine cylinder, to keep the scavenging air stream {{in the direction of}} the scavenging port it is effective to incline the scavenging air passage between the crankcase and the cylinder, and to make thicker the cylinder wall where located scavenging port. In a large loop scavenged engine cylinder to coincide the scavenging air stream with the direction of the scavenging port in the early stage of the scavenging, it has an effect to set the guide plate the position of 1 / 2 at port height...|$|R

The system does not annul the typical simplicity and low production cost of conventional two-stroke, <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged,</b> S. I. engines. Indeed the injection air is supplied by the crankcase and the whole design is based on simple and low-cost solutions. With reference to this system methodologies are also discussed to improve the behaviour of combustion at low loads...|$|R
5000|$|They {{must use}} the {{transfer}} port(s) as a carefully designed and placed nozzle {{so that a}} gas current is created {{in a way that}} it sweeps the whole cylinder before reaching the exhaust port so as to expel the combustion gases, but minimize the amount of charge exhausted. 4-stroke engines have the benefit of forcibly expelling almost all of the combustion gases because during exhaust the combustion chamber is reduced to its minimum volume. In <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> 2-stroke engines, exhaust and intake are performed mostly simultaneously and with the combustion chamber at its maximum volume.|$|R
5000|$|In 1899 John Day {{simplified}} Clerk's design {{into the}} type of 2 cycle engine that is very widely used today.Day cycle engines are <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> and port timed. The crankcase and {{the part of the}} cylinder below the exhaust port is used as a pump. The operation of the Day cycle engine begins when the crankshaft is turned so that the piston moves from BDC upward (toward the head) creating a vacuum in the crankcase/cylinder area. The carburetor then feeds the fuel mixture into the crankcase through a reed valve or a rotary disk valve (driven by the engine). There are cast in ducts from the crankcase to the port in the cylinder to provide for intake and another from the exhausst port to the exhaust pipe. The height of the port in relationship to the length of the cylinder is called the [...] "port timing." ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a 1 D- 3 D numerical model {{to simulate the}} scavenging and combustion processes in a small-size spark-ignition two-stroke engine. The engine is <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> and can be operated with both gasoline and Natural Gas (NG). The analysis is performed with {{a modified version of}} the KIVA 3 V code, coupled to an in-house developed 1 D model. A time-step based, two-way coupled procedure is fully described and validated against a reference test. Then, a 1 D- 3 D simulation of the whole two-stroke engine is carried out in different operating conditions, for both gasoline and NG fuelling. Results are compared with experimental data including instantaneous pressure signals in the crankcase, in the cylinder and in the exhaust pipe. The procedure allows to characterize the scavenging process and quantify the fresh mixture short-circuiting, as well as to analyze the development of the NG combustion process for a diluted mixture, typically occurring in a two-stroke engine. Results in terms of performance and emission characteristics of this engine are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|As more {{stringent}} emission limits and low consumption requirements also involve s. i. 2 -stroke engines, {{one of the}} most important design modifications that can cope with these constraints is to perform the scavenging process using pure air, which means not only fuel-free air but also oil-free air. A new single-cylinder prototype engine, equipped with a gasoline direct injection (GDI) apparatus has therefore been designed and built. In order to reduce manufacturing costs, this prototype was obtained by modifying a mass-produced 4 -stroke 4 -cylinder automotive engine. Apart from the replacement of the original indirect fuel feeding system with GDI, two more remarkable features should be pointed out: the use of a force-fed lubrication system, like those used in current 4 -stroke engines and, as a consequence, the use of an external scavenging pump. Before using an electronically controlled direct injection system on the new prototype engine, the whole apparatus was tested on a mass-produced <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> 2 -stroke engine (Husqvarna WR 250) in order to evaluate the magnitude of the improvements. A comparison of a carburettor fuel feeding system with a direct fuel injection system was carried out, under cubic power requirements, to check whether the GDI strategies were advantageous. As satisfying results were obtained, the direct injection apparatus was mounted onto the prototype engine for the first experimental test...|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{is attached to}} the engine block by numerous bolts or studs. It has several functions. The {{cylinder head}} seals the cylinders on the side opposite to the pistons; it contains short ducts (the ports) for intake and exhaust and the associated intake valves that open to let the cylinder be filled with fresh air and exhaust valves that open to allow the combustion gases to escape. However, 2-stroke <b>crankcase</b> <b>scavenged</b> engines connect the gas ports directly to the cylinder wall without poppet valves; the piston controls their opening and occlusion instead. The cylinder head also holds the spark plug in the case of spark ignition engines and the injector for engines that use direct injection. All CI engines use fuel injection, usually direct injection but some engines instead use indirect injection. SI engines can use a carburetor or fuel injection as port injection or direct injection. Most SI engines have a single spark plug per cylinder but some have 2. A head gasket prevents the gas from leaking between the cylinder head and the engine block. The opening and closing of the valves is controlled by one or several camshafts and springs—or in some engines—a desmodromic mechanism that uses no springs. The camshaft may press directly the stem of the valve or may act upon a rocker arm, again, either directly or through a pushrod.|$|R
5000|$|Some SI {{engines are}} <b>{{crankcase}}</b> <b>scavenged</b> {{and do not}} use poppet valves. Instead the crankcase and {{the part of the}} cylinder below the piston is used as a pump. The intake port is connected to the crankcase through a reed valve or a rotary disk valve driven by the engine. For each cylinder a transfer port connects in one end to the crankcase and in the other end to the cylinder wall. The exhaust port is connected directly to the cylinder wall. The transfer and exhaust port are opened and closed by the piston. The reed valve opens when the crankcase pressure is slightly below intake pressure, to let it be filled with a new charge; this happens when the piston is moving upwards. When the piston is moving downwards the pressure in the crankcase increases and the reed valve closes promptly, then the charge in the crankcase is compressed. When the piston is moving upwards, it uncovers the exhaust port and the transfer port and the higher pressure of the charge in the crankcase makes it enter the cylinder through the transfer port, blowing the exhaust gases. Lubrication is accomplished by adding 2-stroke oil to the fuel in small ratios. Petroil refers to the mix of gasoline with the aforesaid oil. This kind of 2-stroke engines has a lower efficiency than comparable 4-strokes engines and release a more polluting exhaust gases for the following conditions: ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{combined}} experimental and numerical {{investigation of a}} small unit displacement two-stroke SI engine operated with either Gasoline and Natural Gas (CNG).
