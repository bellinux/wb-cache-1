The spillway is the [...] "drop inlet" [...] type with a <b>crest</b> <b>radius</b> of 15.7 metres, a 6-metre diameter shaft and conduit conveys the overflow to the flip bucket. The catchment area of 2 400 square kilometres stretches up to the source of the Odzi river in the high rainfall area just south of Juliasdale. The construction was financed with aid supplied by the Italian Government, the main contractor was Salini Costuttori SpA, with local subcontractors K.W.Blasting doing tunneling and hard excavation. It is operated to supply water to irrigation schemes in Chimanimani and Chipinge Districts.|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} of bone {{could help}} minimise donor site defects of conventional bone flaps like the fibula, iliac <b>crest,</b> <b>radius</b> and scapula. First a review is given on {{the literature of}} donor site morbidity of these flaps. Then the use of MRI is investigated for longitudinal study of ectopic bone formation in a rat model with demineralised bone matrix in a subcutaneous site. The {{results of this study}} show that in vivo MRI is well suited to assess bone formation larger than 0. 5 mm in diameter and to monitor the complete three-dimensional shape of the newly formed bone in a noninvasive manner. In the third chapter it is concluded that in vivo MRI proves to be a reliable method for monitoring ectopic bone formation in a rat model with DBM in a muscle flap, while in vivo DEXA was unable to detect the implants. Furthermore, in vivo MRA proves to be a very useful technique for studying the circulation of muscle flaps in this animal model. In chapter four it is concluded that enlargement of the surface area by morsellizing DBM implants in a rat model is not an important factor in bone forming capacity. In chapter five, the aim of the study is to investigate the influence of the carrier in a cell-based bone regeneration approach, whereby we hypothesize that CaP ceramic implants will induce more bone formation than Ti-fiber implants. Our hypothesis is confirmed. In chapter six the hypothesis that a muscle recipient site could favor bone formation in a cell-based bone graft substitute compared to a subcutaneous recipient site due to the higher vascularity of muscle tissue, could not be confirmed. In the last chapter the influence of a microsurgical anastomosis on a prefabricated flap is investigated: We conclude that in a rat model viable microsurgical bone flaps can be obtained by using a cell-based tissue engineering approach...|$|E

40|$|Effective osseous {{reconstruction}} {{of the head and}} neck after congenital, traumatic, and particularly ablative oncologic procedures is a relatively recent innovation. Whereas pioneers led with individual donor sites, it is only in the past 20 years that most centers have developed teams comfortable with use of the four common donor sites for free flaps: iliac <b>crest,</b> fibula, <b>radius,</b> and scapula. Calvarium, though much less frequently used, is a useful donor site for specific reconstructive challenges. Less commonly used sites such as femur, humerus, and rib have not proved universally reliable. This article aims to illustrate some refinements and pitfalls in vascularized osseous {{reconstruction of}} the head and neck using the well-recognized flaps, including calvarium, in a variety of pathologic conditions, recipient-site defects, and comorbidities. Strategies for error avoidance will be emphasized. The authors hope that this will support the concept of a reconstructive “toolbox” for this complex area...|$|R
40|$|The {{cornerstones}} of {{the treatment}} for nonunions (of forearm bones) remains resection of the pseudarthrosis, grafting and rigid fixation. In most cases union can be obtained. However failures do occur and even can be predicted: hypovascularity of the field, the vascularity-at-risk of some (parts of) bones, multiple operations and infections. In these cases vascularized bone grafts have several benefits: they bring new living osteocytes and osteoblasts with their blood supply to the nonunion site. Incorporation of the graft is faster and more secure since it relies on simple fracture healing processes rather than on creeping substitution. For major defects the fibula is the gold standard but in smaller (less than 5 cm) this may be not necessary. Several other potential donor sites are known: the iliac <b>crest,</b> the <b>radius,</b> the scapula and the ribs. They are all associated with extensive dissection and an important donor site morbidity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of new remains of Lagosuchus that are {{thoroughly}} described, including most of the skeleton except the manus, {{it is assumed that}} Lagosuchus is a form intermediate between Pseudosuchia and Saurischia. The presacral vertebrae show three morphological zones that may be related to bipedality: 1) the anterior cervicals; 2) short cervico-dorsals; and 3) the posterior dorsals. The pelvis as a whole is advanced, in particular the pubis and acetabular area of the ischium, but the ilium is rather primitive. The hind limb has a longer tibia than femur, and the symmetrical foot is as long as the tibia. The tarsus is of the mesotarsal type. The morphology of the distal area of the tibia and fibula, and the proximal area of the tarsus, suggest a stage transitional between the crurotarsal and mesotarsal conditions. The forelimb is proportionally short, 48 % of the hind limb. The humerus is slender, with advanced features in the position of the deltoid <b>crest.</b> The <b>radius</b> and ulna are also slender, the latter with a pronounced olecranon process. A new family of Pseudosuchia is proposed for this form: Lagosuchidae. Its level of organization is discussed in some detail and the transitional condition of Lagosuchus between Pseudosuchia and Saurischia is analyzed. The possible relationships of Lagosuchus with Triassic saurischians are discussed according to the information from vertebral zonation, pelvis, hind limb, and disparity of the limbs. It is concluded that Lagosuchus is part of...|$|R
40|$|Vascularized bone grafts {{have been}} {{successfully}} applied for the reconstruction of bone defects at the forearm, distal radius, carpus, and hand. Vascularized bone grafts are most commonly used in revision cases in which other approaches have failed. Vascularized bone grafts {{can be obtained from}} a variety of donor sites, including the fibula, the iliac <b>crest,</b> the distal <b>radius</b> (corticocancellous segments and vascularized periosteum), the metacarpals and metatarsals, and the medial femoral condyle (corticoperiosteal flaps). Their vascularity is preserved as either pedicled autografts or free flaps to carry the optimum biological potential to enhance union. The grafts can also be transferred as composite tissue flaps to reconstruct compound tissue defects. Selection of the most appropriate donor flap site is multifactorial. Considerations include size matching between donor and defect, the structural characteristics of the graft, the mechanical demands of the defect, proximity to the donor area, the need for an anastomosis, the duration of the procedure, and the donor site morbidity. This article focuses on defects of the distal radius, the wrist, and the hand. (J Hand Surg 2010; 35 A: 1710 - 1718.

30|$|Tumor {{resection}} in {{the oral}} and maxillofacial region leads to facial deformity, stomatognathic system dysfunction, and subsequent psychological problems. Reconstruction of defects after tumor resection poses a common problem in oral and maxillofacial surgery [7, 8]. Free vascularized flaps are now considered safe and reliable for reconstruction of orofacial defects caused by tumor resection, and different donor sites such as the fibula, iliac <b>crest,</b> scapula, and <b>radius</b> have been suggested for use in reconstruction. The free vascularized fibula flap is widely used for the functional reconstruction of extended defects of both the mandible and the maxilla because it offers many advantages over other vascularized bone grafts for jaw reconstruction. The flap has sufficient length and better quality of the bone, which can be easily shaped with osteotomies, and the pedicle of the flap is of sufficient length for {{the reconstruction of the}} mandible or the maxilla [9 – 11]. However, the bone height of the fibula flap is insufficient. The fibula flap is also associated with some disadvantages with regard to desirable prosthetic rehabilitation with dental implants and the maintenance of adequate oral hygiene and negatively affects the profile of the reconstructed mandible [12]. The solutions to this problem may be the use of a double-barrel fibula flap graft [13 – 15] or secondary vertical distraction osteogenesis of the fibula flap [3, 16 – 19].|$|R
40|$|Now {{that there}} is a need to {{increase}} a processing capacity, curved cutting edge mills find ever-growing use. Also known as “rough end”, “full-side”, and “heavy-duty” mills, they provide the increased depth and width values of milling owing to the width-sized chip separation. The analysis of produced mills allowed us both to reveal their basic design components (type of a shaft or basic opening, diameter and length of the cutting part, mill length, quantity of teeth, a tilt angle of a screw flute) and to make their classification. The paper presents a classification of the profile types of cutting edges, which can be divided by form (flat, round), size (small, large, super-large), and symmetry (symmetrical and asymmetrical). The profile of the cutting edge is characterized by the following parameters: profile height, pitch of <b>crests</b> spherical <b>radius</b> of <b>crest.</b> A review of the curved cutting edge profile types allows us to build the geometrical constructions to define a form and the sizes of the chip load made by the cutting edge from a billet. It is shown that parameters of the cutting edge profile influence the form and the sizes (thickness and width) of the chip load. The chip load thickness provided by the curved cutting edge mills exceeds that of observed when using the “smooth” cutting edge mills. A thickening degree of the chip load is changed with changing form and sizes of the cutting edge mill profile. Larger thickening is observed if the chip load is limited from below and from above by the marks of a single tooth (the first or second etc.), and a length of the other teeth marks is minimum. The most achievable chip load thickness is equal to feed per revolution. Studying the references allowed us to formulate some rules to choose a cutting edge profile depending on a type of the processed material and a desirable roughness of the processed surface. It is important to note the following. When choosing a profile of the cutting edge it is possible to be guided by the rule: as a hardness of the processed material increases and a desirable roughness of the processed surface decreases it is necessary to use mills with a profile of the smaller height and pitch. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} the hydraulic characteristics of sharp crested weirs with semi- circular shape were studied, {{the study was}} depended on the dimensional analysis which confirmed by experimental work. The dimensional analysis results demonstrate that the effective parameters on the discharge of flow over this type of weir are the ratio of water height above the weir <b>crest</b> to the <b>radius</b> of this weir (H/R) and the ratio of water height above the weir crest to {{the height of the}} crest (H/P). Experimental tests were carried out on (16) models of weirs with Semi-circle shape where the radius of cutting was change four times (R= 5, 10, 15, 20 cm) and for any radius the height of the crest was change four times (P= 30, 25, 20, 15 cm). The results show a great influence of the parameter (H/R) on flow parameter (Q 2 /gH 5) while the effect of the parameter (H/P) is limited. Depending on non-dimensional parameters and experimental results, the statistics program (SPSS) were used to create empirical equation for measuring the discharge over the sharp crested weirs with semi-circular shape. The results of the equation show a very good agreement with the experimental result for determine the discharge with knowing the depth of water over the weir (H), radius of cutting of the weir (R) and height of the crest (P). Also the equation shows a great influence of the radius (R) and limited influence of the height (P) on the discharge over this type of weirs. </p...|$|R
