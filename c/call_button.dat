500|$|The Links are [...] tall, and are {{compliant}} with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. There are two [...] high-definition displays on each Link for advertisements {{and public service}} announcements. There is an integrated Android tablet embedded within each Link, {{which can be used}} to access city maps, directions, and services, as well as make video calls; they were formerly also available to allow patrons to use the internet, but these browsers have now been disabled due to abuse (see below). Each Link includes two free USB charging stations for smartphones as well as a phone that allows free calls to all 50 states and to Washington, D.C.. The Links allow people to make either phone calls (using the keypad and the headphone jack to the keypad's left), or video calls (using the tablet). Vonage provides this free domestic phone call service as well as the ability to make international calls using calling cards. [...] The Links feature a red 9-1-1 <b>call</b> <b>button</b> between the tablet and the headphone jack. The Links {{can also be used to}} call 3-1-1, and , they can be used for other simple tasks such as registering to vote. In April 2017, the Links were equipped with another app, Aunt Bertha, which could be utilized to find social services such as food pantries, financial aid, and emergency shelter.The Wi-Fi technology comes from Ruckus Wireless and is enabled by Qualcomm's Vive 802.11ac Wave 2 4x4 chipsets. The Links' operating system runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor and the Adreno 320 graphics processing unit. The Links' hardware and software can handle future upgrades. The software will be updated until at least 2022, but Qualcomm has promised to maintain the Links for the rest of their service lives.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Call</b> <b>buttons</b> are {{installed}} at traffic lights with a dedicated pedestrian signal, {{and are used}} {{to bring up the}} pedestrian [...] "walk" [...] indication in locations where they function correctly. In the majority of locations where <b>call</b> <b>buttons</b> {{are installed}}, pushing the button does not light up the pedestrian walk sign immediately. One Portland State University researcher notes of <b>call</b> <b>buttons</b> in the US, [...] "Most <b>call</b> <b>buttons</b> don’t provide any feedback to the pedestrian that the traffic signal has received the input. It may appear at many locations that nothing happens." [...] However, there are some locations where <b>call</b> <b>buttons</b> do provide confirmation feedback. At such locations, pedestrians are more likely to wait for the [...] "walk" [...] indications.|$|R

2500|$|Adam is {{an expert}} swordsman; he carries a {{swordstick}} and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who deserves it. He {{is not the only}} British hero with such a weapon; John Steed of The Avengers had a sword umbrella, and Lord Peter Wimsey had a specially made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a measuring tool. [...] He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 – though he is naturally listed on their official records as being [...] "missing, presumed killed" [...] since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, {{on the top of a}} multi-storey car park, which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. [...] It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden <b>call</b> <b>button.</b> [...] He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised numberplate AA 1000. The car is dark green and tan (or perhaps dark brown and gold, please see the DVD), it has a sun-roof, electric windows, and a very posh interior. It was a special conversion: a [...] "Mini de Ville" [...] by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD. He occasionally does a job for the British Government, as in [...] "More Deadly Than the Sword". When he is knocked unconscious, Adam usually dreams of how he was caught by the Face and of Louise telling him: [...] "So clever, but oh so vulnerable." [...] This is apt, as many women take advantage of his Victorian naïveté.|$|E
