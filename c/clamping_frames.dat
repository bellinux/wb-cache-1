40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of blast-loaded steel plates is studied both experimentally and numerically. The blast loading was generated using a shock tube facility. This {{is an alternative}} to explosive detonations where the blast intensity is easily controlled through the initial conditions in each experiment. Massive and deform- able steel plates where located at the tube end during testing, where the massive-plate tests served {{as a basis for}} comparison with respect to ﬂuid-structure interaction (FSI) effects. Special focus was placed on the inﬂuence of pre-formed holes on the dynamic response and failure characteristics of the deformable plates. The plates had an exposed area of 0. 3 m £ 0. 3 m and the tests covered a wide range of structural responses from large inelastic deformations to complete tearing along the diagonals of the plates. Numerical simula- tions were performed in the ﬁnite element code EUROPLEXUS, where the plate was uniformly loaded by the pressure measurements from the massive-plate tests. The plate deformation and the observed crack propagation were successfully recreated by using element erosion and adaptive mesh reﬁnement in the plate, driven by the damage parameter in the material model. As expected, the simulations overestimated the plate deformations due to the underlying assumption that the blast pressure was uncoupled from the deformation (i. e., neglecting FSI). It was also found that the modelling of the realistic boundary conditions with <b>clamping</b> <b>frames,</b> contact and friction was essential to predict the experimental results. JRC.

40|$|In recent years, much {{research}} has been devoted in understanding and production of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) parts. Still, the overall costs of CFRP-parts are high and offer potential for reduction. To {{be able to compete}} with metallic parts it is necessary to analyze the complete CFRP-part production process with focus on optimization and reduction of costs. In this work two optimization aspects along the production chain of thermoformed CFRP-parts are being addressed: -Turning a 3 -step process into a 2 -step process -Reduction of manual interaction At the first issue the effect on the part quality by dropping the consolidation step of the ply-package to an organo sheet is examined. The common production process of thermoplastic CFRP-parts includes the processing of organo sheets. These organo sheets can be produced by vacuum- or press consolidation, which are representing very time, energy and therefore cost intensive steps. For this investigation the unconsolidated ply-package is directly inserted into a <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> and subsequently transferred to an infrared (IR) preheating station. In this station the ply-package is thermally activated and after achieving process temperature it is formed to the final geometry by the hot press. Here the influence of variation of different process parameter to the quality of thermoformed parts is evaluated. The investigated process parameter are including the number and position of the welding points at single plies, the dwell time and temperature at the IR-station as well as pressure, duration and temperature during the press step. Afterwards the quality of the parts that has been produced with and without the consolidation step is analyzed and compared against the background of efficiency. With the second issue the enhancement of the level of automation is addressed. On that score the transport of the ply-packages / organo sheets inside a <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> along the thermoforming process is investigated. For this purpose a special <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> was developed, that is able to strain the organo sheet automatically and keeps it under continuous tension and allows the necessary flexibility during the whole process. With the application of this <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> we are able {{to get rid of the}} manual spring mounting into the organo sheet, the actual state of the art, which results in shorter cycle times and reduced effort. This paper shows that the production of thermoformed parts can be optimized at several points. By choosing the right process parameters we aim to drop the consolidation step. Furthermore the cycle time can be reduced by use of an automatic <b>clamping</b> <b>frame.</b> These achievements can contribute to a lower total price of thermoplastic CFRP-parts and therefore enhance their position at the competition with metallic parts...|$|R

The research at the Center for Lightweight-Production-Technology (ZLP) in Augsburg aims at automation of thermoplastic composite production utilizing a flexible robot work cell with integrated hot press.

30|$|Deformation of curved {{laminated}} structural wood elements {{was analyzed}} by Altinok et al. [9]. The modified poplar woods were put within a mold that was prepared {{in accordance with}} the desired form and were pressed for a period of 120  min at a pressure of 2.5  N/mm 2. After the pressing operation, the specimens were kept at ordinal atmospheric conditions for a period of 3  weeks for the adhesive used in the lamination to become completely cured [9]. Poplar woods of green and sound are preferred for easy deforming. The poplar woods were subjected to a formatting process in a handled deformation mold until it reached a radius curvature of 90 °. Deforming operation is performed gradually and the specimens were kept at ordinal atmospheric conditions for a period of 1  week, for their deformation in the frames to become completely fixed.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the practical implementation of decentralized velocity feedback on a thin rectangular panel using sixteen triangularly shaped piezoceramic patch actuators with the base edges uniformly distributed along {{the perimeter of}} the panel and accelerometer sensors located at the tips of the actuators. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the sensor–actuator open loop frequency response function of one feedback loop is modelled and analysed in order to study the principal stability properties of a single control unit. In particular an elemental model is developed for studying the bending excitation and passive stiffness and inertia effects produced by the triangular piezoceramic actuator and for investigating the resilient effect of the <b>clamping</b> <b>frame</b> that holds the panel. The simulated frequency response function is validated experimentally and contrasted with that obtained from a conventional model of the bending excitation produced by triangularly shaped distributed transducers. In the second part of the paper, the stability and control performance of sixteen decentralized feedback loops are investigated experimentally. Six rectangular panels have been built and equipped with accelerometer sensors and piezoceramic triangular actuators of various geometries such that the effects of the base width, height and base area can be examined. <br/...|$|R

It is shown that harmonics of higher order have to be considered when a certain approximation quality is needed. Results of the HBM are compared to those of direct time integration.

40|$|The {{mounting}} system of photovoltaic (PV) modules {{has a significant}} impact on the thermo-mechanical stress in PV modules. In this work the <b>clamping</b> of <b>framed</b> PV modules is compared to the clamping of unframed PV laminates by a simulation study using the finite element method (FEM). The FEM modelling allows to calculate the local stress distribution in the solar cells directly. We present results from a model of a standard glass-backsheet PV module with 3 mm glass under homogenous mechanical pressure load of up to 5400 Pa. The thermal stress from the lamination process is considered as a pre-study, similar to [1]. The frameless clamped PV laminate shows a significantly larger displacement of 147 mm than the framed PV module with 54 mm for 2400 Pa. In line with the findings of Kajari-Schroeder [2] we simulate an elliptic deflection distribution for the framed PV module, whereas the clamped PV laminate shows a wave-like shape. Consequently, the area of high tensile stresses in the silicon solar cells, with a maximum value of 142 MPa at 2400 Pa load, is narrowly located around the highest curvature at the center of the framed PV module. In case of the frameless clamped PV laminate we identify four areas of high tensile stresses with a higher maximum value of 218 MPa. The results show that the frame reduces the tensile stresses in the solar cells significantly compared to unframed laminates...|$|R

50|$|Before the 1770s, textile {{production}} was {{a cottage industry}} using flax and wool. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would card the fibre, which the women would spin into yarn; the male weaver would use a frame loom to weave this into cloth. This was then tentered in the sun to bleach it. The same production system was attempted with cotton, but the demand was too high, and with the invention by John Kay of the flying shuttle, which made the loom twice as productive, more cotton yarn was being woven than the traditional spinners could supply.There were two types of spinning wheel: the Simple Wheel, which uses an intermittent process, and the more refined Saxony wheel, which drives a differential spindle and flyer with a heck (an apparatus that guides the thread to the reels) in a continuous process. These two wheels became {{the starting point of}} technological development. Businessmen such as Richard Arkwright employed inventors to find solutions that would increase the amount of yarn spun, then took out the relevant patents.

40|$|Background: Laparoscopy is a {{well-established}} alternative to open surgery for treating many diseases. Although laparoscopy has many advantages, {{it is also}} associated with disadvantages, such as slow learning curves and prolonged operation time. Fresh frozen cadavers may be an interesting resource for laparoscopic training, and many institutions have access to cadavers. One of the main obstacles for the use of cadavers as a training model is the difficulty in introducing a sufficient pneumoperitoneum to distend the abdominal wall and provide a proper working space. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe a fresh human cadaver model for laparoscopic training without requiring a pneumoperitoneum. Materials and Methods and Results: A fake abdominal wall device was developed to allow for laparoscopic training without requiring a pneumoperitoneum in cadavers. The device consists of a table-mounted retractor, two rail <b>clamps,</b> two independent <b>frame</b> arms, two adjustable handle and rotating features, and two frames of the abdominal wall. A handycam is fixed over a frame arm, positioned and connected through a USB connection to a television and dissector; scissors and other laparoscopic materials are positioned inside trocars. The laparoscopic procedure is thus simulated. Conclusion: Cadavers offer a very promising and useful model for laparoscopic training. We developed a fake abdominal wall device that solves the limitation of space when performing surgery on cadavers and removes the need to acquire more costly laparoscopic equipment. This model is easily accessible at institutions in developing countries, making it one of the most promising tools for teaching laparoscopy...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{membranes}} with exceptional {{mechanical and}} optical properties present {{one of the}} most promising platforms in quantum opto-mechanics. The performance of stressed silicon nitride nanomembranes as mechanical resonators notoriously depends on how their <b>frame</b> is <b>clamped</b> to the sample mount, which in practice usually necessitates delicate, and difficult-to-reproduce mounting solutions. Here, we demonstrate that a phononic bandgap shield integrated in the membrane's silicon frame eliminates this dependence, by suppressing dissipation through phonon tunneling. We dry-etch the membrane's frame so that it assumes the form of a cm-sized bridge featuring a 1 -dimensional periodic pattern, whose phononic density of states is tailored to exhibit one, or several, full band gaps around the membrane's high-Q modes in the MHz-range. We quantify the effectiveness of this phononic bandgap shield by optical interferometry measuring both the suppressed transmission of vibrations, as well as the influence of <b>frame</b> <b>clamping</b> conditions on the membrane modes. We find suppressions up to 40 dB and, for three different realized phononic structures, consistently observe significant suppression of the dependence of the membrane's modes on sample clamping - if the mode's frequency lies in the bandgap. As a result, we achieve membrane mode quality factors of 5 × 10 ^ 6 with samples that are tightly bolted to the 8 K-cold finger of a cryostat. Q× f-products of 6 × 10 ^ 12 Hz at 300 K and 14 × 10 ^ 12 Hz at 8 K are observed, satisfying one of the main requirements for optical cooling of mechanical vibrations to their quantum ground-state.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that clamping a tensioned wire {{can cause a}} reduction in wire tension. Tension (about 1275 N) was applied to a wire that was subsequently clamped, using cannulated bolts, to the steel half-ring of an Ilizarov external fixator. The tension in the wire was monitored before, during and after clamping. The apparatus was disassembled and the deformations in the wire caused by the clamps were measured. This experiment was repeated 15 times. When the wire was <b>clamped</b> to the <b>frame,</b> the wire tension was reduced by 22 +/- 7 per cent (mean +/- standard deviation, SD). The drop in wire tension was linearly correlated (r = 0. 96; p < 0. 001) with the deformation caused by the bolts. A finite element (FE) model of the wire was also constructed. The model was pre-stressed (tensioned), and the clamping effect replicated. This analysis showed that clamping the wire could be considered to squeeze the wire outwards (like toothpaste from a tube) and so reduce its tension during fixator assembly. To assess {{the magnitude of this}} effect in the clinical situation, the FE model analysis was repeated to replicate clamping a 1. 8 -mm-diameter wire to a 180 -mm-diameter steel Ilizarov ring component. The analysis showed that for these conditions the tension reduced by 8 - 29 per cent. The results of this study highlight a general engineering problem: how can a tensioned wire be secured to a structure without an appreciable loss of tension? If the performance of the structure depends on the wire tension, this performance will change when the wire is secured...|$|R
