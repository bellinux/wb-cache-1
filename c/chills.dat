40|$|Dormancy is {{commonly}} separated into a rest period, when the buds remain dormant due to growth-arresting physiological conditions, and a quiescent period, when the buds remain dormant due to unfavourable environmental conditions. A sequential model predicting {{the number of}} days during dormancy based on accumulation of <b>chill</b> days during rest and anti-chill days during quiescence is described. <b>Chill</b> days and anti-chill days are calculated using the single triangle method to estimate degree days relative to a threshold temperature. The temperature threshold for calculating the <b>chill</b> and anti-chill days and the <b>chilling</b> requirement to determine when rest is broken are found by trial and error to minimize the root mean square error of predicted and observed bud-burst dates. Using several years of weather and phenological data for cherry, pear, kiwifruit and olive orchards and nine forest species from locations in Sardinia, Italy, the <b>Chill</b> days model performed better than four classical <b>chill</b> unit models and two <b>chilling</b> hour models. The classical <b>chill</b> unit and <b>chilling</b> hour models failed to predict bud-burst in some years depending on the species and climate, whereas the <b>Chill</b> days model always gave good results. The classical <b>chill</b> unit and <b>chilling</b> hour models start to accumulate <b>chilling</b> when temperatures fall below the threshold in autumn, whereas the <b>Chill</b> days model begins to accumulate <b>chilling</b> at a phenological stage (i. e. leaf fall or harvest).

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} climate change on fruit production in Germany, this study aimed at determining long-term trends in winter <b>chill,</b> as calculated with the <b>Chilling</b> Hours and Dynamic Models (<b>Chill</b> Portions). An idealized daily temperature curve was used to convert daily temperature records from 43 weather stations, taken throughout the twentieth and late nineteenth centuries, into an hourly dataset, which was then converted to units of winter <b>chill.</b> Besides exposing temporal trends in winter <b>chill,</b> the data could be spatially interpolated, yielding contiguous maps of typical winter <b>chill</b> in Germany around 2010, as well as <b>chilling</b> losses since 1950. Throughout Germany, winter <b>chill</b> varied between 1700 and 3000 <b>Chilling</b> Hours or 125 and 150 <b>Chill</b> Portions. The areas of highest winter <b>chill</b> were located in the northern parts of the country. For the whole of Germany, there were no significant temporal trends. The extent of interregional variation in winter <b>chill</b> depended on the <b>chilling</b> model used. While the <b>Chilling</b> Hours Model showed strong declines in winter <b>chill</b> for the areas around Dresden and Leipzig, {{as well as for the}} Lake Constance region, the Dynamic Model did not detect such dramatic changes. More than a decline in winter <b>chill,</b> increased heat during the winter months might become a challenge to German fruit growers. As already experienced during the extraordinarily warm winter of 2006 / 07, warm temperatures during the winter can cause fruit trees that fulfill their <b>chilling</b> requirements relatively early to bloom prematurely. This can then lead to elevated risk of frost damage and hamper the homogeneity of flowering...|$|R

5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing <b>chills</b> and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory.

Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, <b>chills,</b> and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Spanish missionaries {{found that}} fever was treated by Amerindians near Loxa (Peru) with powder from Peruvian bark (later {{established}} to be from any of several trees of genus Cinchona). It {{was used by the}} Quechua Indians of Peru to reduce the shaking effects caused by severe <b>chills.</b> Jesuit Brother Agostino Salumbrino (1561–1642), who lived in Lima and was an apothecary by training, observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from cold, it was nevertheless effective for malaria. The use of the “fever tree” bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries (Jesuit's bark). Jesuit Bernabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited with taking cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of Italy, in 1632. Francesco Torti wrote in 1712 that only “intermittent fever” was amenable to the fever tree bark. This work finally established the specific nature of cinchona bark and brought about its general use in medicine.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare two <b>chilling</b> methods, {{combined}} (aerosol) and water <b>chilling,</b> {{in terms of their}} effectiveness in <b>chilling</b> of different weight categories of broiler chickens. At the same time microbial associations of different weight categories of broiler chickens were evaluated. Samples were collected in an approved establishment and poultry carcasses were divided according to weight and <b>chilling</b> methods into five categories. The first four categories were <b>chilled</b> using combined <b>chilling</b> method and fifth category was <b>chilled</b> with water. The temperature of the breast muscle before and after <b>chilling</b> and microbiological parameters (total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella) was measured. By comparing the temperature of the breast muscle after combined <b>chilling</b> method was not achieved in the breast muscles temperature below 4 °C in all weight categories. In any case, the lowest average temperature has been reached in the weight category < 1. 2 kg (4. 9 °C) and with increasing weight, the average temperature was rising, and the highest was in weight category 1. 8 to 2. 5 kg (10. 8 °C). Poultry carcasses were subsequently divided into portions and after cutting were <b>chilled</b> up to a temperature below 4 °C. In poultry carcasses <b>chilled</b> by water, the average temperature of the breast muscle after 20 minutes in the water bath was even higher (19. 6 °C) compared to combine <b>chilling.</b> Thus <b>chilled</b> poultry carcasses were frozen up to - 18 °C in a core of muscles. Comparing the microbiological contamination in different weight categories and <b>chilling</b> techniques, we found that the lowest total viable count (TVC) before and after <b>chilling</b> was in the lowest category and the difference before <b>chilling</b> was significantly lower comparing with all other categories. Conversely TVC after <b>chilling</b> by water was decreased. In comparing the number of Enterobacteriaceae before and after <b>chilling,</b> a similar pattern of contamination as above was found.
