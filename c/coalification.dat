50|$|Supporters {{of the in}} situ theory {{believe that}} close to its present {{location}} organic matter accumulated near a peat bog and, shortly after burial, underwent permineralisation - minerals seeped into the organic matter and formed an internal cast. Water with a high dissolved mineral content was buried with the plant matter in a peat bog. As the dissolved ions crystallised, the mineral matter precipitated out. This caused concretions containing plant material to form and preserve as rounded lumps of stone. <b>Coalification</b> was thus prevented, and the peat was preserved and eventually became a coal ball. The majority of coal balls are found in bituminous and anthracite coal seams, in locations where the peat was not compressed sufficiently to render the material into coal.|$|E
50|$|The {{two broad}} scale {{pathways}} of methane production, thermogenic and biogenic generation, {{account for the}} majority of methane generation in coals. Thermogenic production of methane in coals begins at temperatures around 80 °C and peaks around 0.7 - 1.6% of vitrinite reflectance. Biogenic generation of methane takes place through two chemically distinguishable pathways. These pathways are carbon dioxide reduction; and acetate fermentation and methanol/methyl utilization. Typically biogenic production takes place early in the maturation of a coal bed, since the temperatures observed during the <b>coalification</b> process are high enough for sterilization. A coal bed may produce methane later in its history if it is uplifted and fractured. The uplifting of the beds cools them enough for colonization by microbes and fractures and faults provide inoculation pathways by the infiltration of surface water.|$|E

30|$|<b>Coalification</b> {{temperatures}} are often {{considered to be}} approximately 100 – 170  °C for bituminous coal and 170 – 275  °C for anthracite. However, our micropetrographic observations, solid state 27 Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, interpretation of δ 13 C values for whewellite in pelosiderite concretions from Carboniferous sediments, and assessment of whewellite thermal stability show that <b>coalification</b> temperatures can be significantly lower. Also the temperatures of coal alteration may be substantially lower than is stated. Ordinarily, high-temperature alteration is reported, but microthermometric measurements of fluids temperatures and micropetrographic observations show that the coal alteration can take place at low temperatures. For this reason, coals from the Kladno–Rakovník Basin, part of Late Paleozoic continental basins of the Czech Republic, were analyzed. Regarding <b>coalification,</b> micropetrographic characterizations of unaltered coals, the presence of thermally unstable Al complexes in the coal organic mass documented using 27 Al MAS NMR method, and proven occurrence of whewellite in pelosiderite concretions suggest a lower <b>coalification</b> temperature, max. ~[*] 70  °C. Regarding coal alteration, micropetrographic observations revealed (a) the weaker intensity of fluorescence of liptinite, (b) mylonitic structures and microbreccia with carbonate fluid penetration, and (c) high oxygen content in coals (37 – 38  wt.%). These phenomena are typical for thermal and oxidative alteration of coal. As the temperature of carbonate fluids inferred from fluid inclusion analysis was evaluated as ~[*] 100 – 113  °C, the temperature of coal alteration was suggested as ~[*] 113  °C; the alteration was caused by hot hydrothermal fluids.|$|E

It is based on over 29, 000 analyses of the volatile matter moisture- and ash-free (Vdaf) from surface and underground boreholes drilled in 1946 – 1989. Vitrinite reflectance (Rmax) cannot be used as a measure of <b>coalification</b> in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin: the number of reflectance measurements is small and their distribution over the basin area is very uneven.

Inexplicable {{to date is}} that the precursor of coal, modern peat deposits, almost nowhere have such low ash yields {{as a result of}} both the inorganic mineral and biogenic phytolith contents. However, despite the common occurrence of phytoliths in modern peats, they are invariably absent in coals. It has thus been hypothesized by some investigators that modern environments are not ideal analogues for the formation of low ash coal deposits. Here we present new evidence to suggest that mineral diagenesis during <b>coalification</b> can transform biogenic inorganics to new minerals and that a substantial component of these new minerals could be removed in solution during expulsion of moisture with <b>coalification</b> resulting in low ash precursors of coal. This study presents results from artificial <b>coalification</b> experiments of modern tropical forest peat material with ash yields between 2 - 4. 3 wt. %. The inorganic material of the peat consists almost exclusively of Al-Si-and Si-rich phytoliths and other bioliths; no other inorganic mineral matter is present. Compressed pellets of dried peat were deformed in a Griggs constant strain rate apparatus at a constant confining pressure of 5 kb and constant strain rate of 10 - 5 s - 1 at variable temperatures from 350 [degree sign]C to 550 [degree sign]C. The samples, exposed to artificial <b>coalification</b> processes, were then analysed by SEM, EDS, and XRD for semi-quantitative chemical analyses.

Our experiments illustrate that during <b>coalification,</b> it is likely all or almost all biogenic material is transformed into new minerals, mainly quartz and clay minerals, such as kaolinite.

30|$|Austen et al. (1966) offer three {{possibilities}} for the origin of radicals in coal. Firstly, stable radicals {{are associated with the}} original organic matter and survive <b>coalification.</b> The radicals form as a result of enzymatic reactions, as well as the oxidation of organic matter during diagenesis. However, since radicals in the initial organic matter would mostly be localized on oxygen atoms, which are progressively expelled during <b>coalification,</b> it is unlikely that these are present in coal of bituminous rank (Austen et al. 1966). Indeed, with an increase in maturity from lignite to bituminous coal, the proportion of radicals localized on oxygen atoms is decreased (Austen et al. 1966). Radicals in such coals may instead be associated with carbon atoms, as molecular products of reactions related to oxygen expulsion (Austen et al. 1966). Secondly, the radicals form due to an increase in temperature during <b>coalification</b> (Austen et al. 1966; Qiu et al. 2007). The decomposition of methyl and methoxyl, hydroxyl, and carboxyl functional groups through homolytic fission with methane, water, and carbon dioxide as products respectively, results in the formation of radical species. The radicals are subsequently immobilized by the coal structure (Austen et al. 1966; Retcofsky et al. 1968). As the aromatic structure grows with increasing rank, bond breakage is also enhanced and the stable structure required to accommodate and shield the radicals is progressively established. The final mechanism proposed by Austen et al. (1966) is also related to a temperature rise. Radioactive decay of elements within mineral constituents of coal provides the heat required for the breaking of bonds in the organic fraction, resulting in the formation of radicals (Austen et al. 1966). All these three radical-generating processes, so far as they are related to homolytic bond fission during <b>coalification,</b> have subsequently been supported by others (e.g., Retcofsky et al. 1968; Kwan and Yen 1979; Krevelen 1993).|$|E

This {{suggests}} independent origin pathways for the dominant macerals present in each coal sample. Differences in the pathways must have occurred before the precursors for the dominant macerals of each density-fractionated sample underwent diagenesis in a classic peat-forming environment, wherein geochemical <b>coalification,</b> affecting {{the sum total of}} coal-forming materials, took place. Any other process affecting the materials during <b>coalification</b> should have imparted similar characteristics on all coal-forming materials. The dominant macerals of vitrinite-rich sample, collotelinite and collodetrinite, formed through humification and gelification of woody tissues in a water-logged setting (Teichmüller 1989; Diessel 1992; Krevelen 1993; ICCP 1998; Taylor et al. 1998; Hower et al. 2013; O’Keefe et al. 2013). Vitrinite formation is thus consistent with the lower radical content for the vitrinite-rich sample, thus lacking the pronounced, heat-induced alteration associated with fusinite genesis.|$|E
