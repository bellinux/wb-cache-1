6000|$|We {{carried out}} the corpse on three cheers (that joke was not {{intentional}} and I do not endorse it), and then the President, throned behind a <b>cable</b> <b>locker</b> with a national flag spread over it, announced the [...] "Reader," [...] who rose up and read that same old Declaration of Independence which we have all listened to so often without paying any attention to what it said; and after that the President piped the Orator of the Day to quarters and he made that same old speech about our national greatness which we so religiously believe and so fervently applaud. Now came the choir into court again, with the complaining instruments, and assaulted [...] "Hail Columbia"; and when victory hung wavering in the scale, George returned with his dreadful wild-goose stop turned on and the choir won, of course. A minister pronounced the benediction, and the patriotic little gathering disbanded. The Fourth of July was safe, {{as far as the}} Mediterranean was concerned.|$|E

50|$|First-class {{passengers}} were embalmed, placed in coffins, {{and stored in}} the rear <b>cable</b> <b>locker.</b> These included the bodies of: John Jacob Astor IV, the richest man aboard, body No.124 recovered on April 22, identified by the initials sewn on the label of his jacket; architect Edward Austin Kent, body No.258; and Isidor Straus, owner of Macy's Department Store.|$|E
5000|$|More a ropeworker's term than a knot term, {{it refers}} {{to the end of a}} rope that is tied off, hence the {{expression}} [...] "hanging on to the bitter end". A bitt is a metal block with a crosspin used for tying lines to, found on piers. In fact the bitter end is the end of the anchor [...] "cable" [...] that connects to the anchor bitts in the <b>cable</b> <b>locker</b> under the forecastle or poop using the bitter pin. (British nautical usage.) Other uses may be borrowed from this derivation.|$|E
5000|$|The anchor is {{shackled}} to {{the anchor}} cable (US anchor chain), the cable passes {{up through the}} hawsepipe, through the pawl, over the windlass gypsy (US wildcat) down through the [...] "spurling pipe" [...] to the chain/cable locker under the forecastle (or poop if at the stern (US fantail)) - the anchor [...] are on a bulkhead in the <b>cable</b> <b>locker</b> and the [...] of the cable {{is connected to the}} bitts using the bitter pin, which should be able to be released from outside the locker to [...] "slip" [...] the anchor. This would occur if the windlass brake has slipped (in a storm, for example) and the cable has reached [...] "the bitter end". This is the origin of the term [...] "to the bitter end". It originally applied in sailing vessels where the cable was a rope, and the windlass or capstan was powered by many sailors below decks.|$|E
5000|$|At 16:06 (or 16:15, {{according}} to Leggett), Volage struck a second mine. That mine was also later {{determined to be}} a German-manufactured EMC. Volage reportedly hit the mine head on; [...] "In a split second forty feet of the destroyer, from the fore peak to {{just in front of}} ‘A’ gun turret, had vanished. Mess decks, store rooms, the paint shop, the <b>cable</b> <b>locker</b> containing tons of anchor cable, the anchors themselves, literally dissolved in the air" [...] (Leggett 1976:71-72). Fragments of the bow were observed flying into the air, and other fragments, [...] "some weighing up to half a ton" [...] landed on the ship, some on to the bridge (Leggett 1976:72). Leggett (36) and Meçollari (96-99) chart the site of Volage’s mining off the north point of the Bay of Saranda. As previously noted, despite their damage, both destroyers remained afloat, and subsequently returned to Corfu under tow. Saumarez suffered 36 dead, 25 of whom were missing and presumed killed, while Volage lost eight men, seven of whom were missing, presumed killed (Leggett 1976:154-155).|$|E
