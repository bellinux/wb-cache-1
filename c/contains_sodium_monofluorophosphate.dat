40|$|Introduction: The {{major reason}} for decline in dental caries across globe is because of {{widespread}} use of fluoride dentifrices. For a fluoride dentifrice {{to be effective in}} the control of dental caries, an adequate concentration of the fluoride must be soluble. Objective: To assess soluble fluoride and total fluoride content in selected commercial dentifrices in Davangere. Materials and Methods: The soluble fluoride and total fluoride content in six selected commercial dentifrices in Davangere were assessed and expressed as ppm of fluoride (F) (mgF/g). Total fluoride and soluble fluoride was determined using an ion-specific electrode. Descriptive statistics applied to assess the mean total fluoride and soluble fluoride. Results: The total fluoride and soluble fluoride concentrations were approximately near to 1, 000 ppm. Among the six dentifrices evaluated, four <b>contained</b> <b>sodium</b> fluoride (NaF) and two <b>contained</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (Na MFP) as fluoride compound. Conclusions: All the fluoridated dentifrices evaluated in this study contain adequate amount of soluble and total fluoride...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of fluoridated dentifrices in caries prevention {{has been well}} documented and research into various formulations continues for a more effective dentifrice. This study evaluated the anti-caries and anti-plaque {{efficacy of}} a dentifrice <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (1000 ppm) and calcium glycerophosphate, and compared it with a non-fluoridated dentifrice. Materials and Methods: A total of 595 school children (12 - 15 years) were divided into test (302 children) and control (293 children) groups. The test group used the dentifrice <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (1000 ppm) and calcium glycerophosphate, whereas the control group was given a placebo dentifrice. Oral examination for dental caries and plaque assessment was carried out {{at the start of the}} study and the children were followed up semiannually up to 18 months. Data were analyzed using repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by one-way ANOVA. Results: The values for decayed missing filled teeth (DMFT) increased from baseline to 18 month examination from 4. 43 ± 2. 03 and 4. 67 ± 2. 25 (P= 0. 175) to 5. 84 ± 2. 29 and 5. 13 ± 2. 30 (P= 0. 001) for control and test groups, respectively. Similarly, the increase in decayed missing filled surface (DMFS) values were from 6. 42 ± 4. 10 and 7. 06 ± 4. 77 (P= 0. 082) to 8. 64 ± 4. 51 and 7. 92 ± 5. 07 (P= 0. 095) for test and control groups, respectively. The mean DMFT and DMFS values increased for both the groups; however, the increase was less in test group as compared to control group. The baseline plaque score reduced from 2. 94 ± 0. 72 and 2. 91 ± 0. 72 (P= 0. 679), respectively, for control and test groups to 1. 33 ± 0. 46 and 0. 91 ± 0. 38 (P< 0. 001), respectively, at 18 month examination.

40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} of the {{clinical}} effectiveness of two small groups of fluoride-containing toothpastes {{on the basis of}} published and unpublished information available to the group. One comparison showed that particular sodium fluoride/silica and stannous fluoride/calcium pyrophosphate formulations were effective in reducing the incidence of dental caries in schoolchildren and that the former toothpaste was more effective than the latter. A separate comparison showed that certain toothpastes <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> formulated with either an alumina or an insoluble metaphosphate abrasive were also effective in reducing and controlling caries. The group recommended that there was a need for additional field trials in which direct comparisons could be made between a wide variety of formulations, and that further research should be carried out to develop improved formulations. Extension of the use of adequately formulated fluoride-containing toothpastes is recommended as a valuable public health measure to reduce the incidence of dental caries...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Dentifrices are {{commonly}} used for oral hygiene with some formulated with antimicrobial agents to control plaque. There is little information regarding the effects of dentifrices on controlling dental plaque and gingivitis amongst Indian subjects. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of three commercially-available fluoride dentifrices on established gingivitis and supragingival dental plaque after 6 -week of product use. Materials and Methods: Adult subjects completing informed consent and presenting a Loe-Silness gingival index (GI) score ≥ 1. 0 and a Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification, plaque index (PI) score ≥ 1. 5 completed a 2 -week washout period with commercial fluoride toothpaste. They were instructed to refrain from all other oral hygiene products (including mints, chewing gums, mouth rinses). Subjects returned to the clinical facility again having refrained from all oral hygiene procedures for 12 h and from eating, drinking or smoking for 4 h for baseline gingivitis and plaque examinations. They {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three treatment groups according to baseline gingival and plaque indices scores: (1) A dentifrice containing 0. 3 % triclosan and 1000 ppm <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (Colgate ® Supershakti Dental Cream), (2) a dentifrice containing 0. 54 % zinc citrate, 0. 64 % stannous chloride and 0. 33 % sodium fluoride (Crest ® Pro-Health All Good 7 Effects Toothpaste), and (3) a dentifrice <b>containing</b> 1000 ppm <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (Colgate ® CIBACA Toothpaste [negative control]). After 6 -week use of their assigned dentifrice, all subjects were recalled for posttreatment plaque and GI examinations. Results: 105 subjects completed the study. Baseline plaque and GI scores demonstrated no statistical differences between treatment groups (P > 0. 05). Further, Chi-square analysis demonstrated no significant differences between treatment groups for subject age or gender (P > 0. 05). At the 6 -week examinations, subjects in all three dentifrice groups exhibited statistically significant reductions in GI scores (32. 5 %, 16. 6 % and 19. 9 %, respectively) and PI (38. 1 %, 16. 4 % and 20. 4 %, respectively) scores from baseline (P < 0. 05). The triclosan group exhibited statistically significant (P < 0. 05) reductions in GI scores (17. 5 % and 12. 5 %, respectively) and PI scores (21. 7 % and 19. 1 %, respectively) when compared to the zinc citrate/stannous chloride dentifrice and to the <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> dentifrice. Conclusion: The triclosan/sodium monofluorophosphate dentifrice (Colgate Supershakti Dental Cream) demonstrated significantly less gingivitis and greater reductions of supragingival dental plaque (P < 0. 05) when compared to a dentifrice containing zinc citrate/stannous chloride/sodium fluoride (Crest Pro-Health All Good 7 Effects Toothpaste) and to a dentifrice <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (Colgate CIBACA Toothpaste) ...|$|R
40|$|Artificial plaque {{from human}} saliva {{produces}} glycolytic action after {{three to four}} hours in-cubation at 37 C. When 6 to 8 ppm F from aminefluorides is present, such effects are ab-sent. Under the same conditions, up to 100 ppm F from sodium fluoride and monoflu-orophosphate are inactive; stannous fluoride is active at 50 ppm F, but not at 10 ppm F. A marketed preparation of a gel that con-tains aminefluoride is active at 80 ppm F, whereas an inorganic fluoride gel is active only at 1, 250 ppm F. Aminefluoride compounds have caries-pre-ventive effects as pure compounds and in dentifrices in animals'- 4 and humans. 5 Her-mann and Muhlemann 6 have noted that in the presence of these compounds, glycolysis rates of saliva decreased sharply; this indi-cates killing or static effects on salivary mi-croorganisms. On the basis of clinical studies, dentifrices that <b>contain</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> or stannous fluoride as the principal active in-gredient have been classified by the Amer-ican Dental Association Council on Dental Therapeutics as effective in helping to pre-vent dental caries. 7 In a 20 month clinical study, a neutral sodium fluoride-calcium py-rophosphate dentifrice and a stannous flu-oride dentifrice demonstrated significant car-ies reductions Because carious lesions are associated with plaque-forming streptococci and plaque also is associated with gingivitis and periodontal disease, we decided to test inorganic and aminefluorides as pure compounds and in commercial preparations in the in vitro plaque system described by Dolan et al. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: This {{clinical}} study aimed to evaluate {{effectiveness of a}} commercially available toothpaste <b>containing</b> potassium nitrate, <b>sodium</b> monoflurophosphate, and nano-hydroxyapatite as well as antioxidants phloretin, ferulic acid and silymarin in reducing dental hypersensitivity in adults. Materials and methods: The clinical trial enrolled patients {{with a history of}} dentin hypersensitivity. A test toothpaste was introduced into the daily routine, which included initial instruc-tion on usage. Patients completed a five-question visual analog scale (VAS) at the inception/baseline, after two days and after two weeks of using the toothpaste to determine their level of tooth sensitivity at baseline {{with the use of the}} toothpaste over time. Results: Patients that had significant sensitivity at baseline had a range of 52 % to 76 % improvement after 48 hours and a range of 70 % to 84 % improvement after two weeks.

40|$|Four {{corrosion}} inhibitors namely <b>sodium</b> nitrite, <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate,</b> ethanolamine and an alkanolamine-based mixture were studied by immersing mild steel bars for 42 days in model electrolytes of varied pH and chloride concentration which {{were intended to}} simulate the pore solution phase present within carbonated and/or chloride-contaminated concrete. Site trials were carried out on <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> and the alkanolamine-based inhibitor to study their depth of penetration into concrete. The influence of various carbonating atmospheres on the pore solution chemistry and microstructure of hydrated cement paste was investigated. Physical realkalisation of carbonated cement paste and a calcium nitrite-based corrosion rehabilitation system for chloride-contaminated cement paste were investigated by monitoring ionic transport within the pore solution phase of laboratory specimens. The main findings were as follows: 1,Sodium nitrite, <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate,</b> ethanolamine and the alkanolamine-based mixture all behaved as passivating anodic inhibitors of steel corrosion in air-saturated aqueous solutions of varied pH and chloride concentration. 2,Sodium monofluorophosphate failed to penetrate significantly into partially carbonated site concrete when applied as recommended by the supplier. Phosphate and fluoride penetrated 5 mm into partially carbonated site concrete treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate.</b> 3,The ethanolamine component of the alkanolamine-based inhibitor {{was found to have}} penetrated significant depths into partially carbonated site concrete. 4,Carbonating hydrated cement paste over saturated solutions of sodium nitrite resulted in significant concentrations of nitrite in the pore solution of the carbonated paste. Saturated solutions of sodium chloride, ammonium nitrate, magnesium nitrate and sodium dichromate were investigated and identified as alternatives for controlling the relative humidity of the carbonating environment. 5,Hardened carbonated cement paste can by physically realkalised to a limited extent due to the diffusion of hydroxyl ions under saturated conditions. A substantial proportion of the hydroxyl ions that diffused into the carbonated cement paste however, became bound into the cement matrix.

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1929 by the German chemist Willy Lange, {{who was then}} with the University of Berlin. His fruitless attempts to prepare the free monofluorophosphoric acid led him to check the stability of its esters. Together with Gerda von Krüger, one of his students, Lange thus synthesized diethyl fluorophosphate and some analogs, which proved to be quite toxic, being related to nerve agents. In the 1930s, Gerhard Schrader, working for the German company IG Farben, tried to develop synthetic insecticide. His work focused on esters of phosphoric acid and resulted in an accidental discovery of some other nerve agents such as DFP (diisopropyl fluorophosphate), Tabun, Soman, and Sarin. In the meantime, Lange, who {{was married to a}} Jewish woman, emigrated from Germany to the United States and started work for Procter and Gamble Company. In 1947, he and Ralph Livingston of Monsanto Company published the preparation of the free fluorophosphoric acids and mentioned the use of some toxic esters of monofluorophosphoric acid (like DFP) in the treatment of glaucoma and myasthenia gravis. The well known toxicity of these esters led to fears that the simple salts might also be toxic, and such fears precluded any large scale commercial use of the salts. In 1950, under sponsorship of the manufacturer of the compounds, Ozark Chemical Company, the toxicity of <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> was studied by Harold Hodge at the University of Rochester who included anti-cavity testing. In 1967 Colgate-Palmolive filed several patents on the use of <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> in toothpaste.|$|R

Objective: The {{objectives of}} this study were: a) determine the concentration of fluoride ion (FI), total soluble fluoride (FST), and total fluoride (FT) in toothpaste <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (MFP) that were commercialized {{in the state of}} Paraiba. It was sought to investigate whether the brand, place of sale (mesoregion) and storage (the presence air conditioning) could play a role in these concentrations. It was also aimed to analyze the influence of a natural compound in fluoride potentiometric reading on not traded experimental toothpastes. Materials and Methods: For Study 1, samples (n = 57) were collected in 14 cities drawn from 4 mesoregions. Analyses were performed in triplicate using specific electrode for fluoride. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ANOVA. For Study 2, the analyzes of samples (n = 59) were carried out in 3 phases: 1) determine the concentration of fluorine FT, FST and FI by direct reading; 2) determine the concentration of FT HMDS (gold standard) 3) determine the concentration of TF in toothpaste containing MFP experimental model containing different concentrations of hydrocolloid and mucin. Results: In Study 1, it was found that all the analyzed dentifrices exhibited FT values below 1500 ppm regardless of their mesoregion and brand. The average concentrations of FST were low, ranging between 750 - 800 ppm. The average concentrations (DP) of FI per establishment with and without air conditioning were 281. 14 (21. 75) and 262. 72 (69. 01) respectively (p> 0. 05). For the second study, we observed a decrease of the concentration of dentifrice FT evaluated by directly reading when compared with the HMDS (gold standard). At a concentration of 50 % in the dentifrice formulation, the hydrocolloid proved to interfere with the direct analysis of the total fluorine (947. 65 ppm) compared to a sample without the presence of the natural compound (1095, 52 ppm). When analyzed by HMDS, these same samples showed concentrations (1812. 44) and (1525. 37) respectively. Conclusion: The fluoride concentrations in toothpastes do not exceed the maximum allowed legally, however, they proved to be below than the ideal concentrations (1000 ppm). The fluoride concentrations in toothpastes sold in Paraiba were not influenced by storage locations and regions of the state.

40|$|Tooth {{hypersensitivity}} due to exposed {{dentinal tubules}} {{is a common}} finding in the adult population, {{with as many as}} 1 in 7 (8 - 57 %) patients attending for dental treatment [1, 2]. The subjects’ evaluation of their own overall sensitivity, i. e. subject assessment, has been used frequently to measure hypersensitivity in clinical studies [3]. This assessment is done through various types of stimuli, which can be applied on the teeth to evoke a response from the patient. Patient’s own perception of overall hypersensitivity, as experienced by them, following application of various stimuli, can be reported using either a verbal rating scale (VRS) [4], or a visual analogue scale (VAS) [5]. A number of treatment options are currently available for the treatment of hypersensitivity. Agents may bring about their therapeutic effects, either by partial or complete obturation of dentinal tubules (tubule occluding agents), by anti-inflammatory activity, protein precipitation, or sealing the tubules. Research into the use of the mineral components of the inorganic portion of the tooth structure, i. e. calcium and phosphate has evoked considerable interest [6 - 11], and has inspired the preparation of hydroxyapatite (HAP), for occlusion of dentinal tubules [12]. Numerous studies have also reported the application of hydroxyapatite in various formulations, as dentifrices and gels in the treatment of tooth hypersensitivity [13 - 17]. Potassium nitrate [18 - 20] and <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> [21, 22] are popular and proven desensitizing agents with worldwide usage and applications. A pilot study evaluating the efficacy of Hydroxyapatite as an in-office desensitizing agent found it to be very effective [12], therefore, the present study was undertaken with the primary objective of evaluating the clinical effectiveness of HAP, in comparison with potassium nitrate and <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> in treating hypersensitivity at 0, 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks, following usage...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was performed on}} the inhibition of steel reinforcement corrosion using three soluble phosphates: <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> (Na 2 PO 3 F), disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na 2 HPO 4) and trisodium phosphate (Na 3 PO 4). Tests were carried out using ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste specimens and OPC mortar specimens with embedded steel reinforcements. The corrosion inhibitors were deployed in two different ways: by immersion of OPC specimens in aqueous solutions containing the soluble phosphates (migrating corrosion inhibitor), and by addition of the phosphate powders to a fresh OPC paste (admixture corrosion inhibitor). After curing, the tested specimens were studied using X-ray diffraction, wavelength-dispersive electron microprobe analysis, linear polarisation resistance and electrochemical corrosion potential. A correlation was found between the phosphate content (by migration or admixture) in the OPC matrices and the steel corrosion rate. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Electron and atomic force {{microscopy}} {{techniques have}} been applied to characteriz e both the in vitro deposition and the microstructure of the KOH-soluble fluorid e precipitates on human dental enamel. The study {{was focused on the}} effects of a mine fluoride, sodium fluoride and <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> having a fluoride concentration of 0. 1 % F in acidulated and aqueous solutions. Under certain condi tions, fluoride globules were formed within an initation time of less than 20 s. This result supports the potential significance of this process for the cariost atic action of fluorides during dentifrice use. The deposition intensity seems t o be dependent on the availability of Ca and F ions on the dental surface.

5000|$|Fluoride-containing compounds, such as sodium {{fluoride}} or <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate</b> {{are used in}} topical and systemic fluoride therapy for preventing tooth decay. They are used for water fluoridation and in many products associated with oral hygiene. Originally, {{sodium fluoride}} was used to fluoridate water; hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6) and its salt sodium hexafluorosilicate (Na2SiF6) are more commonly used additives, especially in the United States. The fluoridation of water is known to prevent tooth decay and is considered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as [...] "one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century". In some countries where large, centralized water systems are uncommon, fluoride is delivered to the populace by fluoridating table salt. For the method of action for cavity prevention, see Fluoride therapy. Fluoridation of water has its critics (see Water fluoridation controversy).|$|R
5000|$|Crest was {{introduced}} in the United States as [...] "Fluoristan" [...] in 1954 as it contained stannous fluoride. In 1955, the name of the product was changed to [...] "Crest with Fluoristan". The composition of the toothpaste had been developed by Drs. Muhler, Harry Day, and William H. Nebergall at Indiana University, and was patented by Nebergall. Procter & Gamble paid royalties from use of the patent and thus financed a new dental research institute at this university ("The House that Crest built"). The active ingredient of Crest was changed in 1981 to <b>sodium</b> <b>monofluorophosphate,</b> or [...] "Fluoristat". Today Crest toothpastes use sodium fluoride, or [...] "Dentifrice with Fluoristat"; Crest Pro-Health uses stannous fluoride again and an abrasive whitener together called [...] "Polyfluorite". Crest is accepted by the American Dental Association (ADA) as well as by equivalent dental associations in other countries.|$|R
