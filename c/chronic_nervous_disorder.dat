40|$|Epilepsy is a <b>chronic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder</b> {{caused by}} {{abnormal}} electrical signals in the brain. Epileptic seizures can be minimized {{with the use}} of anticonvulsant drugs. Use of anticonvulsants by a pregnant woman poses the risk of damage to an unborn baby. One of the most common anticonvulsants is diphenyihydantoin (DPH). To study the effects on the fetus of preimplantation exposure to anticonvulsants, DPH was injected into A/J and NSA strains of mice during the first five days of pregnancy. Fetuses were examined externally on Day 18 of development and later dissected for internal examination. The DPH mice of both strains showed no internal or external anomalies other than reduced size. Other effects found were the inability to establish pregnancy, increases in resorptions, and smaller litter size. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E
40|$|Impaired glial {{glutamate}} uptake {{is commonly}} involved in neuronal damages observed in acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders.</b> As <b>nervous</b> insults are frequently associated with local inflammation involving microglia, {{this study aims}} at exploring the link between activated microglia and altered glutamate uptake in astrocytes. The regulation of the expression and activity of type 1 glutamate transporter (GLT- 1) was examined after exposing cultures of rat astrocytes to conditioned medium from lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia cultures. Significant increases in GLT- 1 mRNA expression and dihydrokainate sensitive uptake of aspartate were observed after 72 h of treatment. These effects were reproduced by direct exposure of the astrocyte cultures to tumor necrosis factor alpha, a major cytokine released by activated microglia. The regulation of GLT- 1 activity in response to inflammatory stimuli was also evidenced in cells exposed to dibutyryl cAMP, recognised {{as a model of}} reactive astrocytes in which the expression of this glutamate transporter is constitutively enhanced. Taken together, these results suggest that the GLT- 1 -dependent control of glutamate neurotransmission by either naive or chemically activated astrocytes is influenced by microglia-mediated inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Hyponatremia is {{a common}} {{complication}} following acute or <b>chronic</b> central <b>nervous</b> system <b>disorders.</b> It {{may be due to}} inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone or the cerebral salt wasting syndrome, which are usually attributed to each other due to identical clinical presentation. Since the pathogenesis and the treatment of these two syndromes are different, the cerebral salt wasting syndrome must be clearly differentiated from the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Cerebral salt wasting syndrome is rarely seen in children. In this article, 2 patients with the cerebral salt wasting syndrome are presented. Diagnosis and the treatment of this syndrome are discussed in view of the literature...|$|R
40|$|Nervous system {{infections are}} among the most {{important}} diseases in travellers. Healthy travellers might be exposed to infectious agents of central nervous system, which may require in-patient care. Progressive course is not uncommon in this family of disorders and requires swift diagnosis. An overview of the available evidence in the field is, therefore, urgent to pave the way to increase the awareness of travel-medicine practitioners and highlights dark areas for future research. In November 2013, data were collected from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge (1980 to 2013) including books, reviews, and peer-reviewed literature. Works pertained to pre-travel care, interventions, vaccinations related neurological infections were retrieved. Here we provide information on pre-travel care, vaccination, <b>chronic</b> <b>nervous</b> system <b>disorders,</b> and post-travel complications. Recommendations with regard to knowledge gaps, and state-of-the-art research are made. Given an increasing number of international travellers, novel dynamic ways are available for physicians to monitor spread of central nervous system infections. Newer research has made great progresses in developing newer medications, detecting the spread of infections and the public awareness. Despite an ongoing scientific discussion in the field of travel medicine, further research is required for vaccine development, state-of-the-art laboratory tests, and genetic engineering of vectors...|$|R
40|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} <b>chronic</b> central <b>nervous</b> system <b>disorder</b> {{characterized}} by repeated malicious seizures. Current medications acceptable by medical practitioners till date mostly suppresses the seizures and has symptomatic relief, but no effect on epileptogenesis. In the present work, we have attempted to provide the scientific base to use the bee venom therapy (Apitherapy) which was practiced throughout ancient Egyptian, Greek and Chinese civilization to treat epilepsy. Our computational studies and molecular dynamics simulation results indicate that interaction between S 100 B (calcium binding protein) and melittin (a venom peptide from bee), resulted in the structural distortion and inaccessibility of calcium binding domain of S 100 B protein, which is required to maintain ionic imbalance due to over expressed S 100 B in disease conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of photoluminescent of BIOCERAMIC(PLB) and BIOCERAMIC resonance {{are based on}} BIOCERAMIC material, {{is a kind of}} non-ionized radiation spectrum emitting material possesses characteristics of weakening effect on water hydrogen bonds. The effect is corresponding to our previous medical-biological studies, such as microcirculation enhancement. Herein, a review is to conclude our previous study on therapeutic effect of PLB or BIOCERAMIC resonance. They are include: glucose level control on diabetics by animal model; improved motor activity on middle cerebral arterial occlusion(MCAO) of rats by PLB treatment; normalizing ability to the mean current level measurement of acupuncture points on skin by PLB irradiation; enhanced propagated sensation along meridians‟ (PSM) phenomenon with clinical benefits by PLB effect on different meridian channels; combine effects of PLB and BIOCERAMIC resonance on many disorders such as insomnia, migraine(a <b>chronic</b> sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system <b>disorder)</b> and other autonomic <b>nervous</b> system <b>disorder,</b> associate clinical improvements. Thus, application of BIOCERAMIC technology for complementary therapy has scientific evidence based with good expectation. Running title: BIOCERAMIC therapy...|$|R
40|$|Objective—Major {{depression}} {{is a common}} concomitant of <b>chronic</b> central <b>nervous</b> system <b>disorders,</b> notably Parkinson’s disease (PD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been investigated as a potential treatment for depression in PD and for the movement disorder of PD, but comprehensive testing in multiple areas of performance has seldom been carried out within a single study. We studied the effect of left dorsolateral prefrontal rTMS on several different functional domains. Methods—Fourteen PD patients with treatment-resistant depression entered an open, 10 -day inpatient study of 10 -Hertz rTMS, undergoing extensive psychiatric, neuropsychological, and motor testing from baseline to 6 weeks after treatment. Motor testing included a defined “off ” state. Results—rTMS was well-tolerated. Highly significant improvement in depression scores was seen three days and 3 - 6 weeks after treatment. Improvement was also found in anxiety, movement scores (especially in the off state), and some neuropsychological measures. We {{found no evidence of}} increased risk from rTMS in this population. Conclusions—Further controlled trials of rTMS in PD appear worthwhile, and should include a defined “off ” state. Significance—TMS may be beneficial for depressed PD patients in multiple functional domains...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a <b>chronic</b> central <b>nervous</b> system <b>disorder</b> {{characterized by}} white matter inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration. Although cognitive dysfunction {{is a common}} manifestation, it may go unnoticed in recently-diagnosed patients. Prior studies suggest MS patients develop compensatory mechanisms potentially involving enhanced performance monitoring. Here we assessed the performance monitoring system in early-stage MS patients using the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related brain potential (ERP) observed following behavioral errors. Twenty-seven early-stage MS patients and 31 controls were neuropsychologically assessed. Electroencephalography recordings were obtained while participants performed: a) a stop task and b) an auditory oddball task. Behavior and ERP measures were assessed. No differences in performance were found between groups in most neuropsychological tests or in behavior or ERP components in the auditory oddball task. However, the amplitude of the ERN associated with stop errors in the stop task was significantly higher in patients. ERN amplitude correlated positively with scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score, and negatively with the time since last relapse. Patients showed higher neuronal recruitment in tasks involving performance monitoring. Results suggest the development of compensatory brain mechanisms in early-stage MS and reflect {{the sensitivity of the}} ERN to detect these changes. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare body sway {{characteristics}} of the healthy elderly and the disordered elderly. The subjects were 38 healthy elderly and 24 disordered elderly with disequilibrium. The latter consisted of two groups : 12 elderly with vestibular organ or central <b>nervous</b> systems <b>disorder</b> (central <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders),</b> and 12 elderly with disorder in other systems (other disorders). The measurement device can calculate the center of foot pressure (CFP) of vertical loads from the values of three vertical load sensors, which are located {{at the corners of}} an isosceles triangle on a level surface. The data sampling frequency was 20 Hz. Four body sway factors with high reliability (unit time sway, frontback sway, left-right sway, and high frequency band power) were used to evaluate body sway. As compared with healthy people, central <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders</b> had larger unit time sway, high frequency band power, and left-right sway factors. Other disorders were larger in unit time sway and high frequency band power factors. Central <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders,</b> as compared with other disorders, had larger unit time sway and left-right sway factors. Disorders produced large and fast sway, and central <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders</b> in particular showed a marked sway in the left-right direction.

This article argues that the Pink Pill advertisements contributed to the ‘psychologizing’ of society. The advertisements created an imaginary community of people sufferingfrom <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders</b> with whom the readers could identify. Initially, the Pink Pill advertisements highlighted somatic explanations for the correlation between weak nerves and ‘thin blood’. After 1910 the advertisements placed ever more emphasis on the personality traits of those with <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders.</b> Furthermore, causes were mentioned, such as considerable work pressure. It is notable that such external causes of the disorders were particularly sought for male sufferers, whereas for female sufferers the cause continued to be attributed to them being the ‘weaker sex’.
