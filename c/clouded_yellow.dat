5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow,</b> Camberwell beauty, painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.|$|E
25|$|Colias croceus {{is a small}} {{butterfly}} of the Pieridae family, that is, the yellows and whites. In India {{and nearby}} regions it {{is known as the}} dark <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> or common <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> to distinguish it from the other species of clouded yellows occurring there; elsewhere it is often simply known as the <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow,</b> as it was the first and original butterfly to go by this name.|$|E
60|$|The stag-beetle dies slowly (it was John who {{collected}} the beetles). Even {{on the second}} day its legs were supple. But the butterflies were dead. A whiff of rotten eggs had vanquished the pale <b>clouded</b> <b>yellows</b> which came pelting across the orchard and up Dods Hill and away on to the moor, now lost behind a furze bush, then off again helter-skelter in a broiling sun. A fritillary basked on a white stone in the Roman camp. From the valley came the sound of church bells. They were all eating roast beef in Scarborough; for it was Sunday when Jacob caught the pale <b>clouded</b> <b>yellows</b> in the clover field, eight miles from home.|$|R
2500|$|Colias croceus {{is one of}} the most-widespread {{species in}} Europe. The common <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow's</b> {{breeding}} range is North Africa and southern Europe and eastwards through Turkey into the Middle East but it occurs throughout much of Europe as a summer migrant, in good years individuals reaching Scandinavia. [...] In Asia, its range extends into central Siberia in the north and barely into India in the south; it is not found in Central Asia.|$|R
60|$|It {{fell like}} an eye upon the stirrups, and then {{suddenly}} and yet very gently rested upon the bed, upon the alarum clock, and upon the butterfly box stood open. The pale <b>clouded</b> <b>yellows</b> had pelted over the moor; they had zigzagged across the purple clover. The fritillaries flaunted along the hedgerows. The blues settled on little bones lying on the turf with the sun beating on them, and the painted ladies and the peacocks feasted upon bloody entrails dropped by a hawk. Miles away from home, in a hollow among teasles beneath a ruin, {{he had found the}} commas. He had seen a white admiral circling higher and higher round an oak tree, but he had never caught it. An old cottage woman living alone, high up, had told him of a purple butterfly which came every summer to her garden. The fox cubs played in the gorse in the early morning, she told him. And if you looked out at dawn you could always see two badgers. Sometimes they knocked each other over like two boys fighting, she said.|$|R
25|$|In a small {{proportion}} of females (about 5%) the golden upperside colouration is replaced by a pale cream colour. These females have been distinguished as form helice. The pale form helice {{does not seem to be}} that distinct as intermediates exist and the variation is to some extent related to humidity during development, with dryer conditions producing paler colouration. These pale forms helice can be confused with Berger's <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> (Colias sareptensis) and the rarer Pale <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> (Colias hyale). Even the palest C. croceus tends to have more black on the upperside however, in particular on the hindwings.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known movie featuring some exterior scenes {{filmed in}} the city is On the Night of the Fire (1939), though by and large the action is studio-bound. Later came The <b>Clouded</b> <b>Yellow</b> (1951) and Payroll (1961), both of which feature more extensive scenes filmed {{in the city}}. The gangster thriller Get Carter (1971) was shot on location in and around Newcastle and offers {{an opportunity to see}} what Newcastle looked like in the early 1970s. The city was also backdrop to another gangster film, the film noir Stormy Monday (1988), directed by Mike Figgis and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Melanie Griffith, Sting and Sean Bean.|$|E
50|$|Female: Each wing of {{the female}} whitetail is marked with a small, dark, {{elongated}} spot with a clear center, near the base, and {{with a pair of}} thick, wavy, brownish bands spanning the width of the wing. The wingtip is sometimes <b>clouded</b> with <b>yellow.</b> The female thorax and abdomen are grayish brown. Every side of the thorax is marked with a pair of yellowish stripes, and {{at the top of the}} abdomen is marked with two parallel lines of thick yellow dashes.|$|R
50|$|The plains clubtail is {{a medium}} to large {{dragonfly}} with {{a length of}} 2 1/16 to 2 3/8 inches (52 to 60 mm). The base of this dragonfly is brownish black. Its face is marked with yellow. The top of its thorax behind its head is marked with a parallel pair of yellow stripes, and every side of the thorax is marked with several diagonal yellow stripes. The base of its wings may be <b>clouded</b> with <b>yellow</b> where they attach to its body. Its abdomen is black and is marked with a line of yellow dashes along the top. As with other clubtails, the segments {{at the tip of}} its abdomen are wider than the rest.|$|R
5000|$|The size of {{the shell}} attains 24 mm. The {{imperforate}} shell has an ovate-conic shape. Its color pattern is yellowish brown, or <b>yellow</b> <b>clouded</b> with orange-brown. The elevated spire is acute. The five whorls are sloping above, convex, longitudinally irregularly striate, and spirally costate. The costae are rugose, irregular, slightly elevated, about four on the penultimate whorl, twelve on the body whorl. The aperture is circular. The peristome is simple. The columella is white.|$|R
25|$|Despite its arid climate, {{the island}} {{is also home to}} a {{surprisingly}} large insect fauna. Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> (Colias hyale) and the bath white (Pontia daplidice) which feeds on xerophytic cruciferae. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and its close African relative Danaus chrysippus. Around holiday developments such as Caleta de Fuste, water is relatively abundant, and dragonfly species including the blue emperor, Anax imperator and the scarlet darter, Crocothemis erythraea can be found. The islands sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of bee and wasp species including the large Eumenid caterpillar hunting wasp, Delta dimidiatipenne and the striking blue banded bee, (Amegilla canifrons).|$|E
2500|$|A truly migratory European butterfly, {{this species}} {{is famous for}} {{occasional}} mass migrations and subsequent breeding, which are often {{referred to in the}} United Kingdom as [...] "clouded yellow years". Notable <b>clouded</b> <b>yellow</b> years include 1877, 1947, 1983, 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2000.|$|E
