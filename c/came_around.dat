5|$|Ultimately though, it was Heisuke Yanagawa's 10th Army which, on November 19, {{abruptly}} {{crossed the}} operation restriction line and began advancing on Nanking. In {{response to this}} flagrant act of insubordination, Matsui, it is claimed, made some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but he also insisted to the high command that marching on Nanking was the right course of action. On December 1 the Army General Staff finally <b>came</b> <b>around</b> and approved an operation against Nanking, though by then many of Japan's units in the field were already well on their way.|$|E
5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on used tyres {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars <b>came</b> <b>around</b> for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E

5|$|Brundage, {{through his}} tenure, slowly <b>came</b> <b>around</b> to the {{position}} advocated by Iron Curtain IOC members, that the important thing was to recognize the mainland, with Taiwan of less importance. Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), {{it was not until}} 1975, after Brundage's departure as president, that the PRC applied to rejoin the Olympic movement. The PRC again participated at the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid and then the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; the island NOC competed as the Republic of China in 1968 and 1972; when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976, after Brundage's death, it boycotted the 1976 and 1980 games, returning in 1984 as Chinese Taipei.|$|E
5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the {{climb to the}} finish. At {{the foot of the}} climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe <b>came</b> <b>around</b> Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E
5|$|In June 1963, Kenyatta {{met with}} the Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi.

Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 <b>came</b> <b>around</b> the federation had not come to pass. In May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1917, the Australians {{were moved}} to Belgium {{as the focus of}} British {{operations}} shifted to the Ypres sector in an effort to draw German attention away from the French. The first effort <b>came</b> <b>around</b> Messines, on the southern flank, where a series of tunnels were dug under the German lines. On 7 June, 19 mines were detonated and in the ensuing fighting, the British captured Messines Ridge. Assigned a support role, the 15th Battalion was held in reserve and did not take part in the attack. The following day, it was committed to hold the gains that had been made during the attack, relieving the New Zealanders around Gooseberry Farm. The 15th remained in the Ypres sector and subsequently took part in the fighting around Polygon Wood during the Third Battle of Ypres in September. In November 1917, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a three-month rest, spending the winter around Templeux-la-Fosse and Hollebeke.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1947, the {{committee}} {{recommended that the}} flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones. The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the Chakra (wheel) from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased by the change, but eventually <b>came</b> <b>around</b> to accepting it.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it <b>came</b> <b>around</b> for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E

5|$|On 7 February 1934, Whittle {{was walking}} through University Park {{when he was}} accosted by a small boy who said that his younger brother {{had fallen into the}} lake. Rushing to the area, Whittle dived into the weed-choked lake and began searching for the boy. Finding him unconscious, Whittle brought the boy to the bank and applied {{artificial}} respiration for approximately half an hour; the child later <b>came</b> <b>around</b> and was taken to hospital. Whittle left the scene and proceeded home in a taxi without leaving his name, but his identity was subsequently discovered and he was presented with a Certificate of Merit by the Royal Life Saving Society. Whittle himself was ill for a fortnight due to swallowing some of the foul water in the ornamental lake.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} flank, {{north of the}} road, the North Koreans overran the {{battalion}} observation post and B Company's outpost line. This high ground changed hands three times during the day. While the infantry fight was in progress, and shortly after the first tank penetration, five more T-34s <b>came</b> <b>around</b> the road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion. Check had called for an air strike when the first tanks appeared. Three F-80 Shooting Stars arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks, destroying three of them with 5-inch rockets. Altogether, bazooka, artillery, and air strikes knocked out six North Korean tanks during the morning, either within or {{on the edge of}} the 1st Battalion position. In its first engagement with American troops, the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached to it a few days earlier at Chongju.|$|E
5|$|The eastern segment first {{designated}} in 1926 {{was separated}} {{from the rest of}} the highway in 1939. The northern end was scaled back to M-15/M-24 in Saginaw County. The concurrency along M-81 was removed, the section northeast to Gilford was transferred to local control, and the section northeast of Guilford to Unionville was added to M-138. The Bay Port—Harbor Beach section was redesignated M-142. The last changes <b>came</b> <b>around</b> 1962 when the I-75/US10/US23 freeway was completed between Pontiac and Flint. M-83 was rerouted on its south end to turn west along Birch Run Road to the freeway, concurrent with the new M-54, which replaced M-83 south of Birch Run Road.|$|E

5|$|The team {{got their}} first win of the season, in their first stage race, at the Étoile de Bessèges. Dumoulin made a late {{selection}} in stage 3, joining nine other riders who finished {{just ahead of the}} rest of the peloton, and won the sprint to the finish line. Later in February, Moncoutié won the queen stage of the Tour Méditerranéen, finishing at Mont Faron. He had previously won stages there in 2003 and 2009, but his win this year was enough to win him the race overall thanks to his time gap. The squad also won the teams classification. Dumoulin took another win later in February, in the first stage of the two-day Tour du Haut Var. He stayed latched onto Rinaldo Nocentini's wheel during the stage's final climb, and <b>came</b> <b>around</b> him in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{they were}} sent to Pernois for rest and re-organisation, and after being brought back up to about two-thirds strength, the 2nd Battalion's next {{involvement}} in the fighting <b>came</b> <b>around</b> Mouquet Farm when they were briefly put into the line on 18/19 August to provide reinforcement, before being quickly relieved a few days later. In early September, I Anzac Corps was transferred from the Somme region to Ypres, in Belgium, swapping with the Canadians for a rest. Taking up a position north of the Ypres–Commines canal, the battalions of the 1st Division {{were placed in the}} centre of the line between those of the 4th, on the right to the south, and the 2nd on the left, to the north. The sector was a relatively quiet one, although not without its dangers due to constant mortar attacks, sniping, and the need to maintain patrols in no man's land. Nevertheless, duties in this time were focused mainly upon maintaining a defensive presence in the line and rebuilding the defences. In addition, a number of small-scale raids were also undertaken in an effort to draw some attention away from the fighting that was occurring on the Somme.|$|E
5|$|As {{operations}} continued {{throughout the}} month, casualties amongst the Australian Corps became critical {{and the decision}} was made to disband some of the 3rd Division's battalions and use them to reinforce the remaining units. This decision saw the reduction of the strength of division's infantry brigades from four battalions to three, bringing the Australians into line with the British, who had made a similar decision earlier in the war. Nevertheless, the decision was not popular amongst the soldiers and when the 42nd Battalion received the order to disband, the attempt was rejected by its personnel and the order disobeyed. As a result, the proposed reorganisation was postponed until after the division's final offensive actions were fought in early October 1918. These <b>came</b> <b>around</b> the St Quentin Canal when the division attacked the Beaurevoir Line in concert with American troops from the US 27th Division, who would lead the assault in. The attack went awry, however, when the lead assault units failed to adequately clear the forward positions and subsequently when the 3rd Division was committed they came under fire almost immediately and instead of passing through the American positions, they had to complete the mopping up process before they could advance. Nevertheless, by nightfall on 1 October, the division had captured the northern end of the tunnel that ran under the canal.|$|E

5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not sure how Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting <b>came</b> <b>around</b> everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E
5|$|Venable {{had been}} {{expected}} to be a September 2008 call-up, but when Scott Hairston was forced onto the disabled list, Venable was called up ahead of schedule. On August 29, 2008, in his debut, he tripled in his first at-bat and <b>came</b> <b>around</b> to score a run. He is the twenty-fifth Princeton alumnus to play in the Major Leagues, but he is the first African-American alumnus. He posted his first Major League home run in his sixth game on September 4, 2008, during a 5–2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park. His only other home run for the 2008 San Diego Padres was also in a victory on the road on September 19, 2008 in an 11–6 victory over the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. During this game, Venable posted his first three-hit performance and first three-RBI performance. When Venable batted leadoff for the Padres on September 28, 2008 against Pittsburgh, he became the first Princeton batter to oppose a Princeton pitcher (Ross Ohlendorf). In 2008, Venable accumulated only 110Major League at-bats, and rookie year is considered to be the season in which one accumulates his 130th at-bat. He only played centerfield in 2008. Following the season he played winter baseball in the Dominican Professional Baseball League, where he struggled.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 January, at Wandumi, the main Japanese thrust fell upon the 70-man strong 'A' Company, 2/6th Infantry Battalion. Throughout the day the company fought desperately to hold the Japanese while {{reinforcements}} from the 2/5th were brought up from Wau; in the mid-afternoon, as it looked like they would be overrun, a desperate bayonet charge temporarily bought the Australians some relief and they eventually withdrew about a mile to the south-west, back towards the Bulolo River where they formed a night defensive position, having successfully delayed the Japanese advance and inflicted over 75 killed upon them. Throughout the following day, as poor weather hampered efforts to fly in the 2/7th Infantry Battalion, {{a large group of}} about 500 Japanese bypassed 'A' Company's position and continued on towards Wau. In response two companies of the 2/5th were moved to the airstrip, reaching there early on 29 January just before Japanese mortars began firing on it. By mid-morning, however, the weather cleared and Allied aircraft soon began arriving at the airfield, disgorging men from the 2/7th who were quickly thrown into the line. That night several counterattacks were fought off and the following day, as a section of guns from the 2/1st Field Regiment arrived, the 17th Brigade went on the offensive. A company of machine guns from the 7th Machine Gun Battalion was also flown in. By 5 February the Japanese began withdrawing from the area. Significant fighting occurred on 9 February, and {{over the course of the}} next three weeks further clashes took place as the Australians followed up the retreating Japanese. The last actions <b>came</b> <b>around</b> Buibaining and Waipali and by 26 February the withdrawal was complete with the Japanese establishing themselves around Guadagasal and Mubo.|$|E
