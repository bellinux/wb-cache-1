The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but nothing was to <b>come</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, {{intending}} to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered {{the war against}} Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would <b>come</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar's letters home under the title Trusty and Well Beloved, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something {{he had been doing}} more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, Ballad of Ensign Joy, was published later that year.|$|E

She had no aspirations {{to return to the}} television. In 1991, she had given birth to her second child, Johnny, and her husband was bidding on a television franchise in the South of England.

25|$|But by {{then things}} were changing. King Henry IV died in 1413 {{and his son}} King Henry V began to adopt a more conciliatory {{attitude}} to the Welsh. Royal Pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and other opponents of his father's regime. In a symbolic and pious gesture, the body of deposed King Richard II was interred in Westminster Abbey. In 1415 Henry V offered a Pardon to Owain, as he prepared for war with France. There {{is evidence that the}} new King Henry V was in negotiations with Owain's son, Maredudd ab Owain Glyndŵr, but nothing was to <b>come</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In 1416 Maredudd was himself offered a Pardon but refused. Perhaps his father Owain was still alive and he was unwilling to accept it while he lived. He finally accepted a Royal Pardon in 1421, suggesting that Owain Glyndŵr was finally dead. There is some evidence to suggest, in the poetry of the Welsh Bard Llawdden for example, that a few diehards continued to fight on even after 1421 under the leadership of Owain's son-in-law Phylib ap Rhys.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will <b>come</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

25|$|Mackworth {{headed the}} county {{sequestration}} committee, which confiscated and leased out the estates of royalist landowners, pending their reaching {{a settlement with}} the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents, based at Goldsmiths' Hall. Mackworth's dealings with the Ottley family are fairly well known {{from their point of}} view, as their correspondence is preserved. The county committee began felling Francis Ottley's trees in retribution for his burning of houses while governor or Sheriff. This was quickly forbidden by the Committee for Compounding but it seems that Mackworth and the county committee were slow to comply. In April 1647, a letter from Lucy Ottley, the wife of Sir Francis, to Richard Ottley, their eldest son, mentioned moves by Mackworth and others to prosecute Sir Francis, but the details are unknown and nothing seems to have <b>come</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Mackworth's name heads the signatories on the document releasing Ottley's lands from sequestration in March 1648, although the financial details were far from settled. Ottley was accused of involvement in the attempted royalist uprising of that summer but apparently never apprehended. There were legal proceedings between Mackworth and Ottley in February 1649, but their nature is not known, although there was apparently difficulty in securing legal officials not related to either party. Sir Francis completed his business with the compounding Committee in the summer and died later in the year.|$|E

Eventually, Raimi got in contact with a manager at a movie theater in Detroit who was [...] "open and flexible". The same theater played The Rocky Horror Picture Show every single week and was open to more unusual cinema. To Raimi's shock, the manager agreed to screen Within the Woods right before a midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The premiere of the film received a positive reception by the audience, and the cast and crew was paid just over $10, all of which was donated to the American Cancer Society. The film, however, was never commercially released.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1885, Kennan began another voyage in Russia, {{this time}} across Siberia from Europe. He {{had been very}} {{publicly}} positive about the Tsarist Russian government and its policies and his journey {{was approved by the}} Russian government. However, {{in the course of his}} meetings with exiled dissidents during his travel, notably Nikolai Mikhailovich Yadrintsev (1842–1894), Kennan changed his mind about the Russian imperial system.

I thought it was exactly the right story to be telling at that point in time. It was about a family living in a not very embracing community, one that doesn't necessarily share all their values. [...] they don't lose their sense of humor or their inclination to help. They still open their arms and embrace this outsider kid. And I thought that was powerful in an era with a kind of xenophobia, a kind of looking-over-your-shoulder and getting small and angry, sort of creeping into the PATRIOT Act-fueled environment. This espoused a kind of America... It just felt right. And it had a sense of humor." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the 16th National Congress, Jiang {{introduced}} a third kind of civilization, political civilization, along with [...] "the important {{thoughts of the}} Three Represents". According to Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a former advisor to the Chinese government, the idea was [...] "three interrelated objectives — material civilization, spiritual civilization,	and political civilization — and one unifying mechanism, Three Represents. The three civilizations were the intended ends, and the important thought of Three Represents was the chosen means." [...] There has been talk of introducing a fourth civilization, but nothing has <b>come</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> yet. A proposed fourth civilization, social civilization, is linked to Hu's concept of Harmonious Socialist Society. According to Lie Zhongjie, the Deputy Director of the Central Research Office, [...] "the outcome of building 'society' in a general sense ... is 'social civilization' ... it is a social civilization in the broad sense, transcending the [...] three civilizations". However, social civilization has not been elevated to {{the same level as}} the other three kinds of civilization.

2500|$|The {{production}} of the two operas turned Schubert's attention more firmly than ever {{in the direction of}} the stage, where, for a variety of reasons, he was almost completely unsuccessful. All in all, he embarked on twenty stage projects, each of them failures which were quickly forgotten. In 1822, Alfonso und Estrella was refused, partly owing to its libretto. Fierrabras (D 796) was rejected in the fall of 1823, but this was largely due to the popularity of Rossini and the Italian operatic style, and the failure of Carl Maria von Weber's Euryanthe. Die Verschworenen (The Conspirators, D 787) was prohibited by the censor (apparently on the grounds of its title), and Rosamunde, Fürstin von Zypern (D 797) was withdrawn after two nights, owing to the poor quality of the play for which Schubert had written incidental music. Of these works, the first two are written on a scale which would make their performances exceedingly difficult (Fierabras, for instance, contains over 1,000 pages of manuscript score), but Die Verschworenen is a bright attractive comedy, and Rosamunde contains some of the most charming music that Schubert ever composed. In 1822, he made the acquaintance with both Weber and Beethoven, but little came of it in either case. Beethoven is said to have acknowledged the younger man's gifts on a few occasions, but some of this is likely legend and in any case he could not have known the real scope of Schubert's music, especially not the instrumental works, as so little of it was printed or performed in the composer's lifetime. On his deathbed, Beethoven is said to have looked into some of the younger man's works and exclaimed: [...] "Truly, the spark of divine genius resides in this Schubert!", but what would have <b>come</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> if he had recovered, we can never know.|$|E
