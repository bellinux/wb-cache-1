5|$|In 2016 in Nijmegen, The Netherlands, Pastafarian and {{law student}} Mienke de Wilde petitioned {{the courts to}} be allowed to wear a <b>colander</b> in her driver's license photo.|$|E
50|$|Conventionally, <b>colanders</b> {{are made}} of a light metal, such as {{aluminium}} or thinly rolled stainless steel. <b>Colanders</b> are also made of plastic, silicone, ceramic, and enamelware.|$|R
5|$|Some anti-clerical protesters wore <b>colanders</b> to Piazza XXIV Maggio {{square in}} Milan, Italy, on June 2, 2012, in mock {{obedience}} to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|R
40|$|David <b>Colander's</b> update/reworking of his 1987 volume draws {{conclusions}} about graduate study in economics from interviews {{with students in}} selected leading U. S. programs. Although not formally statistical, the interviews support the conclusion {{that most of the}} core of graduate instruction (except macro) is handled very well. <b>Colander's</b> concern about the lack of attention to training teachers is well founded. His conclusion that fewer idiots savants are being trained than in the 1980 s is overly optimistic, and his worry about stresses that graduate students express is misplaced. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating <b>colander.</b> The <b>colander</b> separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a <b>colander</b> to ensure that all the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the <b>colander</b> in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
5000|$|A {{parody of}} the Tim Burton film Edward Scissorhands, which {{featured}} a similar character but with <b>colanders</b> for hands instead of scissors. He was seen in a sketch helping a housewife to drain vegetables. He was also present in the Robert Smith sketch as an audience member clapping {{to the beat of}} the songs, instead of clapping his hands he clapped his <b>colanders</b> together and unlike the rest of the audience he showed immense enjoyment of the performance. He later returned as [...] "Edward 'Good Movie Guide' Knob".|$|R
50|$|Preserve razor handles are {{produced}} from recycled plastics, 65% of which come from yogurt containers. Preserve also produces and sells mixing bowls, cutting boards, measuring cups, food storage containers and <b>colanders</b> - all {{made from recycled}} materials.|$|R
30|$|Different studies have, as yet, {{explored}} {{the application of}} clay or nanoclay along with <b>colanders,</b> ceramic filters, clay pipes, or earthen containers. The nanoclays with very small sizes have been of desirable efficiencies in adsorption of both organic and heavy metals (Prachi 2013; Pandey 2017; Pandey and Ramontja 2016 a, b).|$|R
25|$|In the {{two-stage}} or two-bath method, {{the first}} bath, sometimes called blanching, is in hot fat (around 160°C / 320°F) to cook them through. This may {{be done in}} advance. Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190°C / 375°F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed in a <b>colander</b> or on a cloth to drain, salted, and served. The exact times of the two baths depend {{on the size of}} the potatoes. For example, for 2–3mm strips, the first bath takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.|$|E
25|$|Progressive Jargon Aphasia is a fluent or {{receptive}} aphasia {{in which the}} patient's speech is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact syntax and grammar, but the patient has problems with the selection of nouns. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with sounds. As such, patients with jargon aphasia often use neologisms, and may perseverate {{if they try to}} replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - <b>colander),</b> picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).|$|E
25|$|The {{flying boat}} squadrons {{operating}} from Pembroke Dock, were occupied with {{a myriad of}} tasks during the Second World War. Principal among these was Air Sea Rescue (ASR) with which most aircraft were equipped with Lindholme Gear for dropping into the sea for downed aircrews. The squadron also had responsibility for convoy escort duties in the Atlantic and also as hunter killers in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). On 2 June 1943, a Short Sunderland of No 461 Squadron (11 Crew, 9 Australian, 2 British) was attacked whilst on an ASR patrol over the Bay of Biscay by 8 Junkers 88 fighter aircraft. The Sunderland had been searching the Bay of Biscay area for a downed BOAC aircraft that had been shot down over that area the previous day (and included amongst its passenger manifest the actor Leslie Howard) when it was attacked by the Luftwaffe. The crew managed to down three of the enemy aircraft, but limped home with an airframe like a <b>colander</b> due to the strafing bullet runs that the Junkers 88s had taken against it. The aircraft was landed hard at Praa Sands in Cornwall and whilst most of the crew were injured, {{there was only one}} fatality. The tide destroyed the airframe the next day.|$|E
50|$|At the 2004 Summer Olympics Abi was unfortunate in {{not making}} the 100 m final. Running in the faster of the two semi-finals, she {{finished}} fifth in her heat {{with a time of}} 11.18 s, that equalled LaTasha <b>Colander's</b> fourth placed time that saw her through in the second semi.|$|R
50|$|Berkswell {{is a hard}} cheese, made at Ram Hall Farm near Berkswell, West Midlands, England. It is {{made using}} unpasturised ewe milk and animal rennet. The moulds of cheeses are left in plastic kitchen <b>colanders</b> which give the cheese its {{distinctive}} shape. Berkswell may be compared to a mature pecorino.|$|R
50|$|Colombini {{designed}} many {{household products}} for Kartell that were revolutionary and affordable examples of everyday items. His products include a carpet beater (1957), a lemon squeezer (1958), plastic wash basins, salad <b>colanders,</b> lunch boxes and a long-handled cleaning scoop (1959). One {{of his most}} famous designs is a round umbrella stand made from ABS plastic with a stainless steel ashtray top (1965).|$|R
500|$|A man's Irish {{driving licence}} {{photograph}} including a <b>colander</b> {{was rejected by}} the Road Safety Authority (RSA) in 2013. In 2016, an Equality Officer of the Workplace Relations Commission reviewed the RSA's decision under the Equal Rights Acts and upheld it, on the basis that the complaint did [...] "not come within the definition of religion and/or religious belief".|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet {{is derived}} from the Latin words colum, meaning [...] "strainer", and forma, meaning [...] "shape"—Berkeley's vernacular name [...] "Cullenden puff-ball" [...] also refers to a <b>colander.</b> Gray called it the [...] "sievelike pill-box". The generic name is from the Greek words μνριός, meaning [...] "countless" [...] and στόμα, meaning [...] "mouth" [...] (the source of the technical term stoma). The species is commonly known as the [...] "salt-and-pepper shaker earthstar" [...] or simply the [...] "pepperpot".|$|E
500|$|In November 2015 Massachusetts {{resident}} Lindsay Miller {{was allowed}} to [...] wear a <b>colander</b> on {{her head in her}} driver's license photo after she cited her religious beliefs. Miller (who resides in Lowell) said on Friday, November 13 that she [...] "absolutely loves the history and the story" [...] of Pastafarians, whose website says has existed in secrecy for hundreds of years and entered the mainstream in 2005. Ms. Miller was represented in her quest by The American Humanist Association’s Appignani Humanist Legal Center.|$|E
50|$|Both teams play at once. The two {{children}} maneuver {{their way around}} a four-section inflatable pool filled with gunge and try to place blue and yellow hoops around the center pole whilst the adults have to throw gunge on the kids to slow them down using leaky <b>colanders.</b> The children score 20 points per hoop around the pole. Time limit is one minute.|$|R
5000|$|Ventilation was {{achieved}} by a system of tubing built in the walls and foundations leading to and connecting on the roof with a high-power electric fan that drove the cold air down under the concrete floor of the auditorium, into which it was filtered by way of innumerable <b>colanders</b> installed under seats, {{making it possible to}} keep the temperature of the interior [...] "healthful", no matter what conditions prevailed outside.|$|R
60|$|Standing {{all around}} the {{clearing}} were a good many cookstoves, ranges and grills, of all sizes and shapes, and besides these there were several kitchen cabinets and cupboards and a few kitchen tables. These things were crowded with utensils of all sorts: frying pans, sauce pans, kettles, forks, knives, basting and soup spoons, nutmeg graters, sifters, <b>colanders,</b> meat saws, flat irons, rolling pins and many other things of a like nature.|$|R
500|$|When {{an animal}} is ritually {{slaughtered}} (shechted) the raw meat is traditionally cut, rinsed and salted, prior to cooking. Salting of raw meat draws out {{the blood that}} lodges on the inner surface of the meat. Salting is made with any coarse grain of salt, while the meat is laid over a grating or <b>colander</b> to allow for drainage, and where the salt is allowed {{to remain on the}} meat for the duration of time that it takes to walk one biblical mile (appx. 18– 24 minutes). Afterwards, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat cooked. Meat that is roasted requires no prior salting, as fire acts as a natural purgatory of blood.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{mentioned}} in the scientific literature by Samuel Doody in the second edition of John Ray's Synopsis methodica Stirpium Brittanicorum in 1696. Doody briefly described the mushroom like so: [...] "fungus pulverulentus coli instar perforatus, cum volva stellata" [...] (mushroom dusty, like a perforated <b>colander,</b> volva star-shaped), {{and went on to}} explain that he found it in 1695 in Kent.It was first described scientifically as a new species in 1776 from collections made in England by James Dickson, who named it Lycoperdon coliforme. He found it growing in roadside banks and hedgerows among nettles in Suffolk and Norfolk. Nicaise Auguste Desvaux first defined and published the new genus Myriostoma in 1809, with the species renamed Myriostoma anglicum (an illegitimate renaming). Christian Hendrik Persoon had previously placed the species in Geastrum in 1801, while Samuel Frederick Gray would in 1821 describe the genus Polystoma for it. Myriostoma coliforme received its current and final name when August Carl Joseph Corda moved Dickson's name to Myriostoma in 1842, replacing Desvaux's name.|$|E
2500|$|Strainers {{are formed}} when an object blocks {{the passage of}} larger objects but allows {{the flow of water}} to {{continue}} - like a big food strainer or <b>colander.</b> [...] These objects can be very dangerous, because the force of the water will pin an object or body against the strainer and then pile up, pushing it down under water. For a person caught in this position, it will be difficult or impossible to get to safety, often leading to a fatal outcome.|$|E
50|$|Cross {{contamination}} {{in the home}} is also a consideration for those who suffer gluten-related disorders. There can be many sources of cross contamination, as for example when family members prepare gluten-free and gluten-containing foods on the same surfaces (counter tops, tables, etc.) or share utensils {{that have not been}} cleaned after being used to prepare gluten-containing foods (cutting boards, <b>colanders,</b> cutlery, etc.), kitchen equipment (toaster, cupboards, etc.) or certain packaged foods (butter, peanut butter, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|... bottle gourds-The ancient Mexicans {{learned to}} first {{cultivate}} the bottle gourds around 8,000 BC. American Indians raisedbottle gourds {{for use as}} bowls, scoops, <b>colanders,</b> ladles, spoons, can-teens and dippers. Larger gourds were used as cooking vessels.Eastern Woodland Natives hung bottle gourds on poles in their cornfields to serve as habitats for insect-eating birds (a form of biological pest-control, which the Native Americans developed). Native Americans in Northern Peru also used bottle gourds as floats for fishing nets.|$|R
50|$|Pick's {{early work}} {{employed}} imagery sourced from significant moments in Art History, making particular {{use of the}} Gothic emblems of the Medieval period. By 1994, however, she had developed her own distinctive and captivatingly personal iconography. Works from this period {{have been described as}} 'dreamscapes' in which symbolic images from Pick's memory (beds, dresses, pincushions, <b>colanders)</b> float surreally across rich surfaces. These strangely dislocated objects were often domestic in nature, indicating the special significance memory can inject into otherwise everyday objects.|$|R
2500|$|After {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Kersten remained in Helsinki, where he studied therapy with the specialist Dr <b>Colander,</b> and after two years was awarded a certificate in physical therapy. He then left for Berlin, where he continued his studies and eventually became the pupil of a notable Chinese therapeutic masseur, Dr Ko, whom he had met at a dinner party. In 1925, Ko told Kersten [...] "You have learned all I can teach you." [...] He then turned his practice over to Kersten and retired to Tibet.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2014 the La Belle: The Ship That Changed History exhibit officially opened. The hull of {{the ship}} and many of the {{recovered}} artifacts, including colored glass beads, brass pots, a <b>colander,</b> a ladle, muskets, powder horns, an early explosive device called a fire pot and a bronze cannon with lifting handles shaped like dolphins, are on display at the Bullock Texas State History Museum in the state capital of Austin. Many more artifacts {{can be seen in the}} multi-location La Salle Odyssey exhibit, located in museums around Texas. [...] The Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History is the official repository of artifacts. The Museum of the Coastal Bend in Victoria, Texas also has many artifacts from the La Belle, mainly the other seven cannons from Fort St. Louis.|$|E

50|$|This era {{also showed}} {{increased}} contact with Mississippian peoples; {{some of whom}} may have migrated to and been integrated into Fort Ancient villages. The Madisonville horizon of artifacts after 1400 includes relatively high proportions of bowls, salt pans, triangular strap handles, <b>colanders,</b> negative painted pottery, notched and beaded rims, and some effigies, all items and styles that are usually associated with the Mississippian cultures of the Lower Ohio Valley, at sites such as Angel Mounds and Kincaid Mounds. These sites were abandoned during this time period.|$|R
50|$|Many {{everyday}} wares were made: tiles, mugs, drug jars, dishes, wine bottles, posset pots, salt pots, candlesticks, fuddling cups (that is, ale mugs {{joined in}} groups of three, four or five with connecting holes to confuse the drinker), puzzle jugs (similar to fuddling cups), barber's bowls, pill slabs, bleeding bowls, porringers and flower bricks. Humble undecorated items included chamberpots, <b>colanders</b> and small disposable ointment pots (gallipots), dispensed by apothecaries. Large decorative dishes, often called chargers, were popular, and included much {{of the most ambitious}} painting, often stretching the artists to the edge of their capabilities, and beyond.|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{the paper}} is to place current methodological discussions in macroeconometric {{modeling}} contrasting the 'theory first' versus the 'data first' perspectives {{in the context of}} a broader methodological framework with a view to constructively appraise them. In particular, the paper focuses on <b>Colander's</b> argument in his paper 'Economists, Incentives, Judgement, and the European CVAR Approach to Macroeconometrics' contrasting two different perspectives in Europe and the US that are currently dominating empirical macroeconometric modeling and delves deeper into their methodological/philosophical underpinnings. It is argued that the key to establishing a constructive dialogue between them is provided by a better understanding of the role of data in modern statistical inference, and how that relates to the centuries old issue of the realisticness of economic theories.
