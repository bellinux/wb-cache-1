5000|$|Rey's {{interest}} in astronomy began during World War I {{and led to}} his desire to redraw <b>constellation</b> <b>diagrams,</b> which he found difficult to remember, so {{that they were more}} intuitive. This led to the 1952 publication of The Stars: A New Way to See Them, (...) [...] His <b>constellation</b> <b>diagrams</b> were adopted widely and now appear in many astronomy guides, such as Donald H. Menzel's A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets. As of 2003 The Stars: A New Way to See Them, and a simplified presentation for children called Find the Constellations, are still in print. A new edition of Find the Constellations was released in 2008, updated with modern fonts, the new status of Pluto, and some more current measurements of planetary sizes and orbital radii.|$|R
50|$|Quadrature {{modulation}} is {{the general}} technique of combining two amplitude-modulated (DSB) carrier signals {{in such a way}} that the original amplitude modulations are separable, by coherent demodulation, at the receiver. Examples include quadrature amplitude modulation, phase-shift keying, and minimum-shift keying. <b>Constellation</b> <b>diagrams</b> are used to examine the modulation in the 2-D signal space.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{very special}} STBC. It is the only {{orthogonal}} STBC that achieves rate-1. That is {{to say that it is}} the only STBC that can achieve its full diversity gain without needing to sacrifice its data rate. Strictly, this is only true for complex modulation symbols. Since almost all <b>constellation</b> <b>diagrams</b> rely on complex numbers however, this property usually gives Alamouti's code a significant advantage over the higher-order STBCs even though they achieve a better error-rate performance. See 'Rate limits' for more detail.|$|R

After injection-locking, a low-cost DFB laser used at the regenerator exhibited the same linewidth characteristics as the narrow line-width transmitter laser. The phase regeneration properties of the regenerator were evaluated by emulating random Gaussian phase noise applied to the DPSK signal before the regenerator using a phase modulator driven by an arbitrary waveform generator.

We employ frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) with different subcarrier modulations to effectively exploit a 2 -GHz limited O-band RSOA in a SS architecture, achieving, {{for the first time}} to the best of our knowledge, 12 -Gb/s transmission over 10 -km SSMF. Due to O-band low chromatic dispersion, propagation distance is only limited by the power budget, which determines the sub-bands signal to noise ratio, reducing equalization effectiveness.

This enhancement is achieved by controlled corruption of <b>constellation</b> <b>diagrams</b> in IQ space by orthogonal injection of interference.

The chapter reviews the techniques {{that are used in}} optical sampling systems to perform the ultrafast sampling of the signal under investigation. In addition to the various nonlinear materials and effects used for the optical sampling gates and pulse sources, the realized optical sampling systems also differ in the way, in which the system is synchronized to the data signal. Systems have been reported using synchronous, random and software synchronized configurations. Applications of optical sampling systems include high bit rate waveform and eye diagram measurements, measurements of <b>constellation</b> <b>diagrams</b> of phase modulated data signals, time-resolved measurements of the state-of-polarization as well as investigations of fiber transmission impairments...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{adaptive}} equalizers {{are widely}} used in wireless communication systems {{in order to reduce}} the effects of the channel distortion. Various researchers have used linear block equalizers for different modulations techniques. In this paper the BER performance of different M-PSK and M-QAM modulations with the block based LMS and RLS linear equalizers are compared over the flat and frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. For achieving better performance the Rayleigh channel is modeled with four multipath channels and normalized channel impulse response under the presence of AWGN noise. The maximum Doppler shifts frequencies are varied for evaluating the performance of the equalizers. Using the normalized channel impulse response improves the BER performance of the communication system for the higher values of M as 512 and 1024. Transmitted and received <b>constellation</b> <b>diagrams</b> are also compared for different equalizers. Performance is also compared for the different equalizer weights and block sizes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Free Space Optical (FSO) {{communication}} links is {{a promising}} and cost-effective {{solution for the}} provision of high data rate point to point communications. Due to their huge bandwidth, license free spectrum and multipath fading mitigation, the FSO links combined with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique provide an ideal communication solution between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and fixed Ground Station (GS). In order to design a high performance communication link, it is important to characterize the quality of the optical channel with a proper model, considering the interesting challenges of environmental conditions, such as turbulence and visibility conditions. In this paper we are studying the performance of a mobile link among co-moving UAVs, UAV and GS at different fixed altitudes and link ranges via Optisystem simulation platform, in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER), Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) and <b>constellation</b> <b>diagrams.</b> An extensive, comparative analysis among different FSO configurations links considering various characteristics of the OFDM modulation, link ranges, Bit Rates (BR) and the atmospherical conditions is provided...|$|R
40|$|Chromatic {{dispersion}} from {{optical fiber}} {{is the most}} important problem that produces temporal skews and destroys the rectangular structure of code patterns in the spectra-amplitude-coding-based optical code-division multiple-access (SAC-OCDMA) system. Thus, the balance detection scheme does not work perfectly to cancel multiple access interference (MAI) and the system performance will be degraded. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is the fastest developing technology in the academic and industrial fields of wireless transmission. In this study, the radio-over-fiber system is realized by integrating OFDM and OCDMA via polarization multiplexing scheme. The electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) equalizer element of OFDM integrated with the dispersion compensation fiber (DCF) is used in the proposed radio-over-fiber (RoF) system, which can efficiently suppress the chromatic dispersion influence in long-haul transmitted distance. A set of length differences for 10 km-long single-mode fiber (SMF) and 4 km-long DCF is to verify the compensation scheme by relative equalizer algorithms and <b>constellation</b> <b>diagrams.</b> In the simulation result, the proposed dispersion mechanism successfully compensates the dispersion from SMF and the system performance with dispersion equalizer is highly improved...|$|R
