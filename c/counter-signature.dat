[...] Princess Ileana was sceptical: [...] "You know quite well (...) that the King will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a proper solution for a medium enterprise or public institution that enables easier {{management of the}} digital documents library and eases the common document workflows. The main problem addressed by the proposed project is the complexity of document workflows in public administration. Documents {{that need to be}} filled out and signed are always around us and often can cause problems and delays when poorly managed. With its characteristics, our solution eliminates all the inconvenient of the document workflows helped by the document library and workflows, while keeping the security part, now represented by hand signatures with the implementation of the digital signatures. The main benefit it brings to the client is that it automates the signing and approval process to any kind of document it uses inside or outside the company. The signature system allows signing on multiple levels (<b>counter-signatures)</b> and multiple signatures per level (co-signatures) for perfectly mimicking a plain document...|$|R
2500|$|In its beginnings, {{the council}} {{was a place}} of debate amongst the ministers over {{government}} policy. However, since the formation of real political parties {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, these debates were moved from the council to informal ministerial meetings where government policy could be coordinated – usually held every Wednesday. As a result, the primary function of the council today is to grant royal assent, which is done by the <b>counter-signatures</b> of the sovereign and a minister. Before granting the assent, a relevant minister explains the general aim of the bill brought before the council. According to section 22 of the Danish constitution, a bill must be granted assent within thirty days of its passing by parliament, at the latest, for it to become an Act. In urgent cases, or if a passed law will be in conflict with this time limit if only signed at the next scheduled council meeting, the responsible minister for the law is also allowed to visit the royal institution at a separate meeting ahead of the scheduled council meeting, and ask for royal assent. [...] The sovereign cannot be held responsible for any granted assent.|$|R

50|$|The President is {{involved}} {{in the formation of the}} Federal Government and remains in close cooperation with it. Basically the President is free to act on his or her own accord. However, according to Article 58 of the German constitution, the decrees and directives of the President require the countersignature of the Chancellor or the corresponding Federal Minister. This rule ensures the coherence of government action. There is no need for a <b>counter-signature</b> with regard to the appointment and dismissal of the Chancellor, the dissolution of the Bundestag according to Article 63 and the call on Chancellor and ministers to remain in office until a successor is elected.|$|E

Upon signing, the President has to check if the law was passed {{according}} to the order mandated by the Constitution and/or if {{the content of the}} law is constitutional. If not, he or she has the right to refuse to sign the law, thus effectively vetoing it. Some scholars also consider it possible that the president has the full veto authority on any bill, this however, is not how past presidents handled their power. As yet (2017), this has happened only eight times and no President has done it more often than two times during his term: ...|$|E
50|$|This {{concession}} allowed soldiers' letters {{under the}} weight of 1/4 oz to be sent and received for one penny, whilst officers' mail was charged at six pence. To safeguard against abuse it was necessary for a soldier or sailor's name and his regiment or ship to be endorsed {{on the outside of the}} letter and to be countersigned by his commanding officer. To prevent the abuse of the concession, further legislation was enacted in 1806 imposing a penalty of £5 or a term of imprisonment for any abuser. It came to light that officers were handing their personal letters to their soldiers/sailors, who then signed their names on the covers and presented them as their own to their commanding officer for <b>counter-signature.</b>|$|E

This topic was chosen because the valid Constitution of the Czech Republic {{is based on the}} Constitution Instrument of 1920 and the two constitutions in question are similar. In closer look those similarities are not so strong and differences maybe seems small but they are significant. This thesis is composed of four chapters. Chapter one is dealing with overall questions around the appointment powers of the president. It is divided to two parts. One is mentioning deputization of the president. Second is handling responsibilities of the president and <b>counter-signature.</b> Second chapter describes common appointment powers which occur in both Constitutions. It is divided into four subchapters. President and his relationship to executive, judiciary, constitutional authorities and other appointment powers.
