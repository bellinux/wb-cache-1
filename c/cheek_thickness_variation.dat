40|$|Most {{existing}} techniques for regulating the ink flow in offset presses rely on density measurements {{carried out on}} specially printed patches. In the present contribution, we develop a methodology to deduce ink <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> from spectral measurements of multi-chromatic halftone patches located within the printed page. For this purpose, we extend the Clapper-Yule spectral reflectance prediction model by expressing the transmittance of the colorants composed of superposed inks {{as a function of}} the ink transmittances and of fitted ink layer thicknesses. We associate to each ink an ink <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> factor. At print time, this ink <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> factor can be fitted in order to minimize a difference metric between predicted reflection spectrum and measured reflection spectrum. The ink <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> deduced from multi-chromatic halftones allow to clearly distinguish between normal ink volume, reduced ink volume or increased ink volume.

40|$|We have {{developed}} x-ray radiography to measure <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> of coatings on laser fusion targets. Our technique {{is based on}} measuring the variation in x-ray transmission through the targets. The simplest targets are hollow glass microshells* or microballoons** 100 to 500 μm in diameter (Fig. 1), that have several layers of metals or plastics, 1 to 100 ym thick (Fig. 2). Our goal is to examine these opaque coatings for <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> as small as 1 % or 0. 1 %, {{depending on the type}} of defect. Using contact radiography we have obtained the desired sensitivity for concentric and elliptical defects of 1 %. This percentage corresponds to <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> as small as 100 A in a 1 -μm-thick coating. For warts and dimples, the desired sensitivity is a function of the area of the defect, and we are developing a system to detect 0. 1 % <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> that cover an area 10 μm by 10 μm...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new cross-hole {{tomography}} imaging (CTI) method for variable-depth defects in metal plates based on multi-mode electromagnetic ultrasonic Lamb waves (LWs). The dispersion characteristics determine that different modes of LWs {{are sensitive to}} different thicknesses of metal plates. In this work, the sensitivities to <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> of A 0 - and S 0 -mode LWs are theoretically studied. The principles and procedures for the cooperation of A 0 - and S 0 -mode LW CTI are proposed. Moreover, the experimental LW imaging system on an aluminum plate with a variable-depth defect is set up, based on A 0 - and S 0 -mode EMAT (electromagnetic acoustic transducer) arrays. For comparison, the traditional single-mode LW CTI method {{is used in the}} same experimental platform. The imaging results show that the computed thickness distribution by the proposed multi-mode method more accurately reflects the actual <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> of the defect, while neither the S 0 nor the A 0 single-mode method was able to distinguish <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> in the defect region. Moreover, the quantification of the defect’s <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> is more accurate with the multi-mode method. Therefore, theoretical and practical results prove that the variable-depth defect in metal plates can be successfully quantified and visualized by the proposed multi-mode electromagnetic ultrasonic LW CTI method...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of sound radiation behavior of plate in air medium with attached discrete patches/point masses having different <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> with different taper ratio of 0. 3, 0. 6, and 0. 9 is analysed.

Minimum peak sound power level obtained is at a taper ratio of 0. 6 with parabolic increasing-decreasing <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> for plate with four discrete patches. At higher taper ratio, linearly increasing-decreasing <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> is another alternative for minimum peak sound power level suppression with discrete patches. It is found that, in low frequency range, average radiation efficiency remains almost the same, but near first peak, four patches or four point masses cause increase in average radiation efficiency; that is, redistribution of point masses/patches does have effect on average radiation efficiency at a given taper ratio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Silicon wafer {{is widely}} used in {{semiconductor}} industries for development of sensors and integrated circuit in computer, cell phones and wide variety of other devices.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} with the micromechanical modelling of closed-cell polymeric foams (M 130) using Laguerre tessellation models incorporated with realistic foam cell size and cell wall thickness distributions. The cell size and cell wall thickness distributions of the foam were measured from microscope images. The Young&# 039;s modulus of cell wall material of the foam was characterised by nanoindentation tests. It is {{found that when}} the cell size and cell wall thickness {{are assumed to be}} uniform in the models, the Kelvin, Weaire-Phelan and Laguerre models overpredict the stiffness of the foam. However, the Young&# 039;s modulus and shear modulus predicted by the Laguerre models incorporating measured foam cell size and cell wall thickness distributions agree well with the experimental data. This emphasizes the fact that the integration of realistic cell wall and cell size variations is vital for foam modelling. Subsequently the effects of cell size and cell wall <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> on the stiffness of closed-cell foams were investigated using Laguerre models. It is found that the Young&# 039;s modulus and shear modulus decrease with increasing cell size and cell wall <b>thickness</b> <b>variations.</b> The degree of stiffness variation of closed-cell foams resulting from the cell size dispersion and cell wall thickness dispersion are comparable. There is little interaction between the cell size variation and cell wall <b>thickness</b> <b>variation</b> as far as their effects on foam moduli are concerned. Based on the simulation results, expressions incorporating cell size and cell wall <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> were formulated for predicting the stiffness of closed-cell foams. Lastly, a simple spring system model was proposed to explain the effects of cell size and cell wall <b>thickness</b> <b>variations</b> on the stiffness of cellular structures...|$|R
