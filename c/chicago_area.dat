5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's <b>Chicago</b> <b>area</b> engineer, Major Arthur V.

5|$|Payton's legacy {{continues}} through the charitable Walter and Connie Payton Foundation. His own appealsâ€”and after his death, his foundation'sâ€”for {{greater awareness of}} the need for organ donations are widely credited with bringing national attention to the problem. After his appeals, donations in Illinois skyrocketed, and the regional organ bank of Illinois was overwhelmed with calls. In response, the City of Chicago inserted organ donation requests into city-vehicle-registration mailings in early 2000, and by August 2000, 13,000 people had signed on to the program. The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the <b>Chicago</b> <b>area</b> each Christmas. The family established the Walter Payton Cancer Fund in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The Mission of the Guardian Angel {{was somewhere}} in the {{vicinity}} of Chicago from 1696 until it was abandoned in around 1700. The Fox Wars effectively closed the <b>Chicago</b> <b>area</b> to Europeans {{in the first part of}} the 18th century. The first non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who might have had a trading-post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River in around 1778. After Point du Sable, Antoine Ouilmette is the next recorded resident of Chicago; he claimed to have settled at the mouth of the Chicago River in July 1790, a few months after Hugh Heward visited Point du Sable.|$|E

Joliet and Marquette did not report any Indians living near the Chicago River area at this time, though archaeologists have since discovered numerous Indian village sites elsewhere in the <b>Chicago</b> <b>area.</b> Two of La Salle's men built a stockade at the portage in the winter of 1682/1683.|$|E

5|$|Alexander, who {{was also}} a highly {{regarded}} football player, did not play organized basketball until eighth grade. Alexander played on Curie's 2010â€“11 varsity team as a freshman, but had little impact at first and sat out some games in December. He missed the first ten games due to a heart murmur. In late December, he started getting local attention as part of the reason Curie remained undefeated. During the Chicago Public High School League (CPL) and Illinois High School Association (IHSA) playoffs, he contributed significant performances. On March 9, 2011, Curie was eliminated from the IHSA playoffs in a Class 4A sectional semifinal by Lyons Township High School as freshman Alexander posted 9 points, 13 rebounds, and 2 blocks in a 66â€“64 loss. His late-season contributions gave Curie an added dimension, as the team finished with a 28â€“3 record. Following his freshman season, Alexander began to be recognized by local evaluators as a potential top national recruit. After Jabari Parker and Jahlil Okafor, Alexander was already considered the best <b>Chicago</b> <b>area</b> basketball prospect. He earned Red-Central all-conference recognition.|$|E
