40|$|Results are {{reported}} of an irrigated experiment {{designed to determine}} the optimum levels of nitrogen for ratoon cane when cut at different ages, and {{at different times of}} the year. The adverse effects of excessive nitrogen on estimated recoverable sugar (e r s) are shown to be more extreme when young cane (12 months old) is cut at an unfavourable (May) compared with a favourable (November) time of the year. In contrast, the time of cutting is relatively unimportant, even at high levels of nitrogen, when the cane is 18 months of age. The uptake of N is more efficient in crops grown during a favourable <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle,</b> viz. November to November or November to 'May, compared with a less favourable cycle, viz.

Cd concentrations are found to have been highly variable in ancient Antarctic ice and therefore in the past pristine south polar atmosphere during the last <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle,</b> the highest values being observed during the cold terminal stages of the last and next to last ice ages.

40|$|International audienceThe Surduk loess {{section in}} Serbia {{provides}} a 20 m thick pedosedimentary {{record of the}} last interglacial–glacial <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle</b> (Upper Pleistocene). Based on optical dating, a chronostratigraphy could be established for the last <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle,</b> yielding the first numerical ages of a loess record from the middle Danube basin. Infrared-stimulated luminescence (IR-OSL) dating {{has been applied to}} the polymineral silt fraction using a multiple aliquot additive-dose protocol to determine the equivalent dose (DE). Within error limits, all age estimates are in stratigraphic order. Owing to the application of shine-plateau tests, the samples showed no evidence of insufficient bleaching. The Surduk loess section comprises three major periods of soil formation. Based on the IR-OSL chronostratigraphy, the lowermost pedocomplex is attributed to the Last Interglacial and to the Early Glacial (Marine Isotope Stage – MIS 5 e to 5 a). The middle part of the section exhibits a succession of weakly developed brown soils and a humic horizon, named 'Surduk soil', formed during MIS 3. On top of the section, recent soil formation is related to the Holocene. Thick loess deposits are preserved between these palaeosols and are attributed to the Lower and Upper Pleniglacials (MIS 4 and 2), respectively.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} model {{strategy is}} presented which enables {{the prediction of}} catchment hydrology and the dynamics of sediment transport within the alluvial river systems draining these catchments. The model is driven by AGCM-based weather predictions, generalised by using a stochastic weather generator, and by palaeo-climate and palaeo-environment reconstructions. The model consists of a lumped hydrological rainfall-runoff model, calibrated against modern daily discharge data and the AGCM control experiment, combined with simple modules for hillslope erosion, river channel geometry, sediment transport and fluvial planform type. We apply the model to a conceptualised <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle,</b> and investigate the response to brief climatic events.

50|$|In {{this book}} Coney {{deals with the}} impact of a {{dramatically}} varying ecology upon an intelligent species, both physically and psychologically. It is also a book about coming of age, examining what that might mean both in terms humans would understand, and what it might mean in the resident dominant species (who think of themselves as 'human'). The physical impact on evolution is also given significant weight. The sun is clearly a source of enough radiation to promote mutations in all species, and the extreme <b>climatic</b> <b>cycles</b> have also evolved creatures which are specialised to endure extreme cold (such as the lox and the lorin, or the ice-devils), or which have evolved to take advantage of events like the grume, such as the grume-riders.|$|E
50|$|Interest in {{predicting}} long-range weather trends dated {{from the middle}} of the 19th century, at the same time that meteorological observation was establishing itself as a scientific pursuit to enable daily weather forecasting. The appearance of spots on the surface of the sun had been the source of conjecture for a long time. Around the middle of the 19th century it was recognised that the number of sunspots increased and decreased on a regular cycle of around 11 years. The hypothesis was that as the sun dominates our experience of weather, then the sunspot cycle might set in motion regular changes in the Earth's climate. Consequently, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many scientists and enthusiastic amateurs embarked on the hunt for <b>climatic</b> <b>cycles,</b> believing that if such patterns could be found, then it might be possible to forecast the weather months, perhaps years ahead.|$|E
