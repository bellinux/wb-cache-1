5|$|As of 2010, Canadians make up 0.5% of the world's total population, having {{relied upon}} {{immigration}} for {{population growth and}} social development. Approximately 41% of current <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> first- or second-generation immigrants, and 20% of Canadian residents in the 2000s were not born in the country. Statistics Canada projects that, by 2031, nearly one-half of Canadians above the age of 15 will be foreign-born or have one foreign-born parent. Indigenous peoples, according to the 2011 Canadian Census, numbered at 1,400,685 or 4.3% of the country's 33,476,688 population.|$|E
5|$|Hockey is Canada's {{national}} winter sport, and <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> extremely {{passionate about}} the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union competed in its first World Championship in 1954, defeating Canada and winning the gold medal. At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, the Soviet team went undefeated and won its first gold medal. Canada's team lost to the Soviets and the United States in the medal round, winning the bronze. The 1960 Winter Olympics, in Squaw Valley, United States, saw the first, and to date only, team from Australia compete in the tournament. Canada, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Sweden were the top four teams heading into the Games, but were all defeated by the American team, which won all seven games en route to its first Olympic gold medal. Canada won the silver medal and the Soviet Union won the bronze.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{form of the}} Canadian {{passport}} {{came about}} in 1921. At that time, <b>Canadians</b> <b>were</b> British subjects, and Canada shared a common nationality with the United Kingdom; thus, <b>Canadian</b> passports <b>were</b> issued to those British subjects resident in or connected to Canada. This arrangement ended in 1947, when the <b>Canadian</b> Citizenship Act <b>was</b> granted Royal Assent and the designation of <b>Canadian</b> citizenship <b>was</b> created. Beginning in July the following year, <b>Canadian</b> passports <b>were</b> issued to <b>Canadian</b> citizens only.|$|R
25|$|The {{rights of}} LGBT <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> now as well {{protected}} {{as those of}} other Canadians largely due to several court decisions decided under Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that {{was included in the}} Constitution of Canada in 1982, with Section 15 coming into effect in 1985.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{different}} styles of indigenous hunting agricultural settlement, the ethnic makeup of the Prairie Provinces is somewhat divided north and south. Cree, Métis, French, and Ukrainian <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> concentrated in the parkland belt, and in parkland cities such as Edmonton, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg as opposed to prairie cities like Calgary and Regina, which were settled more so by people of Blackfoot, Sioux, American, English, and German backgrounds.|$|E

25|$|In Canada, Jeopardy! had aired {{largely on}} local {{stations}} since its debut. Like most American game shows that air in Canada, <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> eligible {{to appear as}} contestants on the American version, with notable examples including 1990 Tournament of Champions winner Bob Blake and 1997 International Jeopardy! Tournament winner Michael Daunt. Before 2008, Jeopardy! aired across Canada mostly on CTV stations, although the Vancouver CTV station CIVT-TV has never aired the show (the show has aired before on local Global station CHAN-TV), and in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the show airs on NTV.|$|E
25|$|Tamil <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> Canadians of Tamil ethnic origins {{mostly from}} India and Sri Lanka. From a {{population}} of fewer than 150 Tamils in 1983, it {{has become one of}} the largest visible minority population groups within the Greater Toronto Area. In the 1991 census, Tamils were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the city. Canada's Tamil population is thought to constitute the largest Sri Lankan diaspora in the world with Toronto (having a Tamil ethnic population of 157,000 as of 2016) being home to the largest Tamil community outside of Asia.|$|E

50|$|German {{documents}} captured {{after the}} war showed that Operation Penknife was successful in concealing the movement of Canadian troops from Italy to Belgium. Until late March, German intelligence maps showed the <b>Canadians</b> to <b>be</b> at various places in Italy. On March 17, when all <b>Canadians</b> <b>were</b> either in Belgium or northern France, the Germans still believed the <b>Canadians</b> <b>were</b> in the Ancona area, although {{the exact location of}} the 1st <b>Canadian</b> Armoured Brigade <b>was</b> unknown. Only in mid-April did the German maps show the absence of Canadian troops.|$|R
25|$|All honours in Canada {{emanate from}} the country's monarch, who is {{regarded}} as the fount of honour. A complex system of orders, decorations, and medals by which <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> honoured has evolved. The Victoria Cross, Order of Military Merit, Cross of Valour, Star of Courage, Medal of Bravery are some of the military awards that have been created for Canadians serving in a military capacity. The Victoria Cross has been presented to 94 Canadians and 2 Newfoundlanders between its creation in 1856 and 1993, when the Canadian Victoria Cross was instituted. However, no Canadian has received either honour since 1945.|$|E
25|$|Since 76.7% of Canada's exports {{go to the}} U.S., and 53.3% {{of imports}} into Canada come from the U.S. <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> {{interested}} {{in the value of}} their currency mainly against the U.S. dollar. Although domestic concerns arise when the dollar trades much lower than its U.S. counterpart, there is also concern among exporters when the dollar appreciates quickly. A rise {{in the value of the}} dollar increases the price of Canadian exports to the U.S. On the other hand, there are advantages to a rising dollar, in that it is cheaper for Canadian industries to purchase foreign material and businesses.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{spelling}} systems of most Commonwealth countries and Ireland closely resemble the British system. In Canada, the spelling {{system can be}} said to follow both British and American forms, and <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> somewhat more tolerant of foreign spellings when compared with other English-speaking nationalities. Australian spelling has also strayed slightly from British spelling, with some American spellings incorporated as standard. New Zealand spelling is almost identical to British spelling, except in the word fiord (instead of fjord). There is also an increasing use of macrons in words that originated in Māori and an unambiguous preference for -ise endings (see below).|$|E

25|$|The first {{permanent}} European {{settlements in}} Canada were at Port Royal in 1605 and Quebec City in 1608 as fur trading posts. The territories of New France were Canada, Acadia (later renamed Nova Scotia), and Louisiana. The inhabitants of Canada called themselves the Canadiens, and came mostly from northwestern France. The early inhabitants of Acadia, or Acadiens, came mostly but not exclusively from the Southwestern region of France. Canadien explorers and fur traders {{would come to}} be known as coureurs des bois, while those who settled on farms in Canada would {{come to be known}} as habitants. Many French <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> the descendants of the King's Daughters of this era. Many also are the descendants of mixed French and Algonquin marriages.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{only had}} a small {{population}} of Filipinos until the late 20th century. As of the 2016 Canadian Census, there are 837,130 people of Filipino descent living in Canada, most living in urbanized areas. This number is growing yearly due to Canada's more liberal immigration laws to compensate for their low population growth. Filipino <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> the third-largest Asian Canadian group in the nation after the Indian and Chinese communities. They are also the largest Southeast Asian group in the country. Between the 2011 National Household Survey and the 2016 Census, the Filipino community in Canada grew from 662,605 to 837,130, a growth of about 26%, compared {{to the rest of}} Canada which grew by 5% in the same time period.|$|E
25|$|CBC Television, {{with its}} role as the {{publicly}} funded broadcaster, {{has at least one}} O in every single province, as well as CBC North serving the three territories as well as northern Quebec. While the majority of <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> served by CBC owned-and-operated stations, the CBC also has some privately owned affiliates, though the number has decreased over the years, particularly since the early 2000s. As of January 2017, no private CBC affiliates remain (the last such station disaffiliated in September 2016), and stations that have left the network since the mid-2000s have generally not been replaced. Indeed, the public broadcaster shut down most of its own TV rebroadcast transmitters in 2012, and now relies instead on cable and satellite carriage of its O in regions outside the largest markets.|$|E

25|$|Knowledge {{of the two}} {{official}} languages {{is largely}} determined by geography. Nearly 95% of Quebecers can speak French, but only 40.6% speak English. In {{the rest of the}} country, 97.6% of the population is capable of speaking English, but only 7.5% can speak French. Personal bilingualism is most concentrated in southern Quebec and a swath of territory sometimes referred to as the bilingual belt, which stretches east from Quebec through northern and eastern New Brunswick and west through Ottawa and that part of Ontario lying to the east of Ottawa, as well as north-eastern Ontario. There is also a large French-speaking population in Manitoba. In all, 55% of bilingual <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> Quebecers, and a high percentage of the bilingual population in the rest of Canada resides in Ontario and New Brunswick.|$|E
25|$|The orders, decorations, and medals of Canada {{comprise}} a complex system by which <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> honoured by the country's sovereign for actions or deeds that benefit their community or {{the country at}} large. Modelled on its British predecessor, the structure originated in the 1930s, but began to come to full fruition {{at the time of}} Canada's centennial in 1967, with the establishment of the Order of Canada, and has since grown in both size and scope to include dynastic and national orders, state, civil, and military decorations; and various campaign medals. The monarch in right of each Canadian province also issues distinct orders and medals to honour residents for work performed in just their province. The provincial honours, as with some of their national counterparts, grant the use of post-nominal letters and or supporters and other devices to be used on personal coats of arms.|$|E
25|$|To date, {{outside of}} {{academic}} circles, {{there has been}} little national debate on the Canadian monarchy, a subject about which most <b>Canadians</b> <b>are</b> generally unaware. Out of Canada's three most prominent political parties, neither the Liberal Party nor the Conservative Party is officially in favour of abolishing the monarchy (though the latter makes support for constitutional monarchy a founding principle in its policy declaration) and the New Democratic Party (NDP) has no official position {{on the role of the}} Crown. Only some Members of Parliament belonging to these parties and the leaders of the Bloc Québécois have made any statements suggesting abolition of the monarchy. Canada has two special-interest groups representing the debate, who frequently argue the issue in the media: the Monarchist League of Canada and Citizens for a Canadian Republic. There are also other organizations that support and advocate the monarchy, such as the United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada, the Canadian Royal Heritage Trust, the Orange Order in Canada, the Friends of the Canadian Crown, and Canadian Friends of the Royal Family.|$|E
