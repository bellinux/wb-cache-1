The main reason for haptic feedback {{is to improve the}} manoeuvrability of Steer-By-Wire systems. The design includes mod-elling, prototyping and control over the joystick and modelling and control over a vehicle model. The final result was a joystick in one dimension that controlled a vehicle model run on a Arduino DUE, the vehicle was then presented on a computer screen for the user. The haptic feedback was broken down into several tasks to help the design of the con-trollers, tracking of vehicle angle, vehicle velocity based friction, a <b>centring</b> <b>force</b> and a simulated mechanical stop. The latter was {{to be able to use}} the joystick in different vehicles which potentially could have different maximum steering angle. The conclusion was a PD controller for the angular tracking, since that would allow steering and still restrict fast movement and deviation from the vehicle angle. The friction and the cen-tring controllers were P controllers that used angular velocity and angle to control, the reference was to keep each state to zero. The feel of the haptic feedback was smooth an...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{pilot study}} used a CONFORmat® Pressure mat {{to measure the}} {{position}} and movement of the <b>centre</b> of <b>force</b> measured at the buttock/seat interface of users whilst seated in three different one arm drive wheelchairs during propulsion. The manual wheelchairs included were: a dual handrim, a lever drive and a Neater Uni-wheelchair. Methods: 15 hemiplegic user’s propelled each wheelchair around an indoor course during which the <b>centre</b> of <b>force</b> was continuously recorded. Position and movements of the <b>centre</b> of <b>force</b> in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions were recorded. The time taken to complete the circuit was also recorded. Standard deviations and 95 % confidence intervals for each participant in each wheelchair were calculated to determine statistically significant differences. Results: Movement of the <b>centre</b> of <b>force</b> was greatest in the dual handrim wheelchair, both antero-posteriorly [F(2, 39) = 21. 696, p< 0. 001] and mediolaterally [F(2, 39) = 44. 273, p< 0. 001]. Position of the <b>centre</b> of <b>force</b> was also anteriorly displaced in the dual handrim wheelchair, [F(2, 39) = 15. 57, p< 0. 001]. There {{were no significant differences}} in the position of the <b>centre</b> of <b>force</b> in the medio-lateral direction. [F(2, 39) = 2. 488, p= 0. 096] Conclusions: The dual handrim wheelchair produced the greatest movement of <b>centre</b> of <b>force</b> and the lever wheelchair produced the least. This may be indicative of the symmetry and stability of seated posture in hemiplegic one arm drive wheelchair users...|$|R
