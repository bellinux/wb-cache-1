Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick). However, Follmer leaves out any potential motive for these crimes, which causes a frustrated Scully to leave the room. Byers (Bruce Harwood) reveals that he put a cell phone in the baby’s belongings so they can track the Overcoat Woman; Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Scully head out to find William. The two eventually find William's <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> along with the cell phone in an abandoned SUV. Meanwhile, the Overcoat Woman reports to Josepho that she has William.|$|E

25|$|The bag found {{wrapped around}} {{the lower half of}} Harrison's body was unique, as it had {{distinct}} folding patterns and thickness that occurred during the manufacturing process. The bag was traced to a factory in Pioneer, Ohio. Such bags were used for packaging a type of <b>car</b> <b>seat,</b> which was black in color. These seats, sold through Sears, were only available for a brief amount of time through mailing. The box containing Krista's blood belonged to the same type of <b>car</b> <b>seat.</b> Sales records of the seats were subsequently examined from the store, to search for any Ohio resident who purchased the seats. Twenty-three people in northern Ohio had purchased this type of <b>car</b> <b>seat,</b> but none owned a van that matched the one used during the abduction.|$|E
25|$|A {{child safety}} seat (sometimes {{referred}} to as an infant safety seat, a child restraint system, a restraint <b>car</b> <b>seat,</b> or ambiguously as car seats), are seats designed specifically {{to protect children from}} injury or death during collisions. They are commonly used by children when riding in a vehicle. In 1960, Leonard Rivkin of Denver, Colorado invented the first child safe <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> for use in vehicles equipped with bucket seats. A patent was filed on March 5, 1962 and was issued on October 22, 1963.|$|E

25|$|A chair {{without a}} back or arm rests is a stool, or when raised up, a bar stool. A chair with arms is an armchair; one with upholstery, {{reclining}} action, and a fold-out footrest is a recliner. A permanently fixed chair in a train or theater is a seat or, in an airplane, airline seat; when riding, it is a saddle or bicycle saddle; {{and for an}} automobile, a <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> or infant <b>car</b> <b>seat.</b> With wheels it is a wheelchair; or when hung from above, a swing. An upholstered, padded chair for two people is a 'loveseat', while if it is {{for more than two}} person it is a couch, sofa, or settee; or if is not upholstered, a bench. A separate footrest for a chair, usually upholstered, is known as an ottoman, hassock, or pouffe.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} six days later that her remains, which were in an {{advanced}} state of decomposition, {{were found in the}} weeds a few feet off the side of a scarcely traveled road in Holmes County, Ohio. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs. Because of the condition of her remains, police were not able to identify the body until Harrison's father confirmed that it was his daughter. A Budweiser towel, a bloody <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt and jeans were all found {{in the vicinity of the}} dump site. Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather. Krista was buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Marshallville.|$|E

50|$|It is {{recommended}} that children sit rear-facing {{for as long as}} possible. In Scandinavian countries, for example, children sit rear-facing until around 4 years old.

25|$|Police then {{compared}} the orange carpet fibers found on Harrison's {{body to the}} ones in Buell's van, which was {{the same color as}} the one seen in 1982. The rear-view windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed that they had been replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Robert Anthony Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.|$|E
500|$|Since {{infrasonic}} bass is felt, sub-bass can be augmented using tactile transducers. Unlike {{a typical}} subwoofer driver, which produces audible vibrations, tactile transducers produce low-frequency vibrations {{that are designed}} to be felt by individuals who are touching the transducer or indirectly through a piece of furniture or a wooden floor. Tactile transducers have recently emerged as a device class, called variously [...] "bass shakers", [...] "butt shakers" [...] and [...] "throne shakers". They are attached to a seat, for instance a drummer's stool ("throne") or gamer's chair, <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> or home theater seating, and the vibrations of the driver are transmitted to the body then to the ear {{in a manner similar to}} bone conduction. They connect to an amplifier like a normal subwoofer. They can be attached to a large flat surface (for instance a floor or platform) to create a large low frequency conduction area, although the transmission of low frequencies through the feet is not as efficient as the seat.|$|E

Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the <b>car</b> <b>seat.</b> She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{well-known}} Dallas urban legend is {{the story}} of the Lady of White Rock Lake. [...] White Rock Lake Park is reported to be haunted by the ghost of a twenty-year-old looking girl, described as wearing a water soaked 1930s evening dress, who usually appears at night along the roadside of East Lawther Drive. Witnesses claim the phantom asks to be taken to her home on Gaston Avenue in Dallas before disappearing in the car during the ride leaving a waterlogged <b>car</b> <b>seat.</b> Legend claims the woman to be a drowning victim from a boating accident in the 1930s. Reports of the ghostly encounters were published in Dallas-area newspapers in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{focus of}} {{preventive}} measures {{to date has}} been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness [...] of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the <b>car</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
