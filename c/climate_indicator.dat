40|$|In this {{research}} paper, the spatial heterogeneity of mechanical impedance {{of a typical}} chernozem was investigated. The distance between experimental points in the mechanical impedance space was explained by means of multidimensional scaling. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between dissimilarity indices and gradient separation with different data transformation methods revealed {{that the use of}} log-transformed data and Horn-Morisita distance was the most appropriate approach to reflect the relationship between the mechanical impedance of soil and ecological factors. A three dimensional variant of multidimensional scaling procedure was selected as the most appropriate decision. Environmental factors were estimated with the use of phytoindicator scales. Broad, medium and fine-scale components of spatial variation of mechanical impedance of soil were extracted using the principal coordinates of neighbour matrices method (PCNM). In the extracted dimensions, statistically significant phytoindicator scales were found to describe variability from 8 to 33 %. Dimension 1 correlated with a thermal <b>climate</b> <b>indicator</b> value, a hygromorphs index, an abundance of steppe species and meadow species. Dimension 2 correlated with a continental <b>climate</b> <b>indicator</b> value, carbonate content in the soil and the soil trophicity index (capacity of the soil for plant nutrition). Dimension 3 correlated with acidity, humidity and cryoclimate indicator values. Variation partitioning results revealed that environmental factors and spatial variables explained 47. 8 % of the total variation of the dimensions. Purely environmental component explained 18. 2 % of total variation. The spatial component and spatially structured environmental fractions explained 43. 6 %. The broad-scale spatial component explained 26. 4 % of dimensional variation, medium-scale – 6. 7 % and fine-scale – 5. 7 %. As a result of regression analysis, the broad-scale spatially structured environmental fractions were found to be connected with variability of moisture and thermal <b>climate</b> <b>indicator</b> values. The medium-scale component was revealed to be connected with variability of moisture, thermal climate, total salt regime and aeration of soil indicator value. The fine-scale component was connected with carbonate content in the soil, acidity and humidity indicator values...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Surface snow {{accumulation}} over East Antarctica is {{an important}} <b>climate</b> <b>indicator</b> but a difficult parameter to constrain. Surface mass ablation dominates over persistent wind-scour zones as near-surface katabatic winds accelerate over locally steeper ice surface topography, and sublimate and redistribute snow. Here we quantify ablation rates and downwind redeposition of snow over wind-scour zones in the upper Recovery Ice Stream catchment. Airborne radio echo-soundings show a gradual ablation of ~ 16 – 18 m of firn, corresponding to ~ 200 years of accumulation, over these zones and ablation rates of ~ 54 kgm 2 a 1 (54 mm water equivalent a 1). We conclude that mass loss is dominated by sublimation and mass is transported downwind as water vapor, because snow redeposition downslope of the wind-scour zones constitutes {{only a small fraction}} (< 10 %) of the cumulative mass loss. 1...|$|E

Monosaccharides were measured using electrospray mass spectrometry. There were significant differences among concentrations of monosaccharide from different annual tree-rings.

This study examined the ability of climate models from the CMIP 5 archive to capture the observed modes of climate vari- ability and their relationship with <b>climate</b> <b>indicators</b> in the Northeast United States (NE US). As year to year climate variability is largest in the boreal win- ter, this study focused mainly on observed and projected winter climate. The CMIP 5 models were adequately able to simulate observed trends, the annual cycle, and synoptic boreal winter teleconnection patterns for temperature. For precipitation, the models did well capturing cold season trends, but overem- phasized the annual cycle. The models also did not do well simulating NE US winter teleconnection patterns from the NAM, PNA, and EP NINO. Future trends in <b>climate</b> <b>indicators</b> for the NE US suggest that will be warmer and wetter with more year to year variability, particularly for precipitation. In creased variability in <b>climate</b> <b>indicators</b> suggest {{that there will be}} an increase in extreme events, which will be more dicult for society to adapt to than changes in seasonal or annual mean. Changes in teleconnection patterns for the 21 st Century are projected under the high emission scenario (RCP 8. 5), but there is little model agreement in direction or magnitude of future changes. However, the CMIP 5 models offer a better view into synoptic scale forcings than the CMIP 3 models, and these results add to the collective understanding of potential changes to NE US climate...|$|R

Over the years, INSEE has gradually introduced business <b>climate</b> <b>indicators</b> for each business sector.
