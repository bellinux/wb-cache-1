500|$|... "Baby Don't Lie" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella, with Tedder and Blanco also serving as the song's producers. It is a midtempo electropop and reggae-pop song which begins with Stefani announcing, [...] "Uh huh, here we go," [...] to a rubbery bass line and hand claps. The song also has a hip hop-inflected breakdown, in which Stefani raps, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what you're hidin' boy/And you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> if I'm gettin' warm". Lyrically, the song {{discusses}} insecurities in a relationship, where Stefani questions her man's love. Nolan Feeney of Time complimented that the song is [...] "about {{falling in love with}} someone who's got a few skeletons in their closet." [...] As noted by Spins Brennan Carley, [...] "Stefani sounds shattered as she sings, [...] "But there's something behind those eyes / Those eyes / That you can't that you can't disguise / Disguise." [...] In the [...] "stomping, infuriatingly catchy" [...] chorus she sings, [...] "Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie…/I don't want to cry no longer." [...] Melodically, [...] "Baby don't Lie" [...] is written in the key of B♭ minor, performed in a common time moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute and follows the sequence B♭m - G♭ - D♭ as its chord progression. Stefani's voice spans two octaves from the lowest note A♭3 to the highest note A♭5.|$|E

500|$|In September 2010, William Shatner {{commented on}} Twitter {{regarding}} {{damage to his}} star on the Walk of Fame: [...] "I hear my star on the Canadian Walk of Fame is a bit frazzled ... but, then again, so am I. I wonder if anybody hovering around that area <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what’s wrong with it and what needs fixing." [...] The family of Gordie Howe also commented on the damage to Gordie's star. The Canadian Press reported that [...] "A number of celebrities' stars are looking a bit rough around the edges." [...] The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage {{was due to the}} freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows. It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe's damaged tiles, and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, the Cure {{released}} The Top, {{a generally}} psychedelic album on which Smith played all the instruments except the drums—played by Andy Anderson—and the saxophone—played by returnee Porl Thompson. The album was a Top 10 {{hit in the}} UK, and was their first studio album to break the Billboard 200 in the US, reaching number 180. Billboard |website=Billboard |accessdate=26 June 2013}} Melody Maker praised the album as [...] "psychedelia that can't be dated", while pondering, [...] "I've yet to meet anyone who <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> why the Cure are having hits now of all times." [...] The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson, Anderson and producer-turned-bassist Phil Thornalley on board. Released in late 1984, the Cure's first live album, Concert consisted of performances from this tour. Near the tour's end, Anderson was fired for destroying a hotel room {{and was replaced by}} Boris Williams. Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring. However, the bassist slot was not vacant long, for a Cure roadie named Gary Biddles had brokered a reunion between Smith and former bassist Simon Gallup, who had been playing in the band Fools Dance. Soon after reconciling, Smith asked Gallup to rejoin the band. Smith was ecstatic about Gallup's return and declared to Melody Maker, [...] "It's a group again." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{how you are}} going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E
