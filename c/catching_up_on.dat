5|$|Daily life at Fort Greble {{was similar}} to that {{experienced}} by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses. A soldier's normal day began with reville before sunrise and was immediately followed by morning muster, at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call. Following muster, the day was filled with work on improving the fort's defenses and drill of various types, usually consisting of gunnery practice, but also including infantry and parade drill. This schedule usually continued, broken by meal and rest breaks, until taps was called at 8:00 or 9:00p.m. Sunday was a break in the routine as the muster was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call. Sunday afternoons were a soldier's free time, and this was usually filled by writing letters home, bathing, or simply <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> extra sleep.|$|E

Though interested in appearing on Spooks, he was initially somewhat worried and hesitant to join the series, citing replacing Rupert Penry-Jones, which he thought was a [...] "tall order," [...] and fears of bringing the series down. He agreed to appear on the series upon reading the rough outline of the script. He and the producers discussed about the potential and direction for the character, as well as where he would fit in the world of Spooks.

Though Penry-Jones was aware of Spooks and its success, he had never seen any episodes. To be interested in the role, he spent a weekend <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the entire first and second series. He did not take long to decide, since his last leading role was four years previously, in 2000 in the Channel 4 drama North Square. Adam was originally meant to be older, and more [...] "street." [...] When he found acting [...] "street" [...] was too difficult, Penry-Jones acted more like himself. He had to audition three times before the producers included him, four months before filming commenced.|$|E

2500|$|While the Yildirim Army Group was {{retreating}} {{back their}} {{lines of communication}} were shortened facilitating supply while Desert Mounted Corps was getting further away from their base and their lines of communication had to be extended. The pursuit north from Damascus began with the advance along the Mediterranean coast by the XXI Corps north from Haifa and Acre to capture the ports at Beirut and Tripoli through which supplies could be transported to support Desert Mounted Corps advance. While the Australian Mounted Division continued to garrison Damascus the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions continued the pursuit towards Rayak and Baalbek as the advance along the coast was progressing.

40|$|Except for the Philippines between 1896 and 1939, Southeast Asia {{was never}} {{part of the}} century-long East Asian {{industrial}} <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> until after World War II. Before the 1950 s, Southeast Asian manufacturing hardly grew at all: while commodity export processing did grow fast, import-competing manufacturing and manufacturing for local consumption did not. Singapore and Thailand started recording <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> growth rates <b>on</b> the western leaders only from the 1950 s onwards, and Indonesia and Malaysia joined the club only after 1973.

The only Southeast Asian country that appeared to have joined the fast industrial growth club before World War II - the Philippines - had its industrial growth collapse after the ISI years. What explains this dismal industrial performance before the 1960 s? Why did Southeast Asia become a rapid export-led manufacturing growth success story after the 1960 s while it did not in Latin America, the Middle East, or South Asia? In seeking answers, we distinguish four periods: de-industrialization and commodity export growth before 1913; a modest diversification into manufacturing during WWI and the interwar years; the development of consumer goods production under import substitution policies between the 1940 s and the 1960 s; and finally the high speed export-led industrialization since. We show how factor endowments, demography, schooling, second-best institutions, foreign markets, and, especially, good luck mattered...|$|R

[...] Egner also referred to the previous plot in the show involving Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, and speculated what it could mean in regards to Jon Snow's personality being changed, or becoming less of his former self, as with Dondarrion.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} we test whether <b>catching</b> <b>up,</b> the hypoth-esis that there is {{technological}} spillover from leaders to follow-ers, is still important among industrialized countries. Since the U.

A testable model is developed and a number of tests for the existence of <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> are performed. A major improvement on previous tests is that the level of technology is measured in terms of total factor productivity. The two major conclusions, which are quite robust, are that after 1970 there is no <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> effect left in the tradables sector, while <b>catching</b> <b>up</b> is found for industries in the nontradables sector...|$|R
