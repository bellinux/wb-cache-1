Mean density of zooplankton (excluding protozoans) increased from 11. 7 T 1 in May, 1997, to 225. 71 " 1 in August, 1997, mainly due to increases in copepod nauplii and the rotifers Brachionus plicatilis and probably B. rotundiforms. Copepods consisted mostly of Oithona davisae (86 %) and Acartia pacifica (10 %) in May, 1997, but these had been completely replaced by brackish-water species, Sinocalanus tenellus (44 %), Pseudodiaptomus inopinus (35 %), and Paracyclopina nana (19 %) by August, 1997.

5000|$|The current {{consensus}} is that the Euripus was <b>closed</b> by a <b>dike</b> of coarse sediment until about 6000 years ago. It was opened following an (unrecorded) earthquake and remained open (see Herodotus, e.a. VII.173 and VIII.66, on the sea-battle of Artemision) until 411 BC, when the Euboeans decided to renounce their status as an island subject to Athenian hegemony and make themselves part of Boeotia (Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, 13.47, sections 1-8). (There is no trace of this either in Thucydides or in Xenophon (in History of the Peloponnesian War and in Hellenica respectively.) Diodorus mentions specifically that gaps had to {{be left in the}} dike to allow the Euripus tides to flow through and that the current became much more intense owing to the narrowness of the passage and says that a single passage was left just wide enough for a single ship. Strabo (IX.2.2) wrote of some later time when there was a bridge two plethra long (approximately 50 m, which is probably an exaggeration). Some vestiges of the two ends of the dike of 411 probably remained, so that this later bridge was probably narrower than the channel that existed before 411 BC.

40|$|International audienceOn 17 January 2002, Nyiragongo volcano erupted along a 20 km-long {{fracture}} network {{extending from}} the volcano {{to the city of}} Goma. The event was captured by InSAR data from the ERS- 2 and RADARSAT- 1 satellites. A combination of 3 D numerical modeling and inversions is used to analyze these displacements. Using Akaike Information Criteria, we determine that a model with two subvertical dikes is the most likely explanation for the 2002 InSAR deformation signal. A first, shallow dike, 2 km high, is associated with the eruptive fissure, and a second, deeper dike, 6 km high and 40 km long, lies about 3 km below the city of Goma. As the deep dike extends laterally for 20 km beneath the gas-rich Lake Kivu, the interaction of magma and dissolved gas should be considered as a significant hazard for future eruptions. A likely scenario for the eruption is that the magma supply to a deep reservoir started ten months before the eruption, as indicated by LP events and tremor. Stress analysis indicates that the deep dike could have triggered the injection of magma from the lake and shallow reservoir into the eruptive dike. The deep dike induced the opening of the southern part of this shallow dike, to which it transmitted magma though a narrow dike. This model is consistent with the geochemical analysis, the lava rheology and the pre- and post-eruptive seismicity. We infer low overpressures (1 - 10 MPa) for the dikes. These values are consistent with lithostatic crustal stresses <b>close</b> to the <b>dikes</b> and low magma pressure. As a consequence, the dike direction is probably not controlled by stresses but rather by a reduced tensile strength, inherited from previous rift intrusions. The lithostatic stresses indicate that magmatic activity is intense enough to relax tensional stresses associated with the rift extension...|$|R
40|$|Small basaltic dikes of the Killala dike swarm have {{irregular}} contact aureoles. Contact aureoles of dikes 1. 5 to 2 m thick are discontinuous {{and include}} only the grossularite zone. The grossularite zone adjacent to dikes greater than 4 m thick is continuous, but may change thickness {{along the length}} of the dike at dike-contact offsets and may differ in thickness on opposite sides of the dike. The wollastonite zone is present only locally along the contacts of dikes 4 to 5 m thick. Typical methods of modeling contact aureoles including: thermal modeling, analysis of bulk composition, analysis of differential fluid flow, and non-dilational emplacement processes only partly explain the observed irregularities in the metamorphic zones along and across the dikes. ^ The absence of a grossularite zone in the aureoles of dikes less than 1 m thick, its discontinuous development in the aureoles of dikes 1 to 2 m thick, and the location of the grossularite-in and smectite-out isograds <b>closer</b> to the <b>dikes</b> than predicted by thermal history modeling, argue for kinetic inhibition of the grossularite-producing reaction during the short time during which the aureole was heated above 350 ∘C. ^ The absence of a wollastonite zone in the aureoles of dikes less than 5 m thick, and its discontinuous development in the aureole of a 5 m thick dike, may be explained by reaction overstepping. If reaction overstepping is high, the path of fluid-rock system on T-XCO 2 diagram intersects the wollastonite-producing reaction. If overstepping is low, the path of fluid-rock system never intersects the wollastonite-producing reaction. The amount of overstepping is influenced by the amount of fluid flow. Presence of pore-lining cements in preserved fossils in the inner grossularite- and wollastonite zones implies a pathway for enhanced fluid flow was present in the inner contact aureole during metamorphism. ^ Reaction overstepping in combination with non-dilational process during dike emplacement may explain the development of irregular contact aureoles. This implies that the typical assumptions used to evaluate contact aureoles may not be valid for contact aureoles associated with small dikes. ...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, little {{attention}} has been given to the proper reaction of authorities and population {{in the case of a}} dike breach. It is postulated that the number of victims can be reduced if all people involved know what to do and where they have to go. No technically sound evacuation plans exist for the different polders and regions of the Netherlands. This gives rise to the question to what extent current infrastructure suffices to evacuate the complete population in time from one dike-ring to the neighboring dike-rings. The central question this report tries to answer is: Which technical information is needed to improve evacuation in case of a dike breach? First, through a literature review, it is discussed how the impact of a flood can be mitigated and how, in general, floods in the Netherlands are managed. Based on this review, the need for a better supply of technical information to government and citizen is determined. A case study (Callantsoog) was undertaken to obtain insight in the impact of a flood. The case study gives insight in inundation patterns and evacuation possibilities. A number of maps containing the necessary information for the calamity organization was defined. The case study shows that total clearance times vary depending on the clearance strategy. Clearance times vary from 135 to 225 minutes. This means that, under normal circumstances, everyone can be evacuated in the available clearance time. The case study also shows that a larger width of the dike breach causes an increase in the number of victims. The number of victims differs as a function of compartment size. The smallest compartment causes 498 victims, whereas the current single large compartment causes 36 victims. The analysis of the case study led to the creation of four maps, which can support evacuation: 9 ̆ 5 Inundation map with safe areas. This map provides flight possibilities to safe places within the dike ring; 9 ̆ 5 Victim map, which helps authorities decide where evacuation efforts need to be concentrated; 9 ̆ 5 Golf front map, which gives insight into which areas are able to be evacuated after the dike breach; 9 ̆ 5 Flee route map with the times at which dike crossings, which are normally open, need to be closed. This map helps to determine along which roads one has to evacuate and how long on has before a road will be <b>closed.</b> Limiting the <b>dike</b> opening has a positive influence on risk. It reduces the number of victims, it gives more safe areas within the compartment and the time before the compartment has overflowed is extended. The current compartment at Callantsoog has an optimum size for flood risk at one dike opening. It is recommended to build no houses on locations in the compartments where the occupants do not have the possibility to evacuate horizontal or vertically preventively.

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{damage caused}} by hurricane Ike in the year 2008 has been the main incentive for several structural flood risk reduction plans in the Houston-Galveston Bay area. One {{of them is the}} ’Ike Dike’, a large-scale coastal barrier which closes Galveston Bay to prevent penetration of hurricane surges. A momentum gain for flood risk reduction plans enables opportunities for nature-based or Building-with-Nature (BwN) solutions in the area. However, no structured approach with respect to BwN for flood risk reduction has been followed for Galveston Bay yet. BwN focuses on working with processes of nature, promoting and using habitats and increasing the contribution to ecosystem services and other potential benefits. In order to apply this principle to flood risk reduction, more understanding of the hydrodynamic effect of BwN measures under hurricane forcing is required. The main topic of this research is to explore the opportunities for BwN solutions for flood risk reduction in the Galveston Bay area. This study focuses on two aspects: flood risk and natural value. Thereby, the goal is to create solutions which add value to both aspects. Concerning flood risk, surge and waves are considered key processes because they contribute greatly to damage during hurricane conditions. In this study a conceptual design is made and evaluated by means of a qualitative evaluation and a quantitative evaluation. The qualitative evaluation involves two toolboxes. The quantitative evaluation involves a 2 DH hydrodynamic model. The Galveston Bay system is a large estuary, which is prone to hurricanes and vulnerable to flooding. Important variables that affect surge and waves inside Galveston Bay are fetch, depth, landfall location and hurricane surge at the open coast. Fetch and depth can be influenced by BwN measures. Galveston Bay is a productive ecological system and its most important habitats are wetlands (e. g. salt marshes) and oyster reefs. However, significant erosion of shorelines and wetlands in Galveston Bay as a result of relative sea level rise and insufficient sediment supply has been observed. A BwN solution for flood risk reduction in Galveston Bay can consist of several elements or ’building blocks’: nourishments, wetlands, oyster reefs and an eco-island. Oyster reefs are considered as three-dimensional structures. Moreover, an eco-island is defined as a large island with ecological development and e. g. recreational functions. These building blocks have been identified because they have the potential to reduce flood risk as well as provide natural benefits to the system. In order to qualitatively evaluate these building blocks for Galveston Bay, a framework has been developed. This framework involves two toolboxes and the formulation of a global, conceptual BwN design. The toolboxes emphasize on flood risk and natural value of the building blocks. Simplified one-dimensional calculations, where possible, and qualitative literature are used to formulate the toolboxes. The potential effect of a building block is illustrated by a color classification and a description. The effect on flood risk is assessed for surge and waves. The effect on natural value is assessed for five relevant criteria. The framework has been proved to work well for evaluation of building blocks for Galveston Bay. On the one hand, with respect to surge, the toolbox shows potential for a reduction of several decimeters to a meter in Galveston Bay for emerged nourishments which compartmentalize the Bay by limiting fetch and therefore wind set-up. The eco-island, however, is significantly less effective in surge reduction as water can easily flow around it. Wetlands and oyster reefs are considered not effective for surge reduction in Galveston Bay at all. On the other hand, with respect to waves, wetlands are promising for attenuating waves nearshore. However, wide stretches are required and the quantification of their effect is difficult due to various parameters like vegetation type, stem density and stemstiffness. At the shore, oyster reefs are effective in attenuating waves and reducing erosion as well, although the effect in hurricane conditions requires more investigation. Concluding, the evaluation of the toolboxes shows that most promising flood risk reduction measures are least beneficial to the natural value in Galveston Bay and vice versa. The most effective design according to this qualitative evaluation method is a continuous emerged island that reduces peak water levels close to the western and northwestern shore of the Bay. This can be combined with oyster reefs along the western shore until Texas City and wetlands at the foreshore of the Texas City Levee for wave attenuation and erosion reduction. The qualitative evaluation showed promising solutions for surge reduction. However, quantification has been difficult. Therefore a hydrodynamic 2 DH model has been created that incorporates the complex dynamics of a hurricane, two-dimensional flow mechanisms and the bathymetry of the Bay. This model is used to evaluate the system behavior and surge reduction measures for different hurricanes, with or without Ike Dike. Three hurricanes have been applied: a ’regular’ Ike as reference hurricane, and two shifted Ike tracks in which landfall occurs to the southwest of Galveston. These two shifted hurricanes cause higher storm surge levels in Galveston Bay due to higher surge levels at the open coast and stronger onshore winds in Galveston Bay. The model has been calibrated with measurements of peak water levels during Ike. Although this model is a coarse resolution model with limited simulation time, its performance is acceptable. Simulations show that peak surge levels of 3. 5 - 7 m are expected in the Bay for different storms in the open Bay situation. However, {{in the case of a}} <b>closed</b> Bay (Ike <b>Dike)</b> peak surge levels are limited to 1. 5 - 2. 5 m. Surge measures are evaluated for three different areas of interest: West, Northwest or Houston Shipping Channel (HSC) and Northeast Bay. Outcomes of the model show that peak surge level can be reduced by emerged islands which are as continuous as possible. For an island to be emerged even in the worst simulated hurricane conditions an elevation of 6 m above mean sea level (MSL) is required. In that case, peak surge level reductions with a minimumof 0. 5 mand amaximumof 1 mare expected with emerged islands in theWest and the Northwest (HSC) for different storm tracks in the open Bay situation. The measures in the case with an Ike Dike are generally less effective in reducing peak surge levels. A final, optimized design for surge reduction is defined as the combination of a continuous island forWest and Northwest (HSC), the two most economically valuable areas. This design is presented in Figure 1, along with results for peak water level reduction without Ike Dike. The conclusion can be drawn that various limitations are found with respect to BwN solutions for flood risk reduction in Galveston Bay. Bwn solutions can significantly improve natural conditions in the Bay. However, they cannot eliminate flood risk inGalveston Bay, because a large emerged structurewith a few open passages would reduce peak surge levels at thewestern and northwestern shore by a maximum of 1. 5 m. The presented BwN design is a significant intervention in the system and might have limited benefits for natural value. Furthermore, flood risk reduction of BwN measures highly depends on whether an Ike Dike will be constructed and which storm is considered because the landfall location is highly influential to peak surge levels in the Bay. With respect to waves, oyster reefs and wetlands along the shore are considered to be promising measures as they clearly add value to the natural system, protect the shore and attenuate waves. However, the effect of these measures requires quantification. To reduce flood risk significantly, BwN solutions in Galveston Bay should be constructed alongside of hard flood protection structures.
