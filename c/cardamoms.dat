500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, <b>cardamoms,</b> catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E
2500|$|The Angkorian period {{may have}} begun shortly after 800AD, when the Khmer King Jayavarman II {{announced}} the independence of Kambujadesa (Cambodia) from Java and established his capital of Hariharalaya (now known as Roluos) at {{the northern end of}} Tonlé Sap. Through a program of military campaigns, alliances, marriages and land grants, he achieved a unification of the country bordered by China to the north, Champa (now Central Vietnam) to the east, the ocean to the south and a place identified by a stone inscription as [...] "the land of <b>cardamoms</b> and mangoes" [...] to the west. In 802, Jayavarman articulated his new status by declaring himself [...] "universal monarch" [...] (chakravartin) and, in a move that was to be imitated by his successors and that linked him to the cult of Siva, taking on the epithet of [...] "god-king" [...] (devaraja). Before Jayavarman, Cambodia had consisted of a number of politically independent principalities collectively known to the Chinese by the names Funan and Chenla.|$|E

40|$|I {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} understorey cultivation of <b>cardamom</b> (Eletteria cardamomum) on forest structure, tree species composition, soil properties and potential for regeneration in the Knuckles Forest Reserve (KFR) in central Sri Lanka through extensive vegetation and soil sampling. In addition, I examined practical techniques for restoring forests affected by <b>cardamom</b> cultivation through experimental manipulations. Forests with <b>cardamom</b> (<b>cardamom</b> plantations) had higher canopy openness and lower tree, sapling and seedling densities than adjacent forests without <b>cardamom</b> (natural forests). Overall, <b>cardamom</b> plantations {{tended to be more}} diverse than natural forests, mainly related to the addition of pioneer species. <b>Cardamom</b> plantations had higher concentrations of total P and exchangeable K but lower concentrations of total N and soil pH than the natural forests. Relative to natural forests, <b>cardamom</b> plantations had a higher density of seed in the soil seed bank, with a higher percentage of grass and non-native species. Experimental manipulations in <b>cardamom</b> plantations demonstrated that slashing or uprooting or weeding of <b>cardamom</b> stands enhances tree seedling recruitment over the first 15 months post-treatment. However, given the higher labour costs required for removal of <b>cardamom</b> plants, deliberate weeding of <b>cardamom</b> stands with minimum disturbance to tree seedling emergence may be sufficient to enhance tree regeneration in <b>cardamom</b> plantations. Stakeholders in the Knuckles Forest Reserve have mixed views about the rationality of prohibiting <b>cardamom</b> cultivation in the reserve and forests in the buffer zone. However, there are the opportunities for enhancing <b>cardamom</b> production in agroforestry systems outside the reserve. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

He laughed shortly when I told him that Mr. Shaynor had stepped out--but a frail coil of wire held all his attention, and he had no word for me bewildered among the batteries and rods. The noise of the sea on the beach began to make itself heard as the traffic in the street ceased. Then briefly, but very lucidly, he gave me the names and uses of the mechanism that crowded the tables and the floor.|$|E

6000|$|Kim {{considered}} it {{in every possible}} light. He had been diligent, even as the Colonel advised. A boy's holiday was his own property--of so much the talk of his companions had advised him,--and a barrack-school would be torment after St Xavier's. Moreover--this was magic worth anything else--he could write. In three months he had discovered how men can {{speak to each other}} without a third party, at the cost of half an anna and a little knowledge. No word had come from the lama, but there remained the Road. Kim yearned for the caress of soft mud squishing up between the toes, as his mouth watered for mutton stewed with butter and cabbages, for rice speckled with strong scented <b>cardamoms,</b> for the saffron-tinted rice, garlic and onions, and the forbidden greasy sweetmeats of the bazars. They would feed him raw beef on a platter at the barrack-school, and he must smoke by stealth. But again, he was a Sahib and was at St Xavier's, and that pig Mahbub Ali ... No, he would not test Mahbub's hospitality--and yet ... He thought it out alone in the dormitory, and came to the conclusion he had been unjust to Mahbub.|$|E
60|$|Patriotic Barbot (1700), {{in company}} with the mariner Villault de Belfons, Père Labat, and Ernest de Fréville, [Footnote: Mémoire sur le Commerce Maritime de Rouen.] claims the honour for France. According to that 'chief factor for the African Company,' the merchants of Dieppe first traded to West Africa for <b>cardamoms</b> and ivory. This was {{during the reign of}} Charles V., and between 1364 and 1430, or half a century before the Portuguese. Their chief {{stations}} were Goree of Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, Cape Mount, the Kru or Liberian coast, then called 'of Grain,' from the 'Guinea grains' or Malaguetta pepper (Amomum granum Paradisi), and, lastly, the Gold Coast. Here they founded 'Petit Paris' upon the Baie de France, at 'Serrelionne;' 'Petit Dieppe,' {{at the mouth of the}} St. John's River, near Grand Bassá, south of Monrovia; and 'Cestro' [Footnote: Now generally called Grand Sestros, and popularly derived from the Portuguese cestos--pepper.] or 'Sestro Paris,' where, three centuries afterwards, the natives retained a few words of French. Hence Admiral Bouet-Willaumez explains the Great and Little 'Boutoo' of our charts by butteau, from butte, the old Norman word still preserved in the great western prairies.|$|E

If it be in the Punjab then I shall certainly return to it to that very place. Meantime, Mother, consider what I have to eat. This is the true list. I eat daily sugar and ghi and flour, salt, meat, red peppers, some almonds and dates, sweets of various kinds as well as raisins and <b>cardamoms.</b> In the morning I eat tea and white biscuits. An hour after, halwa and puri [native dishes]. At noon, tea and bread; at seven o'clock of the evening, vegetable curry. At bedtime I drink milk. There is abundance of milk in this country. I am more comfortable here, I swear it to you, Mother, than any high officer in India. As for our clothing, there is no account kept of it. You would cry out, Mother, to see the thick cloth expended. So I beg you, Mother, to take comfort concerning your son. Do not tear my heart by telling me your years. Though we both lived to be as old as elephants I am your son who will come asking for you as I said, at your door.|$|E

30|$|<b>Cardamom</b> is {{indigenous}} to South India and Sri Lanka (Purseglove et al. 1981) {{and there is}} a strong belief that the species has been originated in the moist evergreen rainforests of the Western Ghats of South India (Kumar et al. 1997). According to reliable reports, <b>cardamom</b> cultivation began during 1803 in India and until then, <b>cardamom</b> pods were harvested from forests (Ravindran and Madhusoodanan 2003). This means that selection of <b>cardamom</b> with respect to better agronomic traits began around 210  years ago. Further, the cultivation was usually practised in forests after clearing all the undergrowth where <b>cardamom</b> grows naturally. These processes could have gradually eliminated wild <b>cardamom</b> as such and genetic variations there exist. Frequent cultivation of <b>cardamom</b> and targeted selection of peculiar morpho/ecotypes have resulted in the development of many location specific landraces. As in the case of other crop plants, wild <b>cardamom</b> plants (including disease escapes (Venugopal 1999) from abandoned plantations) may have genetic variability and possess alleles that can be effectively used for crop improvement programmes.|$|R

He is three years old. His name is Pir, which in their language also means a holy man. He runs barefoot in summer and wears only one garment. He eats all foods and specially dates. In this country it is not allowed to give children pepper or <b>cardamoms.</b> He has learned to speak our tongue and bears a wooden sword which was made for him and a turban of our sort. When he is weary he repairs to the centre of my bed which is forbidden to him by his grandmother of whom he has no fear. He fears nothing. My Mother, he is almost the same sort as my own. He sends his salutations to him. He calls him [...] "My brother who is in India." [...] He also prays for him aloud before an idol which he is taken to worship. On account of his fatness he cannot yet kneel long, but falls over sideways. The idol is of Bibbee Miriam [the Virgin Mary] whom they, in this country, believe to watch over children. He has also a small idol of his own above his bed which represents a certain saint called Pir. He rides upon the ass and says he will become a trooper. I take delight in his presence and his conversation.|$|E
6000|$|Next {{morning we}} were visited by the Rev. Mr. Mackey, the senior {{of the eight}} white men who inhabit this piece of land--a proper site for Robinson Crusoe--where, as the Yankee said of Great Britain, you can hardly stretch {{yourself}} without fear of falling overboard. He kindly undertook to be our guide over the interior, and we landed on the hard sand of the open western beach: here at times a tremendous surf must roll in. We struck into the bush, and bent towards the south-west of the islet, where stands the monarch of cliffs, 80 feet high. The maximum length is three miles by about the same breadth, and the circumference, including the indentations, may be fifteen. The surface is rolling composed of humus and clay, corallines and shelly conglomerates based on tertiary limestone and perhaps sandstone; dwarf clearings alternate with tracts of bush grass, and with a bushy second growth, lacking large trees. The only important wild productions pointed out to us were <b>cardamoms,</b> the oil palm (Elais Guincensis), and an unknown species of butter-nut. The centre of the island was a mass of perennial pools, fed, they say, by springs as well as rains, one puddle, adorned with water lilies and full of dwarf leeches which relish man's life, extended about a hundred yards long. In fact, the general semblance of Corisco {{was that of a}} filled up [...] "atoll," [...] a circular reef still growing to a habitable land. Here only could I find on the west coast of Africa a trace of the features which distinguished the Gorilla island of 2,300 years ago.|$|E
60|$|The {{energetic}} young Mr. Cashell snorted within, and Shaynor settled {{himself up}} in his chair over which he had thrown a staring red, black, and yellow Austrian jute blanket, rather like a table-cover. I cast about, amid patent medicine pamphlets, for something to read, but finding little, returned to the manufacture of the new drink. The Italian warehouse took down its game and went to bed. Across the street blank shutters flung back the gaslight in cold smears; the dried pavement seemed to rough up in goose-flesh under the scouring of the savage wind, and we could hear, long ere he passed, the policeman flapping his arms to keep himself warm. Within, the flavours of <b>cardamoms</b> and chloric-ether disputed those of the pastilles and a score of drugs and perfume and soap scents. Our electric lights, set low down in the windows before the tunbellied Rosamund jars, flung inward three monstrous daubs of red, blue, and green, that broke into kaleidoscopic lights on the facetted knobs of the drug-drawers, the cut-glass scent flagons, and the bulbs of the sparklet bottles. They flushed the white-tiled floor in gorgeous patches; splashed along the nickel-silver counter-rails, and turned the polished mahogany counter- panels to the likeness of intricate grained marbles--slabs of porphyry and malachite. Mr. Shaynor unlocked a drawer, and ere he began to write, took out a meagre bundle of letters. From my place by the stove, I could see the scalloped edges of the paper with a flaring monogram {{in the corner and}} could even smell the reek of chypre. At each page he turned toward the toilet-water lady of the advertisement and devoured her with over-luminous eyes. He had drawn the Austrian blanket over his shoulders, and among those warring lights he looked more than ever the incarnation of a drugged moth--a tiger-moth as I thought.|$|E
