40|$|Accounting for co-products of {{vegetable}} oil production {{is essential in}} reviewing the sustainability of biodiesel production, especially since oil crops produce valuable protein-rich co-products in different quantities and qualities. Two accounting methods, allocation {{on the basis of}} energy content and <b>system</b> <b>expansion,</b> are compared. Significant differences in results exist between the methods where <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> is to be preferred because it can take actual use of co-products into account.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{choosing}} the best transmission <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> plan considering a probabilistic reliability criterion LOLE. The method minimizes the invest-ment budget for constructing new transmission lines subject to probabilistic reliability criteria, which consider the uncertainties of transmission system elements. Two probabilistic reliability criteria are used as constraints. One is a transmission system reliability criterion LOLE constraint, {{and the other is}} a bus/nodal reliability criterion LOLE constraint. The proposed method models the transmission <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> problem as an integer programming problem. It solves for the optimal strategy using a probabilistic branch and bound method that utilizes a network flow approach and the maximum flow-min-imum cut set theorem. Test results on an existing 21 -bus system are included in the paper. They demonstrate the suitability of the proposed method for solving the transmission <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> planning problem subject to practical future uncertainties.

In this thesis, methods of charging for the transmission system and optimising {{the expansion of the}} transmission network under the competitive power market are described. The first part of this thesis considers transmission tariff design. In the proposed approach, not only is all the necessary investment in the transmission system recovered, but also an absolute economic signal is offered which is very useful in the competitive power market. A fair power market opportunity is given to every participant by the new nodal-use method. The second part of this thesis considers transmission <b>system</b> <b>expansion.</b> All the tests are based on the Three Gorges Project in China. In this thesis, to optimally expand the transmission system, the LMP (Locational Marginal Price) selection method and the CBEP (Congestion-Based transmission <b>system</b> <b>Expansion</b> Planning) method are introduced. The LMP selection method is used to select optional plans for transmission <b>system</b> <b>expansion.</b> It is especially suitable for large transmission systems. The outstanding advantages of the LMP selection method are simplicity and computational efficiency. The CBEP method produces the optimal <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> plan. For the first time, generation congestion and transmission congestion are separated within the <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> problem. For this reason the CBEP method {{can be used in a}} supply-side power market and is suitable for the Chinese power market. In this thesis, the issue of how to relax the congestion in the transmission system have been solved. The transmission system can obtain enough income to recover the total required cost. For this reason more and more investment will come into the transmission system from investors. The risk for the independent generators is also under control in the CBEP method. Even when the system is congested, the uncertainty of LMP is taken into consideration...|$|R

40|$|Many factors {{contribute}} to the planning process of power systems. In the context of expansion planning, focus is paid to selection criteria that enable the optimization of related factors {{that will result in}} the best performance. This is described as meeting demand whilst reducing costs and maintaining minimal risk in operation. In this paper, different criteria used in the planning of power <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> studies are investigated with the objective of identifying their impact on the expansion plan. The results of these criteria on the expansion study of the Jordanian power system are presented. Results show good correspondence to the actual adopted solutions. The spinning reserve is the most influential planning criterion on the overall <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> cost. This is followed by the peak load changes, and the forced outage rate of the candidate units used for capacity additions to meet future expected demand. Finally, the loss of load expectation and cost of energy not served have the least effect on the overall <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> cost. These results highlight the importance to be placed on performing sensitivity analyses to determine the most cost effective and acceptable expansion plan of the electric power system. There is a need to continually update the planning criteria to cater for changes and developments in the power system and the economic situation. Finally, the methodology of this study can be generalized to other power <b>systems.</b> Power <b>system</b> <b>expansion</b> studies Planning criteria Reliability...|$|R
