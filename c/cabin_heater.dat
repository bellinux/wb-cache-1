25|$|The wings {{were covered}} with Madapolam fabric and doped {{in a similar manner}} to the fuselage. The wing was {{installed}} into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the <b>cabin</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Gazelle {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space {{in the rear of}} the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin. Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high landing skids, <b>cabin</b> <b>heater,</b> adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems. While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.|$|E

2500|$|The 2013 {{model year}} Leaf {{destined for the}} U.S. market has several key {{improvements}} similar to the Japanese version, better range, faster charging capabilities, a more efficient <b>cabin</b> <b>heater,</b> and a lower starting price. According to Nissan USA, several of the changes seek to address shortcomings of previous versions of the Leaf, and feedback from Leaf owners was taken into consideration. The 2013 model year Leaf delivers a higher range than the 2012 model with the same [...] battery pack. The efficiency gains come {{from a combination of}} improvements to aerodynamics through tweaks to the front fascia that allowed a reduction of the drag coefficient; a more efficient heater; the addition of a driver-selected B-mode that increases regenerative braking; and energy/range management.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike other {{air-cooled}} cars (such as the Volkswagen Beetle and the Fiat 500) the 2CV's engine had no {{thermostat valve}} in its oil system. The engine needed {{more time for}} oil to reach normal operating temperature in cold weather. All the oil passed through an oil cooler behind the fan and received the full cooling effect regardless of the ambient temperature. This removes the risk of overheating from a jammed thermostat that can afflict water- and air-cooled engines and the engine can withstand many hours of running under heavy load at high engine speeds even in hot weather. To prevent the engine running cool in cold weather (and to improve {{the output of the}} <b>cabin</b> <b>heater)</b> all 2CVs were supplied with a grille blind (canvas on early cars and a clip-on plastic item called a [...] "muff" [...] in the owner's handbook, on later ones) which blocked around half the aperture to reduce the flow of air to the engine.|$|E
25|$|The Djinn {{featured}} a two-seat cockpit as standard, upon which a single pilot and passenger could be accommodated. A range of specialised equipment could be outfitted to suit mission roles, such as stretcher carriers, spray bars, radio sets, electrical systems, additional fuel tanks, and a load-bearing hook. Akin to the later Aérospatiale Alouette II helicopter, the Djinn made considerable use of pneumatic systems. According to aerospace publication Flight International, considerable weight savings {{had been on}} the rotorcraft via the use of bleed air to operate various cockpit indicators and functions, including the blind-flying instruments, fuel gauges, <b>cabin</b> <b>heaters,</b> windshield demisters, trimmers, air/sea rescue hoists and crop-spraying equipment.|$|R

5000|$|The NEKAF jeeps {{differed}} from the US version by adding side reflectors (white in front and red at the rear), low intensity [...] "city lights" [...] on the front fenders and front and rear mounted directional signals. In a bid to reduce the costs, the Ministry of War, having invested already in clothing for the crews, ordered the <b>cabin</b> <b>heaters</b> to be deleted. This modification entailed considerable redesign of the engine cooling unit which eventually led to increased cost of the vehicles (some 12,000 Dutch Florins each). The jeeps, dubbed NEKAF by the military, started to enter service in 1956 and remained so well into the 1990s albeit on reservist duties. The NEKAF jeep saw action in the brief Dutch Indonesian war in 1962, but particularly during the UNIFIL operation in which an armoured infantry battalion participated from 1979 till 1983, the NEKAF {{turned out to be}} a robust and reliable vehicle in South Lebanon. Upon withdrawal of the Dutch battalion all UNIFIL NEKAFs were dismantled and sold locally as scrap, save three NEKAFs that were secretly withheld and privately driven back to the Netherlands. One of these sole surviving UNIFIL NEKAFs is now in the collection of the Legermuseum Delft (the Dutch Army Museum).|$|R
50|$|Engines that do {{not have}} a water cooling system cannot heat the <b>cabin</b> via a <b>heater</b> core; one {{alternative}} is to guide air around the (very hot) engine exhaust manifold and then into the vehicle's interior. Temperature control is achieved by mixing with unheated outside air. Air-cooled Volkswagen engines use this method. Depending on the design, this can cause a safety issue where a leak in the exhaust system will begin to fill the passenger cabin with deadly fumes.|$|R

50|$|The {{cause of}} both the Bryce Canyon crash and the near-fatal Gallup {{incident}} was eventually traced to a design flaw. A <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> intake scoop was positioned {{too close to the}} number 3 alternate tank air vent. If flightcrews allowed a tank to be overfilled during a routine fuel transfer between wing tanks, it could lead to several gallons of excess fuel flowing out of the tank vent and then being sucked into the <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> system, which then ignited the fuel. This caused the fire which destroyed the United aircraft at Bryce Canyon and severely damaged the American aircraft that landed in flames at Gallup.|$|E

50|$|Possible incapacitation of crew by carbon {{monoxide}} emanating from a faulty <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> was speculated upon based on recovery crew observations that crew bodies appeared 'discolored.'

5000|$|The type of First-Class stateroom that predominated was {{a single}} or double berth stateroom which {{contained}} a dressing table, horsehair sofa, wardrobe, and marble-topped washstand with basin. Double berth cabins had [...] "tipped" [...] washbasins on shelves that could be folded back into the cabinet to save room. Many also had additional bunks suspended over the main bed that could be folded against the wall. Staterooms increased in size thereafter with double beds, built-in wardrobes, and comfortable seating areas. Single berth state rooms, like those on A-Deck, were decorated more modestly than the lavish period suites on B and C-Decks. Above most beds was an electrical outlet with a call button that could summon a steward, a reading lamp and a wire-mesh basket for storing small items. Although the Titanic was centrally heated, all First-Class <b>cabins</b> contained electric <b>heaters</b> to provide additional warmth and passengers could get electric bed warmers on request to a steward.|$|R
50|$|Cars sold from 1952 also {{featured}} a fuel-based passenger <b>cabin</b> <b>heater.</b> In order to ignite the heater {{it was necessary}} first to open a small tap in the engine bay, after which the flow of hot air could be regulated using a control in the footwell on the passenger's side.|$|E

50|$|Walruses {{also found}} civil and {{commercial}} use. They were briefly {{used by a}} whaling company, United Whalers. Operating in the Antarctic, they were launched from the factory ship FF Balaena, which had been equipped with a surplus navy aircraft catapult. The aircraft used were slightly modified; they were fitted with electrical sockets to power the electrically heated suits, worn by the crew under their immersion suits. A small, petrol-burning <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> was fitted {{to help keep the}} crews comfortable during flights that could last over five hours.|$|E
5000|$|Reports vary as {{to whether}} or not the plane was on fire before it crashed. According to witnesses, the plane {{appeared}} to be on fire before it crash-landed. However, Jim Burnett, then-chairman of the NTSB, said that even though the plane was filled with smoke, it landed and came to a stop before it was swallowed by flames. The NTSB conducted a year-long investigation and finally concluded that, while a definite cause was still unknown, the crash was probably due to a fire that was caused by the plane's <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> [...] "acting up".|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{aircraft}} was robust, with an airframe fatigue life of 7,200 hours, the cockpit ergonomics were less than perfect. An example of this was the <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> switch being mounted next to the fuel cock. Unfortunately, {{this led to the}} loss of at least four aircraft when the pilot inadvertently closed the fuel cock instead of switching off the <b>cabin</b> <b>heater,</b> causing the engine to shut down. The autorotational qualities of the Scout have also been described by some pilots as 'startling'. In service trials and testing were carried out by the AAC's Development Wing at Middle Wallop, Hampshire. A wide variety of weapons and equipment were evaluated, although many were never adopted. Amongst these were the 7.62mm General Electric Minigun and the two-inch rocket pod. The rocket pods were mounted either side of the central fuselage section on the multi-spar weapon booms and both smooth tube and fin-stabilised rockets were tested, although the accuracy was described as [...] "indifferent". Studies were also carried out for a pintle-mounted M2 Browning machine gun in place of the standard 7.62 GPMG, and the French AME.621 20mm cannon. Another was the installation of a Bendix R.100 lightweight weather and ground-mapping radar, which had a range of eight and forty miles. This was mounted behind the fibreglass nose access panel along with a small viewing screen in the cockpit. The radar antenna was moved further forward later in the development to improve downward scanning.|$|E
50|$|The car had {{hydraulic}} {{drum brakes}} {{on all four}} wheels. Suspension was a unique single double-mounted leafspring—which acts as a stabilizer—between the front wheels coupled to gas-charged shock absorbers, and an independent coil-over-shock absorber setup coupled to semi-trailing arms at the rear. All 600 models had 3-synchro (no synchro on 1st) 4-speed transaxles. Unlike the Volkswagen Beetle or Fiat 500, the Fiat 600 is water-cooled with an ample <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> and, while cooling is generally adequate, for high-power modified versions a front-mounted radiator or oil cooler is needed to complement the rear-mounted radiator. All models of the 600 had generators with mechanical external regulators.|$|E
50|$|The all-wood wing {{was built}} as a {{one-piece}} structure and was not divided into separate construction sections. It {{was made up of}} two main spars, spruce and plywood compression ribs, stringers, and a plywood covering. The outer plywood skin was covered and doped like the fuselage. The wing was installed into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the <b>cabin</b> <b>heater.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{examination}} {{indicated that}} a fire had originated {{on the right side}} of the aft cabin area at or near the floorline. Some reports said the passengers were killed when the aircraft struck obstacles during the forced landing. The ignition and fuel sources of the fire could not be determined. According to another report, the pilot indicated that the crew repeatedly tried to turn on the gasoline <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> shortly before the fire occurred, but that it failed to respond. After the fire, the access panel to the heater compartment was found unlatched. The theory is supported by records that showed that DC-3s in general, and this aircraft in particular, had a history of problems with the cabin heaters.|$|E

After more detailed scenes of its assembly, the completed fuselage is shown being removed from the jig.|$|E
5000|$|When {{questioned}} by the NTSB, pilots Brad Rank and Ken Ferguson had different accounts of key events. According to co-pilot Ferguson, the <b>cabin</b> <b>heater</b> was acting up after the plane took off. Ferguson continued that Rank kept going {{to the back of}} the plane to see if he could get the heater to function correctly and that Rank told Ferguson several times to turn the heater back on. [...] "One of the times, I refused to turn it on," [...] said Ferguson. He continued, [...] "I was getting more nervous. I didn't think we should be messing with that heater en route." [...] After the plane crashed, Ferguson and Rank climbed out the cockpit windows, suffering from extensive burns. They shouted to the passenger cabin, but there was no response. Ferguson and Rank backed away from the plane, fearing explosion. Ferguson stated that Rank told him, [...] "Don't tell anyone about the heater, don't tell anyone about the heater." ...|$|E
