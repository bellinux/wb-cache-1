The study is aimed at identification of novel benzylaminochalcones capable of blocking acetylcholinesterase activity for further development of an approach to Alzheimer’s disease treatment. These compounds were produced in moderate to good yields via Claisen-Schmidt condensation and subjected to an in vitro acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay, using Ellman’s method.

In this project, two series of bis-chalcone compounds have been synthesized through Claisen-Schmidt condensation by reacting terephthaldehyde or 2, 5 -dimethoxyterephthaldehyde with the respective R-acetophenone [where R = H (1 a and 2 a) and ortho-hydroxy (1 b and 2 b) ] in 1 [*]:[*] 2 mole ratio. The presence of a methoxy (OMe) substituent on the central phenyl ring of bis-chalcone has weakened the C=C bond at the α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety of 2 a and 2 b. Interestingly, the OMe group has improved the emission efficiency of the bis-chalcone; that is, the quantum yield of 1 a in DCM solution was not able to be determined due to poor luminescence, but the quantum yield of 2 a in DCM solution was improved to 0. 57.

They possess wide range of biological properties such as; anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, antiinflammatory, anti-angiogenic. In addition, chalcone boronic acid derivatives have been tested for their anti-cancer properties and saccharide sensors abilities in few of the recent studies. In those studies, it is speculated that boronic acid chalcone derivatives are selectively cytotoxic against cancer cells rather than healthy cells. In the present study, synthesis of simple chalcones, derivatized by two boronic acids, and 2 -naphthyl chalcones having a single boronic acid are reported first time in literature. For this purpose different commercially available acetylphenyl boronic acid and formylphenyl boronic acid derivatives are reacted in alkaline methanol to yield diboronic acid <b>chalcone</b> <b>compounds.</b> Similarly condensation reaction of 2 -naphthaldehyde with different acetylphenyl boronic acids yielded the monoboronic acids derivatized 2 -naphthyl chalcones.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increasing}} global challenge of bacterial resistance, there exists an urgent need for the rationale development of antibacterial compounds with either novel or multiple mechanisms of action. Two chalcone-derivatives, F 1 and F 23, demonstrated MICs {{within the range of}} 16 to > 512 μg/ml against two plant pathogens (P. caratovoram and C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis) as well as important clinical bacterial species. Both compounds displayed an MIC of 32 μg/ml against quinolone-resistant S. aureus. Whilst possessing weak activities individually, each semi-synthetic agent displayed notable synergistic action with polymyxin B against S. aureus, C. violaceum, E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa, thereby recording FICs within the range of < 0. 093 to 2 that indicated the existence of synergism in some instance. These <b>chalcone</b> <b>compounds</b> applied with polymyxin B displayed a notable FICindex of < 0. 093 against the Neisseriaceae C. violaceum, and a potential noteworthy capacity to extend the spectrum of activity of the latter antibiotic to include Gram-positive S. aureus species. F 1 inhibited staphylococcal replication in broth and the combination of either of both chalcone-derivatives with polymyxin B instituted a metabolic blockage in S. aureus and other bacterial species as determined through a modified MTT reduction assay. The combined agents inflicted major disruptions to the S. aureus cytoplasmic membrane bilayer as evidenced by the release of intracellular potassium as well as the influx of Sytox Green fluorescent stain. Notable levels of cell membrane potential dissipation, leakage of intracellular potassium ions and blockage of reducing enzymes activities occurred within the first 30 minutes, well in advance of significant loss in cell viability that was recorded usually after 4 – 8 hours, suggesting these activities were prerequisites to cell death. In erythrocyte lysis assay, the synergistic combinations of 128 μg/ml of either of both chalcone derivatives with 128 μg/ml polymyxin B displayed the lowest degree of haemolysis, followed by that occurring with 32 μg/ml of the chalcone-derivatives combined with 256 μg/ml of the polypeptide antibiotic. In conclusion, further structure activity modifications aimed at improving the aqueous solubility of these chalcone-derivatives as well as the antibacterial activity recorded for certain combination concentrations of polymyxin B with either of these semi-synthetic agents may be required before considerations are made for the possibility for potential external formulations. Such preparations may include antiseptic creams, lotions, ointments, as well as aerosols that can be applied with nebulizers in targeted delivery for such cases like cystic fibrosis...|$|E

In this study, a series of forty synthetic chalcones was evaluated in vitro for their anti-inflammatory and antimycobacterial properties and in silico for pharmacokinetic parameters. Seven compounds strongly inhibited NO and PGE 2 production by LPS-stimulated macrophages through the specific inhibition of iNOS and COX- 2 expression, respectively, with compounds 4 and 5 standing out in this respect. Four of the seven most active compounds were able to inhibit production of TNF-α and IL- 1 β. Chalcones that were not toxic to cultured macrophages were tested for antimycobacterial activity.

40|$|Development {{of novel}} {{synthetic}} methodology for selective transformation of organic compounds {{is a central}} element underpinning organic synthesis with control of chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity a very high priority. Reactions which can be conducted under mild reaction conditions and, ideally in an environmentally attractive manner, are particularly advantageous. The principal objective of this thesis was to explore the synthesis, reactivity and synthetic utility {{of a series of}} α,β-thio-β-chloroenones. The stereochemical features of these transformations and the potential of this novel series of compounds in the synthesis of bioactive compounds were of particular interest. In exploring the reactivity of these compounds, the key transformations included nucleophilic additions and Stille cross-coupling at the β-carbon. Chapter 1 reviews the literature relevant to the research conducted, and focuses in particular on the synthesis of β-chloroenones and related unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The synthesis of <b>chalcone</b> <b>compounds</b> from various precursors is also discussed, with particular emphasis on the use of palladium cross-coupling reactions in the preparation of these compounds. The biological activity of chalcones is also summarised in this chapter. The second chapter delineates the stereoselective synthesis of the novel α-thio-β-chloroenones from the corresponding α-thioketones in a multistep reaction cascade initiated by a NCS-mediated chlorination. A range of both alkyl and aryl β-chloroenones were prepared in this work and the oxidation of these compounds to the corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones is also outlined. The electrophilicity of the β-carbon of the enones was examined in nucleophilic addition/substitution reactions with successful access to a variety of synthetically useful novel adducts including acetals and enaminoketones. Investigation of the synthetic potential of the Stille cross-coupling reaction with the novel α-thio-β-chloroenones was explored and provided an efficient route for the synthesis of a novel series of chalcones. Most importantly this new methodology provided a new and synthetically powerful approach for carbon-carbon bond formation at the β-carbon under mild neutral conditions. A preliminary investigation into the use of these β-chloroenones as dienophiles in Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions is also discussed in this chapter. Chapter 2 also reports the nucleophilic addition of N, O, S and C nucleophiles to previously described β-chloroacrylamides and their corresponding sulfoxide derivatives. This work builds on previous research carried out in this programme and the reactivity of these β-chloroacrylamides at the sulfide and sulfoxide level is compared. Comparison of the reactivity of the β-chloroacrylamides, in nucleophilic substitution and Stille-coupling, with that of the novel β-chloroenones is of interest. Finally, the biological activity of both the β-chloroenones and the β-chloroacrylamides in terms of cytotoxicity is summarised in Chapter 2. The final chapter, Chapter 3, details the full experimental procedures, including spectroscopic and analytical data for the compounds prepared during this research...|$|E
40|$|Estrogens in hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) decrease menopausal symptoms, but increase the risks of reproductive cancers. The beneficial effects of estrogen on peripheral tissues and the adverse proliferative effects on the uterus and mammary gland are mediated by ERalpha. Currently HRT is approved only for short-term use. Short-term HRT works for decreasing symptoms associated with menopause, however, long-term usage is needed to prevent subclinical diseases. Because estradiol-bound ERalpha is an agonist in all tissues {{there is a need}} for development of more tissue-selective estrogens that can be used for both short and long-term HRT. Chalcones display antiproliferative activity through ERbeta and may have benefits on menopause-induced hot flashes, however activity through ERalpha and their effects on both estradiol gene regulation and physiology are less known. The present study aimed at identifying a chalcone compound which could change the activity of ERalpha in the presence of estradiol as a coagonist, thereby modulating the response of ERalpha on gene regulation and increasing its tissue specificity. After screening a panel of five <b>chalcone</b> <b>compounds</b> for estrogenic activity in cells cotransfected with ERalpha and an ERE upstream of tk-luciferase, 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-trihydroxychalcone was identified as a unique ERalpha coagonist. 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC displayed no estrogenic activity on its own, but synergized the activation of the ERE in the presence of estradiol. Competitive binding assays with [3 H]-estradiol demonstrated that 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC binds to both ERalpha and ERbeta. Estradiol and SERM-induced genes, KRT- 19 and NKG 2 E, were not regulated by 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC alone. Both KRT- 19 and NKG 2 E were synergized with the combination of 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC and estradiol. Tamoxifen and raloxifene induced expression of NKG 2 E, but did not synergize the expression in the presence of estradiol. The data demonstrates that 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC behaves as a novel coagonist and not a SERM on gene regulation. A unique gene expression profile was induced in U 2 OSalpha cells treated with a combination of estradiol and 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC for 24 hours with doses that would allow binding of both ligands to ERalpha at the same time. Functional analysis utilizing the binding affinities of estradiol, 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC and another ERalpha binding chalcone, 2, 2 ', 4 '-THC, demonstrated that a heteroligand complex consisting of estradiol and 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC in ERalpha is possible. Despite the synergistic activation of estradiol regulated genes in U 2 OSalpha cells, the combination of 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC and estradiol did not induce proliferation of MCF- 7 cells. In the same cells 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC blocked estradiol-induced G 1 to S phase cell cycle transition without blocking proliferative genes regulated by estradiol. In female ovariectomized mice on a soy-free chow diet treated for four weeks (n= 5, per group), 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC did not cause uterine proliferation and blocked estradiol-induced proliferation and gene expression. Although 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC blocked estradiol gene expression in uterine tissue, it regulated and modulated estradiol-induced genes in adipose tissue. Because 2 ', 3 ', 4 '-THC displays unique coagonist activity through ERalpha without causing proliferation, it may be useful for future HRT and expanding our knowledge of ERalpha regulation and ligand interaction...|$|E

Measurement of ethanolic extract of flavonoid was done by using cellulose for TLC and n-buthanol: acetic acid: water (4 : 1 : 5) for the mobile phase and compound cluster detection using citroboric acid reagent and ammonia. Colorimetric test 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay is used to monitor the cytotoxicity effect. The screening for the compound, found in the plants was done using molecular docking. K. pandurata rhizome and P. aduncum L. leaves ethanolic extract shows a cytotoxic effect toward breast cancer cell with it’s IC 50 value as much as 66 µM and 68 µM. The cytotoxic effect is then connected to it’s result of molecular docking using ArgusLab among it’s <b>chalcone</b> <b>compound</b> in plants toward tubulin activity and estrogen receptor α. Furthermore, these docking processes were obtained the lowest scoring value in panduratin A both in tubulin and estrogen receptor α. This results were then compared with other experimental ligands, and showed that the compound interaction was stronger than the colchicine and raloxifen. This shows the probability of chalcone having more of an effect toward tubulin and estrogen receptor α in inducing cytotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Licorice is a {{traditional}} botanical medicine, and has historically been commonly prescribed in Asia to treat various diseases. Glycyrrhizin (Gc), a triterpene compound, is the most abundant phytochemical constituent of licorice. However, high intake or long-term consumption of Gc {{has been associated with}} a number of side effects, including hypertension. However, the presence of alternative bioactive compounds in licorice with anti-carcinogenic effects has long been suspected. Licochalcone A (LicoA) is a prominent member of the chalcone family and can be isolated from licorice root. To date, there have been no reported studies on the suppressive effect of LicoA against solar ultraviolet (sUV) -induced cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 expression and the potential molecular mechanisms involved. Here, we show that LicoA, a major <b>chalcone</b> <b>compound</b> of licorice, effectively inhibits sUV-induced COX- 2 expression and prostaglandin E 2 PGE 2 generation through the inhibition of activator protein 1 AP- 1 transcriptional activity, with an effect that is notably more potent than Gc. Western blotting analysis shows that LicoA suppresses sUV-induced phosphorylation of Akt/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 / 2 /p 90 ribosomal protein S 6 kinase (RSK) in HaCaT cells. Moreover, LicoA directly suppresses the activity of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1, and B-Raf, but not Raf- 1 in cell-free assays, indicating that PI 3 K, MEK 1, and B-Raf are direct molecular targets of LicoA. We also found that LicoA binds to PI 3 K and B-Raf in an ATP-competitive manner, although LicoA does not appear to compete with ATP for binding with MEK 1. Collectively, these results provide insight into the biological action of LicoA, which may have potential for development as a skin cancer chemopreventive agent...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} recent {{achievements}} {{in the search}} for new chemical compounds able to inhibit multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens. An analysis {{of the results of the}} search for new efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) for Gram-positive bacteria, which have been performed over the last decade, indicates that almost all efforts are focused on the NorA (MFS) efflux pump in S. aureus. Considering the chemical structures of the NorA EPIs that have been identified, it can be observed that the most active agents belong to the families of compounds possessing conjugated double bonds, e. g., <b>chalcones,</b> piperine-like <b>compounds,</b> N-cinnamoylphenalkylamides or citral amide derivatives.
