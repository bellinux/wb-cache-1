500|$|In {{a series}} of orchestral concerts in Berlin between 1902 and 1909, both as pianist and conductor, Busoni {{particularly}} promoted contemporary music from outside Germany (though he avoided contemporary music, except for his own, in his solo recitals). The series, which {{was held at the}} Beethovensaal (Beethoven Hall), included German premieres of music by Edward Elgar, Sibelius, César Franck, Claude Debussy, Vincent D'Indy, Carl Nielsen and Béla Bartók. The concerts also included premieres of some of Busoni's own works of the period, amongst them, in 1904, the Piano Concerto, in which he was the soloist and the conductor was Karl Muck, in 1905 his Turandot Suite, and in 1907 his Comedy Overture. Music of older masters was included, but sometimes with an unexpected twist– for example Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto with the eccentric first movement cadenza by Charles-Valentin Alkan (which includes references to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony). The concerts aroused much publicity but generated aggressive comments from critics. <b>Couling</b> suggests the programming of the concerts was [...] "generally regarded as a provocation".|$|E
500|$|A {{move into}} {{professional}} football was first considered during the 1948–49 season. Vic <b>Couling,</b> {{the president at}} the time, had applied for Headington {{to become a member}} of a new Second Division in the Southern League. Other teams that applied included Weymouth, Kettering Town and future league side Cambridge United. Although the plans were postponed, the First Division was going to be expanded by two clubs; Weymouth and Headington were elected. It was later discovered that Llanelli had just one vote fewer than Headington. [...] Oxford played its first season in the Southern League in 1949, the same year they turned professional. Former First Division forward Harry Thompson was hired as manager. In 1950, Headington United became the first professional club in Britain to install floodlights, and used them on 18 December against Banbury Spencer. They initially played in orange and blue shirts, but changed to yellow home shirts for the 1957–58 season. The reason for the change is unknown. In 1960, Headington United was renamed Oxford United, to give the club a higher profile.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Coumermycin A 1 is {{a member}} of the aminocoumarin family of antibiotics. Unlike its {{structural}} relatives, novobiocin and clorobiocin, coumermycin A 1 is a dimer built on a 3 -methyl- 2, 4 -dicarboxypyrrole scaffold and bears two decorated noviose sugar components which are the putative target binding motifs for DNA gyrase. Starting with this scaffold, we have utilized the ligase <b>CouL</b> for mono- and bisamide formation with aminocoumarins to provide substrates for the glycosyltransferase CouM. CouM was subsequently shown to catalyze mono- and bisnoviosylation of the resulting <b>CouL</b> products. CouP was shown to possess 4 ′-O-methyltransferase activity on products from tandem <b>CouL,</b> CouM assays. A fourth enzyme, NovN, the 3 ′-O-carbamoyltransferase from the novobiocin operon, was then able to carbamoylate either or both arms of the CouP product. The tandem action of <b>CouL,</b> CouM, CouP, and NovN thus generates a biscarbamoyl analogue of the pseudodimer coumermycin A 1. Starting from alternative dicarboxy scaffolds, these four enzymes can be utilized in tandem to create additional variants of dimeric aminocoumarin antibiotics. The bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase an...|$|R
