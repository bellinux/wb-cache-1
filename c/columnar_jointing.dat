5|$|Steadily {{rising sea}} levels then further {{isolated}} this little island, which is entirely of volcanic origin. It {{consists of a}} basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each {{of a series of}} equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns, a process known as <b>columnar</b> <b>jointing.</b> The columns typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar jointed sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more rapid cooling, or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of <b>columnar</b> <b>jointing</b> as they approach one another.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the <b>columnar</b> <b>jointing</b> {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
5|$|Many {{patterns}} in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns {{can be described}} by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} mudcracks, needle-like crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display <b>columnar</b> <b>jointing</b> as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.|$|E

Reported <b>columnar</b> <b>joint</b> areas in South Korea are 68, until the present time. These can be divided into five group by geography and volcanic activity. 1) The 16 <b>columnar</b> <b>joint</b> areas are distributed in Hantangang region. The 15 areas in this region are composed of basaltic lava in the Quaternary period, and the other 1 area is composed of volcanic rocks in the Cretaceous period. 2) The 18 <b>columnar</b> <b>joint</b> areas are distributed in Jeju island. Most of them are composed of basaltic lava(alkali basalt and Hawaiite), and the Sanbangsan and Baegrokdam area are composed of trachyte in the Quaternary period.

30|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{water infiltration}} along <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> {{could keep the}} growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> relatively constant with depth. Therefore, it might be plausible for {{the growth rate of}} the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> at the upper margin to be maintained throughout the tuff. If we assume that the median Peclet number of 0.3 was kept during the entire cooling, we can assume that a growth rate of 0.1302  μm/s, corresponding to the growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joint</b> in the upper colonnades at ~ 11 m depth, was kept constant throughout the upper colonnades. Then, if we also assumed that a Peclet number of 0.3 for the lower colonnades, the modified growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> that formed in the lower colonnade is taken as 0.0584  μm/s, which is comparable to the growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> of the lower colonnade as constrained by our numerical calculations (Fig.  9).|$|R
30|$|Our study {{indicates}} that the elevation-dependent distribution of <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> of colonnades in Mt. Mudeung was established by discontinuous tuff emplacements and simultaneous development of <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> in these tuff emplacements.|$|R
5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and thicken as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming <b>columnar</b> <b>jointing.</b> Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E
25|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. At least four basaltic flows {{comprise}} the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, {{some of which are}} underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation.

2500|$|The Monmouth Creek {{complex on}} the west side of the Squamish River mouth is a {{prominent}} and enigmatic edifice composed of basaltic andesite and dacite of unknown age. It may represent a group of dikes and lava domes that formed subglacially. At least four dikes protrude its summit. These form the ribs of [...] high lava spines, the tallest being The Castle, which contains horizontal and radiating columnar joints. The spines are covered by welded breccia close to their bases and <b>columnar</b> <b>jointing</b> extends into the welded sequence. The most elevated lava flows and spines are composed of dacite.|$|E
30|$|Although the scaling {{analysis}} {{described above}} implies that welded tuff in the intermediate region of Mt. Mudeung were formed during a single tuff emplacement, {{it does not}} answer whether {{the growth rate of}} the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> and the face width satisfy reasonable Peclet numbers ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 (Goehring et al., 2009). Previous studies have shown that <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> are generated when the thermal stress caused by contraction exceeds the yield strength of the solidified rock (Spry, 1962). Although the yield strength of the rock depends on temperature, composition, and grain size, it is generally accepted that <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> form when the propagating temperature field reaches the glass transition temperature of the rock. Therefore, the growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> can be estimated by evaluating the temperature field. Because the cooling of the tuff is governed by conduction and water infiltration along <b>columnar</b> <b>joints,</b> which keeps the growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> constant (Goehring et al., 2009; Grossenbacher and McDuffie, 1995), it is essential to evaluate the cooling history of the tuff. As a result, we formulated a one-dimensional numerical model with several assumptions, as described below.|$|R
30|$|Second, the U-Pb geochronology of zircons {{indicate}} that all colonnades were established ~ 85  Ma, {{except for the}} Chotdae-bong colonnades, which are dated to ~ 87  Ma. Scaling analysis and numerical calculations suggest a promising interpretation for {{the genesis of the}} <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> of the colonnades: three large explosive andesitic-dacitic eruptions lead to emplacement, cooling and welding of the Mudeungsan Tuff and the creation of large <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> in MMNG. The modeling suggests that the key feature of the formation of <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> in the welded tuff is related to the collapse of the welded tuff into the emptied magma chamber and the weathering of the circumferential rim tuff.|$|R
30|$|Fourth, striae, typical linear {{structures}} on a column face created by discontinuous cooling of the tuff emplacement, are observed {{only in the}} northern Seoseok-dae colonnades. Because water infiltration along <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> continuously removes heats, the discontinuous growth of <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> might not be developed, as assumed in our numerical experiments. It {{is also possible that}} weathering removed the striae from the column faces.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{sequence}} of rhyodacite lava flows were subsequently erupted and form the Plinth Assemblage. Mount Meager proper, a massive lava dome or volcanic plug, consists of steeply inclined flow layering {{and was the}} southern source of Plinth Assemblage lava flows and breccias. Plinth Peak was also formed during the Plinth Assemblage eruptive stage and is mostly composed of prominent columnar or partly jointed lava flows. Its north ridge and flat-topped summit contain three areas of steep flow layering and subhorizontally-oriented <b>columnar</b> <b>jointing.</b> These areas are possibly the remains of volcanic plugs or lava domes that were the northern source of Plinth Assemblage lava flows. The Mosaic Assemblage, a sparsely porphyritic plagioclase-augite-olivine basalt and trachybasalt formation, also formed during the fourth eruptive period.

2500|$|The Late Cretaceous Strand Fiord Formation is {{interpreted}} {{to represent the}} cratonward extension of the Alpha Ridge, a volcanic ridge that was active during {{the formation of the}} Amerasian Basin. The formation is part of the thick Sverdrup Basin succession and immediately precedes the final basin foundering event. The Strand Fiord volcanics are encased in marine strata and thin southward from a maximum thickness of more than [...] on northwestern Axel Heiberg to a zero edge near the southern shore of the island. Tholeiitic icelandite basalt flows are the main constituent of the formation with pyroclastic conglomerates, sandstones, mudrocks and rare coal seams are also present. The lava flows range in thickness from [...] and subaerial flows predominate. Both pahoehoe and aa lava types are common and the volcanic pile accumulated mostly by the quiet effusion of lavas. The pyroclastic lithologies become more common near the southern and eastern edges of the formation and represent lahars and beach to shallow marine reworked deposits. The formation contains flood basalts which are found on western Axel Heiberg Island at Dragon Cliffs [...] tall.

2500|$|The Milbanke Sound Group in the Kitimat Ranges {{consists}} of young lava flows and monogenetic cinder cones that were probably {{formed in the}} last 10,000years. Like Silverthrone and Franklin, {{little is known about}} the Milbanke Sound Group. As a result, its affinity also remains unclear. It may reflect a northern extension of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, but there is not enough data to support this hypothesis. Its formation might have also resulted from other tectonic processes that are currently not understood. Swindle Island contains a [...] high symmetrical cinder cone on its southern shoreline. This volcano, known as Kitasu Hill, comprises tephra and volcanic bombs. Its summit contains a volcanic crater that is breached to the east. Helmet Peak, a steep-sided cinder cone on Lake Island with an elevation of , {{consists of}} welded volcanic blocks and basaltic feeder dikes. During eruption, basaltic tuff breccia was deposited throughout Lake Island and nearby Lady Douglas Island. Lava flows on the shores of Price Island and Dufferin Island were erupted from forest-covered basalt cones, which have been reduced in size to small volcanic mounds. Basaltic lava flows on Finngal Island comprise well-developed <b>columnar</b> <b>jointing.</b> Like other volcanic deposits in the Milbanke Sound Group, very {{little is known about the}}se lava flows. Although the Milbanke Sound Group was probably formed in the last 10,000years, the exact age of the lava flows and cinder cones is unknown. It probably formed in the last 10,000years because the volcanic formations have minimal erosion, indicative of post-glacial volcanism.|$|E
30|$|Figure  9 b shows {{growth rates}} of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> {{corresponding}} to {{the upper and lower}} colonnades estimated using the 900  °C isothermal contour. Because the heat flux via conduction is large at the upper margin of the welded tuff, the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> grow faster near the margin. Furthermore, because the temperature gradient decreases with time, the growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> also decreases (from 0.1839 to 0.0317  μm/s). The decreasing growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> increased at an intermediate depth of the tuff (e.g., 0.0317  μm/s at a depth of 87.5  m to 0.0666  μm/s at a depth of 116.6  m in the upper colonnade). The style of the growth rate is similar to the style of the cooling rate because the growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> is proportional to the cooling rate. The corresponding Peclet numbers for the upper and lower colonnades vary with the growth rate (e.g., 0.424, 0.073, and 0.153 at the margin (0  m depth), 87.5  m depth, and 116  m depth, respectively). Our numerical experiment confirmed that the ratio of the upper to lower colonnades was ~ 6 : 4, which is consistent with a previous study (Grossenbacher and McDuffie, 1995).|$|R
40|$|AbstractColumnar jointed basalt, {{with a lot}} of small-spacing {{structural}} {{planes and}} poor integrity, is a kind of fractured rock mass. Through comprehensive study of <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> shape, roughness of fracture surface and chemical composition of basalt, it is known that <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> of Baihetan dam area were formed as a result of cooling and shrinkage effects of magma. The columnar jointed basalt is mainly formed through chemical reaction of chlorite, kaolinite, epidote and tremolite, and the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> mainly consist of chlorite according to slice identification and chemical analysis. Test results show that the columnar jointed basalt has high uniaxial compressive strength, low friction coefficient, and high cohesion, shear strength and deformation index. Meanwhile, the columnar jointed basalt is closely locked, and joint surfaces are well closed. The permeability of the rock is quite weak, and the P-wave velocity in the rock could get up to 5 000 m/s. All these show good rock properties. The <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> develop regularly, different from the general fractured rock masses. In summary, the columnar jointed basalt can be used directly as a foundation of dam...|$|R

30|$|First, {{we assumed}} that heat {{transfer}} in the cooling tuff is governed only by conduction. However, because water infiltration along <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> effectively transfers heats from the deeper column to the margin, {{the growth rate of}} the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> might be almost constant regardless of depth; therefore, the face width is also kept constant. Field observations show that the joint spacing (face width) of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> of colonnades in Mt. Mudeung is fairly constant along the extents; therefore, water infiltration effectively transfers the internal heat of the colonnades along <b>columnar</b> <b>joints.</b> To consider the effect of water infiltration, {{we assumed that}} the propagation rate of the temperature field in the early cooling stage represents the effective cooling rate maintained throughout the colonnades. Second, we neglected the discontinuous growth of <b>columnar</b> <b>joints,</b> which are expressed as straie, by assuming that the joint spacing grows constantly. Third, we assumed that deformation was occurring because the emplacement of the tuff was negligible, as evidenced by the minimal internal flow structure, high viscosity of the dacitic tuff, and a paucity of linear fractures caused by tuff flow that was demonstrated by field works (Lodge and Lescinsky, 2009 a, b; Park et al., 2005). Fourth, we assumed that thermodynamic parameters such as thermal conductivity and heat capacity do not depend on temperature and pressure. Finally, we assumed that heat transfers only vertically along the welded tuff and that no lateral heat transfer occurs; one-dimensional heat conduction along the welded tuff was used to evaluate the Peclet numbers of the welded tuff.|$|R

30|$|However, it is {{not clear}} whether the extents and face widths of colonnades are {{reasonably}} correlated, especially whether the face widths of the upper and lower colonnades from 850 to 1100 masl are consistent with the extent of the observed colonnades. If face widths and growth rates are correlated, the growth rate of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> of the colonnades should be consistent with the larger face widths. Therefore, we conducted a scaling analysis and ran simple numerical models that evaluated the relationship between the thicknesses of the tuff and the face width (or growth rate) of the <b>columnar</b> <b>joints</b> of the colonnades.|$|R
