For example, in August and September 1992, while taking air {{emission}} readings, Chemetco was caught using semi-articulated trucks and water sprinklers as a buffer in front of the air emission monitors.

5|$|The {{actions of}} Định {{in the wake}} of the Treaty of Saigon have long been a subject of conjecture. At the time, the French {{military}} accused Huế of surreptitiously supporting Định in <b>contravention</b> of the treaty, while Huế denied this, publicly claiming that Định's actions in resisting the French would be counterproductive in attempting to maintain Vietnamese sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|A <b>contravention</b> of the {{regulations}} renders speakers and organizers of demonstrations liable to fines of up to $10,000, or incarceration of up to six months. The penalty for displaying anything violent, lewd or obscene at a demonstration is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or, on a subsequent conviction, $5,000.

5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in <b>contravention</b> of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in <b>contravention</b> of the offence mentioned above.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the start}} of a barren month for Brown, who passed 30 only once in 11 {{first-class}} innings, totalling 171 runs at 15.55. He ended the unproductive sequence with an unbeaten 100 against Nottinghamshire. This came after Bill Voce had bowled Bodyline {{at the start of the}} Australian innings, in <b>contravention</b> of a prior agreement. After an Australian protest, Voce missed the remainder of the match and Brown's innings was punctuated by angry heckling by the local supporters.|$|E

In 1763, Member of Parliament John Wilkes was arrested for writing an inflammatory pamphlet, No. 45, 23 April 1763; he cited Magna Carta continually. Lord Camden denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a <b>contravention</b> of Magna Carta. Thomas Paine, in his Rights of Man, would disregard Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights {{on the grounds that}} they were not a written constitution devised by elected representatives.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{to ensure}} that an {{entertainment}} or exhibition is not detrimental to the public interest, the Minister can impose conditions relating to the holding of the event on its promoter, every person involved in its promotion, and the proprietor of the premises on which the event is to be held. Failure to comply with any of such conditions is an offence, unless the person involved is able to show {{he or she was}} not responsible for the breach and exercised due care and caution. The authorities are empowered to close an entertainment or exhibition operated in breach of any condition, or kept open in <b>contravention</b> of an order by the Minister.|$|E

He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement his small salary as a federal judge. This allowed him to keep his personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In <b>contravention</b> to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E

5|$|As bishop, de Gray {{settled a}} long-running {{dispute between the}} monks of his cathedral chapter and his {{predecessors}} as bishop. He also allowed the monks of his cathedral chapter the right to appoint and replace the clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral. De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some secular clergy, in <b>contravention</b> of canon law. In more secular matters, he granted the town of Bishop's Lynn (now King's Lynn) the right to hold a weekly market and two fairs per year. He also built a palace at Gaywood.|$|E

As they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed that the Palestinian police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the Israeli army, which had been called to extract the others.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester {{and one of}} the king's main supporters, had {{recently}} been appointed papal legate. Henry objected to Stephen's actions in arresting the bishops and confiscating their property, as they were in <b>contravention</b> of canon law. Henry called a legatine council, a church council convened by a papal legate, at Winchester to discuss the issue, which ended in nothing being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support. Alexander did not attend the council of Winchester, but his uncle did. He seems to have borne Stephen no ill will over the arrest, and worked with the king during Stephen's later reign.|$|E

His 29-year-old nephew Khalid bin Bargash, who was suspected {{by some of}} his assassination, moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in <b>contravention</b> of the treaty agreed with Ali. The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them. Khalid was warned by the consul and diplomatic agent to Zanzibar, Basil Cave, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions. This course of action had proved successful three years earlier when Khalid had tried to claim the sultanate {{after the death of}} Ali, and the British consul-general, Rennell Rodd, had persuaded him of the dangers of such an action.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Helmand Province {{incident}} was the manslaughter of an injured Taliban insurgent by Alexander Blackman, which occurred on 15 September 2011. Three Royal Marines, known during their trial as Marines A, B, and C, were anonymously tried by court-martial. On 8 November 2013, Marines B and C were acquitted, but Marine A was initially {{found guilty of}} murder of the Afghan combatant, in <b>contravention</b> of section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. This made him the first British soldier to be convicted of a battlefield murder whilst serving abroad since the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, {{upon the}} remittal {{of the case}} to the full bench of the Federal Court.

It {{was the first time in}} over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged <b>contravention</b> of Section46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections46 and 47 of the TPA, but left it to the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties. Baxter was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.|$|E

Since the advent of decriminalised parking enforcement, they have largely replaced traffic wardens as the primary enforcers of parking regulations. They {{have the power to}} issue penalty charge notices (PCNs) for parking <b>contraventions</b> dealt with by ss.63-79 Road Traffic Act 1991; in areas where their duties have been extended beyond that of a parking attendant they can also issue PCNs for parking offences coming under other legislation such as e.g. parking a vehicle entirely on a footway or the parking of a detached vehicle trailer or skip.|$|R
