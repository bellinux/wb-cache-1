[...] Still, even with Zhu's aid, it took Luo half a year to quell all of the mutinies. [...] During that period, with the Xuanwu army present and Luo forced to supply it well, the Tianxiong supplies were exhausted. [...] It was aid that the destruction of the headquarters guard corps ended much of the threat against Luo's rule, but the fighting abilities of the Tianxiong army was thereafter permanently damaged.

40|$|We {{study the}} Maurer-Cartan {{equation}} of the pre-Lie algebra of graphs controlling the deformation theory of associative algebras. We prove {{that there is}} a canonical solution (choice independent) within the class of graphs without <b>circuits,</b> <b>i.</b> e. {{at the level of the}} free operad, without imposing the Jacobi identity. The proof is a consequence of the unique factorization property of the pre-Lie algebra of graphs (tree operad), where composition is the insertion of graphs. The restriction to graphs without <b>circuits,</b> <b>i.</b> e. at “tree level”, accounts for the interpretation as a semi-classical solution.

He went up upon that business only, {{as a member of the}} Committee of Circuit, for which business he was, like other members of the Committee of Circuit, amply paid, in addition to his emoluments as Governor, which amounted to about 30,000l. a year. Not satisfied with those emoluments, and without incurring new known expense of any kind or sort, he was paid for the extra expenses of his journey, as appears in your minutes, like other members of the Committee of Circuit. In fact, he was on no visit there at all.

60|$|DEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 16th June was {{received}} {{only a day}} or two since. It was not mailed at Louisville till the 25th. You speak of the great time that has elapsed since I wrote you. Let me explain that. Your letter reached here {{a day or two}} after I started on the <b>circuit.</b> <b>I</b> was gone five or six weeks, so that I got the letters only a few weeks before Butler started to your country. I thought it scarcely worth while to write you the news which he could and would tell you more in detail. On his return he told me you would write me soon, and so I waited for your letter. As to my having been displeased with your advice, surely you know better than that. I know you do, and therefore will not labor to convince you. True, that subject is painful to me; but it is not your silence, or the silence of all the world, that can make me forget it. I acknowledge the correctness of your advice too; but before I resolve to do the one thing or the other, I must gain my confidence in my own ability to keep my resolves when they are made. In that ability you know I once prided myself as the only or chief gem of my character; that gem I lost--how and where you know too well. I have not yet regained it; and until I do, I cannot trust myself in any matter of much importance. I believe now that had you understood my case at the time as well as I understand yours afterward, by the aid you would have given me I should have sailed through clear, but that does not now afford me sufficient confidence to begin that or the like of that again.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Furnival practised at {{the common}} law bar, and early in life had {{attached}} himself to the home <b>circuit.</b> <b>I</b> cannot say why he obtained no great success till he was nearer fifty than forty years of age. At that time I fancy that barristers {{did not come to}} their prime till a period of life at which other men are supposed to be in their decadence. Nevertheless, he had married on nothing, and had kept the wolf from the door. To do this he had been constant at his work in season and out of season, during the long hours of day and the long hours of night. Throughout his term times he had toiled in court, and during the vacations he had toiled out of court. He had reported volumes of cases, having been himself his own short-hand writer,--as it is well known to most young lawyers, who as a rule always fill an upper shelf in their law libraries with Furnival and Staples' seventeen volumes in calf. He had worked for the booksellers, and for the newspapers, and for the attorneys,--always working, however, with reference to the law; and though he had worked for years with the lowest pay, no man had heard him complain. That no woman had heard him do so, I will not say; as it is more than probable that into the sympathising ears of Mrs. Furnival he did pour forth plaints as to the small wages which the legal world meted out to him in return for his labours. He was a constant, hard, patient man, and at last there came to him the full reward of all his industry. What was the special case by which Mr. Furnival obtained his great success no man could say. In all probability there was no special case. Gradually it began to be understood that he was a safe man, understanding his trade, true to his clients, and very damaging as an opponent. Legal gentlemen are, I believe, quite as often bought off as bought up. Sir Richard and Mr. Furnival could not both be required on the same side, seeing what a tower of strength each was in himself; but then Sir Richard would be absolutely neutralized if Mr. Furnival were employed on the other side. This is a system well understood by attorneys, and {{has been found to be}} extremely lucrative by gentlemen leading at the bar.|$|E
