5|$|Nighthawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. Each train has six cars that have four seats {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 24 riders. Riders are restrained by an over the shoulder restraint and a lap bar. Riders <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the over the shoulder restraint but a ride operator will push down the lap bar. While in the station, the trains will recline back to the laying down position.|$|E
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E

500|$|The third track, [...] "Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through", is {{a prayer}} to rock music, celebrating {{how it is}} always there to help you through troubled times. One of its lyrics is [...] "You're never alone, 'cause you <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the 'phones and let the drummer tell your heart what to do." [...] The fourth track also has dark overtones. [...] "It Just Won't Quit", Steinman explains, [...] "is {{about the fact that}} there are some things you never shake off... That's love, I guess." [...] "Out of the Frying Pan (And into the Fire)" [...] is a more upbeat song.|$|E

Hilary brings Leroy home, {{much to the}} shock of her father and stepmother. Ralph's young sister is attacked by a junkie and Ralph lashes out at his mother's attempts to comfort the child by taking her to the local Catholic church, instead of to a doctor. Doris begins to question her Jewish upbringing, changing her name to [...] "Dominique DuPont" [...] and straining the relationship with her mother. During a late-night showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show at the 8th Street Playhouse, Ralph encourages Doris to smoke marijuana. Intoxicated, Doris takes part in the stage show during the film's [...] "Time Warp" [...] musical number. The next day, she realizes that as an actress she <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> any personality she wants, but is sobered upon running into Michael, who is struggling as an actor and waiting tables.|$|E

500|$|Lamb of God's Chris Adler said: [...] "If {{anybody who}} plays heavy metal {{says that they}} weren't {{influenced}} by Black Sabbath's music, then I think that they're lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did." [...] Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: [...] "They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath {{are in the same}} league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary." [...] On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: [...] "The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come." [...] Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that [...] "Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre".|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 775 people {{attended}} No Surrender. Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett rated the entire event an 8 out of 10, which was equal with the 8 of 10 {{given to the}} 2006 No Surrender by Clevett. No Surrender's rating was higher than TNA's previous event Slammiversary, which was given a 7 out of 10 by Clevett. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's The Great American Bash PPV event held on July24, No Surrender was rated higher, as Bob Kapur gave The Great American Bash a 5 out of 10. Clevett felt that No Surrender proved that [...] "when everything clicks they [...] <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a fantastic show that gives fans their money's worth." [...] A.J. Styles versus Sean Waltman, Samoa Joe versus Chris Sabin, and the X Division Championship match were signaled out by Clevett as three [...] "fantastic matches on a solid undercard." [...] Clevett gave his highest match rating of 9 out of 10 in his review to the Joe versus Sabin bout. He gave his lowest rating of 3 out of 10 to the Tag Team Street Fight. The main event, Styles versus Waltman, and the X Division Championship matches were all given an 8 out of 10 by Clevett. Regarding the Dog Collar match, Clevett {{thought it was a}} [...] "bloody and violent encounter, as one would expect with those two in the ring." [...] When commenting on the Styles versus Waltman encounter, Clevett thought it [...] "was undoubtable Waltman's best match in years".|$|E

But in the end we'll be under 50. We'll be one disc." [...] Meyer also spoke {{of what it is}} like to work with the PlayStation platform stating [...] "I think it really helps. It's not even about sales. It's about what we can push on the platform and how far we can take it. I'm sure you'll hear this from every other Sony developer but you know, I can't tell you how much we've been able to optimise Cell and you know, the amount of content we <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> Blu-ray." ...|$|E

Umaga also led the All Blacks to their second Northern Hemisphere Grand Slam. After playing 74 test matches for his country Tana Umaga confirmed his retirement from international rugby {{at a press conference}} on 10 January 2006. His main reason for retiring was {{to spend more time with}} his family as he had just had another child with his wife Rochelle. Tana Umaga's announcement led to Richie McCaw succeeding him as captain. Umaga gave the All Blacks shirt he wore in his final game to Sonny Bill Williams, who stated afterwards: [...] "Just getting that jersey gave me butterflies.

2500|$|Happy Together {{tells the}} story of a couple (Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Leslie Cheung) who travel to Buenos Aires in an effort to save their relationship. Wong decided to change the {{structure}} and style from his previous films, as he felt he had become predictable. Teo, Brunette, and Jeremy Tambling all see Happy Together as a marked change from his earlier work: the story is more linear and understandable, there are only three characters (with no women at all), and while it still has Doyle's [...] "exuberant" [...] photography it is more stylistically restrained. After a difficult production period – where a six-week shoot was dragged out to four months – the film was released in May 1997 to great critical acclaim. It competed for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, where Wong became Hong Kong's first winner of the Best Director Award (an achievement he downplayed: [...] "it makes no difference, it’s just something you <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> an ad.") ...|$|E
