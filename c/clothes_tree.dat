2500|$|Nayral himself celebrated this {{collaborative}} process in his {{preface to the}} Cubist exhibition held at the Galerie Dalmau in Barcelona, April - May 1912 (the second Cubist manifestation held outside of Paris): 'You see a portrait in a landscape' wrote Nayral, 'is it simply the reproduction of some lines that permit our eye to recognize a head, <b>clothes,</b> <b>trees?</b> Photography would be sufficient'. Nayral answers the query: 'a thinking human {{in harmony with the}} surroundings, in accordance with them', one must 'reveal the concert of all these forms of life that are the thought of this man, the perfume of this flower, the brilliance of this plant, the vibration of this light, this is the task of the artist'. In essence, write Antliff and Leighten in Cubism and Culture, [...] "this synthetic vision was the product of Gleizes's sympathetic response to the expressive acts and physiognomic traits he deemed indicative of the poet's character. Both form and content in the work were the result of Gleizes's mental associations while working from memory.|$|R
50|$|Sannyasins {{will wear}} red. There {{will be many}} false religions, and many will profess false {{knowledge}} to earn their livelihood. Life will be short and miserable. Marriage will be for pleasure alone. Being dry of water {{will be the only}} definition of land, and any hard to reach water will define a pilgrimage destination. People will hide in valleys between mountains, and suffering from cold and exposure, people will wear <b>clothes</b> of <b>tree</b> bark and leaves. People will live less than twenty-three years and the pretense of greatness will be the proof of it. Ultimately, humankind will be destroyed.|$|R
25|$|There {{are cases}} of young {{children}} playing (on or near bunk beds, <b>trees,</b> <b>clothes</b> lines, play equipment etc.) suffering death or severe brain damage {{as a result of}} hanging by the straps of their bicycle helmets. European Standard EN 1080, which uses a weak retention system designed to open under load, was published in 1997 to address this problem.|$|R

The two-story school building is constructed of wood and {{can be seen in the}} background. The children are in a group in the foreground on the side of a hill. Most are wearing light-colored <b>clothes.</b> Several bare <b>trees</b> can be seen in the background at left...|$|R

The men in the center are wearing semi-formal suits and the rest are dressed in rugged <b>clothes.</b> The giant <b>tree</b> sits directly behind them while branches and thick vegetation surrounds the site. Additional trees are partially visible in the background. Photoprint reads: "An Oregon Fir Tree(?) 25 ft in diameter at base 300 ft high"...|$|R
50|$|They walk {{to school}} and get {{thrown out of the}} {{classroom}} due to their smell. Then, being free from school, the gang goes to see a movie called Don't Open That Door at the theater. The movie-house cashier notices their smell, but they head into the auditorium. Then even the actors on the screen cannot stand the smell and stop performing. They finally get removed from the theater and remove their <b>clothes</b> behind a <b>tree.</b>|$|R

[...] European Standard EN 1080, which uses a weak retention system designed to open under load, was published in 1997 to address this problem.Such helmets are not intended for use anywhere motor vehicles are present. To avoid serious accidents, parents and carers should take care to ensure that children do not wear bicycle helmets during unsupervised play, or when using climbing equipment.|$|R
25|$|Widows and widowers {{observed}} {{three days}} of fasting and silence, wherein they did not bathe or comb their hair, and may even shave their hair and eyebrows as a special sign of grief. They abstained from eating cooked food until the mourning period ended. In {{the case of the}} death of a datu, his wives, or children: the community was placed under strict mourning requirement called the pumaraw where no one was to wear colored <b>clothes,</b> climb coconut <b>trees,</b> or fish in certain streams; and spears were to be carried point down and side arms blade up. A mournful silence was to be conserved, and families could be enslaved as punishment for breaking the mourning interdict.|$|R
40|$|Working with {{concepts}} from Foucault and Deleuze I analyze how {{the youngest}} children relate to matter {{and the environment}} around them in a preschool context. The children are always connected to space, time and place and here I analyze how space, time and place {{are linked to the}} body in an epistemological and ontological sense. I research the daily life in preschools, analyzing early childhood spaces in an environment comprising water, sand, spades, leaves, <b>trees,</b> <b>clothes,</b> buildings, other bodies, etc. These relate further to how movements are situated, not only in language, but in bodily practices. From this angle I also make my selves as a researcher visible both during my fieldwork and in the writings. </p...|$|R

40|$|Treatments in Nestorians, {{which were}} one of the Christian {{societies}} in middle east in 19 th century, heavily depends on public medicine. Introduction of modern medicine into the society dates back arrival of missionaries in the area. Up to the mentioned era they expected treatment from crones and churches. Although, with the introduction of Christianity, the charm was forbidden in the Nestorian society, it continued for such matters as love, economy and future. Besides charm, belief in evil eye was common. Individuals with color eye fair complexion were considered demonic. They used to tie <b>clothes</b> to the <b>trees,</b> pass through hollow stones, offer churches votives and cast lots so that their wishes would realize. As superstitions, they interpreted syrigmus and twitching in many ways...|$|R
50|$|Some {{villages and}} hamlets in Serbia also observe a festival commemorating a {{disaster}} that has befallen the settlement, {{such as a}} flood, fire, or lightning strike. The festival is called the zavetina, the name being derived from the noun zavet, meaning vow. The service on the zavetina may {{be held in the}} shelter of the zapis. In settlements without a church, ceremonies such as weddings and baptisms were conducted under the crown of the zapis. People with health problems used to leave their <b>clothes</b> on the <b>tree</b> by night, believing this would help restore their health. In the regions of Pek and Zvižd, in eastern Serbia, a fire used to be built under the tree on the eve of Lent. In Gruža, money was lent under the zapis.|$|R
60|$|But {{the spot}} that entranced {{him was a}} pool {{a mile or two}} away from Apia to which in the evenings he often went to bathe. There was a little river that bubbled over the rocks in a swift stream, and then, after forming the deep pool, ran on, shallow and crystalline, past a ford made by great stones where the natives came {{sometimes}} to bathe or to wash their <b>clothes.</b> The coconut <b>trees,</b> with their frivolous elegance, grew thickly on the banks, all clad with trailing plants, and they were reflected in the green water. It was just such a scene as you might see in Devonshire among the hills, and yet with a difference, for it had a tropical richness, a passion, a scented languor which seemed to melt the heart. The water was fresh, but not cold; and it was delicious after the heat of the day. To bathe there refreshed not only the body but the soul.|$|R
50|$|In {{late summer}} 2013, TJ Maxx {{went into the}} mall where Borders was. The same year ULTA Beauty and Sports Authority went where The Movies were, and in 2014, Sbarro closed amid {{bankruptcy}} issues, while a value clothing store came in with Ms. Clothing. The Avenue and Wet Seal closed in January 2015, though Avenue never showed signs of a closeout/going out of business sign. A localized pizza place entered the mall in January 2015 in the former Sbarro's place, later {{to be known as}} Hot Slice Pizzeria, with a <b>clothes</b> store, Salt <b>Tree</b> going in a vancant lot (but left just a few weeks later along with long-time tenant RadioShack), with Planet Fitness opening later in the year (though was delayed until early 2016). June 2016 saw Sports Authority close after just 3 years due to th company going bankrupt. In March 2017, Hot Slice Pizzeria closed, with a Mexican restaurant opening just a few weeks later in the same place.|$|R
50|$|The {{magistrate}} undresses {{and hangs}} his <b>clothes</b> on a <b>tree</b> {{and goes to}} sleep in the miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes. The bodyguard comes and sees the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.|$|R
