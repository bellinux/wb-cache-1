25|$|On Saturday 19 November 2011, Youth Challenge International (YCI), in {{partnership}} with local and international organizations celebrated International Men's Day {{for the first time}} in Arusha and Morogoro, Tanzania. In Arusha, YCI, The Umoja <b>Centre,</b> <b>Support</b> for International Change, UMATI, Initiative for Youth Organization and Global Service Corps hosted the event at the Mbauda Open Market Ground. This event was aimed to promote men and boys as positive role models and to educate the community on the role of males and females in health, education, family life, violence and life choices. The event included performances, games, and educational activities. Over 500 youth and other community members came together to acknowledge the roles and responsibilities of men and boys in creating a brighter future for all Tanzanians. To celebrate the event in Morogoro, volunteers, along with partner organization Faraja Trust Fund, held a soccer tournament on with 8 local teams. To qualify to participate in the tournament each team had to come to two information sessions on male sexual and reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, gender roles and good governance. YCI and Faraja provided an on-site HIV testing centre, a DJ with music and dancing throughout the day, and drama group performances on the key objectives of International Men's Day. Plans exist for the Tanzanian Men's Rights Organisation (TAMRA) to celebrate International men's day in 2013.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{previous}} study in Amsterdam showed that combined family {{support in the}} Meeting <b>Centres</b> <b>Support</b> Programme, in which persons with dementia patients and their carers are both supported by one professional staff, is more effective in influencing behaviour problems and mood of dementia patients living in the community than non-integrated support, such as day care only. A multi-centre implementation study tests if similar effects are achieved in other regions of The Netherlands. METHODS: A pretest-posttest control group design was applied. 112 dementia patients who visited psychogeriatric day care in eight community centres {{across the country and}} in three nursing homes, and their carers participated in the study. The patients in the experimental group (n= 89) received support from the Meeting <b>Centres</b> <b>Support</b> Programme together with their carers, while the control group (n= 23) received day care only. Behaviour problems (aggressive behaviour, inactivity, non-social behaviour) and mood (dissatisfaction, depressive behaviour) were assessed using standardized observation scales. Quality of life was assessed by interviewing the patients. RESULTS: After 7 months the Meeting <b>Centres</b> <b>Support</b> Programme, compared to regular day care, showed a moderately positive effect on the degree of total behaviour problems (effect size= 0. 52), especially on inactivity (effect size= 0. 37) and non-social behaviour (effect size= 0. 60), a large effect on depressive behaviour (effect size= 0. 92) and a moderate effect on self-esteem (effect size= 0. 43). CONCLUSIONS: The Meeting <b>Centres</b> <b>Support</b> Programme proves to be more effective than regular day care in influencing behaviour problems, especially inactivity and non-social behaviour, and depressed mood. Participation in the programme also seems to {{have a positive effect on}} self-esteem, an important aspect of quality of life. These findings surpass the results of the Amsterdam study and confirm the surplus value of the Meeting <b>Centres</b> <b>Support</b> Programme as compared to regular day care for people with mild to severe dementi...|$|R

50|$|The three {{rotor blades}} were {{mounted on a}} ring {{assembly}} supported by bearings, allowing free rotation around the fuselage. At {{the end of each}} was a ramjet. To start the rotors spinning, simple rockets would have been used. As the speed increased, the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire. The pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced. There was no reaction torque to cause a counter rotation of the fuselage, since the rotor blades were driven at their tips by the ramjets. Fuel was carried in the fuselage tanks, and was piped through the <b>centre</b> <b>support</b> ring and along the rotors to the jets.|$|E
