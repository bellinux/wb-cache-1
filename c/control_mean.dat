40|$|We study control variate {{estimation}} {{where the}} <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> itself is estimated. Control variate estimation in simulation experiments can significantly increase sampling efficiency, and {{has traditionally been}} restricted to cases where the control has a known mean. In a previous paper (Schmeiser, Taaffe, and Wang (2000)), we generalized the idea of control variate estimation to the case where the <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> is only approximated. The result is a biased, but possibly useful estimator. For that case we provided a mean-square-error optimal estimator and discussed its properties. In this paper we also generalize classical control variate estimation {{to the case of}} control variates using estimated control means(CVEMs). CVEMsreplacethecontrolmeanwithanestimated value for the <b>control</b> <b>mean,</b> obtained from a prior simulation experiment. Although the resulting control-variate estimator is unbiased, it does introduce additional sampling error and so its properties {{are not the same as}} those of the standard control-variate estimator. We develop a CVEM estimator that minimizes the overall estimator variance. Both BCVs and CVEMs can be used to improve the efficiency of stochastic simulation experiments. Their main appeal is that the restriction of having to know (deterministically) the exact value of the <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> is eliminated; thus the space of possible controls is greatly increased.

40|$|Abstract Growth rate is {{the main}} {{breeding}} goal of fish breeders, but individual selection has often shown poor responses in fish species. The PROSPER method was developed to overcome possible factors that may contribute to this low success, using (1) a variable base population and high number of breeders (Ne > 100), (2) selection within groups with low non-genetic effects and (3) repeated growth challenges.

30|$|A similar {{argument}} may {{be directed}} towards {{the patterns of}} performance observed on the Crowds test. Using the original criterion of 1.96 SDs above the <b>control</b> <b>mean,</b> only one participant outperformed controls. Although the Crowds test had the greatest variability in performance of both controls and self-referred SRs, it was calibrated so that performance up to 3 SDs from the <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> could be detected (as confirmed in initial pilot-testing), and correct responses were recorded from at least some participants for every trial. It is possible that this test relies on {{a different set of}} sub-processes to the other three tests, and that successful performance relies less on the face recognition system itself. Indeed, the searching of crowds requires a range of perceptual and attentional skills that are likely not employed in face recognition tasks involving the simultaneous presentation of only two or three faces. Notably, a larger proportion of the control compared to the experimental sample performed above 1 SD from the <b>control</b> <b>mean,</b> and the top and bottom performers in the experimental group displayed varied performance on the other tests in the battery. However, given that we did not test for consistency in performance on this task, we cannot firmly reach this conclusion without further testing. Alternatively, it may be the use of composite faces that has brought about differences in performance levels.|$|E

Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is the most}} commonly seen peripheral nerve compression syndrome and CTS surgery {{is the most common}} surgery done for peripheral nerve compression syndromes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a systemic disease with a component of peripheral neuropathy. Objective. We aimed to investigate the effects of type 2 DM on functional results in type 2 DM patients who underwent carpal tunnel surgery. Methods. The study included 39 patients with carpal {{tunnel syndrome}} which was confirmed by electromyography. Twenty-one patients did not have DM, 18 patients had type 2 DM that were treated for DM and had regulated blood glucose levels. Assessments were done with the Boston scale. All operations were done by the same surgical team using the same surgical technique. Functional and symptomatic scores between the two groups were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test which is the non-parametric version of the Studentâ€™s t test, and 95 % confidence interval p< 0. 05, which is considered as statistically significant. Results. In patients with type 2 DM, preoperative mean Symptom Severity Score was 3. 6 Â± 0. 35 (2. 9 to 4. 2) in the last <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> Symptom Severity Score was 1. 2 Â± 0. 16 (1. 0 - 1. 7), and preoperative mean functional status score was 3. 3 Â± 0. 56 (2. 3 to 4. 5) and in the last <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> functional status score was 1. 3 Â± 0. 36 (1. 0 to 2. 4).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Knee {{osteoarthritis}} is {{a highly}} prevalent condition with a significant socioeconomic burden to society. It is known to effect sufferers through pain, loss of function and changes in health related quality of life. Management typically involves pharmacologic and/or exercise based therapy approaches to reduce pain. Previous studies have shown multimodal treatment approaches incorporating manual therapy to be efficacious. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine if a manual therapy technique knee protocol can alter the self reported pain experienced by a group of chronic knee osteoarthritis sufferers in a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: 43 participants with a chronic, non-progressive history of osteoarthritic knee pain, aged between 47 and 70 years were randomly allocated following a screening procedure to an intervention group (n= 26; 18 men and 8 women, mean age 56. 5 years) or a control group (n= 17; 11 men and 6 women, mean age 54. 6 years). Participants were matched for present knee pain intensity measured on a visual analogue scale. The intervention consisted of the Macquarie Injury Management Group Knee Protocol whilst the control involved a non-forceful manual contact to the knee followed by interferential therapy set at zero. Participants received three treatments per week for two consecutive weeks with a follow up immediately after the final treatment. Post-treatment Participants completed 11 questions including present knee pain intensity and feedback regarding their response to treatment utilizing a visual analogue scale. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Prior to the intervention, there was no significant differences in age or present knee pain intensity. Following treatment, the intervention group reported a significant decrease in the present pain severity (mean 1. 9) when compared to the control group (mean 3. 1). Response to treatment questions indicated that compared to the control group, the intervention group felt the intervention had helped them (intervention mean 7. 0; <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> 3. 4), felt it decreased their knee symptoms such as crepitus (intervention mean 6. 0; <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> 3. 4) and improved their knee mobility (intervention mean 6. 4; <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> 3. 4) and their ability to perform general activities (intervention mean 6. 5; <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> 3. 8). Importantly the MIMG Knee Protocol intervention group reported no adverse reactions during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term manual therapy knee protocol significantly reduced pain suffered by participants with osteoarthritic knee pain and resulted in improvements in self-reported knee function immediately after the end of the 2 week treatment period. 14 page(s...|$|E
