5|$|The <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribunals</b> were {{initially}} {{housed in a}} building in Birgu. After the Order moved their headquarters to Valletta, a new Castellania {{was built in the}} new capital. Meanwhile, the original Castellania in Birgu was converted into the Inquisitor's Palace in 1574. The building of a Castellania was made in the original plans of Valletta. One of the plans for the Castellania was also to be built within the reserved area of the auberges of the knights, known as the Collacchio, but limiting access to a vast area in Valletta was found to be unpractical and the initiative was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The first Castellania of Valletta was {{demolished}} in the mid-18th century {{on orders}} of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, as he despised its austere architecture and wanted a symbolic building of his absolutism. There are claims based on {{word of mouth}} that in the 18th century the <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribunals</b> were housed at 254, St. Paul's Street (now known as Europe House, and occupied by {{the offices of the}} European Commission and the European Parliament), plausibly between 1757 and 1760, however this is considered as a hearsay.|$|E

25|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that, {{at least since}} World War II, genocide has been illegal under customary international law as a peremptory norm, as well as under conventional international law. Acts of genocide are generally difficult to establish for prosecution, because a chain of accountability must be established. International criminal <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribunals</b> function primarily because the states involved are incapable or unwilling to prosecute crimes of this magnitude themselves.|$|E
25|$|Royal decrees are {{the other}} main source of law; but are {{referred}} to as regulations rather than laws because they are subordinate to the Sharia. Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labor, commercial and corporate law. Additionally, traditional tribal law and custom remain significant. Extra-Sharia government tribunals usually handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees. Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals is to the King and all <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribunals</b> follow Sharia rules of evidence and procedure.|$|E
25|$|Bucharest's {{judicial}} system {{is similar to}} that of the Romanian counties.

The Bucharest Court of Appeal (Curtea de Apel Bucureşti) judges appeals against decisions taken by first-instance <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribunals</b> in Bucharest and in five surrounding counties (Teleorman, Ialomița, Giurgiu, Călărași, and Ilfov).

25|$|Traditionally, a {{distinction}} was drawn between jurisdictional errors {{of law and}} non-jurisdictional errors of law. A jurisdictional error of law was committed when a public authority made a decision or took some action even though it lacked jurisdiction to do so, for example, if the process was tainted by simple ultra vires. In this event, the High Court could judicially review the matter. On the other hand, a non-jurisdictional error of law occurred when an authority was properly empowered {{to make a decision}} or take action, but it was alleged that the authority had exercised its discretion in breach of some administrative law principle. In such cases, the Court was not allowed to intervene by exercising judicial review, save in certain circumstances such as a breach of natural justice. This distinction applied both to the exercise of power by public authorities and to <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribunals.</b>|$|E
40|$|Australian <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> {{administrative}} <b>tribunals</b> {{are dependent}} upon government for funding.

25|$|Commonwealth {{authority}} and ownership.

The coat of arms should never be used where it could wrongly imply a formal guarantee, sponsorship or endorsement by the Commonwealth. Use of the arms by private citizens or organisations is rarely permitted; however, there are provisions for use by sporting bodies and in educational publications. Use of the coat of arms without permission may be in breach of Sections 53 (c) (d) and (e) of the Trade Practices Act 1974, Section 145.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 or Section 39(2) of the Trade Marks Act 1995.

500|$|On 14 August 1968 Lihau {{was named}} First President {{of the new}} Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo. He was officially {{installed}} in the position on 23 November. In his inaugural speech, Lihau requested [...] "the scrupulous respect of all the authorities of the Republic {{the status of the}} magistracy guaranteeing independence in the exercise of its functions." [...] Two years later he became editor of the new law journal La Revue Congolaise de Droit and also served as general delegate to the Office Nationale de la Recherche et du Developpement for its judicial, political, and social research division. Marcel Lihau soon adopted the name Ebua Libana la Molengo Lihau, as per the encouraged Africanisation in accordance with Mobutu's policy of Authenticité. As a judge, he believed that the term [...] "law" [...] applied [...] "not only to legislative acts, but also to regulatory acts which are at least not illegal, as well as international treaties and ratified agreements". In 1971 Lihau joined the executive committee of the state-sanctioned party, Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution (MPR). Three years later he was made a commissioner of its political bureau. That year a new constitution was promulgated that concentrated the government's authority in Mobutu as President. Lihau supported the independence of the judiciary and, despite Mobutu's centralisation, interpreted the document as only veiling such autonomy, not eliminating it. He explained that the constitution's references to the [...] "Judicial Council" [...] (a section of the MPR) in place of the previous term [...] "Judicial Power" [...] were, though obfuscating, done only for political reasons and signified no real change. He surmised, [...] "he attributions of <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>tribunals</b> have remained the same as in the past, even if the spirit in which they declare the law will necessarily be different." [...] However, this interpretation ran contrary to Mobutu's ideals. In June 1975 Lihau refused to enforce a harsh sentence levied against student protesters. He was subsequently dismissed from the Supreme Court, removed from his teaching position, and placed under house arrest.|$|E
