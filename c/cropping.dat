5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom.

This results in only a small {{proportion}} of the land area being suitable for arable <b>cropping,</b> but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast.

40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is a major}} issue in organic farming systems. Although interseeding cover <b>crops</b> is one alternative to herbicides, cover <b>crops</b> often suppress not only weeds but also main <b>crops.</b> Therefore, using cover <b>crops</b> for weed control without adverse effects on main <b>crop</b> growth is important. To verify the effect of cover <b>crops</b> on competition between main <b>crops,</b> cover <b>crops</b> and weeds in a snowy-cold region, main <b>crops</b> soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in 2005 and maize (Zea mays L.) in 2006 were grown with cover <b>crops</b> winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), respectively. The cover <b>crops</b> were sown on three sowing dates: before main <b>crop</b> planting (Pre-MC), on the same date of main <b>crop</b> planting (Syn-MC) and after main <b>crop</b> planting (Post-MC). A plot without cover <b>crops</b> (Sole-MC) was used as a control. The dry weight (DW), vegetation cover ratio (VCR), vertical community structure and chlorophyll content were measured to estimate the competition between main <b>crops,</b> cover <b>crops</b> and weeds. Weed DW was suppressed significantly by sowing cover <b>crops</b> in both soybean and maize. This weed suppression was associated with the increase of VCR of main <b>crops</b> plus cover <b>crops</b> at the early growth stage of main <b>crops.</b> Soil seed banks of dominant weed also became lower by sowing cover <b>crops,</b> implying the importance of proper weed management for suppressing weeds successively. In addition, the sowing dates of cover <b>crops</b> had large effects on main <b>crops</b> DW especially in maize, i. e., it was significantly lower in Pre-MC and Syn-MC than in Post-MC. Although the cover <b>crop</b> height was markedly shorter than the main <b>crop</b> height, the chlorophyll content of the main <b>crops</b> was significantly lower when cover <b>crops</b> were sown earlier. These results suggest that the growth inhibition of main <b>crops</b> by cover <b>crops</b> was partly caused by competition for nutrients between main <b>crops</b> and cover <b>crops,</b> and this growth inhibition was alleviated when cover <b>crops</b> were sown after the establishment of main <b>crops.</b> Consequently, soybean yield was the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 29 %, 18 % and 7 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively, and maize yield was also the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 68 %, 100 % and 24 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively. It was concluded that weeds could be controlled effectively by sowing cover <b>crops</b> after planting main <b>crops</b> in organic farming systems in a snowy-cold region...|$|R

40|$|When sown {{correctly}} at {{the right}} time, in the right position within the rotation, cover <b>crops</b> retain nutrients, conserve water, prevent soil erosion, improve soil fertility and quality, and suppress weeds. Growing cover <b>crops</b> is recognized as a climate-smart agricultural practice. Practical recommendation Where to position and when to time cover <b>crops</b> in the rotation? •	Grow cover <b>crops</b> in the 1 st and 2 nd year after ploughing of clover-grass to avoid nitrogen losses. •	Grow nitrogen fixing cover <b>crops</b> on soils with low fertility. •	Sow cover <b>crops</b> into or immediately after the main <b>crop.</b> In row <b>crops,</b> sow the cover <b>crop</b> {{in combination with the}} last hoeing. If the harvest of the main <b>crop</b> is rather early, sow the cover <b>crop</b> after harvest. •	The earlier a cover <b>crop</b> is sown in August, less nitrogen is lost. Each day of delay in sowing a cruciferous cover <b>crop</b> in August results in loss of about 2 kg of N per ha. •	Do not sow cruciferous cover <b>crops</b> into main <b>crops</b> shortly before the harvest, as weed competition may be too high for successful establishment of the cover <b>crop.</b> •	Cover <b>crops</b> sown in spring usually establish well and safely. For spring-sown cover <b>crops</b> use clover mix rather than ryegrass to satisfy nitrogen needs. •	On sandy soils with irrigation, undersow spring <b>crops</b> with wide row distances after the main <b>crop</b> has developed 1 - 2 nodes high to allow hoeing of the main <b>crop</b> in early stages. •	In winter <b>crops,</b> sow cover <b>crops</b> (clover mix rather than ryegrass) in spring as early as possible. •	Use cover <b>crops</b> after application of large amounts of solid manure, as it helps to retain the nitrogen. •	In lupines or broad beans, undersow a cover <b>crop</b> followed by a spring <b>crop</b> the next year. If a winter <b>crop</b> is chosen instead, perennial weeds might flourish. Cover <b>crops</b> and weed control •	Problems with creeping thistle, sow-thistle and coltsfoot do not rule out cover crops: Sow the cover <b>crop</b> immedia¬tely after an early harvest and ploughing.

5|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach was}} probably {{the first to be}} employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores.

5|$|A popular {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} origins of the lemuriform clade is that they evolved from European adapiforms known as adapids. In some adapids, the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional <b>cropping</b> unit, and the American paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb. However, no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil record of the Eocene, and the European adapid lower jaws from that time did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms.|$|E
5|$|However, modern {{agriculture}} seriously reduces biodiversity. Traditional {{third world}} agriculture that is best at maintaining diversity with multiple <b>cropping</b> systems such aspolyculture(includingcompanion plantingandintercropping) andagroforestrysystems such as shifting cultivation. In Latin America, between 70% and 90% of beans are grown mixed with other {{crops such as}} maize and potatoes. Worldwide, multiple <b>cropping</b> provided up to 20% of all food in 1986. Traditional systems also maintain diversity within a crop species, such as in theAndesmountains where up to 50 varieties of potato are grown.The effects of loss of biodiversity are especially noticeable in pest control. Herbivorous pest insects tend to become more abundant inmonocultures. Stable agroecosystems are biodiverse and contain sufficient numbers of natural enemies of crop pests, such asparasitoidalwasps which are able to controlaphidsandlepidopterancaterpillars. These ecosystems continuously provide food and breeding sites for these beneficial species. Agroecosystems can achieve this equilibrium by arranging a suitable combination of crops in space and time, given the type of soil and surrounding environment; sufficient abundance of non-crop plants in and around fields; and appropriate management of vegetation. Suitable farming strategies include polyculture,crop rotation, mosaics of small scattered fields and uncultivated land. Additional strategies include perennial crops such asorchards(especially if a diverse floral undergrowth is permitted), tolerating specific weed species, and raising genetic diversity such as by planting mixtures of crop varieties.|$|E
50|$|Integrating certain <b>crops,</b> {{especially}} cover <b>crops,</b> into <b>crop</b> rotations is {{of particular}} value to weed management. These <b>crops</b> crowd out weed through competition.

By removing slowing the growth and proliferation of weeds while cover <b>crops</b> are cultivated, farmers greatly reduce the presence of weeds for future <b>crops,</b> including shallow rooted and row <b>crops,</b> which are less resistant to weeds.
