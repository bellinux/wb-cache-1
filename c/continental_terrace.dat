This project investigates the role that internal waves of various frequencies might have in affecting sedimentation in these two regions. The overall long-term project goal is to determine the modes and mechanisms of transport of bottom and suspended sediment by internal waves.

40|$|The {{delimitation}} of flat surfaces, such as marine or <b>continental</b> <b>terraces,</b> can {{be easily}} done if they are wellpreserved by using classic techniques such as fieldwork and photointerpretation. However, subsequent landscapeerosion can modify their initial morphology, hindering their recognition. This paper presents a methodologydesigned to identify and delineate flat erosional surfaces (known as rasas) in a sector of 1, 228 km 2 in theCantabrian coast (eastern Asturias, N Spain). The spatial distribution of rasas was quantitatively established bycomparing the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) with previously available information about flat surfaces alreadymapped. From a lithological point of view, rasas are modelled on Ordovician quartzite (9. 7 km 2 of 1, 228) mainlybetween 132 – 232 m above sea level (a. s. l.) altitude and on Carboniferous limestone (2. 9 km 2 of 1, 228) mainlybetween 24 – 69 m a. s. l. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) combined with a quantitative analysisof the relief (using the hypsometric method) allowed us to develop a predictive approach for flat erosionalsurface detection. The methodology has been tested and validated in areas in which there were no erosionalsurfaces previously mapped. The results reveal new surfaces modelled on Ordovician quartzite (0. 43 km 2), ataltitudes ranging from 200 to 250 m, on Jurassic mixed formations (35. 9 km 2) at 150 – 175 m altitude, and onEocene limestone (1. 1 km 2) at 110 – 120 m altitude...|$|R
40|$|The northeastern {{margin of}} the African plate, in the Latakia region of {{northwest}} Syria, has an important bearing on the closure and collisional history of the Tethys Ocean in the Eastern Mediterranean region. This field-based study focuses on the Tertiary geology of the Nahr El-Kabir basin and provides new insights on the sedimentation, biochronology, structure and regional tectonics of the area. Three unconformity-bound megasequences of Late Cretaceous to Tertiary age are identified, which were strongly influenced by tectonic processes: 1. Late Maastrichtian-Mid Eocene; 2. Miocene; 3. Late Miocene (Messinian) -Late Pliocene. Megasequence 1 was initiated by a Late Maastrichtian-age marine transgression over Maastrichtian-emplaced ophiolitic rocks and melange (Baer Bassit Massif). Water depths increased in the Palaeocene, giving rise to outer-shelf-depth carbonate deposition, rich in planktic foraminifera. Marine high productivity is reflected in common diagenetic chert formation. Nummulite-rich carbonates accumulated on a shallower shelf during Early-Mid Eocene time. Shallowing of marine conditions, coupled with tectonic instability, culminated in emergence, followed by a Late Eocene-Oligocene hiatus. Megasequence 2 is spatially restricted to the Nahr El-Kabir Graben and begins with Early Miocene carbonate deposition of mainly pelagic facies. In the Middle Miocene, there was an increasing input of basin margin-derived high-density turbidites and debris flows. Minor ongoing tectonism was followed by regression during the Messinian salinity crisis. Megasequence 3 begins with the accumulation of mainly laminated gypsum, followed by gypsum debris flows and selenitic gypsum. Initial Pliocene transgression led to shallow-marine, open-shelf muddy sedimentation, shallowing up, prior to the Late Pliocene into marls and bioclastic carbonates. Late Pliocene-Quaternary time was marked by progressive uplift, marine and <b>continental</b> <b>terracing</b> and erosion. A Maastrichtian to Paleogene submerged shelf succession on the Arabian Platform culminated in a regional hiatus during the Late Eocene-Oligocene. Early Neogene rifting led to development of a transtensional basin (the Nahr El-Kabir Graben, a probable half graben). Strike-slip deformation (probably sinistral) and regional uplift followed during Late Neogene-Quaternary time. The Miocene Nahr El-Kabir Graben developed along an important, inferred, transform fault system. The resulting El-Kabir Lineament demarcates the northern {{margin of the}} African Plate (Arabian sub-plate).

It {{consists of}} a continental shelf, 16 to 35 miles wide, and a continental slope, 16 to 37 miles wide. The eastern portion of the shelf is a smooth, sediment covered area that slopes very gently west. The western portion of the shelf contains four rocky bank areas. The banks are topographically ir-regular and appear to be of structural origin. West of the banks the shelf edge occurs at depths of 71 to 90 fathoms. The continental slope extends {{from the edge of}} the shelf to the abyssal plain at depths of 1530 to 1610 fathoms. A smooth upper slope of less than three degrees extending to depths of 117 to 250 fathoms occurs north and south of Heceta Bank.

Here, a refined seismostratigraphic model for the sedimentary development of the Valentin Feilberg Terrace located in ~ 4. 1 km water depth is presented. Analyzing multichannel seismic profiles across and along this terrace, significant changes in terrace morphology and seismic reflection character are identified and interpreted to reflect variations in deep water hydrography from Late Miocene to recent times, involving variable flow of Antarctic Bottom Water and Circumpolar Deep Water. A prominent basin-wide aggradational seismic unit is interpreted to represent the Mid-Miocene climatic optimum (~ 17 – 14 Ma). A major current reorganization can be inferred for the time ~ 14 – 12 Ma when the Valentin Feilberg Terrace started growing due to the deposition of sheeted and mounded drifts. After ~ 12 Ma, bottom water flow remained vigorous at both margins of the terrace. Another intensification of bottom flow occurred at ~ 5 – 6 Ma when a mounded drift, moats, and sediment waves developed on the terrace. This may have been caused by a general change in deep water mass organization following the closure of the Panamanian gateway, and a subsequent stronger southward flow of North Atlantic Deep Water...|$|R

We aimed to identify the main larval transport/retention characteristics in the study area, which constitutes the southernmost P. monodon fishing grounds embedded in the Humboldt Current System. We hypothesized that the main contribution to population renewal originates in the two persistent adult aggregations close to the nursery ground that occurs over a <b>continental</b> shelf <b>terrace</b> limited by two submarine canyons. Two extensive bio-physical field campaigns were carried out during the main 2001 - 2002 upwelling season field data indicated that larvae were released from late austral winter to spring from spots {{to the north and}} south of the nursery. Zoea I were found mainly below 50 m depth in southward-flowing waters, whereas older zoea dominated in northward flowing layers above 50 m. Larvae were circumscribed between the coast and the shelf break front and pelagic retention areas were identified over the widest shelf area. Megalopa and juveniles during March, were only found over the nursery area. Individual based simulations coupled to the output of a hydrodynamic model (climatological configuration) for the studied area, showed that the release sites close to the nursery made the largest contribution to recruitment. Sites further north could also contribute to recruitment if hatching occurred later in the upwelling season. The contribution of vertical behavior to larval success was also important, as was the former's interaction with the site and time of larval release. Our results support the relevance of coastal circulation (affected by topography) on the persistence of P. monodon populations off southern Chile, and the modulation of temporal variability.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the two multichannel seismic reflection records P- 855 and P- 856 reveals {{the complexity of the}} tectonic structure of the Kurile margin. The absence of trench fill and the relatively constant hickness of the subducted sediments on top of the oceanic basement shows that little or no accretion is occurring at present. The lower slope is characterized by active thrusting within a small accretionary prism. The toe of the middle slope is a more consolidated unit that constitutes an efficient buttress.

40|$|Persistent geostrophic {{currents}} {{interacting with}} sea-floor topography and available sediment sources {{are capable of}} eroding, transporting and depositing fine-grained particles into mounded and elongated sediment drifts. These drifts show enhanced accumulation rates when compared to pure pelagic sequences and are thus attractive targets for high resolution paleoceanographic studies. Several expeditions of the IODP/ODP (e. g. 162, 172, 303, 306, 339, 342) therefore have successfully targeted giant contourite drifts. An unexplored area {{in this context is}} a prominent contourite depositional system (CDS) located in the southernmost sector of the extensional Argentine margin. Here the thermohaline circulation is characterized by the interaction of northwardflowing Antarctic water masses (Antarctic Intermediate Water, AAIW; Circumpolar Deep Water, CDW; Antarctic Bottom Water, AABW) and southward-flowing North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The transfer of heat and energy via these water masses constitutes an important component in maintaining the global ocean conveyor belt. We investigate an extensive set of high quality seismic reflection profiles from the Argentine continental margin to detect, characterize and map sedimentary features related to bottom current activity and to reconstruct past changes in the abyssal circulation. Typical margin-parallel morphosedimentary features such as (1) a set of four terraces on the slope and rise, (2) channels separating the terraces, (3) a giant buried sediment drift, and (4) sheeted drifts on the abyssal plain indicate that along slope (contour current) transport dominates over downslope (turbiditic) processes at the southern Argentine margin. Along the central Argentine margin the relative importance of the permanent, steady bottom currents and the shorter-duration, unsteady mass wasting processes on sediment deposition was variable in time and space. Based on a detailed investigation of a <b>continental</b> slope <b>terrace</b> at the southern margin and the mapping of depocenter geometries of four major seismic units at the central margin a chronology of the depositional processes during the Cenozoic was derived: While the Paleocene/Eocene (65 – 34 Ma) is characterized by hemipelagic sedimentation under relatively sluggish bottom water conditions, strong AABW circulation led to widespread erosion on the slope and growth of a large detached sediment drift during the Oligocene and early Miocene (34 – 17 Ma). After deposition of an aggradational seismic unit interpreted to represent low bottom current activity during the Mid-Miocene climatic optimum (17 – 14 Ma), a current reorganization through the emergence of Lower CDW took place at approx. 14 – 12 Ma when the Valentin Feilberg Terrace started growing. Current controlled sedimentation under moderate flow speed commenced at the southern Argentine margin during the middle to late Miocene (12 – 6 Ma) {{but at the same time}} gravitational down-slope sediment transport increased at the central Argentine margin possibly related to tectonic uplift in South America. The Pliocene to Holocene unit at the southern Argentine margin indicates strengthening of bottom flow after 6 Ma possibly due to a general change in deep water mass organization following the closure of the Panamanian gateway. At the central Argentine margin this unit is very heterogeneous and formed by interactions of down-slope and along-slope sediment transport processes as indicated by the evolution of canyons, slope plastered drifts and channels. The available multichannel seismic profiles constitute a high-quality site survey and the results from our project may be used as background information for future ocean drilling in the region which would reveal important aspects of the deep water history and provide better age constraints. We here suggest a transect of drill sites on <b>continental</b> slope <b>terraces</b> in different water depths at the southern Argentine margin. Inferred sedimentations rate of > 8 cm/ 1, 000 years would make these drill sites suitable for high-resolution paleoclimatic studies of the Cenozoic. ...|$|R
40|$|Deep sea {{drilling}} off {{the east}} coast of North America provided valuable information {{on the development of the}} con-tinental rise in a region that has been influenced by the deposition of both continentally derived and pelagic sediments. Site 603 is interpreted to overlie Jurassic oceanic crustal basement. Based upon the oldest sediment recovered, Site 603 was only influenced by pelagic sedimentation during the late Berriasian to Valanginian, with terrigenous sediment not appearing until the late Valanginian to Aptian. The first evidence of clastic sedimentation is the development of a large turbidite system during a time when deltas were being built on the shelf. From the Hauterivian through the Late Creta-ceous, black shale turbidites were intermittently deposited at this site. The maximum abundance of the carbonaceous clay stone occurs interbedded with red and green claystone, and some silt and sand turbidites, in the Aptian-Albian in-terval. Sea level rose during the Albian, and as a consequence redeposition of terrigenous sediment waned, then ceased. The site then dropped below the calcite compensation depth. Less extensive terrigenous turbidite deposits are found as-sociated with multicolored noncalcareous claystone that represents pelagic sedimentation during the Late Cretaceous. A turbidite containing dark green spherules of montmorillonite, and anomalously high concentrations of Ni, Co, and As, is interpreted to represent exotic sediment that was reworked from the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary sediment, based on its sedimentological and geochemical similarities to a biostratigraphically dated K/T boundary lamina cored at DSDP Hole 390 B on the Blake Plateau. Late Paleocene to early middle Eocene pelagic claystone is disconformably overlain by middle Miocene hemipelagic claystone. Turbiditic silts and clays accumulated at this site, followed by the de-velopment of the lower continental rise hills of the Hatteras Outer Ridge.

40|$|Sedimentary {{processes}} in the Argentine Basin and particularly on the Argentine margin are largely controlled by {{the interaction of the}} seafloor with the abyssal circulation which is characterised by the interaction of northward flowing Antarctic water masses (Antarctic Intermediate Water, AAIW; Circumpolar Deep Water, CDW; Antarctic Bottom Water, AABW) and southward flowing North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The interaction of these water masses with the seafloor is obvious {{from the fact that the}} present depths of each of the water masses coincide with the position of a specific sedimentary <b>terrace</b> on <b>continental</b> slope. This set of <b>continental</b> slope <b>terraces</b> located between 44 °S and 48 °S reveals both erosional (e. g. channels) and depositional (e. g. sediment drifts) features of contourites. Here, we present the internal seismic structure of the terraces (especially the Valentin Feilberg Terrace), identify phases of terraces evolution in a seismostratigraphic context and discuss their record of the variability of the Neogene Southern Ocean palaeoceanography in response to the influence of global climate and tectonic events. Maps of reflectors depth and seismic unit thickness are compiled and the shape and location of unit depocentres relative to the continental slope are interpreted as indications for the major transport and depositional processes. Based on regional correlation we established a seismostratigraphic model for the sedimentary development of the Valentine Feilberg Terrace. The terrace grew from 17 Ma onward mainly under the influence of geostrophic bottom currents (AABW and CDW) originating from the south. A prominent intermediate unit that exhibits an aggradational stacking pattern is inferred to have been deposited during the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO, 17 - 14 Ma). Above this unit the sediment record of the Valentine Feilberg Terrace can be divided into 5 subunits that show a variety of different drifts, moats and channels and contain a high resolution palaeoceanographic record of late Miocene to recent time. Depocentres are oriented parallel to the continental slope and thus represent mainly along-slope sediment transport. A major current reorganization can be inferred for the time 14 - 12 Ma when the Valentine Feilberg Terrace started growing due to the deposition of sheeted and mounded drifts which at their distal ends partly covered a giant drift in the deep sea. After 12 Ma bottom water flow remained vigorous at both margins of the terrace as indicated by a contouritic channel at the western side and by a current shaped inclined eastern flank. In contrast, the development of sheeted and mounded drifts, as well as the occurrence of erosional troughs suggests a bottom flow - likely at the CDW/AABW interface- that was quite variable in position and strength over the central terrace plateau. Another marked change in terrace architecture occurred at 6 Ma when a mounded drift and other features (moats, sediment waves) indicating stronger bottom flow started developing on the Valentin Veilberg Terrace plateau. This may have been caused by a general change in deep water mass organization following the closure of the Panamanian gateway and a subsequent stronger southward flow of NADW. ...|$|R

During the Early Cretaceous, the Indian passive margin recorded basaltic magmatic activity. Albian volcanic arenites, probably related to a major extensional tectonic event, are unconformably overlain by an Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene carbonate sequence, with a major quartzarenite episode triggered by the global eustatic sea-level fall at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. At the same time, Neotethyan oceanic crust was being subducted beneath Asia, as testified by calc-alkalic volcanism and forearc basin sedimentation in the Transhimalayan belt. Onset of collision and obduction of the Asian accretionary wedge onto the Indian continental rise was recorded by shoaling of the outer shelf at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, related to flexural uplift of the passive margin. A few My later, foreland basin volcanic arenites derived from the uplifted Asian subduction complex onlapped onto the Indian <b>continental</b> <b>terrace.</b> All along the Himalaya, marine facies were rapidly replaced by continental redbeds in collisional basins {{on both sides of the}} ophiolitic suture. Next, foreland basin sedimentation was interrupted by fold-thrust deformation and final ophiolite emplacement.

40|$|This report {{includes}} {{discussions of}} elastic and viscoelastic models for water-saturated porous media, and measurements and computations of elastic constants including compressibility, incompressibility (bulk modulus), rigidity (shear modulus), Lamé's constant, Poisson's ratio, density, and compressional- and shear-wave velocity. The sediments involved are from three major physiographic provinces in the North Pacific and adjacent areas: <b>continental</b> <b>terrace</b> (shelf and slope), abyssal plain (turbidite), and abyssal hill (pelagic). It is concluded that for small stresses (such {{as from a}} sound wave), water-saturated sediments respond elastically, and that the elastic equations of the Hookean model {{can be used to}} compute unmeasured elastic constants. However, to account for wave attenuation, the favored model is ‘nearly elastic,’ or linear viscoelastic. In this model the rigidity modulus μ and Lamé's constant λ in the equations of elasticity, are replaced by complex Lamé constants (μ + iμ′) and (λ + iλ′), which are independent of frequency; μ and λ represent elastic response (as in the Hookean model), and iμ′ and iλ′ represent damping of wave energy. This model implies that wave velocities and the specific dissipation function 1 /Q are independent of frequency, and attenuation in decibels per unit length varies linearly with frequency in the range from a few hertz to the megahertz range. The components of the water-mineral system bulk modulus are porosity, the bulk modulus of pore water, an aggregate bulk modulus of mineral grains, and a bulk modulus of the structure, or frame, formed by the mineral grains. Good values of these components are available in the literature, except for the frame bulk modulus. A relationship between porosity and dynamic frame bulk modulus was established that allowed computation of a system bulk modulus that was used with measured values of density and compressional-wave velocity to compute other elastic constants. Some average laboratory values for common sediment types are given. The underlying methods of computation should apply to any water-saturated sediment.

The information is mainly from the mapping and field sampling carried out during the 1991, 1994 and 2003 Italian expeditions which were organized by the “Dipartimento di Scienze Geologiche, Ambientali e Marine” of the “Università di Trieste”, within the P. N. R. A. (Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide) - Magellan Project (Coordinator: Antonio Brambati) and by the "Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra" of the "Università di Cagliari" within the cooperation poject PVS - Regione Autonoma della Sardegna - Chile (Coordinator: Sandro DeMuro). 	Previous studies, carried out on the Straits of Magellan were mainly focused on sedimentological research on the sea bottoms and coastal belt of the eastern section (Atlantic opening). Similar research was carried out also on the coastal belt of the western section of the Straits (Pacific opening) from seavessels, since it was inaccessible by land which is typically sheer (fiords). The first coastal studies were connected with the sedimentological analysis of the bottom, but were limited to research on the source and transport of the sediments as well as a regional definition of vast morphostructural units. Subsequent research was carried out in greater detail with mapping of morphological units in the coastal belt (collection of morphostructural, stratigraphic, micropaleontological and sedimentological data, study of active cliffs, palaeo-cliffs, littoral dynamics, dunes, etc.). 	 	During this second phase, greater emphasis was given to the study of palaeo-shorelines and different terrace orders of presumed marine origin. On the basis of the initial geological, sedimentological and geomorphological results obtained, we made a zoning of the coastal belts along the Atlantic opening of the Straits. 	The map shows the distribution of the youngest terraces (prevalently Holocene), from which four orders have been mapped starting from the average sea-level. The three youngest orders are certainly of coastal origin while for oldest a transitional origin may be suggested. 	Generally, they are mostly depositional bodies, but very ocasionally they are just simple marine erosion surfaces (palaeo-abrasion plattforms) formed either on glacial and/or glacifluvial deposits, or on the Meso-Cenozoic bedrock. On the whole, they follow the current coastline, being apparently genetically connected to it, although in detail, they present an ancient configuration different from the present Straits. 	First Order terraces, presently located between 18 and 25 m above p. s. l., are not well represented along the 250 km of explored and mapped coast. Landwards, they are, difficult to identify, because they tend to link up with <b>continental</b> <b>terraces</b> of diverse orders, and relative hydrographic networks, which are older (lower Pleistocene?). From the textural point of view, they are made up of stratified sands and laminated pelites. The Holocenic age is hypothesized on the basis of both stratigraphic position and relation to analogous deposits in the Straits of Magellan with radiocarbon dates. 	Second Order terraces lie mainly between 6 and 11 m above p. s. l.; they are much more extensive than the previous order, and sometimes contain evidence of marine palaeo-forms (Punta Catalina, Punta Dungeness). The deposits are mostly clayey and sandy, sometimes gravelly, and often fossiliferous (gasteropods, bivalves etc.). Their age (Holocene) is presumed from their stratigraphic position, their faunal content, and radiocarbon dating. 	Third Order terraces (Holocene) are less present than in adjacent areas, although they represent larger single outcrops between 3 and 5 m a. s. l [...] Fossiliferous gravels prevail, with some sands. Their age (Holocene) has been directly based on radiocarbon dating carried out on the shells that they contain. 	The Fourth Order shows itself to be distribuited at a height of betwen 1 to 2 metres. The Fourth Order is composed of raised palaeo-beaches containing a rich faunas of gasteropods, bivalves and balanids as recognized by C 14 dating. 	The coastal belt is almost always made up of depositional continental units, mainly linked to the last glaciations and consisting of moraines (ground, terminal and lateral) and kame terraces, as well as fluvial terraces and drumlins. There are, moreover, erosion units, such as marginal and sub-marginal streams, kettle holes and ancientstream channels (first, second and third glaciations). 	The present coastal morphology is more uniform compared to the ancient one suggested by the Holocene terraces. Present abrasion platforms, salt-marsh areas, tidal flats and channels, stable or advancing moving coasts are better developed in areas where the terraces are more noticeable (Bahía Santiago-p. p., Bahía San Felipe, Bahía Lomas, the area between Primera Angostura and Punta Tandy), which indicates that the morphology was the same in the past. On the contrary, they are not developed where there are no terraces or where they are less evident (Bahía Santiago-p. p., Primera Angostura, the stretch between Punta Tandy and Punta Wreck). The genetic similarity between the present configuration of spits and cuspate forelands of Punta Dungeness and Punta Catalina and those of the past expressed by Holocene terraces is also notable. 	The main aeolian morphologies follow the dominant Magellanic wind direction at high-altitudes, whereas on lower zones they run parallel to the coast. 	Lakes in the area are basically bound to glacial morphogenesis. Nevertheless, there are other lakes formed by entrapment in the palaeo-geographic evolution of the marine terraces (Bahía San Felipe, Bahía Lomas, Punta Catalina). They can be, sometimes, considered different stages in the latter phase of the last deglaciation, indicating backshore environments, and relative palaeo-beach ridges formed by isostatic uplift and risen, above the base level. In some sector, they have been, or are currently being shaped in their morphologic evolution, by strong and regular West North - West winds, migrating leewards. 	Elucidation of the evolutionary framework of the mapped palaeo-surfaces, linked to palaeo-beach deposits, provides an important contribution to the reconstruction of the Holo-Pleistocene s. l. palaeo-geographic picture of the peri-Antarctic areas. 	Detailed studies (scale 1 : 50, 000) on marine terraces linked to Holo-Pleistocene glacio-eustatic variations are in course. The aim is to publish an Atlas accompanied by about 12 Geomorphological Maps (topographically based on 28 sections 1 : 50, 000 I. G. M. C.) of the area between Punta Dungeness and Bahía Inútil...|$|R
40|$|Sediment cores {{from nine}} sites along a profile on the Antarctic {{continental}} margin off Kapp Norvegia were analysed sedimentologicaly. The carbonate and organic carbon content, grain size distribution, {{composition of the}} coarse fraction and clay minerals were determined. d 18 O- and d 13 C-isotope ratios were also measured. The distribution of ice rafted debris was determined by a new method. Sedimentation-rates were obtained from 230 Th- and 14 C-analyses. A segregation into seven different sediment facies {{was made possible by}} different sedimentological parameters, which can be attributed to different sedimentation environments and conditions. Thr profile can be divided morphologicaly into shelf, upper <b>continental</b> slope, slope <b>terrace</b> and lower <b>continental</b> slope. The paratill facies is deposited on the shelf during an interglacial phase and consists mainly of ice rafted sediments. A portion of the fine fraction is being carried away by the antarctic coastel current. The sedimentation rate lies between 0 and 3 cm/ 1000 a. The coarse grained deposits of the upper, relatively steep continental slope, were specified as a rest sediment. Current and gravity sediment transport are responsible for the intensive sorting of ice rafted material coming from the shelf. The fine sediment is carried away by currents while sand and silt are deposited as small turbidites on the slope terrace. The morainic facies only appears {{at the base of the}} upper continental slope and defines ice advances, beyond the shelf margin. The facies mainly consists of transported shelf sediments. The interglacial facies, deposited during the interglacial phases on the continental slope, are characterized by high proportions of ice raft, coarse mean grain size, low content of montmorillonite and a carbonate content, which mainly originates from planktonic foraminifera (N. pachyderma). At the central part of the slope the sedimentation rate is at its lowest (2 cm/ 1000 a) and increases to 3 - 4 cm/ 1000 a towards the sea, due to high production of biogenic components and towards the continent due to an increasing input of terrigenous material. Sedimentary conditions during glacial times are depicted in the glacial facies by a low content of ice rafted debris, a lower mean grain size and a high content of montmorillonite. Biogeneous components are absent. The sedimentation rate is generally about 1 cm/ 1000 a. A transition facies is deposited during the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. Typical for this facies, with a terrigenous composition similar to the interglacial facies, is a high content of radiolaria. The reason for the change of plankton from a siliceous to a carbonacous fauna may have been the changing hydrography caused by the sea ice. The surge facies is deposited at the continental margin under the ice shelf and is a sediment exclusively delivered by currents. With the aid of this facies it was, for the first time possible to prove the existence of Antarctic ice surges, an aspect wh ich has been discussed for the past 20 years...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the younger {{of a series of}} Quaternary {{terraces}} along the flanks of the Kyrenia Range in northern Cyprus, specifically the Kyrenia (Girne) and the Koupia terraces. The Kyrenia (Girne) terrace is tentatively correlated with oxygen isotope stage 5 (125  Ka), and the Koupia terrace with oxygen isotope stage 3 (&# 60; 50  Ka). Along the northern flank of the range, the Kyrenia (Girne) terrace deposits (5 – 20  m above modern sea level) typically begin with a basal lag conglomerate and then pass upwards into shallow-marine calcarenites and then into variable aeolianites, paleosols and fluvial deposits (up to 20  m thick). In contrast, the Koupia terrace (&# 60; 2  m above modern sea level) consists of aeolianites and shallow-marine calcarenites (up to 8  m thick). The equivalent deposits along the southern flank of the range are entirely non-marine fluvial mud, sands and conglomerates. The marine to <b>continental</b> <b>terrace</b> systems can be tentatively correlated based on mapping, height above modern sea level and sedimentary facies. However, variable preservation and patchy exposure require such correlations to be independently tested. To achieve this, a portable optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) reader was used to determine the luminescence characteristics of the two terrace systems. Luminescence profiles show major differences in luminescence characteristics between the two terrace depositional systems, which can be related to sedimentary processes, provenance and age. These features allow sections in different areas to be effectively correlated. Individual sections show luminescence properties that are generally consistent with an expected up-sequence decrease in age. However, the younger Koupia terrace deposits show higher luminescence intensities compared with the older Kyrenia (Girne) terrace deposits. This can be explained by multiple phases of reworking of the Kyrenia (Girne) terrace deposits, which changed the luminescence characteristics of the sediment. The use of the portable OSL reader is therefore an effective means of correlating Late Quaternary terrace deposits in northern Cyprus and probably also elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{sediment}} {{samples taken}} with a vented box corer from the eastern Weddell Sea on four profiles perpendicular to the continental margin have been investigated for their benthic foraminiferal content. The live fauna was differentiated from empty tests comprising the foraminiferal death assemblage. Based on the dead assemblages, potential fossil assemblages were calculated to facilitate the analogy with late Neogene core material. Five distinct live assemblages inhabit the continental margin today. Six dead assemblages and five potential fossil assemblages, respectively, correspond to these biocoenoses. A predominantly calcareous live fauna dominated by Trifarina angulosa is correlated with strong bottom currents and sandy sediments at the shelf break and on the uppermost continental slope. Below this, on the upper slope down to 2000 m water depth, the predominantly calcareous Bulimina aculeata assemblage coincides with the core of warm (> 0 °C) Weddell Deep Water and with fine and more organic-rich sediments. These calcareous live assemblages completely change composition during early diagenesis because of calcite dissolution within the uppermost sediment, which depends largely on the grain size distribution of the sediment and the fluxes of organic matter. Therefore, a still calcareous T. angulosa-dominated fossil assemblage indicates the sandy substrates on the shelf break and the upper slope, whereas the deeper slope with hemipelagic calm sedimentation and with high fluxes of organic matter is indicated by Martinottiella nodulosa, the characteristic arenaceous fossil remnant of the former predominantly calcareous live B. aculeata fauna. On a <b>continental</b> <b>terrace</b> between 2500 and 3500 m water depth Cribrostomoides subglobosus dominates the live fauna, but because of rapid disintegration of the empty tests of this agglutinated species a predominantly calcareous fauna characterized by Oridorsalis umbonatus and Epistominella exigua comprises the dead assemblage and the potential fossil assemblage, respectively. On the lower continental slope, between the carbonate lysocline (3500 m) and the carbonate compensation depth (4000 m), tests of Nuttallides umbonifer are the characteristic dead and potential fossil remnants of a former predominantly arenaceous live fauna, which {{is associated with the}} lower part of the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). This corroborates earlier investigations suggesting a relationship between the carbonate-corrosiveness of water masses and the distribution of N. umbonifer. This is important for inferring paleo-routes and estimates of paleo-production rates of AABW during the Neogene...|$|E
40|$|Appointing R. C. Sprigg in 1949 as Head {{of the new}} Regional Mapping Section of the Geological Survey of South Australia was decisive to its rapid {{success and}} high {{national}} reputation. Sprigg had vast enthusiasm for all things in natural history and especially earth history, appreciation of the economic drive, the ability to frame deep and meaningful questions in feedback with geological mapping, strong grasp of the interplay between geo-structure and geo-history, and exemplary follow-through to completion (not invariably) as richly illustrated papers and regional and thematic maps. By age 35 he had changed the culture of South Australian Geology and departed the GSSA. in 1954 Sprigg moved on to geological and biological exploration {{in a spirit of}} private enterprise in economic development. Others expanded the research programs although from time to time he revisited his early interests in the light of developments in the earth sciences, such as the revolution in continental drift and plate tectonics and advances in late Neogene chronology and correlation. The earth-science of hydrocarbon exploration unified most of Sprigg's preoccupations in private enterprise with reviews and syntheses. His histories and popular works gave insights into the rapidly changing scientific, industrial and environmental-awareness scenes and into his view of his own contributions. ADELAIDE GEOSYNCLINE. At the outset of his career Sprigg achieved the most comprehensive advance in the geology of the complex and difficult Adelaide region in more than 150 years. The Mawson-Sprigg Adelaide System with its Torrensian, Sturtian and Marinoan Series was vintage Sprigg. He recognised the Adelaide miogeosyncline as a fossil <b>continental</b> <b>terrace,</b> much older than any that had been recognised hitherto. When his notions of flysch facies and the relationship of the Kanmantoo Group to the Adelaide System were clarified (with Bruno Campana) Sprigg realized that the Kanmantoo eugeosynclinal trough marked the initiation of the great Tasman Geosyncline of eastern Australia. EDIACARAN BIOTA. In a clear case of the prepared mind and the deliberate search, Sprigg had been alert for a decade to the necessary existence of animals without mineralised skeletons before he discovered the fossils which became the basis for the Ediacaran assemblage of animals of latest Precambrian age. He described and named 17 species of pelagic coelenterates (“jellyfish“) of which about one-third survived as recognized taxa and some as higher animals. He saw himself as much biologist as geologist, and his handling of the comparative morphology, taphonomy and reconstruction, taxonomy and biological inferences was confident and secure. LATE NEOGENE IN SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA. In employing the term “Kosciuskan epoch“ in his earliest work, Sprigg perceived the late uplift as being coeval with and part of the uplift of the highlands of southeastern Australia, and he sustained this view of neotectonic activity when it was unfashionable, as in petroleum exploration in Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary basins. Finding strong indications of a cyclical pattern in the remarkably regular lateral succession of fossil beaches in the South-east of South Australia, he took the intuitive leap of explaining this regional pattern with the Milankovitch theory of ice ages, which were still be integrated with the geohistorical record. In due course geomagnetic and oxygen-isotopic stratigraphy would confirm his 1940 s theory that the aeolianites record a punctuated succession of high sea levels (i. e., interglacials). (Subsequently Sprigg added the calcareous aeolianites to the counterclockwise whorl of siliciclastic dunes in a grand vision of windy, glacial Australia, but his initial theory is the survivor.) Predicting that the Pleis tocene River Murray might produce a canyon at the shelf edge, he convinced the Navy to make the necessary traverse and the canyons were found (the first on the australian margin).

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The <b>continental</b> <b>terrace</b> west of Oregon between 43 ° 50 'N and 44 ° 40 ' N {{latitude}} is 50 to 55 miles wide. It {{consists of}} a continental shelf, 16 to 35 miles wide, and a continental slope, 16 to 37 miles wide. The eastern portion of the shelf is a smooth, sediment covered area that slopes very gently west. The western portion of the shelf contains four rocky bank areas. The banks are topographically irregular and appear to be of structural origin. West of the banks the shelf edge occurs at depths of 71 to 90 fathoms. The continental slope extends {{from the edge of}} the shelf to the abyssal plain at depths of 1530 to 1610 fathoms. A smooth upper slope of less than three degrees extending to depths of 117 to 250 fathoms occurs north and south of Heceta Bank. West of Heceta Bank the upper slope is formed by a scarp that slopes 10 ° to 16 ° to 560 to 725 fathoms. West of the upper slope there is an area of irregular topography, including benches, hills and scarps, which extends to depths of 380 to 1100 fathoms. The lower part of the slope is formed by a north-striking scarp which is 3000 to 6000 feet high and slopes 04 ° to 15 °. The bathymetry indicates that the continental slope was formed by step-type, block faulting. Sediments form a thin surface layer over much of: the terrace. Detrital sand, similar to the coastal sand, covers the shelf from the shoreline to approximately 50 fathoms. The deeper areas on the shelf and upper part of the slope are covered by glauconitic sands and silts on the topographic highs and olive green, clayey silts in the topographic lows. The intermediate and lower portions of the slope are blanketed with olive-green, clayey silt. In these sediments the sand fraction, which generally comprises less than five percent of the sample, is composed chiefly of diatoms, Foraminifera, Radiolaria, and sponge spicules. Sands are also present on the intermediate and deep portions of the slope. Dredge hauls west of Newport obtained sand composed mainly of detrital grains which may have been derived from an underlying friable sandstone. Thin layers of sand occur in cores from other portions of the slope. These sands may have been derived by down slope movement of sediment from the upper slope and the shelf. Sedimentary rocks of Upper Miocene and Pliocene age crop out on the shelf banks and on the continental slope. The banks consist of a sequence of diatomaceous, clayey siltstones with interbeds and concretions of calcareous siltstones. Glauconite sandstone, gray wacke sandstone, and limestone breccia are exposed along with the siltstone, on the northern end of Heceta Bank. Most of the rocks obtamed from the slope are similar to those from the shelf. Friable, wacke sandstone is exposed on the slope west of Newport. Foraminifera, the sand fraction compositions, and textural analyses all indicate that the sediment forming the siltstones from the shelf were deposited at lower littoral to lower bathyal depths. The sediments forming the rocks were deposited in one or more sedimentary basins during the Miocene and Pliocene. The subsidence continued until the. Late Pliocene when the area began to rise. The area was uplifted as much as 1000 fathoms by the Late Pleistocene when the shelf was eroded by transgressions and regressions resulting from sea level changes. The last rise in sea level resulted in the erosion of the shelf to its present form and the deposition of a thin layer of sediment. Sand is presently being deposited on the shallow areas adjacent to the continent, and silt and clay are being laid down on the slope and the sheltered areas of the outer shelf...|$|E
40|$|During "Meteor" Cruise 6 / 1966 in the {{northwest}} Atlantic a systematic survey of the bottom topography of the southeast Greenland continental margin was undertaken. Eighty-seven profiles transverse to the shelf edge at distances of 3 - 4 nautical miles and two longitudinal profiles parallel to the coast were carried out with the ELAC Narrow Beam Echo-Sounder giving a reliable record of even steep slopes. On {{the basis of the}} echo soundings the topography and morphology of the continental shelf and slope are evaluated. A detailed bathymetric chart and a serial profile chart were designed as working material for the morphological research. These maps along with the original echograms are morphometrically evaluated. The analysis of the sea bottom features is the basis of a subsequent morphogenetical interpretation, verified and extended by means of interpretation of magnetic data and sediment analysis (grain size, roundness, lithology). The results of the research are expressed in a geomorphological map. The primary findings can be summarized as follows: 1) The southeast Greenland shelf by its bottom topography can be clearly designated as a glacially formed area. The glacial features of the shelf can be classified into two zones nearly parallel to the coast: glacial erosion forms on the inner shelf and glacial accumulation forms on the outer shelf. The inner shelf is characterized by the rugged and hummocky topography of ice scoured plains with clear west/east slope asymmetry. On the outer shelf three types of glacial accumulation forms can be recognized: ice margin deposits with clearly expressed terminal moraines, glacial till plains and glaciomarine outwash fans. Both zones of the shelf can be subdivided into two levels of relief. The ice scoured plains, with average depths of 240 meters (m), are dissected to a maximum depth of 1060 m (Gyldenloves Trough) by trough valleys, which are the prolongations of the Greenland fjords. The banks of the outer shelf, with an average depth of 180 m, surround glacial basins with a maximum depth of 670 meters. 2) The sediments of the continental shelf can be classified as glacial due to their grain size distribution and the degree of roundness of the gravel particles. The ice margin deposits on the outer shelf can be recognized by their high percentage of gravels. On the inner shelf a rock surface is suggested, intermittently covered by glacial deposits. In the shelf troughs fine-grained sediments occur mixed with gravels. 3) Topography and sediments show that the southeast Greenland shelf was covered by an ice sheet resting on the sea floor during the Pleistocene ice-age. The large end moraines along the shelf edge probably indicate the maximum extent of the Wurm shelf ice resting on the sea floor. The breakthroughs of the end moraines in front of the glacial basins suggest that the shelf ice has floated further seaward over the increasing depths. 4) Petrographically the shelf sediments consist of gneisses, granites and basalts. While gneisses and granites occire on the nearby coast, basalt is not known to exist here. Either this material has been drifted by icebergs from the basalt province to the north or exists on the southeast Greenland shelf itself. The last interpretation is supported bythe high portion of basalt contained in the sediment samples taken and the strong magnetic anomalies probably caused by basaltic intrusions. 5) A magnetic profile allows the recognition of two magnetically differing areas which approximately coincide with the glacial erosion and accumulation zones. The inner shelf shows a strong and variable magnetic field because the glacially eroded basement forms the sea floor. The outer shelf is characterized by a weak and homogenous magnetic field, as the magnetized basement lies at greater depthy, buried by a thick cover of glacial sediments. The strong magnetic anomalies of the inner shelf are probably caused by dike swarms, similar to those observed further to the north in the Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord region. This interpretation is supported by the high basalt content of the sediment samples and the rough topography of the ice scoured plains which correlates in general with the magnetic fluctuations. The dike structures of the basement have been differentially eroded by the shelf ice. 6) The continental slope, extending from the shelf break at 313 m to a depth of 1270 m with an average slope of 11 °, is characterized by delta-shaped projections in front of the shelf basins, by marginal plateaus, ridges and hills, by canyons and slumping features. The projections could be identified as glaciomarine sediment fans. This conclusion is supported by the strong decrease of magnetic field intensity. The deep sea hills and ridges with their greater magnetic intensities have to be regarded as basement outcrops projecting through the glaciomarine sediment cover. The upper continental rise, sloping seaward at about 2 °, is composed of wide sediment fans and slump material. A marginal depression on the continental rise running parallel to the shelf edge has been identified. In this depression bottom currents capable of erosion have been recorded. South of Cape Farvel the depression extends to the accumulation zone of the "Eirik" sedimentary ridge. 7) By means of a study of the recent marine processes, postglacial modification of the ice-formed relief can be postulated. The retention effect of the fjord troughs and the high velocity of the East Greenland stream prevents the glacial features from being buried by sediments. Bottom currents capable of active erosion have only been found in the marginal depression on the continental rise. In addition, {{at the time of the}} lowest glacio-eustatic sea level, the shelf bottom was not situated in the zone of wave erosion. Only on the continental slope and rise bottom currents, sediment slumps and turbidity currents have led to significant recent modifications. Considering these results, the geomorphological development of the southeast Greenland <b>continental</b> <b>terrace</b> can be suggested as follows: 1. initial formation of a "peneplain", 2. fluvial incision, 3. submergence, and finally 4. glacial modification...|$|E
