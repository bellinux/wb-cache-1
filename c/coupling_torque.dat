The driver can freely change the drive mode at any time. When “4WD Auto” mode is selected, the Outlander's 4WD system always sends some power to the rear wheels, automatically increasing the amount under full throttle acceleration. The coupling transfers up to forty percent of available torque to the rear wheels under full-throttle acceleration, and this is reduced to twenty five percent over 40 miles per hour.

The functional roles of these trunk muscles in axial rotation are multiple and have not been well investigated. In addition, there is no information on the <b>coupling</b> <b>torque</b> at different exertion levels during axial rotation. The aim of the study was to investigate the functional roles of rectus abdominis. external oblique. internal oblique, latissimus dorsi, iliocostalis lumborum and multifidus during isometric right and left axial rotation at 100 %, 70 %, 50 % and 30 % maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) in a standing position. The coupling torques in sagittal and coronal planes were measured during axial rotation to examine the coupling nature of torque at different levels of exertions. Results showed that the coupled sagittal torque switches from nil to flexion at maximum exertion of axial rotation. Generally, higher EMG activities were shown at higher exertion levels for all the trunk muscles. Significant differences in activity between the right and left axial rotation exertions were demonstrated in external oblique, internal oblique, latissimus dorsi and iliocostalis lumborum while no difference was shown in rectus abdominis and multifidus. These results demonstrated the different functional roles of trunk muscles during axial rotation. This is important considering that the abdominal and back muscles not only produce torque but also maintain the spinal posture and stability during axial rotation exertions.

Methods: Ten healthy subjects performed isometric right and left axial rotation at 100, 70, 50 and 30 % maximum voluntary contractions in two testing sessions at least 7 days apart. EMG amplitude and frequency analyses of the recorded surface EMG signals were performed for rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, latissimus dorsi, iliocostalis lumborum and multifidus bilaterally. The primary torque in the transverse plane and the <b>coupling</b> <b>torques</b> in sagittal and coronal planes were measured. Results: For both EMG amplitude and frequency values, good (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC = 0. 75 - 0. 89) to excellent (ICC greater than or equal to 0. 90) reliability was found in the 6 trunk muscles at different exertion levels during axial rotation.

To {{examine the}} effect of fatigue on torque output as well as electromyographic frequency and amplitude values of trunk muscles during isometric axial rotation exertion in back pain patients and to compare the results with a matched control group. Summary of Background Data. Back pain patients exhibited different activation strategies in trunk muscles during the axial rotation exertions. Fatigue changes of abdominal and back muscles during axial rotation exertion have not been examined in patients with back pain. Methods. Twelve back pain patients and 12 matched controls performed isometric fatiguing axial rotation to both sides at 80 % maximum voluntary contraction in a standing position. During the fatiguing exertion, electromyographic changes of rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, latissimus dorsi, iliocostalis lumborum, and multifidus were recorded bilaterally. The primary torque in the transverse plane and the coupling torques in sagittal and coronal planes were also measured. Results. No difference in the endurance capacity was found between back pain and control groups. At the initial period of the exertion, back pain patients demonstrated a statistical trend (P = 0. 058) of greater sagittal <b>coupling</b> <b>torque</b> as well as lower activity of rectus abdominis and multifidus and higher activity in external oblique. During the fatigue process similar changes of <b>coupling</b> <b>torque</b> were demonstrated in both sagittal and coronal planes, but a smaller fatigue rate for right external oblique, increase in median frequency for latissimus dorsi, and lesser increase in activity for back muscles were found in the back pain group compared with the control group. Conclusions. Alterations in electromyographic activation and fatigue rates of abdominal and back muscles demonstrated during the fatigue process provide insights into the muscle dysfunctions in back pain and may help clinicians to devise more rational treatment strategies.

Such coupling is independent of proximal or distal joint control and limb biomechanics. Principal component analysis of the stroke aggregate kinetic signature reveals unique abnormal frontal plane coupling features that explain a larger percentage of the total <b>torque</b> <b>coupling</b> variance. This study supports the idea that coupled cross-planar kinetic outflow between the lower limb joints uniquely emerges during pathological control of frontal plane degrees of freedom resulting in a generalized extension of the limb.

The poloidal and toroidal components of the fluid flow at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) have been calculated every year from the Bloxham and Jackson model (1992) and plotted at 50 year intervals {{over the last three}} centuries. The flow patterns conserve some broad features over this whole time-span. The time constant of the degree 1 component of the motion is larger than the time constant {{of the rest of the}} flow.

40|$|The {{synchronized}} magnetization {{dynamics in}} ferromagnets on a nonmagnetic heavy metal {{caused by the}} spin Hall effect is investigated theoretically. The direct and inverse spin Hall effects near the ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic interface generate longitudinal and transverse electric currents. The phenomenon {{is known as the}} spin Hall magnetoresistance effect, whose magnitude depends on the magnetization direction in the ferromagnet due to the spin transfer effect. When another ferromagnet is placed onto the same nonmagnet, these currents are again converted to the spin current by the spin Hall effect and excite the spin torque to this additional ferromagnet, resulting in the excitation of the coupled motions of the magnetizations. The in-phase or antiphase synchronization of the magnetization oscillations, depending on the value of the Gilbert damping constant and the field-like torque strength, is found in the transverse geometry by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically. On the other hand, in addition to these synchronizations, the synchronization having a phase difference of a quarter of a period is also found in the longitudinal geometry.
