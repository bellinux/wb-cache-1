50|$|Most {{manufacturers}} of air conditioning {{require that the}} heater be energized for 24 hours before system start-up. The compressor must have crankcase heat before start-up or damage occurs to the compressor. The <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> of the compressor always drops when the compressor starts to turn.|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{systems are}} usually simple, {{at least for}} petrol engines. The fuel tank may be placed above a float-type {{carburettor}} so that gravity is adequate to bring fuel to the carburettor, avoiding {{the need for a}} fuel pump. Alternatively, the tank may be placed below a carburettor which uses engine vacuum or <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsations to lift fuel into the carburetor. Float-type carburettors can only be used when the engine is reliably vertical and without excessive vibration.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} {{displacement of the}} engine remained the same , but more power/torque and better throttle response had been achieved by adding four ventilation holes between the cylinders to equalize <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> beneath the pistons, moving the air intake nearer to the centerline and upgrading the engine management system from a 16-bit to a 32-bit ECU. The entire exhaust system was now made of titanium to save an additional 1.32 lb and the tail light was replaced with LEDs.|$|E
50|$|This is {{necessary}} because internal combustion inevitably involves {{a small but}} continual amount of blow-by, which occurs {{when some of the}} gases from the combustion leak past the piston rings (that is, blow by them) to end up inside the <b>crankcase,</b> causing <b>pressure</b> to build up in the crank case. For control of the pressure inside it, a PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve is used to vent the crankcase.|$|R
50|$|On {{the first}} {{upstroke}} {{of the engine}} {{there would be no}} fuel inducted into the cylinder as the crankcase was empty. On the downstroke the piston now compresses the fuel mix, which has lubricated the piston in the cylinder and the bearings due to the fuel mix having oil added to it. As the piston moves downward is first uncovers the exhaust, but on the first stroke there is no burnt fuel to exhaust. As the piston moves downward further, it uncovers the intake port which has a duct that runs to the crankcase. Since the fuel mix in the <b>crankcase</b> is under <b>pressure</b> the mix moves through the duct and into the cylinder.|$|R
40|$|Crankcase of {{two-stroke}} {{spark ignition}} engine {{is an important part}} since it compresses the air fuel mixture before going into cylinder. Parameter inside <b>crankcase</b> such as <b>pressure</b> largely affects the performance of this engine. In this project, the simulation of flow inside of two-stroke engine had been carried out. The objective of this project is to simulate the visualization of crankcase flow process. The advantages of using CFD in this research are low cost and easy to apply compared to the laser. Before the main concept had been applied, COSMOS application is the one of the software that introduces to the basic of flow pattern in this research. After complete the entire tutorial this software, will proceed with the CFD application. CFD application was started by modeling the crankcase in three-dimensional in SOLIDWORK. After that, GAMBIT was use to generate grids before export to FLUENT for flow analysis. Crankcase model was simulated in motoring condition, which means no combustion or firing. As a result, pressure and contours inside the crankcase flow was observed. And found that the simulation results are slightly different from calculation...|$|R
50|$|Uniquely among flat engines a boxer twin {{suffers from}} {{differences}} in crankcase pressures as the pistons alternately compress {{and expand the}} crankcase gases. This issue is usually addressed {{by means of a}} crankcase breather, as in the BMW R90S. This crankcase pumping effect is also found on singles and 360Â° parallel twins. <b>Crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> differentials have scope for providing a form of supercharging, but while such an innovation has yet to be used on a production engine, it has been used to aid lubrication.|$|E
50|$|The road draft tube, though simple, has shortcomings: it {{does not}} {{function}} when the vehicle is moving too slowly to create a draft, so postal and other slow-moving delivery vehicles tended to suffer rapid buildup of engine sludge due to poor crankcase ventilation. And non-road vehicles such as boats never generated a draft on the tube, no matter how fast they were going. The draft tube discharged the crankcase gases, composed largely of unburnt hydrocarbons, directly into the air. This created pollution as well as objectionable odors. Moreover, the draft tube could become clogged with snow or ice, in which case <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> would build and cause oil leaks and gasket failure.|$|E
50|$|It is {{critical}} that {{the parts of the}} PCV system be kept clean and open, otherwise air flow will be insufficient. A plugged or malfunctioning PCV valve by itself cannot damage an engine; however the blowby will flow up in a reverse fashion up through the crankcase air inlet and if there isn't a separate catch can or oil separator at that inlet, then the blowby will contaminate the air intake manifold. On boosted engines this can be a real problem. A poorly maintained engine's PCV system will eventually contaminate the air intake manifold with oil sludge and if both the pcv valve and the crankcase air inlet are blocked then the <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> will build to a level that will damage seals and eventually the motor.|$|E
50|$|Crankcase heat {{is common}} in air {{conditioning}} (cooling) systems where R-22 {{has been used for}} many years. The home owner often shuts off the disconnect to the outdoor condensing unit for the winter, leaving the compressor without crankcase heat. If the homeowner then starts the unit without some time for the heat to boil the refrigerant out the oil, damage likely occurs to the compressor. On start-up, the <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> reduces as soon as the compressor starts to turn. The refrigerant boils and turn the oil to foam. The oil and refrigerant (some of the refrigerant may be in liquid state) is pumped out of the compressor. Valve and bearing damage may occur and the compressor may be operated with a limited oil charge until it returns to the crankcase from the evaporator.|$|E
50|$|Reed valves are {{commonly}} used in high-performance versions of the two-stroke engine, where they control the fuel-air mixture admitted to the cylinder. As the piston rises in the cylinder a vacuum is created in the crankcase beneath the piston. The resulting pressure differential opens the valve and the fuel-air mixture flows into the crankcase. As the piston descends, it raises the <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> causing the valve to close to retain the mixture and pressurize it for its eventual transfer through to the combustion chamber. The Swedish motorcycle company Husqvarna produced a two-stroke, 500 cc displacement single cylinder engine with a reed-valve controlled intake, {{one of the biggest}} in using this arrangement. Reed valves in two-stroke engines have been placed in the intake ports and also in controlling the intake to the crankshaft space.|$|E
5000|$|Some SI {{engines are}} {{crankcase}} scavenged {{and do not}} use poppet valves. Instead the crankcase and {{the part of the}} cylinder below the piston is used as a pump. The intake port is connected to the crankcase through a reed valve or a rotary disk valve driven by the engine. For each cylinder a transfer port connects in one end to the crankcase and in the other end to the cylinder wall. The exhaust port is connected directly to the cylinder wall. The transfer and exhaust port are opened and closed by the piston. The reed valve opens when the <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> is slightly below intake pressure, to let it be filled with a new charge; this happens when the piston is moving upwards. When the piston is moving downwards the pressure in the crankcase increases and the reed valve closes promptly, then the charge in the crankcase is compressed. When the piston is moving upwards, it uncovers the exhaust port and the transfer port and the higher pressure of the charge in the crankcase makes it enter the cylinder through the transfer port, blowing the exhaust gases. Lubrication is accomplished by adding 2-stroke oil to the fuel in small ratios. Petroil refers to the mix of gasoline with the aforesaid oil. This kind of 2-stroke engines has a lower efficiency than comparable 4-strokes engines and release a more polluting exhaust gases for the following conditions: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{frame is}} a full steel duplex {{swingarm}} design, with Ceriani rear suspension, and Marzocchi front forks. The early models had a twin leading shoe drum brake up front (Strada: 200 mm drum, Sport: 230 mm drum) that was notoriously grabby on the Borrani spoked wheels, but these were replaced with a single chromed 260 mm Grimeca disc in 1976, and later optional double discs. The rear drum brake was replaced in the early 1980s with a Grimeca disc. Switchgear, tail and brake lights were the standard CEV model used on many Italian motorcycles of the 1970s. The month and year of manufacture is embossed in small figures {{on the side of}} each cast wheel, near where one of the seven cast spokes meets the rim. The helical gear transmission was a six-speed, with a top gear ratio of 1:0.954, making it akin to an overdrive. The transmission was engaged with a six-plate dry clutch, making a characteristic rattle similar to Ducatis when disengaged. Secondary drive was by a 5/8 x 3/8-inch chain to a rear sprocket with cush drive. Gear change is by right foot and the rear brake operated by left foot. Engine lubrication was by oil pump to the crankshaft but no force lubrication went to the rocker gear. Instead, <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> forced oil mist up the short pushrod tunnels to the rocker covers, where two 'crow's feet' allowed mist to condense and drip onto the rocker gear. Although ingenious, it required riders to gentle warm up their engines before using maximum revs, redlined at 9,200 rpm. Oil filtration was by plastic mesh filter.|$|E
5000|$|After the 1967 Trans-Am {{campaign}} with the 4-Bbl induction system producing more horsepower than the competing auto makers' 8-Bbl systems, for 1968 Chevrolet developed a factory 'cross-ram' aluminum intake-manifold package using two Holley [...] mechanical secondary carburetors for Trans-Am racing. It was available only as off-road service parts purchased over the Chevrolet dealership parts counter. With the Chevrolet '140 1st-design off-road cam, the package increased a stock 302's horsepower from [...] to approximately [...] Chevrolet {{went so far}} as to carry the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system over to the cross-ram induction system to retain emissions compliance mandated for US-produced cars beginning in 1967, that also provided full-throttle <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> venting to the intake air to burn its vapors. Engines prepared for competition use were capable of producing [...] with little more than the 8-Bbl induction, ported heads with higher pressure valvesprings, roller rocker arms, and the '754 2nd-design road-race cam. 1967/1968 models' cowl-induction system had an enclosed air-cleaner assembly ducted from its passenger side into the firewall cowl above the heater core. In 1969, factory Z/28's could be ordered with the ZL-1 aluminum-block 427 adaption of the 1967 L-88 427 Corvette cowl-induction 'ZL-2' hood available for both single and dual four-barrel induction systems that were sealed to the air cleaner base ensuring dense cooler, high-pressure, oxygen-laiden air from the center of the base of the windshield was supplied to the engine for combustion smoothness and maximum power production. Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball-bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac's 389 and 421 drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1966? Z/28 before they used it on the L88 [...] Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time. Many of the 302s off-road service parts were the development work of racers like Roger Penske. Every part in a SCCA Trans-Am engine had to be available through local Chevrolet parts departments to encourage their use by anyone who wanted them.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} is {{presented}} statistical analysis {{of the effect of}} compression-ignition engine working time on the phenomenon of exhaust gas maximum pressure increase in crankcase and cylinder liner, pistons and rings wear. Characteristics of the crankcase maximum pressure variations were made for the start-up speed and for selected rotational speeds of the 359 compression-ignition engine crankshaft as well as micrometric measurements of the cylinder liner and pistons and rings wear. The engine was operated under normal traction conditions while pressure analyses and cylinder liner micrometric measurements were made, respectively, after an operational run of 204864 km. Crankcase exhaust gas maximum pressure measurements were made both with air vent open and closed for a cold (lubricating oil temperature of 285 K) and a warm engine (333 K). Basing on the analysis of obtained examination results, it was showed that crankcase exhaust gas maximum pressure measurement (also during the start-up) may be used for determination of engine run and life. Average and maximum wear and tear of cylinder liners, maximum wear and tear of pistons in the perpendicular plane to the piston pin axis, dependency of maximum <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> in the function of operational mileage of a 359 engine for lubricating oil temperature of 333 K, dependency of maximum <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> in the function of operational mileage for lubricating oil temperature of 285 K are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{method of}} {{modelling}} the crankcase induction process through {{the integration of}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and one-dimensional engine simulation methods is described. A study of flow in the crankcase of a typical two-stroke engine by Cunningham et al. [1] {{has led to the}} development of a method for predicting and duplicating the motion of the reed valve in the inlet system. The response of the reed valve was predicted by a one-dimensional mathematical model and the corresponding inlet flow geometry that results from the reed motion was accommodated via a mesh movement routine in the CFD. The resultant hybrid model showed good correlation with the reed lift, <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> and delivery ratio predicted by a proven one-dimensional engine simulation code. The predicted velocity fields from the CFD also provided a more detailed view of the processes that occur in and around the reed valve, including the backflow prior to reed closure and the flow reversal which characterizes the two-stage lift profile of the reed. The results from this model show that it should now be possible to create a complete CFD representation of a two-stroke engine by including these techniques in the conventional in-cylinder models...|$|E
40|$|Performance tuning, health monitoring, fault diagnosis, etc. are {{important}} aspects of testing a pre-production engine out in the field. To fulfill these tasks, a robust data-based strategy for detecting anomalies in diesel engines is proposed in this work. Such a strategy separates the healthy data from outlying, anomalous trends of faulty data. The data classifier used here is based on fundamental principles of statistical learning and derived from linear discriminant analysis. Further {{efforts to improve the}} classification performance led to the finding that steady state data makes for a more accurate classification of the working conditions of individual trucks. Hence an algorithm to extract steady data is suggested. After achieving nearly 100 % accuracy for classifying data with one fault, this work is naturally extended to handle multiple trucks and the associated faults. Subsequently, a two-fault classifier using trucks belonging to distinct fleets and ratings, and a three-fault classifier using trucks belonging to the same family were devised. It was observed that data of trucks with similar power ratings and calibrations is more easily classified. The efforts towards clustering the healthy data of three different trucks together and separating it from the clusters of faulty data were successful. This was achieved at an acceptable accuracy of greater than 90 %. The multi-fault, multi-class allocation scheme was validated using five completely new, healthy sets of data. These trucks contained engines with similar hardware and calibrations. It was observed that the data of all but one trucks were grouped in the healthy cluster. That one outlying truck, on further investigation, yielded unusually high values of <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> as compared to the other four. This established the validity of the technique in characterizing healthy data and identifying anomalous behavior of the on-field trucks. ...|$|E
40|$|Icing in {{an engine}} {{breather}} system can block the engine breather pipe, cause excessive <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> and degrade the engine performance. In this project, a numerical study, experimental tests and CFD analysis {{are employed in}} order to understand condensation and the extent of freezing inside a vertical pipe, a horizontal pipe and a T-joint pipe which are exposed to an external convective cooling. The pipe internal flow is assumed to be a vapour/air mixture. This study has led an evaluation of freezing in an engine breather pipe. The finding in this project highlighted the effects of the pipe internal flow condition (vapour mass fraction, relative humidity, mixture gas flow rate, and inlet relative humidity), the pipe external cooling condition (temperature and air velocity) and pipe thermal conductivity on condensation and extents of ice formation in the pipe. In the experimental study, a test rig has been designed and the condensation and freezing in the pipe have been tested at the Cranfield Icing Tunnel. The local pipe temperatures are measured to validate the numerical and the CFD analysis. The numerical study has led to develop a one dimensional code which used heat and mass analogy to model condensation and freezing in a vertical pipe exposed to a cold air flow (- 20 C). This code satisfactory predicts the trend and magnitude of the local temperatures and heat transfer coefficient along the vertical pipe at available test condition within an acceptable uncertainty of 25 %. This study proposes an empirical correlation based on a degradation factor to evaluate heat transfer coefficient inside a vertical pipe. Its results fit with the experimental data within 15 % uncertainty. The CFD methodology developed in this study is capable of predicting condensation rates, local temperatures, heat transfer coefficients and extent of freezing in the pipes with good agreement with the experimental results. The CFD model over predicts the breather pipe ice blockage time due to disparities between an actual engine operating condition and the CFD model. Therefore, an adjustment factor of 1. 7 is proposed in this study to correlate the predicted blockage time. The results of this study can help Jaguar to establish guideline for future design of engines breather pipes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the liquid fuel in the intake manifold, the ring pack crevices and the oil film on the {{unburned}} hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of a spark-ignited, carbureted, air-cooled V-twin engine was studied. Tests were performed {{for a range of}} engine load, two engine speeds, various air-fuel ratio and with a fixed ignition timing. To isolate liquid fuel effects due to the poor atomization and vaporization of the fuel when using a carburetor, a specially conditioned homogeneous, pre-vaporized mixture system (HMS) was developed. The results from carburetor and HMS are compared. To verify the existence of liquid fuel in the manifold, and to obtain an estimate of its mass, a carburetor-mounted liquid fuel injection (CMLFI) system was also implemented. Stop-injection tests performed with the CMFLI system show that 60 - 80 cycles worth of liquid fuel is held in the intake manifold depending on operating condition. The results of the comparison show that the liquid fuel in the intake manifold does not have a statistically significant influence on the averaged HC emissions. In addition, the cycle-resolved HC emissions for both systems follow the same trends and are comparable in magnitude. Heat release analysis showed little difference between fuel mixture delivery system. These results suggest that under steady state operation the HC emissions for this engine are not sensitive to the presence of liquid fuel in the intake manifold. The ring pack contribution to the engine-out HC emissions was estimated using a simplified ring pack gas flow model; the model was tested against the experimentally measured blowby. The tests were performed using the homogeneous fuel mixture system. The integrated mass of HC leaving the crevices from the end of combustion (the crank angle that the cumulative burn fraction reached 90 %) to exhaust valve closing was taken to represent the potential contribution of the ring pack to the overall HC emissions; post-oxidation in the cylinder will consume some of this mass. Time-resolved exhaust HC concentration measurements were also performed, and the instantaneous HC mass flow rate was determined using the measured exhaust and cylinder pressure. At high load the model predicts that the ring pack returns approximately three times as much HC mass to the cylinder as is measured in the exhaust, indicating that the HC emissions are dominated by the ring pack contribution. At the lightest load condition tested, the ring pack model predicts less mass returning to the cylinder from the ring pack than is observed in the exhaust, clearly indicating that another HC mechanism is significantly contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. The integrated exhaust HC mass from the time-resolved HC measurement was found to correlate inversely with the IMEP on a cycle-by-cycle basis, which strongly suggest that incomplete combustion is materially contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. A statistical analysis showed that the correlation was significant. The intermediate load condition represents a combination of these two extremes. The ensemble-average ring pack model results indicate that the mass returned to the cylinder from the ring pack is slightly higher than the amount measured in the exhaust. But, a conditional sampling analysis indicates that there are sub-groups, i. e. late-burning cycles, for which this is not true. There is expected to be some in-cylinder post-oxidation of the ring pack HC mass at this condition, and the late burning cycles were not found to excessively contribute to the HC emissions, which both strongly suggests that there are other mechanisms besides the ring pack that are significantly contributing to the HC emissions at this condition. The most likely mechanism is incomplete combustion. The contribution of fuel adsorption in engine oil and its subsequent desorption following combustion to the engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions was studied by comparing steady state and cycle-resolved HC emission measurements from operation with a standard full-blend gasoline, and with propane, which has a low solubility in oil. Experiments were performed at two speeds and three loads, and for different mean crankcase pressures. The <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure</b> was found to impact the HC emissions, presumably through the ringpack mechanism, which was largely unaltered by the different fuels. The average and cycle-resolved HC emissions were found to be in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the two fuels. Further, the two fuels showed the same response to changes in the <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure.</b> The experiments were supported by a numerical analysis. The simulation of the liquid-gas phase equilibrium of the fuel-oil system showed the solubility of propane in the oil was approximately an order of magnitude lower than for gasoline. Further the numerical analysis of the adsorption-desorption of the fuel in the oil along the cycle showed that the oil layer contribution is very small compared with the ring pack contribution. This suggests that the effect of fuel adsorption in the oil is not significant for small air-cooled utility-type engines...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop simple algorithms for fault detection in diesel engines embedded with many sensors using data-based methods. The motivation to develop an on-board diagnostic tool is {{the reduction in the}} costs of troubleshooting, maintenance, and false alarms. On-board diagnostics also detects faults eventually resulting in excessive emissions so that the corrective action can be taken in advance. It helps in the manufacturing environmentally friendly automobiles that comply with government regulations. ^ Two different data-based approaches are proposed to do fault detection through symptom detection. First approach focuses on healthy-faulty discrimination of engine states using classification rules trained with data from the minimum number of engine monitoring sensors. Besides inspecting a single sensor reading most relevant to the symptom detection, a collection of signals can aid in detecting a set of symptoms with more confidence. A new information-theoretic sensor subset selector is designed to select the minimum number of sensors that can classify eight different engine states with acceptable accuracy. It is found that at least eight sensors are required to classify eight different healthy and fault states of the engine to maintain the classification accuracy of at least 85 %. The specific eight sensor subset selected by the proposed feature selector combined with a probabilistic neural network classifier achieved the best fault classification performance among a set of feature selectors and classifiers studied in this research. ^ Second approach is based on statistical modeling of nominal behavior of a signal directly related to symptom and developing confidence bounds on the engine signal health for symptom detection. Simple regression models, estimated probability density functions, and nonlinear time series analysis tools are successfully used to model nominal behavior of oil pressure, <b>crankcase</b> <b>pressure,</b> oil filter differential pressure, and intake manifold temperature. These models can achieve a much tighter bound on nominal signal behavior than the existing fixed thresholds used for symptom detection. As a result, health monitors with improved performance for oil circuit, charge-air cooler, and exhaust gas return cooler are developed successfully. ^ There are four significant contributions of this work: (i) design of combinatorial and stepwise information-theoretic sensor subset selectors (ii) development of novel histogram-based sparse matrix approach to estimate information to overcome issues with constraints on memory available for computation (iii) development of overall methodology to do data-based fault detection in systems (iv) application of this methodology to do fault detection in diesel engines and the investigation of such faults causing excessive emissions. ...|$|E
