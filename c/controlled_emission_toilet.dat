50|$|The {{facilities}} {{required by}} the franchise agreement included: a one road three-car length shed, and sidings for 8 three-car trains; also required were siding facilities for <b>controlled</b> <b>emission</b> <b>toilet</b> servicing, fuelling; as well as train electric supply (125 A three phase), offices, stores, and a 1.5 t capacity overhead hoist.|$|E
50|$|Fitzpatrick {{contractors}} Ltd. {{was given}} a £11million contact to build a four road train shed for the Class 319 EMUs, which {{in addition to the}} construction of the main train service and maintenance building included stabling for 22 four car trains, a train wash, and <b>controlled</b> <b>emission</b> <b>toilet</b> servicing. The main building was 120 by 25 m. The depot opened 3 November 2004. The initial allocation was 43 Class 319s.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} development required bridge {{widening of}} the crossing of Turnpike lane, and additional embankment work and extensions. The main maintenance building was a six-road 40 by 280 m, 13.4 m high single-ended train shed, with an adjacent train wash (west) and a two-storey 12 by 117 m warehouse {{adjacent to the}} east. The southern site included sidings for 11 twelve-car trains and 2 eight-car trains, with cleaning and <b>controlled</b> <b>emission</b> <b>toilet</b> facilities.|$|E

25|$|GWR are {{to retain}} 24 powercars and 48 {{carriages}} to form 11 four-carriage sets {{for use on}} local services between Cardiff and Penzance. These will be fitted with automatic doors and <b>controlled</b> <b>emission</b> <b>toilets,</b> to allow their operation beyond 2020, at Doncaster Works.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 4 is an all-steel coach {{incorporating}} {{a number of}} improvements over the Mark 3 stock - notably the inclusion of automatic push-button operated plug-type doors, in place of manually operated slam-doors, fully sealed gangways and <b>controlled</b> <b>emission</b> <b>toilets</b> (CET). Body shells were built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) and Società Italiana Ernesto Breda.|$|R
50|$|The {{franchise}} agreement also required {{the construction of}} two depots for the new rolling stock; the main depot was to be at Manchester, with a depot for stabling and maintenance at York. In addition, a depot at Cleethorpes was to be upgraded with refuelling and <b>controlled</b> <b>emission</b> <b>toilet</b> servicing facilities, and a train electric auxiliary supply. The {{franchise agreement}} specified a performance aim of 37,500 miles per casualty, with entry into service between March 2006 (first unit) and November 2006 (entire fleet).|$|E
50|$|Originally {{there was}} a fan of three sidings just west of Skipton Station with a {{carriage}} washer before the sidings split off from the connecting line. This was changed to four sidings (with a full <b>Controlled</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>Toilet</b> (CET) discharge line) in 2012 after services had been strengthened on the Airedale Line. Class 322 EMUs were transferred from Scotrail to bolster peak time services in the Aire Valley. This resulted in a £3.6 million improvement in the siding space to allow overnight stabling of 14 units.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} site was on land historically used for railway use; unbuilt on prior to railway developments; by 1910 sidings {{had been built}} east of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (Brighton Main Line), {{as well as an}} engine shed and turntable adjacent west of the site; In 2008 the western development area comprised underutilised sidings and hardstanding with the site east of the mainline including operation sidings, as well as offices; tenants included English Welsh & Scottish Railway, BAM Nuttall, Colas Rail and Balfour Beatty. The western side of the proposed development included a single-ended 280 by 23 m three-road maintenance shed, 13 m high, a wheel lathe, electricity substation, and sidings for 8 twelve-car trains; the eastern side included stabling for 4 twelve-car trains, and an underframe-cleaning facility; both sides of the development were to have separate 325 m2 train-washing facilities, waste storage, and <b>controlled</b> <b>emission</b> <b>toilet</b> facilities. Site offices and warehousing were to be in a 2857 m2 three-storey building northwest of the main shed.|$|E

There were also been concerns with the 'sewage mist' from passing trains making Network Rail staff ill, and Greater Anglia announced it was [...] "working closely" [...] with the government to introduce a fleet upgrade.

50|$|On 11 July 1983 the Penzance sleeper was relaunched as the Night Riviera, {{designed}} {{to complement the}} long-established daytime Cornish Riviera. New Mark 3 air-conditioned sleeping cars were introduced with many safety features that had been lacking in the Mark 1 carriages that had caught fire at Taunton. These were the first on the route with <b>controlled</b> <b>emission</b> <b>toilets,</b> so discharge facilities were provided at Plymouth Laira and Penzance Long Rock depots where the carriages were serviced, although for a while the carriages were taken from Paddington to Willesden Depot for discharging as Old Oak Common was not initially equipped. A new pricing scheme was also introduced. Instead of paying a sleeping berth supplement {{on top of the}} fare for the journey, all-inclusive fares were introduced that were set at competitive rates. The seating carriages that formed part of the train were mainly Mark 2 carriages. The train by now was again leaving London at midnight, shown in the timetables as 23:59.|$|R

40|$|Both {{stationary}} {{and mobile}} sources are major contributors to many air quality problems. Typically, regulators have more <b>control</b> over total <b>emissions</b> from stationary sources, but only <b>control</b> <b>emissions</b> per vehicle mile from mobile sources, taking total vehicle miles of travel (VMT) as given. A cost minimization model is developed to compare <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> policies which reduce VMT, to other prevailing stationary and mobile source <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> strategies.

40|$|Industrial {{activities}} {{result in}} unintentional production of multiple types of {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPS) at various concentrations. Because of the potential adverse effect of these POPs on the environment, biota and human health, methods for <b>controlling</b> <b>emission</b> of POPs are required. Development and application of techniques for <b>controlling</b> <b>emissions</b> of POPs can be a technical and economic burden for the industry involved. Therefore, {{from the point of}} view of cost-benefit analysis, reducing emissions of multiple pollutants at the same time is optimal for sustainable industrial development. Although techniques have been developed for reducing the emissions of individual POPs, such as dioxins, further work is required on multi-POP <b>control</b> <b>emissions</b> from industrial activities. This paper discusses three important aspects that need to be taken to achieve multi-POP control. These aspects include the establishment of a comprehensive system for evaluating the risk from emissions of multiple POPs, determination of indicators for total emissions of multiple POPs, and the preparation and application of functional materials to inhibit formation of multiple POPs. These discussion might be helpful for the future research on the multi-POP control in industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
