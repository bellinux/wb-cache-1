5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|Nelson owns Luck, Texas, a {{ranch in}} Spicewood, Texas, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors.While {{swimming}} in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's lung collapsed. He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, 8% of U.S. workers {{reported}} {{ever having}} <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome and 4% reported <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome {{in the past}} 12 months. Prevalence rates for <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome in the past 12 months were higher among females than among males; among workers aged 45–64 than among those aged 18–44. Overall, 67% of current <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome cases among current/recent workers were reportedly attributed to work by health professionals, indicating that the prevalence rate of work-related <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome among workers was 2%, {{and that there were}} approximately 3.1 million cases of work-related <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome among U.S. workers in 2010. Among current <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome cases attributed to specific jobs, 24% were attributed to jobs in the manufacturing industry, a proportion 2.5 times higher than the proportion of current/recent workers employed in the manufacturing industry, suggesting that jobs in this industry are associated with an increased risk of work-related <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|As a note, {{a patient}} with true <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{syndrome}} (entrapment of the median nerve within the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel)</b> will not have any sensory loss over the thenar eminence (bulge of muscles {{in the palm of}} hand and {{at the base of the}} thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, branches off of the median nerve and passes over the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> This feature of the median nerve can help separate <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome from thoracic outlet syndrome, or pronator teres syndrome.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{disorders}} on {{the differential}} diagnosis for <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome. Cervical radiculopathy can be mistaken for <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome since it can also cause abnormal or painful sensations in the hands and wrist. In contrast to <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome, the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy usually begins in the neck and travels down the affected arm and may be worsened by neck movement. Electromyography and imaging of the cervical spine can help to differentiate cervical radiculopathy from <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome if the diagnosis is unclear. <b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome is sometimes applied as a label to anyone with pain, numbness, swelling, and/or burning in the radial side of the hands and/or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome {{is unlikely to be}} the source of the symptoms. As a whole, the medical community is not currently embracing or accepting trigger point theories due to lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} this {{condition}} include intrinsic factors that exert pressure within the tunnel, and extrinsic factors (pressure exerted {{from outside the}} tunnel), which include benign tumors such as lipomas, ganglion, and vascular malformation. <b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome often {{is a symptom of}} transthyretin amyloidosis-associated polyneuropathy and prior <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome surgery is very common in individuals who later present with transthyretin amyloid-associated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that transthyretin amyloid deposition may cause <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{factors such}} as genetic {{predisposition}} and anthropometric features had significantly stronger causal association with <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome than occupational/environmental {{factors such as}} repetitive hand use and stressful manual work. This suggests that <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome might not be preventable simply by avoiding certain activities or types of work/activities.|$|E
25|$|About 5% {{of people}} in the United States have <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome. It usually begins in {{adulthood}} and women are more commonly affected than men. Up to 33% of people may improve without specific treatment over approximately a year. <b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome was first fully described after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Recurrence of <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{syndrome}} after successful {{surgery is}} rare.|$|E
25|$|The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons {{recommends}} proceeding conservatively with {{a course}} of nonsurgical therapies tried before release surgery is considered. A different treatment should be tried if the current treatment fails to resolve the symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Early surgery with <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> release is indicated where {{there is evidence of}} median nerve denervation or a person elects to proceed directly to surgical treatment. Recommendations may differ when <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome is found in association with the following conditions: diabetes mellitus, coexistent cervical radiculopathy, hypothyroidism, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Suggested healthy habits such as {{avoiding}} repetitive stress, work modification {{through use of}} ergonomic equipment (mouse pad, taking proper breaks, using keyboard alternatives (digital pen, voice recognition, and dictation), {{and have}} been proposed as methods to help prevent <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome. The potential role of B-vitamins in preventing or treating <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome has not been proven.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{evidence}} based guideline {{produced by}} the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons assigned various grades of recommendation to physiotherapy (also called physical therapy) and other nonsurgical treatments. One of the primary issues with physiotherapy is that it attempts to reverse (often) years of pathology inside the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Practitioners caution that any physiotherapy such as myofascial release may take weeks of persistent application to effectively manage <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Some {{speculate}} that <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome is provoked by repetitive movement and manipulating activities {{and that the}} exposure can be cumulative. It has also been stated that symptoms are commonly exacerbated by forceful and repetitive use of the hand and wrists in industrial occupations, but it is unclear as to whether this refers to pain (which may not be due to <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome) or the more typical numbness symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Heterozygous {{mutations}} in the gene SH3TC2, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, confer susceptibility to neuropathy, including the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The role of MRI or {{ultrasound}} imaging {{in the diagnosis}} of <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome is unclear. Their routine use is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} {{between work and}} CTS is controversial; in many locations, workers diagnosed with <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome are entitled to time off and compensation.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} or no data to support the concept that {{activity}} adjustment prevents <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome. The evidence for wrist rest is debated.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} CTS are of unknown cause. <b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{syndrome}} can {{be associated with}} any condition that causes pressure on the median nerve at the wrist. Some common conditions that can lead to CTS include obesity, hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance), and trauma. Genetics play a role. The use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. <b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> is a feature of a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome type 1 called hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsies.|$|E
25|$|With hypothyroidism, {{generalized}} myxedema causes {{deposition of}} mucopolysaccharides within both the perineurium of the median nerve, {{as well as}} the tendons passing through the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tumors (usually benign), {{such as a}} {{ganglion}} or a lipoma, can protrude {{into the}} <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel,</b> {{reducing the amount of}} space. This is exceedingly rare (less than 1%).|$|E
25|$|<b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{syndrome}} (CTS) is {{a medical}} condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The main symptoms are pain, numbness, and tingling, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring fingers. Symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. Pain may extend up the arm. Weak grip strength may occur and after {{a long period of}} time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. In more than half of cases both sides are affected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{syndrome}} {{is estimated to}} affect one out of ten people during their lifetime and {{is the most common}} nerve compression syndrome. It accounts for about 90% of all nerve compression syndromes. In the U.S., 5% of people have the effects of <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome. Caucasians have the highest risk of CTS compared with other races such as non-white South Africans. Women suffer more from CTS than men with a ratio of 3:1 between the ages of 45–60 years. Only 10% of reported cases of CTS are younger than 30 years. Increasing age is a risk factor. CTS is also common in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|While being {{pregnant}} with her third child, Kiko was diagnosed with placenta praevia. The princess also suffers from <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome osteoporosis aggravated by child-nursing, a symptom common among middle-aged women, her doctor said on 14 December 2007.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} suggests, {{this type of}} mouse is {{intended}} to provide optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome, arthritis and other repetitive strain injuries. It is designed to fit natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.|$|E
25|$|Another possibility, {{suggested}} by Frederick Zugibe, {{is that the}} nails may have been driven in at an angle, entering in the palm in the crease that delineates the bulky region {{at the base of}} the thumb, and exiting in the wrist, passing through the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} patient factors {{can lead to}} CTS, {{including}} heredity, size of the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel,</b> associated local and systematic diseases, and certain habits. Non-traumatic causes generally happen {{over a period of}} time, and are not triggered by one certain event. Many of these factors are manifestations of physiologic aging.|$|E
25|$|Numbness and paresthesias in {{the median}} nerve {{distribution}} are the hallmark neuropathic symptoms (NS) of <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> entrapment syndrome. Weakness and atrophy of the thumb muscles may occur if the condition remains untreated, because the muscles are not receiving sufficient nerve stimulation. Discomfort is usually worse {{at night and}} in the morning.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{known as}} <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome had major appearances {{throughout the years}} but it was most commonly heard of {{in the years following}} World War II. Individuals who had suffered from this condition have been depicted in surgical literature for the mid-19th century. In 1854, Sir James Paget was the first to report median nerve compression at the wrist in two cases.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged GH excess thickens {{the bones}} of the jaw, fingers and toes. Resulting {{heaviness}} of the jaw and increased size of digits is referred to as acromegaly. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome), muscle weakness, excess sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes, and reduced sexual function.|$|E
25|$|The {{scaphoid}} bone {{is one of}} the carpal bones of the wrist. It is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb side of the wrist (also called the lateral or radial side). It forms the radial border of the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The {{scaphoid bone}} is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward, lateralward, and forward. It is approximately {{the size and shape of}} a medium cashew.|$|E
25|$|Despite these improvements, Garcia's {{physical}} and mental condition continued to decline throughout 1993 and 1994. Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. By the beginning of 1995, his playing ability had suffered {{to the point where}} he would often turn down the volume of his guitar, a problem exacerbated by <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome and the ongoing loss of feeling in his extremities from diabetes. On the band's final tours, he frequently had to be reminded of what song he was performing.|$|E
25|$|A ventral forearm muscle, the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) {{originates}} on {{the anterior}} {{side of the}} radius distal to the radial tuberosity and from the interosseous membrane. It passes through the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> in a separate tendon sheath, after which it lies between {{the heads of the}} flexor pollicis brevis. It finally attaches onto the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It is innervated by the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve (C7-C8) It is a persistence of one of the former contrahentes muscles that pulled the fingers or toes together.|$|E
25|$|Neurological: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} and {{mononeuritis multiplex}} may occur. The most common problem is <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist. Rheumatoid {{disease of the}} spine can lead to myelopathy. Atlanto-axial subluxation can occur, owing to erosion of the odontoid process and/or transverse ligaments in the cervical spine's connection to the skull. Such an erosion (>3mm) can give rise to vertebrae slipping over one another and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to quadriplegia or even death.|$|E
25|$|The {{first to}} notice the {{association}} between the carpal ligament pathology and median nerve compression {{appear to have been}} Pierre Marie and Charles Foix in 1913. They described the results of a post mortum of an 80-year-old man with bilateral <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome. They suggested that division of the carpal ligament would be curative in such cases. Putman had previously described a series of 37 patients and suggested a vasomotor origin. The association between the thenar muscle atrophy and compression was noted in 1914. The name 'carpal tunnel syndrome' appears to have been coined by Moersch in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The median nerve can be {{compressed}} by {{a decrease}} {{in the size of the}} canal, an increase in the size of the contents (such as the swelling of lubrication tissue around the flexor tendons), or both. Since the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> is bordered by carpal bones on one side and a ligament on the other, when the pressure builds up inside the tunnel, there is nowhere for it to escape and thus it ends up pressing up against and damaging the median nerve. Simply flexing the wrist to 90 degrees will decrease the size of the canal.|$|E
25|$|An {{accurate}} diagnosis may {{be difficult}} {{because of the way}} the disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> syndrome, TMD, Tourette's syndrome, conversion disorder or other neuromuscular movement disorders. It has been found that the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntington's disease, where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation, sustained fist clenching, knee flexion, and foot inversion. Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntington's disease include long disease duration and use of antidopaminergic medication.|$|E
