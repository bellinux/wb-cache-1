5|$|All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> from small pieces or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{veterinary}} uses of clindamycin {{are quite}} similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, {{for which it is}} the preferred drug in dogs and cats. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats.|$|E
5|$|Salamanders {{use their}} tails in defence {{and some are}} {{prepared}} to jettison them to save their lives in {{a process known as}} autotomy. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone {{at the base of the}} tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated. Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sarvapitri amavasya (all ancestors' {{new moon}} day) is {{intended}} for all ancestors, irrespective of the lunar day they died. It {{is the most important}} day of the Pitru Paksha. Those who have forgotten to perform shraddha <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> on this day. A shraddha ritual performed on this day is considered as fruitful as one conducted in the holy city of Gaya, which is seen as a special place to perform the rite, and hosts a fair during the Pitru Paksha period.|$|E
5|$|In Earth 2, Green Lantern Alan Scott was {{revealed}} as gay. In issue 3, Scott is revealed {{to have a}} boyfriend named Sam, to whom he intends to propose while on vacation in China. Before he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> however, the train on which the couple is travelling is suddenly wrecked. A mysterious green flame protects Scott and heals him; a disembodied voice informs him that the crash {{was caused by a}} force that threatens the whole world, and that Sam did not survive. The grief-stricken Scott is then told that he will be given the power to avenge his love and protect the world.|$|E
5|$|In the subplot, Marge {{finds an}} anomalously high phone bill for calls made by Lisa to the Corey hotline — a premium rate phone service where {{television}} fans {{can listen to}} the voice of a fictional actor based on The Two Coreys. Lisa promises to stop increasing the family's phone bill, but continues to make calls to the hotline from such places as Dr. Hibbert's office and a telephone at Springfield Elementary. After Principal Skinner catches her, Marge suggests that Lisa try to go until midnight without calling the hotline; if she <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> she will have conquered her addiction. Although tempted {{throughout the rest of the}} day, Lisa beats her addiction.|$|E

5|$|Two-and-a-half years later, in {{the second}} part of the series, Orochimaru confronts Naruto and his friends when they {{attempted}} to track down Sasuke. Later, when Sasuke attempts to kill Naruto, Orochimaru stays his hand by pointing out the boy's use in taking down the Akatsuki and thus lessening the number of enemies he has. Eventually, Sasuke uses his Sharingan to void Orochimaru's technique and retains control of his body while trapping Orochimaru's soul within him. The suppression, in turn, gives Sasuke access to many of Orochimaru's abilities in the process. During Sasuke's later fight with Itachi, Sasuke is left too weak to continue suppressing Orochimaru's soul, allowing Orochimaru to escape and try to take his body again. Before he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> Itachi seals him away.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} monks extol {{the power of}} the Church. Bertram has freed Robert from the guards and the two arrive to prevent the {{marriage}} of Isabelle to the Prince of Granada. Bertram attempts to get Robert to sign a document in which he promises to serve Bertram for all eternity. He reveals to Robert that he is his true father and Robert decides to sign the oath from filial devotion. Before he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> Alice appears with the news that the Prince has been prevented from marrying Isabelle. Alice prays for divine help (Dieu puissant, ciel propice) and hands Robert his mother's will. Robert reads his mother's message, in which she warns him to beware the man who seduced and ruined her. Robert is wracked by indecision. Midnight strikes and the time for Bertram's coup is past. He is drawn down to hell. Robert is reunited with Isabelle in the cathedral, to great rejoicing.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} three volumes concern {{themselves with the}} battle for a third ring, which has been embedded for years {{in the body of}} a comatose young man named Emilio Lufas Getto. Gamma and company learn of Emilio's existence from his sister Wolfina, a tabloid photojournalist and vigilante who does not believe in the Rings of the Dead. The group of hunters offer to restore Emilio to consciousness in exchange for the ring he contains. Before they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> however, Emilio is kidnapped by Balmunk the Mystic, a powder hunting magician who leads a circus-themed gang. Wolfina teams up with Elwood, Gamma, and Smith to retrieve Emilio, and they succeed in doing so after a number of battles with Balmunk's henchmen. The conflict culminates in a fight between Gamma and a giant golem summoned by Balmunk, which Gamma defeats {{with the help of a}} berserk state. Balmunk is beaten but not killed, and departs, swearing revenge upon Gamma.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
