40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the service {{operations}} that are essential for the smooth running of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Station. The first part describes the nuclear power station with its VVER 440 reactors; it particularly describes basic devices of the primary circuit, which include a nuclear reactor, a steam generator, the main circulating pump, a pressurizer and the main <b>closing</b> <b>fitting.</b> The next chapter concerns water management, whose main objective is pumping crude water and treating {{it so that it}} can be used in technological circuits of the power plant as well as in secondary systems, which maintain the required parameters and conditions necessary for the operation of basic devices of the primary circuit. The secondary systems secure compensation of reactivity changes in the reactor. Next, they secure refilling, cleaning and degassing of the coolant. The final part of this Bachelor thesis describes an increase of the electrical output of one of Dukovany's units to 500 MW and its effect on the secondary systems of the primary circuit. The main adjustments before the output increase were performed on secondary circuit devices and electrical devices. Primary circuit's machinery remained unchanged...|$|E
