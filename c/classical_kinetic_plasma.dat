40|$|A quantum <b>kinetic</b> {{equation}} for <b>plasmas</b> in laser fields is presented. Nonequilibrium proper-ties {{like the}} electron–ion collision frequency and collisional absorption are calculated {{on the basis}} of a numerical solution of this equation as well as using perturbation theory. 1 Generalized <b>kinetic</b> equation The <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> theory of <b>plasmas</b> in time dependent electric fields was developed in important papers of Silin [1] and later by Klimontovich [2]. In these papers kinetic equations for ultrafast processes where derived and applied to the determination of transport properties of plasmas in strong high–frequency electric fields. At the same time Oberman and Dawson [3] developed a mean field theory for these systems. The recent developments in the field of short-pulse laser technology make this problem again very acute. The aim of the present paper is to give a generalization to a quantum kinetic description. An important problem is the energy transfer between the plasma and the field described by the well–known eqs. dWfield dt = − 〈 j · E 〉, j = a ea d 3...|$|R

40|$|We {{employ a}} {{recently}} formulated dequantization procedure {{to obtain an}} exact expression for the kinetic energy which is applicable to all kinetic-energy functionals. We express the kinetic energy of an N-electron system as the sum of an N-electron <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy and an N-electron purely quantum kinetic energy arising from the quantum fluctuations that turn the classical momentum into the quantum momentum. This leads to an interesting analogy with Nelson's stochastic approach to quantum mechanics, which we use to conceptually clarify the physical nature of part of the kinetic-energy functional in terms of statistical fluctuations and in direct correspondence with Fisher Information Theory. We show that the N-electron purely quantum kinetic energy can be written as {{the sum of the}} (one-electron) Weizsacker term and an (N- 1) -electron kinetic correlation term. We further show that the Weizsacker term results from local fluctuations while the kinetic correlation term results from the nonlocal fluctuations. For one-electron orbitals (where kinetic correlation is neglected) we obtain an exact (albeit impractical) expression for the noninteracting kinetic energy as the sum of the <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy and the Weizsacker term. The <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy is seen to be explicitly dependent on the electron phase and this has implications for the development of accurate orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals. Also, there is a direct connection between the <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy and the angular momentum and, across a row of the periodic table, the <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy component of the noninteracting kinetic energy generally increases as Z increases.

40|$|The {{simulation}} {{of problems in}} <b>kinetic</b> <b>plasma</b> physics are often challenging due to strongly coupled phenomena across multiple scales. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based coarse-grained numerical scheme, based on the framework of Equation-Free Projective Integration, for a <b>kinetic</b> <b>plasma</b> system modeled by the Vlasov-Poisson equations. A kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code is used to simulate the meso scale dynamics for short time intervals. This allows the extrapolation over long time-steps {{of the behavior of}} a coarse wavelet-based discretization of the system. To validate the approach and the underlying concepts, we perform two 1 D 1 V numerical experiments: nonlinear propagation and steepening of an ion wave, and the expansion of a plasma slab in vacuum. The direct comparisons to resolved PIC simulations show good agreement. We show that the speedup of the projective integration scheme over the full particle scheme scales linearly with the system size, demonstrating efficiency while taking into account fully kinetic, non-Maxwellian effects. This suggests that the approach is potentially interesting for <b>kinetic</b> <b>plasma</b> problems with a large separation of scales, especially in higher dimensions...|$|R

40|$|Intermittency {{of heating}} in weakly collisional plasma {{turbulence}} {{is an active}} subject of research, with significant potential impact on understanding of the solar wind, solar corona and astrophysical plasmas. Recent studies suggest a role of vorticity in plasma heating. In magnetohydrodynamics small scale vorticity is generated near current sheets and this effect persists in <b>kinetic</b> <b>plasma,</b> as demonstrated here with hybrid and fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations. Furthermore, vorticity enhances local kinetic effects, with a generalized resonance condition selecting sign-dependent enhancements or reductions of proton heating and thermal anisotropy. In such plasmas heating is correlated with vorticity and current density, but more strongly with vorticity. These results help explain several prior results that find kinetic effects and energization near to, but not centered on, current sheets. Evidently intermittency in <b>kinetic</b> <b>plasma</b> involves multiple physical quantities, and the associated coherent structures and nonthermal effects are closely related.

Achieving greater chemical accuracy or computational efficiency is desirable and this has motivated attempts to construct improved kinetic-energy functionals (KEFS) {{but that is not}} our aim in this paper. Rather, we aim to obtain expressions for the exact kinetic energy and exact noninteracting kinetic energy that provide a general framework for the development of KEFS. We employ a recently formulated dequantization procedure to obtain the kinetic energy of an N-electron system as the sum of an N-electron <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy and an N-electron purely quantum kinetic energy arising from the quantum fluctuations that turn the classical momentum into the quantum one. We show that the N-electron purely quantum kinetic energy can be written as the sum of the (one-electron) Weizsacker term (T_W) and an (N- 1) -electron kinetic correlation term. We further show that T_W results from local fluctuations while the kinetic correlation term results from nonlocal ones. We then write the N-electron <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy as the sum of the (one-electron) <b>classical</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy (T_{Cl}) and another (N- 1) -electron kinetic correlation term. For one electron orbitals we then obtain an expression for the noninteracting kinetic energy as the sum of T_{Cl} and T_W.
