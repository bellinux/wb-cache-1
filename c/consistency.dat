40|$|Domain {{filtering}} local <b>consistencies,</b> such as inverse <b>consistencies,</b> {{that only}} delete values {{and do not}} add new constraints are particularly useful in Constraint Programming. Although many such <b>consistencies</b> for binary constraints have been proposed and evaluated, the situation with non-binary constraints is quite different. Only very recently have domain filtering <b>consistencies</b> stronger than GAC started to attract interest. Following this line of research, we define a number of strong domain filtering <b>consistencies</b> for non-binary constraints and theoretically compare their pruning power. We prove that three of these <b>consistencies</b> are equivalent to maxRPC in binary CSPs while another is equivalent to PIC. We also describe a generic algorithm for domain filtering <b>consistencies</b> in non-binary CSPs. We show how this algorithm can be instantiated to enforce some of the proposed <b>consistencies</b> and analyze the worst-case complexities of the resulting algorithms. Finally, we make a preliminary empirical study. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{works in}} the area of Constraint Programming have focused on inference, and more precisely, on {{filtering}} methods based on properties of constraint networks. Such properties are called domain filtering <b>consistencies</b> when they allow removing some inconsistent values from the domains of variables, and bound <b>consistencies</b> when they focus on bounds of domains. In this paper, we study the relationship between <b>consistencies</b> introduced with respect to discrete and continuous constraint networks, and experiment the effectiveness of exploiting bound <b>consistencies</b> on discrete instances. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpatiotemporal {{interactions}} affect {{visual performance}} under repeated stimulation conditions, showing both incremental (commonly related to learning) and decremental (possibly sensory adaptation) effects. Here {{we examined the}} role of spatiotemporal <b>consistencies</b> on learning dynamics and transfer. The backward-masked texture-discrimination paradigm was used, with stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) controlling the observers’ performance level. Temporal <b>consistencies</b> were examined by modifying {{the order in which}} SOA was varied during a training session: gradually reduced SOA (high <b>consistencies)</b> versus randomized SOA (low <b>consistencies).</b> Spatial <b>consistencies</b> were reduced by interleaving standard target trials with oriented ‘dummy’ trials containing only the background texture (no target, oriented 45 ° relative to the target’s orientation). Our results showed reduced improvement following training with gradual SOA, as compared with random SOA. However, this difference was eliminated by randomizing SOA only at the initial and final segments of training, revealing a contaminating effect of temporal <b>consistencies</b> on threshold estimation rather than on learning. Inserting the ‘dummy’ trials (reduced spatial <b>consistencies)</b> facilitated both the learning and the subsequent transfer of learning, but only when sufficient pre-training was provided. These results indicate that visual sensitivity depends on a balance between two opposing processes, perceptual learning and sensory adaptation, both of which depend on spatiotemporal <b>consistencies.</b> Reducing spatiotemporal <b>consistencies</b> during training reduces the short-term spatiotemporal interactions that interfere with threshold estimation, learning, and generalization of learning. We consider the results within a theoretical framework, assuming an adaptable low-level network and a readout mechanism, with orientation and location-specific low-level adaptation interfering with the readout learning...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, {{there is a}} {{noticeable}} difference {{in the number of}} read <b>consistencies</b> (#total reads vs #read inconsistencies) between MongoDB and Riak when the number of clients increases above 16. Firstly, in MongoDB, the number of read <b>consistencies</b> is 468 (1600 – 1132) and 531 (3200 – 2669) for 16 and 32 clients respectively. Secondly, in Riak the number of read <b>consistencies</b> is 648 (1600 – 952) and 812 (3200 – 2388) for 16 and 32 clients respectively. This fact implies that the number of read <b>consistencies</b> approximately increase 1.13 (531 / 468) and 1.25 (812 / 648) times when number of clients in the system fluctuate from 16 to 32, in MongoDB and Riak respectively.|$|R

Two main families of <b>consistencies</b> have been introduced so far: those that permit us to reason from variables such as (i, j) -consistency and those that permit us to reason from constraints such as relational (i, j) -consistency.

Hypotheses concerning behavioural <b>consistencies</b> are drawn from the diverse literature on sexual offences and a study is described of 66 sexual assaults committed by 27 offenders against strangers.

Mining context from corpus is not practical for ME recognition due to the complexity originated from 2 -D nature of MEs. For practicality, we identify typical types of <b>consistencies</b> that are often found in customary usage and general patterns in MEs. We aim to increase these <b>consistencies</b> in recognition results by correcting symbol labels and/or spatial relationships among symbols. Such <b>consistencies</b> are easily encoded as condition-action pairs. Preliminary interpretations generated by the base recognizer are reordered by increasing or decreasing scores by the rules. Although our approach is not complete, it easily implements even global context among distant symbols. Experimental results show that our approach is useful to increase the accuracy of handwritten ME recognition. 1...|$|R
