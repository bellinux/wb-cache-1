5|$|Complementing Nihilistic's and Swingin Ape Studio's {{work on the}} game, Blizzard's <b>cinematics</b> team—originally {{formed to}} develop StarCrafts cut scenes—created the cut scenes for Ghosts single-player campaign, which are {{integral}} to the game's storyline. The team, which originally consisted of six people, grew to 25, and used newer hardware, software, and <b>cinematics</b> techniques to create higher quality cut scenes than those featured in StarCraft and Brood War. The game's trailer, composed of the <b>cinematics</b> team's work, was released in August 2005.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} heavily stylized {{opening and}} ending <b>cinematics</b> produced {{in part by}} Pete Candeland of Passion Pictures, with help from animator Robert Valley and background visuals from Alberto Mielgo. Candeland, {{who is known for}} his work animating Gorillaz videos, also produced the opening <b>cinematics</b> for both the original Rock Band and Rock Band 2. Within two and a half minutes, the opening cinematic provides a brief representative history of the band interspersed with numerous references to songs by The Beatles, followed by more metaphorical scenes reflecting their studio albums. Prior to each of the chapters in the game's Story mode, the game presents short introductory animations; these animations were prepared by graphic design studio MK12, who had previously worked on the opening <b>cinematics</b> for movies such as Stranger than Fiction and Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|Glasgow based {{animation}} studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on {{the creation}} of CGI <b>cinematics</b> for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for Dead Island. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in live action using performance capture. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action shoot to create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide more coverage of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the 3D animation package, Houdini, to procedurally generate the environment in the <b>cinematics.</b> Axis worked with Glasgow-based audio post production company Savalas on sound design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops <b>cinematics.</b> Facial motion capture was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game <b>cinematics</b> for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios. Axis worked in conjunction with Giant Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.|$|E
5|$|Being an {{expansion}} to Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith requires the Dark Forces II CD-ROM {{the first time}} the player starts the game. LucasArts has made improvements to the 3D engine used in Dark Forces II by including colored lighting. The full motion video cut scenes that were used between levels in Dark Forces II have been replaced with <b>cinematics</b> rendered by the 3D engine.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} game of the Halo series, , Seropian noted that the company had to {{incorporate}} new features such as surround sound and <b>cinematics.</b> Halo went on to sell more than 4million units by 2004 and founded a media franchise encompassing sequels, books, and music. Seropian left Bungie in 2002 to spend time with his new family, but also due to frustrations with the game development process.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended the}} game {{to have a greater}} sense of scale than its predecessor, and writers created a story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the heroic X-Men to defeat a greater threat. High quality <b>cinematics</b> were created by Blur Studio. Online multiplayer was also added.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{tentatively}} titled Crash Team Racing 2 during its pre-production phase. The {{characters of the}} game were designed by series veteran Charles Zembillas, while the environments were designed by Joe Pearson (another veteran of the series), John Nevarez, Alan Simmons and Di Davies. The karts were designed by Perry Zombolis Jr. and Andy Lomerson. Recognizing that full motion video sequences have become the new norm in state-of-the-art video games, Universal Interactive decided that Crash Nitro Kart {{would be the first}} game in the Crash Bandicoot series to feature such <b>cinematics.</b> The cutscenes of Crash Nitro Kart were created by Red Eye Studios; pre-production of the cutscenes was handled by Epoch Ink. The screenplay of the cutscenes was written by Dan Tanguay. The studio's eight artists were given four months to create 32 minutes of pre-rendered <b>cinematics.</b> The actual animation phase was to be completed in 15 weeks, breaking down to almost five shots a day or 15 seconds of animation per day for each artist. The in-game versions of the character models were built using 3ds Max and were outfitted with full inverse kinematic setups, morph targets and UV texture maps by Vicarious Visions. These models could not be ported directly into the <b>cinematics</b> due to their lower resolution for optimal real-time interactivity. Instead, the artists of Red Eye Studios worked from concept sketches provided by Vicarious Visions and used Alias Systems' Maya (with which the artists were more familiar) to enhance the detail of the 27 character models in the game, including the Crash Bandicoot character.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of a pilot in the ranks of the Galactic Terran–Vasudan Alliance (GTVA). While the {{appearance}} and name of the pilot can be customized by the player, the player never gets to personally interact with other characters in the game. The pilot is also never shown in the game's <b>cinematics</b> or any other media.|$|E
5|$|Trailers {{featuring}} <b>cinematics</b> from Halo Wars 2 {{were released}} from {{the announcement of the}} game up to its launch. The announcement trailer revealed at Gamescom 2015 showed an injured UNSC soldier being dragged away and Atriox taunting. The trailer shown at E3 2016 was created by Blur Studio, and depicted the leaders of both factions—Cutter and Atriox—facing off as their forces are engaged in conflict. At RTX 2016, 343 Industries revealed a teaser of the in-game <b>cinematics,</b> illustrating the Spirit of Fires arrival at the Ark and Spartan supersoldiers encountering the Banished. At The Game Awards 2016, a trailer focusing on Atriox's background and motives was presented. The game was showcased and playable at a number of video gaming conventions and expos including E3, RTX, Gamescom, and Paris Games Week. 343 Industries and toy maker Mattel announced a partnership to create a new line of Halo toys based on Halo Wars 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to retelling the plot from Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission introduces new <b>cinematics</b> {{to push the}} story forward. Sakamoto believed {{in the importance of}} having a story to complement a game. He found it particularly difficult to convey the game's plot accurately {{in a way that the}} player can understand, because of the sparse use of dialogue in the Metroid series. The story for Metroid: Zero Mission was rewritten to explore Samus Aran's backstory more than in the original Metroid. <b>Cinematics</b> are used to show Samus' memories to move the story forward and to keep the plot open for interpretation. Sakamoto claimed that this was intended to expand the original story while retaining some mystery. The game is the first Metroid game to let the player choose a difficulty level at the start of the game; each of three levels varies in the amount of damage caused by enemies. The battle with Mother Brain marked the end of the original Metroid; however, Metroid: Zero Mission offers players extra levels to play after the battle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the credits}} of HD 1.5 Remix, clips of Kingdom Hearts Re:coded were shown, hinting at its {{inclusion}} in another collection. On October 14, 2013, Square Enix announced that Re:coded {{would be part}} of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix collection, released exclusively on the PlayStation 3. Due to the games touch screen use on the Nintendo DS, console conversion was ruled out as it would necessitate a full remake. Two additional hours of <b>cinematics</b> were created for the game to cover the entire story and show the games connections to other Kingdom Hearts titles. The collection features the game as HD <b>cinematics,</b> much like 358/2 Days was in the HD 1.5 Remix collection. The collection also includes both Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix in HD and trophy support. Additional events occur in the cinematic scenes not seen in the original, with new voice acting, orchestrated audio, and including new battle scenes and a scene that ties Re:coded and Dream Drop Distance together. The collection was released in Japan on October 2, 2014, North America on December 2, 2014, Australia on December 4, 2014, and Europe on December 5, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperative}} Spartan Ops mode originally {{began as}} a Firefight-type mode, similar to that featured in Halo: Reach, but was composed of different objective-oriented mission types. Over the course of development, changes were made to Spartan Ops to include a narrative that would tie Halo 4s multiplayer together. The missions were designed primarily for four player co-op. The Spartan Ops development team worked with the narrative team to use ideas and storylines to shape the mode such that the <b>cinematics</b> would tie in with the missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} by Electronic Arts on March 2, 2006 for Windows and July 5, 2006 for Xbox 360. Electronic Arts released a Collector's Edition that includes a bonus DVD with supplemental high-definition media such as the full original music score; in-game <b>cinematics</b> and trailers; the documentary The Making of The Battle for Middle-earth II; and The Art of the Game, a gallery featuring hundreds of cinematic paintings and concept art created for the game.|$|E
5|$|A PlayStation 2 port of the game, retitled Deus Ex: The Conspiracy {{outside of}} Europe, was {{released}} on March 26, 2002. Along with pre-rendered introductory and ending <b>cinematics</b> that replaced the original versions, it features a simplified interface with optional auto-aim and motion captured character models. There are many minor changes in level design, some {{for the purpose of}} balancing gameplay, but most to accommodate loading transition areas, due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 2 version was rereleased in Europe on the PlayStation 3 as a PlayStation 2 Classic on May 16, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Bungie first {{introduced}} the Halo series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, {{a series of}} cryptic email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie's previous series, the Marathon Trilogy. The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in I Love Bees, a promotion for Halo 2. Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks {{many of the same}} lines in Halo 3. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of <b>cinematics,</b> the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story.|$|E
5|$|The X-Mansion {{serves as}} a hub that the team returns to after each mission. While at the mansion, one player {{controls}} Alison Crestmere as she explores, and learns about herself and the other X-Men. Here players can also view loading screen art, <b>cinematics,</b> and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. Biographies of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed on computers located in the mansion. Players can participate in an X-Men trivia game, which rewards experience points for correct answers. Additionally, players can access the Danger Room's computer to play challenge missions unlocked during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} visual {{novels that}} consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue, School Days {{is unusual in}} that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. <b>Cinematics</b> naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability to pause, fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved {{at any time in}} up to 100 slots and loaded from either the main menu or during play.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Halo Wars 2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} professional critics. The campaign <b>cinematics,</b> created by Blur Studio, were lauded for their outstanding animation quality. Reviewers found {{the game to}} be very approachable to beginners but {{felt that it was}} in need of more strategic depth to gain popularity amongst experienced RTS players. Several nuisances present in the game's keyboard and mouse controls left some critics disappointed, however, enhancements made to the gamepad control scheme from the first Halo Wars were praised. Post-release, the game has been supported with additional content and updates such as support for cross-platform play. A campaign expansion, titled Awakening the Nightmare, was released in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects house The Sequence Group, who had {{previously}} developed animation for Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversarys terminals, returned to create additional animation for Halo 4. The Terminals feature a painterly artistic style, which Sequence president Ian Kirby felt appealed to gamers familiar with the style of concept art. In addition to creating the visuals for the Halo 4 terminals, their work appeared {{in one of the}} game's main <b>cinematics.</b> To save time and expense using traditional motion capture methods to animate the 3D characters, The Sequence Group used twin Microsoft Kinect infrared sensors to create a home-made solution.|$|E
5|$|X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse {{features}} a central hub that players return to between missions. It is a designated area free from enemies, and its setting changes {{to coincide with}} the current act of the game. Here players can view loading screen art, <b>cinematics,</b> and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. Biographies of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed here. Players can also participate in an X-Men trivia game which awards experience points for correct answers. Additionally, players can access a virtual combat environment known as the Danger Room to play additional missions unlocked during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The <b>cinematics</b> were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars {{received}} generally positive reviews. Reviewers lauded the game's pre-rendered <b>cinematics,</b> {{attention to}} detail in replicating the Halo universe, and intuitive control scheme. Complaints against the game included {{the lack of an}} option to play as the Covenant faction in campaign mode as well as the lack of strategic options during play. Critics from GameSpot and USA Today wrote that experienced RTS players would find the strategic elements of the title shallow. The game sold one million units worldwide through March 2009, making it the best-selling console real-time strategy game to date. An enhanced version of the game—Halo Wars: Definitive Edition—was released for Windows and Xbox One. Halo Wars 2, a sequel developed by 343 Industries and Creative Assembly was released in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} delayed {{numerous}} times before its actual release. Work {{on the game}} was extended because the development staff wanted to perfect the game due to high expectations from the fans and because the team only consisted of about 35 people. Before its release, it was ranked as the most wanted game in Japan and Square, knowing about Dragon Quest VII's release, moved Final Fantasy IX {{to come out on}} a later date. Horii stated in an interview that the team focused more on puzzle solving than the game's story. Being the first game in the series to include 3D graphics, the team was also initially reluctant to include CG movies and <b>cinematics</b> due to letters written to Enix by fans fearing that doing so would change the overall feeling of the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} {{cinematic}} scenes {{was written by}} Naoki Mori, who joined the project for one and a quarter years in his role: the cinematic director was Shigeki Yoshida, who was brought on {{at the same time}} as and worked on the storyboards with Mori. The initial script was proposed by Fujibayashi based on his perception of the game's structure. As the game's theme was the use of the sword, and the sword most associated with the series was the Master Sword, the team decided to make it an origin story for the weapon. An early element was whether to incorporate the creation of Hyrule, while also needing to explain the creation of Skyloft: this initial stage of story development ended up being difficult as their initial story plans were full of contradictions to established series lore due to them wanting to create an origin story for the entire series. These issues were further complicated by the third year of development with the necessity of finalizing the gameplay and environments. Feigning illness, Fujibayashi shut himself away in a hotel room and wrote the synopsis in a single day. Mori wrote the dialogue based on Fujibayashi's synopsis, who needed to work out the fine details with Fujibayashi. A scene Fujibayashi was intent on including was where Zelda jumped from the edge of Skyloft and Link caught her: this was fitted in for the two characters after the end of Link's exam. The early part of the story was quite different from earlier Zelda titles, playing out in a similar way to a school drama. Once the script was finished, it was handed to Yoshida so his team could create the <b>cinematics.</b> The total number of <b>cinematics</b> was estimated as 79, coming to over 120 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, <b>cinematics,</b> visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot to be interesting because it explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story did not contribute much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential for an interesting backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed their motives in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel like it was retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy at times, the expressive facial animations kept the <b>cinematics</b> captivating.|$|E
5|$|Artist Takayoshi Sato {{corrected}} {{inconsistencies in}} the plot, and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially restricted to basic {{tasks such as}} font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and presentations, and taught older staff members the fundamentals of 3D modeling. However, he was not credited for this work as {{he did not have}} as much respect within Konami as older employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered, and threatened to withhold this technical knowledge from other staff members if he was not assigned to 3D work. As a consequence, his superior had to give in to his demand, and he was allowed to do character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each their own distinctive characteristics, but made Harry almost completely neutral as he wanted to avoid forcing interpretations of the game on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was difficult because he had no Caucasian co-workers to use for reference. Although Sato was largely responsible for the game's <b>cinematics</b> and characters at this point, his superior still did not want to fully credit his work, and intended to assign a visual supervisor to him. To prevent this from happening, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over the course of two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, as he had to render the scenes with the approximately 150 Unix-based computers of his coworkers after they left work {{at the end of a}} day.|$|E
25|$|However, reviewers {{noted that}} the {{character}} models were of mediocre quality, especially when viewed up close during in-game <b>cinematics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Halo 5: Guardians is a first-person shooter, {{with players}} {{experiencing}} most gameplay {{through the eyes}} of a playable character. The camera switches to a third-person view for some <b>cinematics</b> and gameplay sequences.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter {{is also a}} known {{supporter}} of video games as a media and art form and has a particular liking for the Sonic the Hedgehog and F.E.A.R. franchises, even offering himself as a spokesman and helping direct the <b>cinematics</b> for F.E.A.R. 3. He has also {{expressed an interest in}} making a film based on Dead Space.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the regular game, there also exists a limited Collector's Edition Warcraft III bundle. The collector's edition box contained a Warcraft III cinematic DVD, including behind-the-scenes features and the <b>cinematics</b> of all prior Warcraft games; a Collector's Edition Soundtrack; a Collector's Edition instruction manual; The Art of Warcraft book; and lithographic prints.|$|E
25|$|The QS World University Rankings places Warwick's Economics {{department}} at 19th worldwide in its 2013 subject rankings. Further, The Complete University Guide ranked Warwick's Economics department 1st overall in its latest rankings for 2014. Overall, 17 of the 27 subjects offered by Warwick were ranked within the top 10 nationally in 2016, with Drama, Dance & <b>Cinematics</b> taking first place.|$|E
25|$|The game's plot is told entirely through <b>cinematics</b> and cutscenes, with {{additional}} information {{found in the}} Warcraft III manual. The campaign itself is divided into five sections, with the first acting as a tutorial, and the others telling the story {{from the point of}} view of the humans of Lordaeron, the Undead Scourge, the Orcs, and the Night Elves, in that order.|$|E
25|$|Cory Barlog (class of 1993), {{director}} and {{writer in the}} entertainment industry. He was a writer and director for the God of War video game series, creative consultant on the unreleased Mad Max reboot game. In March 2012, {{it was announced that}} Barlog joined Crystal Dynamics to direct the <b>cinematics</b> for the new Tomb Raider game and go on to direct an unannounced game.|$|E
25|$|Narrative {{sections}} {{are presented}} as three-dimensional animated <b>cinematics,</b> with camera movements and full voice acting in Japanese and English. The Escape sections, which include thirteen different rooms, involve the player searching the room for tools and clues through a point-and-click interface in a first-person perspective and solving puzzles. The puzzles are mostly self-contained, and test the player's problem-solving skills and memory; among these are puzzles where the player has to decipher messages, and ones {{where they have to}} align the sides of a three-dimensional object correctly.|$|E
25|$|In October, Snow Patrol {{embarked}} on a second European Tour. The tour saw them visit countries like Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and France. Artists like The <b>Cinematics,</b> Declan O'Rourke, Asyl and Joseph D'Anvers supported the band throughout the tour on different dates. Midway through the tour, Paul Wilson injured his left arm and shoulder. The bassist had been having a little muscle strain, but he had ignored the pain and carried on playing. It built up and became {{too much for him}} to play on-stage. As a result, four French and two German dates were cancelled.|$|E
