40|$|The Lagrangian {{coordinate}} framework {{considers the}} position of a particle (x,y,z) at time t relative to its initial position. In the Lagrangian frame, a concentration field and its turbulent flux are defined by the statistics of an ensemble of dispersing marked fluid parcels and the strength and spatial distribution of sources and sinks (see Lamb, 1980; Sawford, 1985; Raupach, 1988; Wilson, 1989 for detailed discussions). This approach is valid as long as the molecular diffusion within a fluid parcel is negligible in comparison to its turbulent diffusion through the atmosphere. The concentration of a scalar can be defined at a particular location and after a given travel time using the principle of superposition.

The performance of control and amine-depleted hearts was indistinguishable during each of these three types of severe stress.

The procedure accounts for the back-diffusion, described as a Brownian motion that superimposes to the centrifugal drift, and considers the sector-shaped geometry of the cell and the boundaries imposed by the meniscus and bottom. Results Simulations are carried out for four molecules covering {{a wide range of}} the ratio of sedimentation and diffusion coefficients. The evaluation is done by extracting the molecular parameters that were initially employed in the simulation by analyzing the profiles with an independent tool, the well-proved SEDFIT software. The code of simulation algorithm has been parallelized in order to take advantage of current multi-core computers. Conclusions Our Brownian dynamics simulation procedure may be considered as an alternative to other predictors based in numerical solutions of the Lamm equation, and its efficiency could make it useful in the most relevant, inverse problem, which is that of extracting the molecular parameters from experimentally determined concentration profiles. </p...|$|E

It examines support strategies in the short, medium and long-term and at a whole-school, group and individual level. The process of support is considered in terms of its contribution to normalisation. The exploration makes particular reference to decision-making factors for schools regarding outside support post-Critical Incident, especially that which is available from a Local Authority Critical Incident Response Team (<b>C.</b> I. <b>R.</b> <b>T.).</b> Eleven schools participated, creating two data sets balanced between those requesting <b>C.</b> I. <b>R.</b> <b>T.</b> support and these that did not. Decision-makers, most of whom were head teachers, were interviewed and subsequently the resultant data was scrutinised through the process of thematic analysis from an interpretivist perspective. Overall the themes revealed that schools coped psychologically through a pastoral response targeted for both staff, young people and families, leading to reduced stress and whole-school normalisation. There are systemic limitations and pressures, however schools which requested external support through <b>C.</b> I. <b>R.</b> <b>T.</b> reported useful outcomes, particularly a strengthened staff and an enhanced sense of preparedness. Decision-making regarding external support is influenced by the initial impact of the C. l.

Monocytes and myeloid {{dendritic}} cells (mDCs) are important orchestrators of innate and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -specific immune responses and of the generalized inflammation that characterizes AIDS progression. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate monocyte and mDC imbalances in HIV type 2 (HIV- 2) -positive patients, who typically feature reduced viremia and slow disease progression despite the recognized ability of HIV- 2 to establish viral reservoirs and overcome host restriction factors in myeloid cells. We found a heightened state of monocyte and mDC activation throughout HIV- 2 infection (characterized by CD 14 (bright) CD 16 (+) expansion, as well as increased levels of soluble CD 14, HLA-DR, and CD 86), together with progressive mDC depletion. Importantly, HIV- 2 -positive patients also featured overexpression of the inhibitory molecule PD-L 1 on monocytes and mDCs, which may act by limiting the production of proinflammatory molecules. These data, from patients with a naturally occurring form of attenuated HIV disease, challenge current paradigms regarding the role of monocytes in HIV/AIDS and open new perspectives regarding potential strategies to modulate inflammatory states.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Springer Nature via the DOI in this record. Aquatic chytrid fungi {{threaten}} amphibian biodiversity worldwide owing to their ability to rapidly expand their geographical distributions and to infect a wide range of hosts. Combating this risk requires an understanding of chytrid host range to identify potential reservoirs of infection and to safeguard uninfected regions through enhanced biosecurity. Here we extend our knowledge on the host range of the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis by demonstrating infection of a non-amphibian vertebrate host, the zebrafish. We observe dose-dependent mortality and show that chytrid can infect and proliferate on zebrafish tissue. We also show that infection phenotypes (fin erosion, cell apoptosis and muscle degeneration) are direct symptoms of infection. Successful infection is dependent on disrupting the zebrafish microbiome, highlighting that, as is widely found in amphibians, commensal bacteria confer protection against this pathogen. Collectively, our findings greatly expand the limited tool kit available to study pathogenesis and host response to chytrid infection. N.

The Pancreatic lipase (Pnlip) gene, involved in the hydrolysis of dietary triglycerides to fatty acids has been previously shown to be regarded as possible candidate for the gene responsible for intramuscular fat content in the rat. It is located within the genomic region of a bovine marbling quantitative trait locus and thus was considered as a positional functional candidate for the marbling gene.

Failure in algebra is the # 1 trigger of {{dropouts}} in {{high school}} according to a former superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) (Helfand, 2007).

Gov'tBACKGROUND: Environmental estrogens in {{wastewater}} treatment work (WwTW) effluents are well established {{as the principal}} cause of reproductive disruption in wild fish populations, but their possible role in the wider health effects of effluents has not been established. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the contribution of estrogens to adverse health effects induced in a model fish species by exposure to WwTW effluents and compared effects of an estrogen alone {{and as part of}} a complex mixture (i. e., spiked into effluent). METHODS: Growth, genotoxic, immunotoxic, metabolic, and endocrine (feminized) responses were compared in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed for 21 days to a potent estrogenic effluent, a weakly estrogenic effluent before and after spiking with a steroidal estrogen [17 alpha-ethinyl-estradiol (EE 2) ], and to EE 2 alone. RESULTS: In addition to endocrine disruption, effluent exposure induced genotoxic damage, modulated immune function, and altered metabolism; many of these effects were elicited in a sex-specific manner and were proportional to the estrogenic potencies of the effluents. A key finding was that some of the responses to EE 2 were modified when it was present in a complex mixture (i. e., spiked into effluent), suggesting that mixture effects may not be easily modeled for effluent discharges or when the chemicals impact on a diverse array of biological axes. CONCLUSION: These data reveal a clear link between estrogens present in effluents and diverse, adverse, and sex-related health impacts. Our findings also highlight the need for an improved understanding of interactive effects of chemical toxicants on biological systems for understanding health effects of environmental mixtures.

40|$|Ambient {{temperature}} largely {{determines the}} body temperature of amphibians, and thus their hydration state and physiological performance. Microhabitat conditions chosen by terrestrial amphibians {{may represent a}} trade-off between high ambient temperatures, which maximize performance but cause high rates of water loss, and low temperatures, which, in turn, slow desiccation, but potentially hinder performance. We determined the operative temperature of common frogs (Rana temporaria) by placing 3 % agar models in different microhabitats and measuring their temperature and water loss. Temperature measurements derived from the models accurately matched the body temperature of live frogs placed in the same microhabitat. Operative temperatures were lower than ambient temperatures on a warm day, probably because of evaporative water loss, but they were similar to or even slightly higher than ambient temperatures on a cool day, possibly because of warmth from the substrate. Frogs in the field selected moist and cool habitats, and their body temperatures ranged from 15 to 21 °C. In a temperature gradient in the laboratory, captive frogs chose significantly higher temperatures (19. 4 ± 1. 7 °C) when the gradient floor was covered entirely with wet sand than when sand was wet in the cool end, but dry in the warm end (17. 6 ± 2. 5 °C). The relevance of the preferred temperature was assessed through jumping performance experiments, using frogs with different body temperatures. Jump length was lower at low body temperature (6 °C) than at higher body temperatures, and peaked at 15 °C. Our {{results suggest that the}} frogs select favourable microhabitats of intermediate temperature, which could result in reduced water loss and peak physiological and behavioural performance.

40|$|The {{potassium}} channel toxin secreted {{by the sea}} anemone Bunodosoma granulifera (BgK) is a 37 -amino-acid peptide containing three disulfide bridges. Because a synthetic peptide corresponding to the reported sequence of BgK was found not to fold properly, the sequence was determined again. The new sequence differed from the previous one in the C-terminal tetrapeptide, which contains two cysteines involved in disulfide bridging. The revised sequence is: V C R D W F K E T A C R H A K S L G N <b>C</b> <b>R</b> <b>T</b> S Q K Y R A N C A K T C E L C. The toxin BgK was synthesized {{according to the new}} sequence and folded successfully. Disulfide bridges were assigned by peptide mapping on both natural and synthetic forms to be between Cys 2 -Cys 37, Cys 11 -Cys 30 and Cys 20 -Cys 34. The toxin contains a C-terminal free carboxylate as shown by comparing the native toxin with two synthetic peptides containing the C-terminus in either the carboxylate or carboxamido form. Synthetic BgK inhibits binding of 125 I-alpha-dendrotoxin to rat brain synaptosomal membranes, similarly to natural BgK (nanomolar range). No activity was observed on maxi-K+ channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. The ability of BgK to block voltage-dependent K+ channels was determined from recordings of whole cell currents in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding three cloned Kv 1 channels (Kv 1. 1, Kv 1. 2, Kv 1. 3) and one Kv 3 (Kv 3. 1) channel. The Shaker-related Kv 1 channels are equally affected by BgK, while the Shaw-related channel Kv 3. 1 is insensitive up to 0. 125 microM toxin. Indeed, half blockage of the current through the three Kv 1 channels tested occurred in the same concentration range (Kd = 6 nM for Kv 1. 1, 15 nM for Kv 1. 2, 10 nM for Kv 1. 3). The specificity of BgK for the Shaker-related K+ channels indicates that BgK is able to discriminate a large group of neuronal Kv 1 channels in situ. The sequence, the disulfide bridge pattern, the secondary structure and the biological activity of BgK demonstrated that the sea anemone toxins, i. e. BgK, ShK and Kaliseptine, constitute novel molecular probes useful for investigating K+ channel properties...|$|E

40|$|Probability can {{be viewed}} as a multi-valued logic that extends binary Boolean propositional logic to the case of {{incomplete}} information. The key idea is that the probability P[b/c] of a proposition (statement) b, given the information in proposition c, is a measure of how plausible b is based on c. Boolean logic deals with the special case of complete information where the truth or falsity of b is known from <b>c.</b> <b>R.</b> <b>T</b> Cox was the first to derive the probability logic axioms from those of Boolean logic but this interpretation of probability has a long history and has received increasing interest recently, especially due to E. T Jaynes who emphasized its connection with the information-theoretic ideas stemming from C. E. Shannon's work. It is consistent with the Bayesian point of view that probability represents a degree of belief in a proposition. A. N. Kolmogorov's statement of the probability axioms, which are neutral with respect to the interpretation of probability, {{can be viewed}} as a special case where the statements refer to uncertain membership of an object in a set. Probability logic provides a rigorous unifying framework for treating modeling uncertainty, along with excitation uncertainty, when using models to predict the response of a real system. An overview is given of the foundations of probability logic and its application to quantifying uncertainty for robust predictive analysis of systems. A key concept is a stochastic system model class, which consists of a set of probabilistic input-output predictive models for a system together with a chosen probability distribution, the prior, over this set that quantifies the initial relative plausibility of each predictive model in 473 the set. These probability models are viewed as representing a state of knowledge about the real system, conditional on the available information, and not as inherent properties of the system. Any set of dynamic models for a system can be used to construct a model class through stochastic embedding in which Jaynes' Principle of Maximum Information Entropy plays an important role in establishing the fundamental probability models. A model class can be used to create both prior (initial) and posterior (updated using system data) robust predictive models based purely on the probability axioms. Since there is always uncertainty in choosing a model class to represent a system, one can choose a set of candidate model classes. The probability axioms then lead naturally to prior and posterior hyper-robust predictions that combine the predictions of all model classes in the set. The posterior probabilities of the candidate model classes also give a measure of their relative plausibility based on the data and so can be used for model class selection. In applications, integrals over high-dimensional parameter spaces are usually involved that cannot be evaluated in a straight-forward way. Useful computational tools are Laplace's method of asymptotic approximation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as the Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampler and Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms. Parameter estimation, which selects just one predictive model in the model class, is justified via Laplace's method if the class is globally identifiable based on the data; if not, a posterior robust predictive analysis should be performed using an MCMC method that combines the probabilistic system predictions from each model in the model class...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{presented}} various combinations of custom-designed protein polymers that formed composite hydrogels. In chapter 2, composite hydrogels were prepared by mixing silk-like block copolymers (CP 2 SE 48 CP 2) with collagen-like block copolymers (T 9 CR 4 T 9). We found that {{by adding the}} collagen-like protein polymer the storage modulus, the critical stress and critical strain values of the composite hydrogels were significantly improved {{in comparison to the}} single networks. With cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) we observed that the silk-like fibers were bundled {{in the presence of the}} collagen-like protein polymer, probably due to depletion attraction interactions. In follow-up research on these composite hydrogels in chapter 3, we tried to get more insight into the exact toughening mechanism and self-healing capabilities of the composite network by performing cyclic loading/unloading tests. We found that mechanical hysteresis occurred in these composite hydrogels. The energy that was dissipated could be split into two contributions: a part belonging to the permanent rupture of silk-like fibers, and a viscoelastic part belonging to the assembly and disassembly of collagen-like triple helices. Both these contributions increased as the concentration of the collagen-like protein polymer in the composite network was increased, resulting in toughening of the composite network. Furthermore, it was observed that the silk-like fiber network was not able to recover, while the composites could recover up to 70 % of the original storage modulus after failure. In chapter 4 we studied composite networks of silk-like block copolymers (CP 2 SE 48 CP 2) and a FMOC-functionalized dipeptide (FMOC-LG) which could both form fibers. With cryo-TEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) we found that two different types of fibers were formed, indicating that orthogonal self-assembly occurred in this system. We found with rheology that the storage moduli of the composite fiber networks were significantly higher (75 kPa vs. 400 kPa) than that of the single networks. Strain-hardening present in the FMOC-LG fiber network disappeared when the silk-like protein polymer was present. In chapter 5 hydrogels with both physical and chemical crosslinks were prepared from collagen-like protein polymers (T 9 <b>C</b> <b>R</b> <b>T</b> 9). The chemical crosslinks were introduced by crosslinking lysine residues present in the random-coil middle blocks with glutaraldehyde. We found with rheology that the order in which the physical and chemical networks were formed did not influence the final storage modulus of the hydrogel. Depending on the amount of glutaraldehyde added we found an increase of up to an order of magnitude in the storage modulus for the collagen-like hydrogels. To investigate effects on the nonlinear rheological properties cyclic loading/unloading tests were performed. It was observed that before hydrogel failure occurred no hysteresis was observed between consecutive cycles. Both physical and chemical crosslinks ruptured when the hydrogel was fractured. In chapter 6 we studied hydrogels formed by the co- assembly of an asymmetric silk-collagen-like protein polymer (SH 8 CR 4 T 9) with a symmetric oppositely charged silk-like protein polymer (CP 2 SE 48 CP 2). This was done in a step-wise approach: (1) the S blocks were co-assembled into silk-like fibers. (2) the T blocks were assembled into triple helical nodes by reducing the temperature. We confirmed with confocal laser scanning microscopy and NMR that both monomers were present in the same fibers. With rheology we found that these composite hydrogels did respond in a reversible manner to temperature changes, with which the mechanical strength of the hydrogel can be tuned. In chapter 7 hydrogel formation of a modified silk-like protein polymer with a cysteine-residue attached to the C-terminal side (CP 2 SH 48 CP 2 -Cys) was studied. With rheology we showed that hydrogels that were formed in oxidizing conditions, where disulfide-bridges could form, were much stronger than those formed in reducing conditions. Both hydrogels formed in oxidizing and reducing conditions showed a scaling of modulus versus concentration consistent with entangled semi-flexible networks. This result implied that the disulfide-bridges formed between cysteine-residues formed loops in the coronae of the fibers. The increase in mechanical strength of the fibers was related to the increase in persistence length of the fibers in oxidizing conditions observed with AFM. With self-consistent field theory-simulations it was shown that the formation of loops in the corona resulted in a slight reduction of the lateral pressure in the corona of the fibers. However, this effect is by itself not sufficient to cause a significant change in persistence length. Due to the reduction in lateral pressure, the stacking of monomers into fibers is probably influenced: fibers with a more crystalline structure and with less detects are formed, resulting in improved mechanical properties of the hydrogels. In the general discussion in chapter 8, we reflect on our work, discuss about future directions of research, and possible applications of protein polymers.  ...|$|E

Every labour {{relations}} board {{must have a}} case management System which is suited to its own specific circumstances. In {{the case of the}} Canada Labour Relations Board (C. L. R. B.), it must take into consideration the specific enabling statute, the requirements of a vast geographical dispersion of employers and employees (involving a constant necessity for hearings in remote areas) and the facility to provide service in both official languages — simultaneously when necessary. The jurisdiction of the Board covers operations in the Yukon and Northwest Territories which would normally be under provincial jurisdiction as well as such diverse activities as broad-casting, communications, international and interprovincial transportation of goods and passengers by land, sea or air, grainhandling, uranium mining, longshoring and various Crown corporations such as Canada Post, DEVCO, National Arts Centre and Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The C. L. R. B. has regional offices in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montréal and Halifax staffed by officers who investigate and mediate cases as well as providing information and processing submissions made by parties. These offices are link-ed to the Board in Ottawa by electronic equipment for the transmission of documents. In some cases the employer may be located {{in one part of the}} country while the union headquarters may be in another part of the country and a case could involve such things as an unlawful strike in an entirely different location. In many cases, particularly those involving the acquisition or termination of bargaining rights decisions are made without the conduct of a public hearing. This is accomplished by the report of an investigation officer. Copies of the report of the officer are made available to the parties and they are invited to make written submissions including any challenge they might have as to the accuracy of the report. In certification cases and some other situations, there is a confidential report on the wishes of the employees. This includes verification of union membership cards and a check on the money collected which is traced from receipt of bank deposit. There are spot checks to verify that employees signed of their own free will and where there are any allegations of impropriety there is a more detailed investigation conducted. This information on the wishes of the employees is protected by legislation, but all other material on the files must be provided to the parties in order to ensure that there is no denial of natural justice. Where there are matters of fact in dispute between the parties the Board must conduct public hearings, allow the introduction of evidence and provide for cross examination of witnesses. In 1980, 92 % of all certification cases were disposed without conducting a public hearing. This was possible on the basis of the investigation officers' report and the written submissions of the parties. In certification and similar cases, the Board requires the employer to post notices to employees who may be affected and they may submit interventions to the Board. In some cases dealing with bargaining rights it is necessary for the Board to conduct a secret ballot to determine the wishes of the employees. In national bargaining units and even interprovincial units such as telephone communications, this can involve employees at hundreds of locations widely dispersed. It involves in some cases employees who may be at sea or in the air beyond our national boundaries. Mailed ballots are required in some of these situations. In cases involving complaints of unfair labour practices or unlawful strike or lock-out applications, the Board is obliged to conduct hearings and provide full opportunity for defence before making a finding that a person has acted in violation of the statute. However, many of these cases are settled without a hearing as a result of the mediation provided by officers of the Board. Apart from providing solutions acceptable to the parties an effective mediation program can save considerable time and money which would otherwise be required for travelling and hearing of cases. The Board does not, however, permit any mediation as to the composition of bargaining units lest such a practice should result in employees being denied the benefits of the legislation as a result of their rights being traded away in a compromise solution to differences between the parties. The Board does not delegate the authority to determine who is an employee within the meaning of the legislation or what employees should be included in or excluded from a bargaining unit. The Board is also required to conduct a public hearing before imposing a first collective agreement upon a referral of a dispute from the Minister of Labour. It is up to the Minister of Labour in the first instance to refer such questions to the Board. Upon referral, the imposition of a first collective agreement and its provisions are at the discretion of the Board. Scheduling of hearings in all parts of the country poses significant problems for the CLRB. It is not always possible to determine from the material on file the length of time that may be required to hear a particular case. If a case runs longer than expected an adjournment could make it expensive for the Board to return to the same part of the country for a continuation and hearings have to be scheduled so as to provide the parties with reasonable time to make travel and other arrangements except in the most pressing of cases. Before the commencement of a hearing the Board may conduct a meeting with counsel or principal representatives of the parties to discuss and identify the issues that are agreed upon and those in dispute and the procedures to be followed. This usually results in co-operation of counsel to expedite the hearing. If however it is not possible to complete the hearing in the time allotted without a denial of natural justice, the Board may be able to hear all the evidence and later dispose of the case as a result of written arguments submitted by the parties. The Board has to keep careful control of its case load in order to ensure the fastest possible disposition of cases. Priority is given to cases involving continuing loss. Unlawful strike or lock-out applications and cases involving dismissals normally have high priority. However, an unlawful strike application may lose its priority as a result of a resumption of work or successful mediation. This may mean that the schedule may be altered and other cases moved up for hearing. The Board has a complex System of case control and performance measurement. Weekly reports on priority cases are revised when any changes occur and monthly reports on the disposition of cases are carefully analyzed. In addition the Board measures performance by analyzing the time it takes to acknowledge and transmit each individual case; the time taken to investigate or mediate, to schedule, to hear and to issue a decision and convey it to the parties. These figures are prepared by regions and by types of cases, and are constantly studied to ensure that no avoidable delays occur and that the whole System is constantly sensitive to the need for the promptest possible disposition of cases that is consistent with the strict observance of the requirements of natural justice. These figures are examined by regional directors and their staff and are discussed by the Registrar at meetings with the regional directors and at other staff meetings. The CLRB has the advantage of external evaluation of its performance by many outside observers. Organizations of unions and employers, the legal profession, the academic community and such organizations as the Law Reform Commission are not hesitant to examine and question the operations or decisions of the Board and to prepare briefs or conduct studies on general or very particular matters which may range from proposals to amend the legislation to specific complaints regarding procedures, practices or decisions. These collectively provide a very valuable reflection of the observations of those who are interested in the whole process and knowledgeable of industrial relations...|$|E
