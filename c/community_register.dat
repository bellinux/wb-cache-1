This method of case identification {{was compared to}} that of use of MI <b>community</b> <b>registers</b> set up in accordance with principles adopted in a World Health Organization collaborative programme. The comparison comprised data for four Swedish cities over a number of years. On average 81 % of incident hospital-treated cases below 65 years of age identified through MI <b>community</b> <b>registers</b> were found by the retrospective use of the method based on hospital discharge data and mortality data. Of hospital-treated cases identified by the latter method, 83 % were also found by the MI <b>community</b> <b>registers.</b> For cases fulfilling the diagnostic criteria employed by the MI <b>community</b> <b>registers</b> this proportion would be higher, probably 87 %- 92 %. Several reasons for cases being missed by either method were suggested by the results. According to the findings of this study, the case identification of the method based on hospital discharge data and mortality data seems to be somewhat less efficient compared to use of MI <b>community</b> <b>registers.</b> This may be of importance in descriptive epidemiological studies, but is of less significance in analytical studies. The relative efficiency of the former method could be improved by a more reliable system for the recording of hospital discharges.

Adjustment of individual prevalence rates {{to take account of}} the entire spatial distribution has implications both for epidemiological inference and resource rankings for localities. The more commonly adopted empirical Bayes approaches are here compared with fully Bayes approaches. Fully Bayes methods allow for uncertainty in the prevalence parameters and also permit the inclusion of information from other sources (for example, hospital admissions for mental illness) or from previous studies. The impact of socioeconomic indices on morbidity and its relevance for adjusted prevalence estimates is also considered.

Data {{are based on the}} Upper Bavarian Study, a longitudinal epidemiological study of a representative community sample (n = 1668) in a rural area. Extensive semistructural psychiatric interviews by research physicians were conducted between 1975 and 1977 (n = 1536). Thirteen years after psychiatric assessment, information was obtained from the <b>community</b> <b>register</b> concerning death in the interval, date of death and cause of death according to ICD 9.

Results indicate that alcohol intake and cigarette smoking increased mortality while physical activity and the availability of a steady partner had protective effects. There were no interactive effects between the four variables studied, except far a dramatically increased risk for women drinking more than 20 ml of pure alcohol a day and reporting no physical exercise at wave one assessment. The relative risks of alcohol intake and smoking, and the counteracting effects of physical activity and partnership, are exemplified in the cases of a 40 -year-old female and a 40 -year-old male.

40|$|Background/Objective: Orphan {{drugs are}} {{medicinal}} products which treat life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases which affect small patient populations. So far {{there is a}} substantial knowledge gap on actual expenditure on orphan drugs in Serbia. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} provide insight into the expenditure trends of orphan drugs in Serbia. Material and methods: Annual reports on turnover and the consumption of pharmaceuticals in Serbia published by Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia (ALIMS) for the period 2006 - 2013 were used to extract data on expenditure on orphan drugs. Drugs were eligible for inclusion in the analysis if they had active European orphan designation and European marketing authorization during the period covered by the study (2006 - 2013). Data were analysed across time series. Simple descriptive analysis and observation of chronological trends were applied. Results: Data for annual expenditure on 12 different orphan drugs were available in the analysed reports. Orphan drug expenditure and share of orphan drug expenditure in total drug expenditure increased constantly from 2006 to 2010. Both began to slightly decrease over the next two years (2011 - 2012), and then suddenly declined nearly threefold in 2013. Share of orphan drug expenditure didn't exceed 1 % of total drug expenditure over a period of eight years. The highest share of expenditure on orphan drugs was attributed to imatinib (87. 36 %- 97. 13 %), so abrupt decline in 2013 could be explained by its withdrawal from European <b>Community</b> <b>Register</b> of Orphan Medicinal Products in 2012. Conclusions: Expenditure on orphan drugs in Serbia from 2006 to 2013 was considerably low compared to total expenditure on drugs. In the last available year we noted substantial decline of orphan drug expenditure, mainly because of imatinib losing its orphan designation. A broader time horizon would be needed to investigate long term trends...|$|E

In this study, the writer investigated the register used in cinematography community come from Universitas Brawijaya named Nol Derajat film when they make Reflection movie. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to answer the following questions: 1). What are the registers and their meaning used in the process of making Reflection movie by Nol Derajat film community? 2). What are the functional contexts of register found in the process of making Reflection movie by Nol Derajat film community? and 3). What are the factors facilitating the use of the registers?This study used a qualitative approach. The data were utterances which contain register. In collecting the data, the writer used documentation (as the primary instrument) and interview. In data analysis, the writer put the data into a table to define the literal meaning and register meaning. Then, the writer analyze the aspect of functional context which consist of field, mode and tenor using Halliday and Hasan 2 ̆ 7 s (1985) theory and analyzed the factor facilitating the use of register using Yule 2 ̆ 7 s (2006) theory. The result of this study revealed that there were 20 registers used in the process of making movie. They are Action, bocor, camera, choose, clipper, cut, detail, focus, freeze, in-frame, lighting, longshot, noise, reflector, rolling, scene, shot, sound, take, and talent. All those registers have 2 different meanings namely literal meaning and register meaning. The writer found the field and the tenor of all utterances different due to different topic and speaker in each conversation. However, the mode of all utterances is the same that is spoken language. Then, thewriter found the factor facilitating the use of those registers that is the context of the sentence. The context was divided into situational context (shooting location), occupational (among filmmaker), and topical (talking about something importantin making movie). For further study in register, the writer suggests that the next writers who want to conduct a study on register phenomena analyze it in other communities, such as photography community and use different technique, such as key person technique.

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{a recent}} armed {{conflict}} in Guinea-Bissau, we observed a marked {{decline in the}} case fatality among hospitalized children at the only paediatric department in the country. AIM: To analyse the causes behind the observed fall in case fatality. MATERIAL: All children hospitalized at the only paediatric department {{in the capital of}} Guinea-Bissau. The war cohort comprised all children hospitalized during the war, which lasted from June 1998 to May 1999, and the peace cohort comprised all children hospitalized in the year preceding the war. As part of a longitudinal community study, we also registered all children being hospitalized from the Bandim Health Project's study area, including routinely collected information on socio-economic background factors. METHODS: The war cohort was compared with the peace cohort in terms of determinants for hospital case fatality. Through information in the <b>community</b> <b>register,</b> we examined post-hospital mortality in the 2 wk after discharge as well as socio-economic differences in recruitment during the war. Hospital case fatality was estimated by odds ratios and compared by multiple logistic regression. Community mortality risk was estimated by deaths per person years. RESULTS: The case fatality among children aged 0 - 14 y fell during the war (age-adjusted OR = 0. 58; 95 % CI: 0. 50 - 0. 68). There was a uniform reduction in case fatality among children hospitalized less than 7 d, while we observed no decline among children hospitalized longer. There were more children per bed during the war and mean hospitalization time was shorter, and post-discharge mortality also fell (mortality ratio (MR) = 0. 57; 95 % CI: 0. 40 - 0. 83). Adjustment for socio-economic confounders in recruitment during the war period made no difference to the estimated decline in case fatality. The decline in case fatality at the hospital was not explained by a general decline in mortality. Compared with the preceding year, the mortality ratio was 1. 34 (1. 20 - 1. 51) in the Bandim Health Project's study area during the war. Adjusted for age, the decline in case fatality at the hospital was most marked for disadvantaged groups. For example, the general reduction in case fatality was 42 % (95 % CI: 11 - 63); however, children of mothers without any schooling experienced a reduction of 73 % (95 % CI: 27 - 90 %), whereas the reduction was only 33 % (95 % CI: 14 - 61 %) for children of mothers with school education. CONCLUSION: The decline in case fatality could be explained neither by a general decline in childhood mortality nor by changes in recruitment or discharge policy. The decline was therefore most likely due to improved treatment as a result of better availability of drugs funded by humanitarian aid and the presence of dedicated staff, which was offered relief food as compensation. Interventions improving case management may have a proportionately larger effect for poor families...|$|E
