40|$|Carbon (C) {{dynamics}} in grassland ecosystem contributes to regional and global fluxes in carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations. Grazing {{is one of}} the main structuring factors in grassland, but the impact of grazing on the C budget is still under debate. In this study, in situ net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) observations by the eddy covariance technique were integrated with a modified process-oriented biogeochemistry model (denitrification-decomposition) to investigate the impacts of grazing on the long-term C budget of semiarid grasslands. NEE measurements were conducted in two adjacent grassland sites, non-grazing (NG) and moderate grazing (MG), during 2006 - 2007. We then used daily weather data for 1978 - 2007 in conjunction with soil properties and grazing scenarios as model inputs to simulate grassland productivity and C dynamics. The observed and simulated CO 2 fluxes under moderate grazing intensity were compared with those without grazing. NEE data from 2 -year observations showed that moderate grazing significantly decreased grassland ecosystem CO 2 release and shifted the ecosystem from a negative <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> (releasing 34. 00 g C m(- 2)) at the NG site to a positive <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> (absorbing - 43. 02 g C m(- 2)) at the MG site. Supporting our experimental findings, the 30 -year simulation also showed that moderate grazing significantly enhances the CO 2 uptake potential of the targeted grassland, shifting the ecosystem from a negative <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> (57. 08 +/- 16. 45 g C m(- 2) year(- 1)) without grazing to a positive <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> (- 28. 58 +/- 14. 60 g C m(- 2) year(- 1)) under moderate grazing. The positive effects of grazing on <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> could primarily be attributed to an increase in productivity combined with a significant decrease of soil heterotrophic respiration and total ecosystem respiration. We conclude that moderate grazing prevails over no-management practices in maintaining <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> in semiarid grasslands, moderating and mitigating the negative effects of global climate change on the <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> in grassland ecosystems...|$|R

This paper[1] presents a model developed to gain a realistic understanding of the heterogeneous roles of capoeira (fallow agricultural land) in land use dynamics and <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> in the Brazilian Amazon. The model estimates the areas and <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> {{of different types of}} capoeira in association with different farming activities and also monitors carbon intensity over time in the context of technological trajectories (distinct farming systems). Modeling with agricultural census data compared six different, competing technological trajectories of capoeira for changes in major land use variables and impacts on <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> from 1990 to 2011. Results revealed that: a) technological trajectories contribute differently to net emissions of CO 2, with livestock for meat enterprises being the highest net emitters and peasant agroforestry and plantation enterprises the lower emitters; b) carbon intensity tends to diminish over time because of increased weight of trajectories with lower carbon intensity, in combination with reduced carbon intensity of trajectories with higher carbon intensity; and c) for most trajectories, reuse of “old land” becomes increasingly more important for explaining the essence of agricultural dynamics, including <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance,</b> than is deforestation for opening up new agricultural land. These results draw attention to the role of capoeiras in modernization and intensification of the agricultural sector through renovation of deforested land.

Light response curves and leaf N contents (Nlf) were evaluated in the upper, middle and lower canopy. Diurnal variation of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was used to adjust LRC measured only once a day. Canopy photosynthesis (Pcan) was modeled using three canopy layers and three LRC.

Altogether 30 study plots, each 120 cm x 120 cm in size, were randomly distributed between three treatments (n= 10) : ambient control, UV-A control and UV-B treatment. The UV-B-treated plots were exposed to elevated UV-B radiation level for three growing seasons. The instantaneous net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) and dark respiration (R-TOT) were measured {{during the growing season}} using a closed chamber method. The wintertime CO 2 emissions were estimated using a gradient technique by analyzing the CO 2 concentration in the snow pack. In addition to the instantaneous CO 2 exchange, the seasonal <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balances</b> during the growing seasons were modeled using environmental data measured at the site. In general, the instantaneous NEE at light saturation was slightly higher in the UV-B treatment compared with the ambient control, but the gross photosynthesis was unaffected by the exposure. The R-TOT was significantly lower under elevated UV-B in the third study year. The modeled seasonal (June-September) <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> varied between the years depending on the ground water level and temperature conditions. During the driest year, the seasonal <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> was negative (net release of CO 2) in the ambient control and the UV-B treatment was CO 2 neutral.

The CO 2 detector was calibrated using a certified CO 2 free gas standard to set the zero point (1  % methane, balance nitrogen Scotty Analyzed Gases, Plumsteadville, PA, USA) and another gas standard for the span (a gas standard of 1010  ppm <b>CO</b> 2, <b>balance</b> nitrogen, Scotty Analyzed Gases, Plumsteadville, PA, USA). Linearity of the CO 2 detector was assessed by diluting the gas standard (1010  ppm <b>CO</b> 2, <b>balance</b> nitrogen) with medical grade compressed air using mass flow controllers to produce final CO 2 concentrations of 50.5, 101, 505 and 1010  ppm. The CO 2 detector response agreed with the prepared gas standard to within 3.3  % for the four values measured, with values creating a line with a slope of 1.0006 and an R 2 value of 0.9998 when plotting measured concentration versus expected concentration (data not shown).|$|R
40|$|Leaf {{photosynthesis}} and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase {{activation level}} were inhibited in several mutants of the C 3 crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana which possess lesions in the photorespiratory pathway. This inhibition occurred when leaves were illuminated under a photorespiratory atmosphere (50 % O 2, 350 microliters per liter <b>CO</b> 2, <b>balance</b> N 2), {{but not in}} nonphotorespiratory conditions (2 % O 2, 350 microliters per liter <b>CO</b> 2, <b>balance</b> N 2). Inhibition of carboxylase activation level was observed in strains with deficient glycine decarboxylase, serine transhydroxymethylase, serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase, glutamate synthase, and chloroplast dicarboxylate transport activities, but inhibition did not occur in a glycolate-P phosphatase-deficient strain. Also, the photorespiration inhibitor aminoacetonitrile produced a decline in leaf and protoplast ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activation level, but was without effect on intact chloroplasts. Fructose bisphosphatase, a light-activated enzyme which {{is strongly dependent on}} stromal pH and Mg 2 + for regulation, was unaffected by conditions which caused inhibition of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition does not appear to involve changes in stromal Mg 2 + and pH but rather is associated with metabolite flux through the photorespiratory pathway...|$|R
40|$|Biodegradable Polymers from Renewable Resources {{may be seen}} as a {{solution}} of today's paramount environmental problems, i. e. limited landfill and incineration capacity, the limited nature of fossile resources and the global <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance.</b> In reality, however, much research activities will be necessary, until associated and functionality converting steps will lead to products competitive with today's petrochemical polymers. In addition, waste management based on biological methods has to be established widley until the property of biodegradability will be of any benefit...|$|R
40|$|Black liquor {{gasification}} (BLG) {{is currently}} being developed as an alternative technology for energy and chemical recovery at chemical pulp mills. In the gasification process the black liquor is converted to a syngas, {{which can be used}} for e. g. production of renewable motor fuels or electricity generation. This study examines how different assumptions regarding systems surrounding the pulpmill, for example the electricity generation system, affect the <b>CO</b> 2 emission <b>balances</b> for different BLG concepts. Different final products are considered, including DME, methanol, FT-diesel and electricity. Both a market pulp mill and an integrated pulp and paper mill are considered as host mill for the BLG plant to investigate how the mill influences the <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balances.</b> Furthermore, the consequences of limited availability of biomass are shown, i. e. biomass is not necessarily considered as CO 2 -neutral. The results show that the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions by introducing BLG is generally much higher for a market pulp mill than for an integrated pulp and paper mill. Electricity generation from the syngas is favoured when assuming high grid electricity CO 2 emissions where as motor fuel production is favoured when assuming low grid electricity CO 2 emissions. When considering the consequences of limited availability of biomass, the <b>CO</b> 2 emission <b>balances</b> are strongly affected, in some cases changing the results from a decrease to an increase of the CO 2 emissions...|$|R
40|$|Quantification of an ecosystem's {{carbon balance}} and its {{components}} is pivotal for understanding both ecosystem functioning and global cycling. Several methods are being applied in parallel {{to estimate the}} different components of the <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance.</b> However, different methods are subject to different sources of error. Therefore, {{it is necessary that}} site level component estimates are cross-checked against each other before being reported. Here we present a two-step approach for testing the accuracy and consistency of eddy covariance-based gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) estimates with biometric measurements of net primary production (NPP autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) respiration. The test starts with closing the <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> to account for reasonable errors in each of the component fluxes. Failure to do so within the constraints will classify the flux estimates on the site level as inconsistent. If the <b>CO</b> 2 <b>balance</b> can be closed, the test continues by comparing the closed site level Ra/GPP with the Rh/GPP ratio. The consistency of these ratios is then judged against expert knowledge. Flux estimates of sites that pass both steps are considered consistent. An inconsistent ratio is not necessarily incorrect but provides a signal for careful data screening that may require further analysis to identify the possible biological reasons of the unexpected ratios. We reviewed the literature and found 16 sites, {{out of a total of}} 529 research forest sites, that met the data requirements for the consistency test. Thirteen of these sites passed both steps of the consistency cross-check. Subsequently, flux ratios (NPP/GPP, Rh/NPP, Rh/Re, and Re/GPP) were calculated for the consistent sites. Similar ratios were observed at sites which lacked information to check consistency, indicating that the flux data that are currently used for validating models and testing ecological hypotheses are largely consistent across a wide range of site productivities. Confidence in the output of flux networks could be further enhanced if the required fluxes are independently estimated at all sites for multiple years and harmonized methods are used...|$|R
