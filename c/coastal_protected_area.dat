This has been achieved at low cost by using the voluntary sector. The project incorporates scientists, wetland managers, students, scholars and other citizens under the auspices of an international volunteer network (TAIB), working in partnership with the Parc management team. Long-term monitoring over a 25 -year span of subjects as varied as insects, birds, land and aquatic ecosystems and communities has led to an improved ecological understanding of socio-economic as well as environmental impacts and threats for the catchment. This paper illustrates the added value of a long-term ecological knowledge base for decision making and capacity building in protected areas in order to reduce environmental impacts from socio-economic development in surrounding coastal zones. It describes how the science base has been used as a means of communication to encourage early action by policy makers to avoid negative outcomes of costly future impact on the public purse; and highlights how the economic value of long-term monitoring as an early warning system far outweighs the modest cost to society of an integrated participatory project based in the volunteer sector.

40|$|Tidal flats provide {{ecosystem}} services to billions of people worldwide, yet their changing status is largely unknown. In the Yellow Sea region of East Asia, tidal flats {{are the principal}} coastal ecosystem fringing more than 4000 [*]km of the coastlines of China, North Korea and South Korea. However, widespread loss of areal extent, increasing frequency of algal blooms, hypoxic dead zones and jellyfish blooms, and declines of commercial fisheries and migratory bird populations suggest that this ecosystem is degraded and declining. Here, we apply the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Ecosystems criteria to the Yellow Sea tidal flat ecosystem and determine that its status is endangered. Comparison of standardized remotely sensed habitat data and historic topographic map data indicated {{that in the last}} 50 years, a decline of more than 50 % but less than 80 % of tidal flat extent has occurred (criterion A 1). Although restricted to a narrow band along the coastline, Yellow Sea tidal flats are sufficiently broadly distributed to be classified as least concern under criterion B. However, widespread pollution, algal blooms and declines of invertebrate and vertebrate fauna across the region result in a classification of endangered (C 1, D 1). Owing to the lack of long-term monitoring data and the unknown impacts of severe biotic and abiotic change, the ecosystem was scored as data deficient for Criterion E and several subcriteria. Our assessment demonstrates an urgent need to arrest the decline of the Yellow Sea tidal flat ecosystem, which could be achieved by (i) improved coastal planning and management at regional and national levels, (ii) expansion of the <b>coastal</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> network, and (iii) improved managed of existing protected areas to reduce illegal land reclamation and coastal exploitation...|$|E

40|$|Sandy coastlines are {{sensitive}} ecosystems where human activities can have considerable negative impacts. In particular, trampling by beach visitors is a disturbance that affects dune vegetation {{both at the}} species and community level. In this study we assess {{the effects of the}} limitation of human trampling on dune vegetation in a <b>coastal</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> of Central Italy. We compare plant species diversity in two recently fenced sectors with that of an unfenced area (and therefore subject to human trampling) using rarefaction curves and a diversity/dominance approach during a two year study period. Our results indicate that limiting human trampling seems to be a key factor in driving changes in the plant diversity of dune systems. In 2007 the regression lines of species abundance as a function of rank showed steep slopes and high Y-intercept values in all sectors, indicating a comparable level of stress and dominance across the entire study site. On the contrary, in 2009 the regression lines of the two fenced sectors clearly diverge from that of the open sector, showing less steep slopes. This change in the slopes of the tendency lines, evidenced by the diversity/dominance diagrams and related to an increase in species diversity, suggests the recovery of plant communities in the two fences between 2007 and 2009. In general, plant communities subject to trampling tended to be poorer in species and less structured, since only dominant and tolerant plant species persisted. Furthermore, limiting trampling appears to have produced positive changes in the dune vegetation assemblage after a period of only two years. These results are encouraging for the management of coastal dune systems. They highlight how a simple and cost-effective management strategy, based on passive recovery conservation measures (i. e., fence building), can be a quick (1 - 2 years) and effective method for improving and safeguarding the diversity of dune plant communities...|$|E
40|$|Protected areas {{often need}} to provide {{recreational}} opportunities whilst conserving biodiversity. Recreation brings important benefits to human well-being, and allowing people to experience nature in protected areas can also provide revenue and support for conservation objectives. However, not all recreational activities are compatible with environmental management goals. Here, we show how a <b>coastal</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> can be zoned to satisfy both recreational and conservation objectives. We collected empirical data {{on the effect of}} recreational disturbance to foraging shorebirds in Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland, Australia, and calculated the benefit of alternative protected area zone types on shorebird representation using a zero-inflated negative binomial model. The predictions from this model were used to optimize a zoning plan in a linear programming framework that balances recreational use with shorebird conservation. Costs reflect foregone recreational opportunity, thereby facilitating solutions that minimize restrictions on recreational use of the coastline. We discover a consistent negative effect of recreational use of the foreshore on shorebird occupancy and abundance and show that, despite this, zoning can be used to achieve shorebird representation targets with only a small cost to recreational opportunity. When dog recreation is permitted at all sites, a 91 % shorebird representation target can be met, indicating that de facto patterns of recreation were rather well segregated from areas used by shorebirds. By restricting dog recreation to five sites and allowing people to access all other foreshore sites, shorebird representation increased to 97 %. Synthesis and applications. Our approach of calculating the contribution of each zone type towards conservation objectives results in zoning plans with robust estimates of conservation benefit that can be readily implemented by managers. Specifically, we estimated the effects of removing people and domestic dog recreation within each intertidal site on shorebird abundance to inform coastal zoning plans. Incorporating cost as foregone recreational opportunity results in zoning plans that minimize the number of people required to make a behavioural change. Compliance to zone types is often ultimately voluntary so integrating the current intensity of recreational use is more likely to generate workable zoning plans...|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic Ocean Circulation Models and Lagrangian {{particle}} tracking {{models are}} valuable tools e. g. in coastal ecology {{to identify the}} connectivity between offshore spawning and coastal nursery areas of commercially important fish, for risk assessment and more for defining or evaluating marine protected areas. Most studies are based on only one model and do not provide levels of uncertainty. Here this uncertainty was addressed by applying a suite of 11 North Sea models to test what variability can be expected concerning connectivity. Different notional test cases were calculated related to three important and well-studied North Sea fish species: herring (Clupea harengus), and the flatfishes sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). For sole and plaice we determined which fraction of particles released in the respective spawning areas would reach a coastal marine protected area. For herring we determined the fraction located in a wind park after a predefined time span. As temperature {{is more and more}} a focus especially in biological and global change studies, furthermore inter-model variability in temperatures experienced by the virtual particles was determined. The main focus was on the transport variability originating from the physical models and thus biological behavior was not included. Depending on the scenario, median experienced temperatures differed by 3 °C between years. The range between the different models in one year was comparable to this temperature range observed between modelled years. Connectivity between flatfish spawning areas and the <b>coastal</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> was highly dependent on the release location and spawning time. No particles released in the English Channel in the sole scenario reached the protected area while up to 20 % of the particles released in the plaice scenario did. Interannual trends in transport directions and connectivity rates were comparable between models but absolute values displayed high variations. Most models showed systematic biases during all years in comparison to the ensemble median, indicating that in general interannual variation was represented but absolute values varied. In conclusion: variability between models is generally high and management decisions or scientific analysis using absolute values from only one single model might be biased and results or conclusions drawn from such studies need to be treated with caution. We further concluded that more true validation data for particle modelling are required...|$|E
