In order to evaluate melting and scattering characteristics of the fuse, we applied to 8 / 20 µs surge current, overload current and external thermal stress such as flame of fire. From the experimental results, the fuse element was melted and scattered by applied surge current(above 0. 79 kA) and overload current(above 4. 5 A). It was also attached to the inner surface of the fuse tube. The fuse element was attached as a thin film on inner sur-face of fuse tube when large surge current was applied.

50|$|A {{common design}} of fuse box that was {{featured}} on homes built from 1940 to 1965 was the 60-amp fuse box that featured four plug fuses (i.e. Edison base) for branch circuits {{and one or}} more <b>fuse</b> blocks containing <b>cartridge</b> <b>fuses</b> for purposes such as major appliance circuits. After 1965, the more substantial 100 A panel with three-wire (230 V) service became common; a fuse box could have fuse blocks for the main shut-off and an electric range circuit plus a number of plug fuses (Edison base or Type S) for individual circuits.|$|R

5000|$|The Greenwich Heritage Centre is {{situated}} in the western and southern range of a quadrangle of buildings known as New Laboratory Square or Building 41, a former storehouse designed by James Wyatt, dating from 1783-85.

Further storehouses were added to form {{the north and east}} sides of the square in 1808-10. By 1860 the whole complex had been taken over by the Royal Laboratory department and converted into a factory to make boxes and barrels for the storage and carriage of ammunition, powder, <b>cartridges,</b> <b>fuses</b> and other items; the west range contained the wood store, the east range had a sawmill with a cooperage above it, the north range contained a steam engine, which powered the machinery by way of line shafting.|$|R

5000|$|Soon he {{discovered}} {{that he had to}} design machinery to make its parts. One of the first was a tapping machine, also his patent. Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to slot screw heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. <b>cartridge</b> <b>fuses</b> and fuse block, lamp holders, key sockets - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within." [...] Hubbell's pace of new ideas and product design did not falter. In 1909 the company began constructing a four-floor factory and office building that woul d become the first building in New England made of reinforced concrete.|$|R
50|$|The global {{recession}} of 1975 affected Schurter, {{and the company}} was forced to abandon the <b>fuse</b> <b>cartridge</b> and screw business. In 1981 Bruno Schurter established Schurter, Inc. in California. By 1984 {{more than two-thirds of}} sales from Switzerland were exported to other countries. Rolf's son Hans-Rudolph, the current President of the company, joined in 1986. In the following year, Rolf Schurter turned management of the company over to Hans-Rudolph Schurter. In 1990, all activities were consolidated under the umbrella of Schurter Holding AG. This move facilitated the series of acquisitions that are still taking place today. In that year Schurter SSRO was established in the Czech Republic to expand production of power entry module products.|$|R

And two really very large and almost complete specimens of some species of Ammonites unknown to me, from the hills to the east of the Adige, partially wrapped in a back number of the Corriere della Sera, that were pressed upon me by a friendly officer, were unfortunately lost on the line between Verona and Milan through the gross negligence of a railway porter.

The company got its start {{producing}} <b>fuse</b> <b>cartridges,</b> screw heads and set screws. Heinrich's son Rolf joined the company in the 1940s to help manage the accounting and bookkeeping. Fuseholders were added to the product line in 1944, and the company's first catalog was printed. During the 1940s Schurter products began to be listed in reseller's catalogs. The company moved to its current facilities established at Werkhofstrasse 8 in 1948. The company was transformed into a limited liability company in 1949. In 1964 the company had grown to 194 employees. By 1968, component sales amounted to two-thirds of Schurter's business due to increasing exports. Hienrich Schurter died that year. Schurter GmbH was established in Endingen, Germany in 1971 under Managing Director Kaspar Egli, who came from Lucerne to run the business.|$|R
