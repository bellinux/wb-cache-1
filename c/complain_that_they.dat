5|$|Combs {{also won}} {{approval}} of a $10million bond issue to benefit the state parks, which had poor lodging and few amenities. Combs combined the bond issue with $10million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around the parks {{did not come to}} fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to the parks. Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not get reservations in the parks during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a reservation system that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.|$|E

25|$|The ethos {{at the end}} of the 19th {{century and}} the {{increasing}} influence of the Olympic Games made amateurism an issue in many sports. It was especially relevant in cycle racing because riders had begun travelling internationally to compete in track, or velodrome, races. Riders from one country would <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were at a disadvantage to those from another, that they were riding against what they considered to be professionals.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in the Americas of the 19th century, {{slaves in}} the Middle East were allowed to own land, and their {{children}} were generally not born into slavery. Also conversion to Islam precluded further servitude and gave freedom. Skin color played a distinctive role even amongst slaves. Many activists amongst Afro-Iraqis <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are unable to find opportunities to improve their social condition. However, the same complaint is often also made by Iraqis of Arab Semitic descent as well.|$|E
25|$|I {{had been}} having some {{difficulty}} with the relief committee of the Denver smelter men. At first we had been giving out relief at such a rate that I had to tell the chairman that he was providing the smelter men with more than they had had while at work. Then he cut down the rations until the wives of the smelter men began to <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not getting enough to eat.

In {{the days leading up to}} the commencement ceremony, Washington University Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton explained the trustees' decision to award Schlafly’s degree with the following statement:In bestowing this degree, the University is not endorsing Mrs. Schlafly's views or opinions; rather, it is recognizing an alumna of the University whose life and work have had a broad impact on American life and have sparked widespread debate and controversies that in many cases have helped people better formulate and articulate their own views about the values they hold.|$|E

Portnoy stated that while he appreciated the devotion of Dream Theater's fans, he was frustrated because he was [...] "constantly tearing [...] away from [...] family" [...] to give more to the fans. He found it discouraging that, even though he spent [...] "countless nights" [...] writing special setlists and the band spent days rehearsing, some fans would still <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> went to a show and did not hear [...] "Pull Me Under".

2500|$|American parents <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are {{essentially}} alone {{in dealing with}} foreign courts and legal systems. [...] The US State Department has a virtual monopoly on information in such cases, but refuses {{to act as a}} vigorous advocate for left-behind American parents while also preventing the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children or anyone else from playing that role. State Department attorney Thomas Johnson remarked that when he reminded one senior State Department official with Child Abduction Convention responsibilities that she works for the American people, her immediate response was: [...] "I don’t work for the American people; I work for the Secretary of State", [...] demonstrating the Department's inherent conflict of interest (i.e., a desire to maintain [...] "good" [...] bilateral foreign relations for their own sake that overrides assertive and effective advocacy on behalf of American citizens).|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} fools enter the synagogue, and seeing people occupying {{themselves}} with the law, ask how a person learns the law. They answer that first a person reads from children’s materials, then from the Torah, then from the Prophets ( [...] , Nevi'im), and then from the Writings ( [...] , Ketuvim). Then the person learns the Talmud, then the law ( [...] , halachah), and then the Midrash ( [...] , haggadot). Hearing this, fools ask themselves when they can learn all that, and turn to leave. Rabbi Jannai compared this to a loaf suspended in the air. The fool exclaims {{that no one can}} bring it down. But the wise person says that someone put it there and takes a ladder or stick and brings it down. So fools <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are unable to read all the law. But wise people learn a chapter every day until they read all the law. God said in [...] "it is not too hard for you," [...] but if you find it too hard, it is your own fault, because you do not study it.|$|E
