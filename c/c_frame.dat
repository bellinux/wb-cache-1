In 1 BT motion estimation algorithm, the 8 -bit current frame (<b>c</b> <b>frame)</b> and reference frame (p frame) are transformed into their 1 -bit representation image, before calculating the Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) and performing the search operations. For our proposed algorithm, a smoothing threshold (Threshold S) is {{incorporated into the}} filtering kernel, {{which is used to}} perform the transformation from 8 -bit image into its 1 BT image. This smoothing technique can greatly reduce the scattering noise created in the 1 BT image. After transformation, the 1 BT image for the <b>c</b> <b>frame</b> and p frame is divided into macroblocks. The macroblock in the <b>c</b> <b>frame</b> will be first compared to the macroblock at the same position in the p frame. If the SAD is below the preprocessing threshold (Threshold P), the macroblock is considered to have negligible movement and search operation is not required. This preprocessing technique can greatly reduce the total number of search operations. Simulation results show that an improvement up to 0. 64 dB, with reduction in search operation up to 93. 36 % is achieved for video conferencing sequences.

Equivalent linear models may however be used to simulate their behaviour at a fixed displacement amplitude and frequency, with an acceptable approximation level.

In fact, the presence of full infilled frames, with regular distribution, could improve the seismic response and mitigate horizontal displacements. On the other hand, an irregular distributions of infill could dramatically modify the stiffness and resistance of structures resulting in a brittle collapse mechanism related with soft story or torsional effects. In this study it has been evaluated the seismic behaviour of frames designed to bear only gravity load; a simulated design procedure has been adopted, according to code provisions and design practices in force in Italy between 1950 s and 1970 s. A parametric study has been performed {{to take into account the}} typical mechanical properties of masonry available in Italy. Infill panels have been modelled by means of equivalent struts. A pushover analysis has been carried out to evaluate the capacity curves and collapse mechanisms of infilled frames.

The results emphasize as the properties of masonry infills should be adequately evaluated before doing a seismic analysis as the masonry shear strength significantly influences the global seismic behaviour of RC <b>frames.</b> Keywords—Infilled R. <b>C.</b> <b>frames,</b> masonry infills, ductility R. <b>C.</b> <b>frames,</b> seismic vulnerability.

Different rehabilitation systems {{have been developed to}} upgrade the seismic performance of this kind of structures before being subjected to an earthquake: in particular, buckling restrained steel braces (BRB) offer many advantages. BRB differs from conventional braces in that it is capable of yielding both in tension and compression instead of buckling thus exhibiting very favorable and stable energy-dissipating characteristics. The present paper deals with the seismic protection of reinforced concrete frames. In particular a displacement-based procedure to design dissipative BRB for the seismic protection of existing r. c. frames is proposed. This procedure can be easily applied to multi-fold performance objective to protect the structure against collapse and to avoid non-structural damage by limiting global displacements and interstorey drifts so that structural and infill integrity is granted under a given seismic event.
