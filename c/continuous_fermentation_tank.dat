Nisin Z was separated from the fermentation broth using various kinds of adsorbents including Amberlite IR- 120 B, CM Sephadex C- 25, Celite, and Sep-Pak cartridges. The Sep-Pak (tC_ 18, C_ 18, C_ 8, and tC_ 2) cartridges showed a substantial capacity for nisin Z adsorption.

Using the batch fermentation equations, models predicting butyric acid selectivity for <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentation</b> were also developed. The model showed that butyric acid production was a strong function of cell mass, while acetic acid production was a function of cell growth rate. Further, it was found that at high acetic acid concentrations, acetic acid was metabolized to butyric acid and that this conversion could be modeled. In batch fermentation, high butyric acid selectivity occurred at high initial cell or glucose concentrations. In <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentation,</b> decreased dilution rate improved selectivity; at a dilution rate of 0. 028 h− 1, the selectivity reached 95. 8 %.

The percentage of cellular nitrogen in the nonlipid biomass changed dramatically {{over the course of the}} batch fermentation and was greatly affected by the dilution rate in steady-state <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentations.</b> Lactose was used both for the accumulation of nonnitrogenous nonlipid biomass and lipid;The specific rates of change in various substrates and products were calculated with respect to the cellular nitrogen concentration. The results for batch fermentations indicated that there was a constant specific rate of lactose uptake. The specific rate of lipid accumulation which increased during the fermentation was accompanied by a parallel decrease in the specific rate of conversion of lactose to nonnitrogenous nonlipid biomass. During the later stage of the fermentation when most of the lipid accumulation occurred, a constant and maximum specific rate of lipid accumulation was observed. This observation was consistent with the hypothesis that a single enzyme step controls the rate of lipid accumulation;The batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>fermentations</b> were satisfactorily described by a kinetic model in which the specific rates of accumulation or uptake were expressed with respect to the cellular nitrogen concentration.
