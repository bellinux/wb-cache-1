5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor {{to defend against}} the same and nothing more, and a high top speed so that they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from slower but much better armored capital ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{theory is that}} Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away.</b> If all the troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks down. If they had all {{remained}} at the pass, {{they would have been}} encircled and would eventually have all been killed. By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the outcome is unknown. No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with, we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E

5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide {{the best way to}} get in and out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies to get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the band's {{popularity}} {{began to}} soar as the band, especially Dee and Jay Jay, {{started to talk}} (rap) to the audience about current topics of the day between songs.

25|$|The Wykagyl {{course is}} hilly, tree-lined and very {{beautiful}} accented by its stone tees. It is old fashioned, primarily because the three architects who were mainly {{responsible for the}} layout of the course - Lawrence Van Enen, Donald Ross and A. W. Tillinghast - all practiced their art over 60 years ago. Because of this it has small greens and more blind shots than any architect <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with designing today.|$|E

25|$|Ridgway {{was born}} in Stockport, Cheshire, England on 10 August 1923. As a county cricketer, Ridgway, {{although}} not appearing a likely successful pace bowler because of his slight build, was the mainstay of Kent's opening attack for a decade after World War II, except {{on the rare occasions}} that Jack Martin <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from business. Ridgway did not play regularly in 1946, but the following year he jumped into prominence with 12 for 86 on a rain-affected pitch against Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|According to another, whilst {{he was a}} shepherd, one day he drew a {{line around}} his sheep with his staff so that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> to collect food. On his return, {{he found that the}} flock had not left the {{invisible}} boundary. This miracle may have taken place in a field near Chidham, which for centuries was known as ‘St Cuthman’s Field’ or ‘St Cuthman’s Dell.’ It was said that a large stone in the field, ‘on which the holy shepherd was in the habit of sitting,’ held miraculous properties.|$|E
25|$|The main {{proponent of}} using {{ejection}} seats was James Chamberlin, {{head of the}} engineering division of NASA's Space Force Task Group. Chamberlin had never liked the Mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight. He reviewed several films of Atlas and Titan II ICBM failures, which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the Titan II would produce a much smaller explosion, thus the spacecraft <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with ejection seats.|$|E

25|$|On 13 October several French corps marched west on {{the south}} side of the Danube. Napoleon still hoped to {{encircle}} Mack's forces south of the river. He seemed unaware of the possibility that the Austrians <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> on the north bank. That day, Napoleon heard from Ney that only Dupont's division and some cavalry occupied the north bank in force. The French emperor ordered Ney and Marshal Joachim Murat to shift their forces to the north side of the river the next day. Also on the 13th, Soult wiped out General-Major Karl Spangen von Uyternesse's brigade in the Battle of Memmingen, capturing 4,600 men at the cost of 16 casualties.|$|E
25|$|Human use of {{the brook}} began {{at the start of}} the 20th century, when The Educational Alliance (EA), a New York City Jewish {{organization}} that sought to better integrate Jews into American life, bought the land around the brook's headwaters and dammed the brook to create Surprise Lake Camp, where Jewish boys from the Lower East Side of Manhattan <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> from the city during the summer. Its early alumni included Eddie Cantor, who later said it was at the camp that he realized he wanted to be an entertainer. After going through several organizational parents in its first decades, the camp assumed control of its own affairs in the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Pahlen sent {{messengers}} to Nangis {{pleading for}} assistance, but Ignaz Splény de Miháldi's division had already marched off leaving only Anton Leonhard von Hardegg's Austrian division from Wrede's V Corps. Hardegg had some infantry battalions in Nangis and two cavalry regiments in Bailly. The Austrian division commander declined to assist his ally and ordered an immediate retreat. However, before they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away,</b> the two Austrian cavalry regiments were disordered by the fleeing Cossacks and then scattered by Piré's and August Lamotte's horsemen. The Russian infantry's withdrawal continued, {{leaving a trail}} of casualties from artillery fire. On the outskirts of Grandpuits they were finally brought to halt by Ludot's brigade which was now blocking the Russian line of retreat. Surrounded and hammered by artillery, the Russian battalions were all overrun by cavalry charges. The final square was broken when charged simultaneously by the brigades of Ludot and Ismert.|$|E

25|$|In the one-day series again Pakistan in the UAE, BBC Sport {{commentator}} Jonathan Agnew {{stated that}} Hales' technique {{was simply too}} fallible outside off stump, planting his front foot on middle stump and playing with a bat two feet away from his body. Agnew surmised that whilst in 20 and 50 over cricket with no slips Hales <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with this issue, in test cricket he could not. In the first three tests in South Africa, Hales' technique was cruelly exposed by their fast-bowling attack. In the first Tests he made scores of 10 and 26, although England {{went on to win}} the game by 241 runs. In a high scoring second Test, Hales made 60 in the first innings but was dismissed for just five in the second. In the third Test, he was out for one in the first innings as England made 323. He was out for 18 in the second innings, as England went onto secure a seven wicket victory. In the final match of the series, he again struggled, and after making 15 in the first innings, he was out for just one in the second innings as England were bowled out for just 101. Despite the heavy defeat, England won the series 2-1.|$|E

In one scene, Lucas can be seen breaking into a car and getting his hands on various items that {{would be useful to}} help set up traps against the FSB officers. Throughout the episode's development, the items kept changing. There were also staff discussions about what they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with in terms of the protagonists killing FSB officers. The most prominent discussions included Harry strangling one officer with his necktie, and Lucas shooting another in the head in cold blood despite being unarmed and subdued.|$|E

500|$|Met by an {{audience}} largely {{unaware of the}} Daddies' eclectic background, Soul Caddy was received negatively by both fans and critics, {{one of the more}} prevalent criticisms being its lack of swing tracks. Many reviewers chastised the band for what was being seen as an abandonment of their swing [...] "roots" [...] in favor of a trendier sound, while some criticized the Daddies' entire musical aesthetic — UGO's Hip Online stated bluntly, [...] "covering five or six genres on one album is just insane". The Los Angeles Daily News placed Soul Caddy on their list of the 10 worst albums of 2000, the reviewer wondering what made a swing band [...] "think it <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> with an album of recycled psychedelic pop".|$|E

The writers kept pitching {{for him to be}} older and older, eventually debating whether his age would be 57 or 58. [...] They then decided on 60, [...] an idea that could have come from Ron Hauge, one of the Simpsons writers. A few weeks before the discussions, after having found out that he was slightly older than the next oldest writer in the staff, Hauge had told one of the writers, in [...] "the most serious reasonable" [...] voice, that he was 60 years old. At the time, Hauge was [...] "around 40" [...] years old.|$|E
