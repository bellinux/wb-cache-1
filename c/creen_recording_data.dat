40|$|Adverse {{reproductive}} outcomes (AROs) disproportionately affect black American {{infants and}} significantly {{contribute to the}} U. S. infant mortality rate. Without accurate understanding of AROs, there remains little hope of ameliorating infant mortality rates or eliminating infant health disparities. However, despite the importance of monitoring infant mortality rates and health disparities, birth <b>record</b> <b>data</b> quality is not assured. Racial disparities in the reporting of birth <b>record</b> <b>data</b> have been documented, and missing birth <b>record</b> <b>data</b> for AROs appears to be disproportionate. Due {{to the extent of}} missing birth <b>record</b> <b>data,</b> innovative strategies have been developed to evaluate relationships between maternal socioeconomic status (SES) and community-based ARO rates. Because addresses convey aggregate information about income level, education and occupation, ZIP codes, census tracts and census block-groups have been applied to geocoding efforts. The goals of this study are to: 1) analyze the extent of missing birth <b>record</b> <b>data</b> for New Jersey areas with high rates of an ARO (preterm birth), 2) evaluate associations between the extent of missing birth <b>record</b> <b>data</b> and other AROs, and 3) consider how geocoding strategies could be applied to provide a basis for understanding maternal SES risk factors and ARO resource allocation for at-risk communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Information Notice is to clarify the {{requirements}} for collecting and reporting Periodic <b>record</b> <b>data</b> to the Department of Mental Health’s (DMH) Client and Service Information (CSI) System. This notice contains {{a description of the}} Periodic record collection and reporting procedures and also includes an enclosure that provides examples of appropriate and inappropriate Periodic record reporting. The California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5610 (a) requires counties and mental health plans to submit data in accordance with the requirements set forth by DMH. Analyses of previously reported Periodic <b>record</b> <b>data</b> by DMH show that clarification is needed to ensure uniform reporting of this important data. In the past, the reporting procedures for collecting and reporting Periodic <b>record</b> <b>data</b> to CSI have been confusing or not clearly stated for some county Mental Health Plans (MHPs). Thus, some counties have not been properly reporting Periodic <b>record</b> <b>data</b> to CSI. Periodic <b>record</b> <b>data</b> allows DMH to respond to requests for information about MHP clients and their functioning levels over time. In order to accurately respond to these requests, Periodic <b>record</b> <b>data</b> for each MHP client are to be reported to the Department of Menta...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{have become}} {{increasingly}} interested in better understanding the survey data collection process in interviewer-administered surveys. However, tools for analysing paradata capturing information about field processes, also called call <b>record</b> <b>data,</b> are still not yet fully explored. This paper introduces sequence analysis as a simple tool for investigating such data {{with the aim of}} better understand ing and improving survey processes. A novel approach is to use sequence analysis within interviewers, which allows the identification of unusual interviewer calling behaviours, and may provide guidance on interviewer performance. Combining the technique with clustering, optimal matching and multidimensional scaling, the method offers a way of visualising, displaying and summarising complex call <b>record</b> <b>data.</b> The method is introduced to inform survey management and survey monitoring. Sequence analysis is applied to call <b>record</b> <b>data</b> from the UK Understanding Society survey. The findings inform further modelling of call <b>record</b> <b>data</b> to increase efficiency in call scheduling...|$|R
40|$|A Web {{database}} typically {{responds to}} a query with a Web page, which encodes the query results into semi-structured data objects using HTML tags. We call such data objects Web <b>data</b> <b>records</b> or <b>data</b> <b>records.</b> Mining Web <b>data</b> <b>records</b> {{is very important}} for many applications, e. g., meta search, comparative shopping, etc. This paper proposes a new effective approach called AutoRM, which mines <b>data</b> <b>records</b> from single Web page automatically. AutoRM involves three major steps: (1) constructing the DOM tree of the given Web page; (2) mining all sets of adjacent similar C-Records (Candidate <b>data</b> <b>Records)</b> from the constructed DOM tree; (3) mining actual <b>data</b> <b>records</b> from C-Records. In many Web pages, similar <b>data</b> <b>records</b> are distributed in bigger and adjacent similar objects. Existing approaches typically identify such objects as <b>data</b> <b>records.</b> Conversely, AutoRM views such objects as C-Records, and mines actual <b>data</b> <b>records</b> from them. One key issue for mining similar <b>data</b> <b>records</b> is the boundary detection of each <b>data</b> <b>record.</b> Existing approaches typically make some brittle assumptions for handling this issue. By making more robust assumptions, AutoRM tends to detect <b>data</b> <b>record</b> boundaries more accurately. Experimental results show that AutoRM is highly effective, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches...|$|R

40|$|Estimation of the {{parameters}} of an exponential distribution based on <b>record</b> <b>data</b> has been treated by Samaniego and Whitaker (1986) and Doostparast (2009). Recently, Doostparast and Balakrishnan (2011) obtained optimal confidence intervals as well as uniformly most powerful tests for one- and two-sided hypotheses concerning location and scale parameters based on <b>record</b> <b>data</b> from a two-parameter exponential model. In this paper, we derive optimal statistical procedures including point and interval estimation {{as well as most}} powerful tests based on <b>record</b> <b>data</b> from a two-parameter Pareto model.

40|$|In recent years, survey {{agencies}} {{have started to}} collect detailed call <b>record</b> <b>data,</b> including information on the timing and outcome of each interviewer call to a household. In interview-based household surveys, such information {{may be used to}} inform effective interviewer calling behaviours, which are critical in achieving co-operation and reducing the likelihood of refusal. However, call <b>record</b> <b>data</b> can be complex and it is not always clear how best to model such data. We present a general framework for the analysis of call <b>record</b> <b>data</b> by using multilevel event history modelling. A multilevel multinomial logistic regression approach is proposed in which the different possible outcomes at each call are modelled jointly, accounting for the clustering of calls within households and interviewers. Of particular interest are the influences of time varying characteristics on the outcome of a call. The analysis of interviewer call <b>record</b> <b>data</b> is illustrated by using paradata from several face-to-face household surveys with the aim of modelling non-response...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{identification}} of notifiable diseases from electronic medical records can potentially improve the timeliness and completeness {{of public health}} surveillance. We describe {{the development and implementation}} of an algorithm for prospective surveillance of patients with acute hepatitis B using electronic medical <b>record</b> <b>data.</b> Initial algorithms were created by adapting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for acute hepatitis B into electronic terms. The algorithms were tested by applying them to ambulatory electronic medical <b>record</b> <b>data</b> spanning 1990 to May 2006. A physician reviewer classified each case identified as acute or chronic infection. Additional criteria were added to algorithms in serial fashion to improve accuracy. The best algorithm was validated by applying it to prospective electronic medical <b>record</b> <b>data</b> from June 2006 through April 2008. Completeness of case capture was assessed by comparison with state health department records. A final algorithm including a positive hepatitis B specific test, elevated transaminases and bilirubin, absence of prior positive hepatitis B tests, and absence of an ICD 9 code for chronic hepatitis B identified 112 / 113 patients with acute hepatitis B (sensitivity 97. 4 %, 95 % confidence interval 94 - 100 %; specificity 93. 8 %, 95 % confidence interval 87 - 100 %). Application of this algorithm to prospective electronic medical <b>record</b> <b>data</b> identified 8 cases without false positives. These included 4 patients that had not been reported to the health department. There were no known cases of acute hepatitis B missed by the algorithm. An algorithm using codified electronic medical <b>record</b> <b>data</b> can reliably detect acute hepatitis B. The completeness of public health surveillance may be improved by automatically identifying notifiable diseases from electronic medical <b>record</b> <b>data...</b>|$|R
