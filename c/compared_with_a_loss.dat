40|$|Although {{established}} {{money managers}} operate {{in an environment}} which seems com-petitive, they also {{seem to be very}} profitable. The present value of the expected future profits from managing a collection of funds is equal to the value of the assets under management multiplied by the profit margin, assuming that the managed funds will remain in business forever, and that there will be zero asset flow {{into and out of the}} funds, zero excess returns net of trading costs, a fixed management fee proportional to the assets under management and a fixed profit margin for the management company. A profit margin of 30 % seems empirically reasonable, but money management compa-nies seem to trade at 2 - 4 % of assets under management. Attempts to reconcile the two figures are not compelling, which is disturbing considering the centrality of the present value formula to finance and economics.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide a {{detailed}} evaluation of adherence to nutrition supplements by patients with a lower limb fracture. Methods: These descriptive data are from 49 nutritionally“ at-risk” patients aged 70 + years admitted to the hospital after a fall-related lower limb fracture and allocated to receive supplementation as part of a randomized, controlled trial. Supplementation commenced on day 7 and continued for 42 days. Prescribed volumes aimed to meet 45 % of individually estimated theoretical energy requirements to meet the shortfall between literature estimates of energy intake and requirements. The supplement was administered by nursing staff on medication rounds in the acute or residential care settings and supervised through thrice-weekly home visits postdischarge. Results: Median daily percent of the prescribed volume of nutrition supplement consumed averaged over the 42 days was 67 % (interquartile range [IQR], 31 – 89, n = 49). There was no difference in adherence for gender, accommodation, cognition, or whether the supplement was self-administered or supervised. Twenty-three participants took some supplement every day, and a further 12 missed < 5 days. For these 35 “nonrefusers,” adherence was 82 % (IQR, 65 – 93), and they lost on average 0. 7 % (SD, 4. 0 %) of baseline weight over the 6 weeks of supplementation <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of 5. 5 % (SD, 5. 4 %) in the “refusers” (n = 14, 29 %), p =. 003. Conclusions: We achieved better volume and energy consumption than previous studies of hip fracture patients but still failed to meet target supplement volumes prescribed to meet 45 % of theoretical energy requirements. Clinicians should consider alternative methods of feeding such as a nasogastric tube, particularly in those patients where adherence to oral nutrition supplements is poor and dietary intake alone is insufficient to meet estimated energy requirements...|$|E
40|$|Androgen-deprivation {{therapy is}} {{well-established}} for treating prostate cancer but {{is associated with}} bone loss and {{an increased risk of}} fracture. We investigated the effects of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand, on bone mineral density and fractures in men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. In this double-blind, multicenter study, we randomly assigned patients to receive denosumab at a dose of 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months or placebo (734 patients in each group). The primary end point was percent change in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 24 months. Key secondary end points included percent change in bone mineral densities at the femoral neck and total hip at 24 months and at all three sites at 36 months, as well as incidence of new vertebral fractures. At 24 months, bone mineral density of the lumbar spine had increased by 5. 6 % in the denosumab group as <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of 1. 0 % in the placebo group (P< 0. 001); {{significant differences between the two}} groups were seen at as early as 1 month and sustained through 36 months.

40|$|PURPOSE: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{injections}} are currently the standard treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but {{a broad range}} of response rates has been observed. We evaluated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF genes and their receptors (VEGFR) with the response rate to ranibizumab in 366 patients with neovascular AMD. DESIGN: Case series study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 366 eyes of 366 patients with neovascular AMD. METHODS: Visual acuity (VA) was determined at baseline, after 3 monthly ranibizumab injections, and after 1 year of treatment. Genotyping of 126 SNPs in the genes encoding VEGF family members VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD (FIGF), and placental growth factor (PGF); VEGF receptors VEGFR 1 (FLT 1), VEGFR 2 (KDR), and VEGFR 3 (FLT 4); and the gene encoding pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) (SERPINF 1) was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The changes in VA after 3 injections and after 1 year of treatment and their association with VEGF and VEGFR genotypes. RESULTS: Univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed a significant effect of SNP rs 4576072 in the VEGFR 2 gene on VA change after 12 months (F[1, 235] = 14. 05; P = 0. 02). A stepwise linear regression analysis returned a model (P = 0. 01) with SNPs rs 4576072 and rs 6828477 in the VEGFR 2 gene as independent predictors for VA change after 12 months, with a mean increase in VA of 0. 26 on the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) scale in patients with 3 contributing minor alleles <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of 0. 03 logMAR in patients with no minor allele. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in the VEGFR 2 /KDR gene significantly influence visual outcome in patients receiving ranibizumab treatment for neovascular AMD. This study shows that genetic variation partially explains the wide range of response to ranibizumab treatment, which in the future might help clinicians tailoring medical interventions to individual needs...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the human genome has a {{haplotype}} block structure, such that it can be divided into discrete blocks of limited haplotype diversity. In each block, a small fraction of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), referred to as “tag SNPs,” can be used to distinguish a large fraction of the haplotypes. These tag SNPs can potentially be extremely useful for association studies, in that it may not be necessary to genotype all SNPs; however, this depends on how much power is lost. Here we develop a simulation study to quantitatively assess the power <b>loss</b> for <b>a</b> variety of study designs, including case-control designs and case-parental control designs. First, a number of data sets containing case-parental or case-control samples are generated on the basis of a disease model. Second, a small fraction of case and control individuals in each data set are genotyped at all the loci, and a dynamic programming algorithm is used to determine the haplotype blocks and the tag SNPs based on the genotypes of the sampled individuals. Third, the statistical power of tests was evaluated on the basis of three kinds of data: (1) all of the SNPs and the corresponding haplotypes, (2) the tag SNPs and the corresponding haplotypes, and (3) the same number of randomly chosen SNPs as the number of tag SNPs and the corresponding haplotypes. We study the power of different association tests <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of disease models and block-partitioning criteria. Our study indicates that the genotyping efforts can be significantly reduced by the tag SNPs, without much loss of power. Depending on the specific haplotype block–partitioning algorithm and the disease model, when the identified tag SNPs are only 25 % of all the SNPs, the power is reduced by only 4 %, on average, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> power <b>loss</b> of ∼ 12 % when the same number of randomly chosen SNPs is used in a two-locus haplotype analysis.

40|$|Murine promonocytic leukemias {{involving}} {{insertional mutagenesis}} of the c-myb locus can be induced by replication-competent retroviruses. In previously studied promonocytic leukemic cells induced by Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} (called MML), the provirus has been invariably integrated upstream of exons 3 or 4 and the leukemic cells expressed aberrant RNAs with fused virus-myb sequences. Furthermore, Myb expressed by these cells {{has been shown to}} be truncated by 47 or 71 amino acids. The present report examines the mechanisms of myb activation in leukemias induced by two other retroviruses, amphotropic virus 4070 A and Friend strain FB 29 (the leukemias are called AMPH-ML and FB-ML, respectively). This study revealed two additional c-myb proviral insertion sites in these promonocytic leukemias. One FB-ML had a proviral integration in exon 9, and expressed a C-terminally truncated Myb protein of 47 kDa similar to that previously demonstrated to be expressed in the myelomonocytic cell lines NFS 60 and VFL- 2. However, a sequence of reverse-transcribed and amplified RNA from this leukemia demonstrated that the truncation involved a loss of 248 amino acids <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> of 240 amino acids in the myelomonocytic cell lines. Another leukemia had a provirus integrated in the 5 ' end of c-myb upstream of exon 2 (in the first intron) and produced a Myb protein that was indistinguishable on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from normal Myb. This latter leukemia (FB-ML R 1 - 4 - 10) expressed Myb with the smallest N-terminal truncation observed so far in promonocytic leukemias; translation begins at an ATG within c-myb exon 2, leading to loss of only 20 amino acids from the N terminus. Unlike the proteins produced in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced promonocytic leukemias (MML) that have larger truncations, this protein has an intact DNA binding region and does not contain N-terminal amino acids encoded by gag. However, this protein is similar to all N-terminally truncated Mybs so far studied, in that the truncation resulted in deletion of a casein kinase II phosphorylation site which has been proposed to be involved in regulation of DNA binding...|$|E

During the dry period, cows consuming WCGF were observed to have a significant gain in BCS (0. 07 ± 0. 06) <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>loss</b> in BCS in cows fed the control diet (control = − 0. 11 ± 0. 06 and WCGF-L = − 0. 04 ± 0. 06). During lactation, there were no differences by treatment on BCS. Cows consuming WCGF during lactation consumed more feed compared with the control: 25. 4, 23. 8, and 21. 2 ± 0. 76 kg/d for WCGF-L, WCGFDL, and the control, respectively. Milk production was higher for cows consuming WCGF: 35. 0, 34. 7, and 31. 1 ± 2. 1 kg/d for WCGF-L, WCGF-DL, and the control, respectively. No differences were found in either DM intake or actual milk yield between the WCGF-L and WCGF-DL treatments, indicating that prepartum diets did not influence lactational performance. The WCGF diets resulted in significant reductions in the concentration of milk fat (3. 94, 3. 74, and 4. 15 ± 0. 08 % for WCGF-L, WCGF-DL, and the control, respectively), but because total milk yield was increased, there were no differences in total milk fat yield. In addition, 3. 5 % of fat-corrected milk tended to be affected by diet: 38. 9, 36. 3, and 34. 7 ± 1. 93 kg/d for WCGF-L, WCGF-DL, and the control, respectively. The increasing effect of DM intake and milk yield in cows consuming WCGF resulted in a similar efficiency of 3. 5 % fat-corrected milk production for all treatments, averaging 1. 5 ± 0. 09. Total protein yields were significantly higher for cows consuming WCGF diets during lactation: 1. 15, 1. 10, 1. 00 ± 0. 06 kg/d for WCGFL, WCGF-DL, and the control, respectively. These results indicate that diets may be formulated to contain as much as 37. 5 % WCGF (DM basis) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} approximation {{is developed}} for the magnetization of an infinitely long superconductor <b>with</b> <b>an</b> elliptical transverse cross-section. The superconductor is modeled in the critical state <b>with</b> <b>a</b> critical current density that is not dependent on the magnetic field. The aspect ratio of the ellipse is varied from one (=circle) to infinitely large. The magnetic field is applied perpendicular or parallel to the broadest face. The analytical expression is <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more detailed model that utilizes a numerically optimized contour for the boundary of the saturated zone. The two methods are compared and the maximum error is estimated at 2 % for the optimized contour approach and 5 % for the analytical approximation. The analytical model is <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> magnetization <b>loss</b> measurement on <b>a</b> high-Tc superconducting tape <b>with</b> <b>an</b> aspect ratio of nearly 20. A good agreement is obtained for a magnetic field pointing perpendicular as well as parallel to the broadest face of the tape. An interesting result for the magnetic behavior determined for the ellipse is that it contradicts with the behavior that is predicted for an infinitely thin strip in perpendicular field. The difference is attributed to the two specific assumptions made in the thin strip model: the constant critical current density distribution across the tape and the magnetic-field profile that does not exclude unsaturated currents in the shielded zone...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Citigroup {{achieved}} {{its first}} profitable year since 2007. It reported $10.6 billion in net profit, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> $1.6 billion <b>loss</b> in 2009. Late in 2010, the government sold its remaining stock holding in the company, yielding an overall net profit to taxpayers of $12 billion. A special IRS tax exception given to Citi allowed the US Treasury {{to sell its}} shares at a profit, while it still owned Citigroup shares, which eventually netted $12 billion. According to Treasury spokeswoman Nayyera Haq, [...] "This (IRS tax) rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations to evade taxes, and was never intended to address the unprecedented situation where the government owned shares in banks. And it was certainly not written to prevent the government from selling its shares for a profit." ...|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was developed}} for measuring j 32 -microglobulin (/ 32 m) and albumin in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) fluid, Plasma concentrations of f 32 m were twofold greater in hemodialysis patients (41. 3 ± 13. 3 mg/L) than in CAPD patients (23. 6 ± 5. 5 mg/L) matched for duration of treatment. Measurement of p 2 m in CAPD fluid showed <b>a</b> substantial <b>loss</b> of this protein,- 31 % of total body 132 m, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 5 % <b>loss</b> of <b>a</b> protein of middle molecular mass (albumin). Because of the molecular sieving effects of the peritoneal membrane, peritoneal clearance of $ 2 m was sixfold {{greater than that of}} albumin. Whether / 32 m losses prevent or delay the incidence of dialysis-induced amyloidosis in these patients remains to be established. AddItional Keyphrases: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assa...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{communities}} in the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are, as in other ecological niches, influenced by autogenic and allogenic factors. However, our understanding of microbial colonization in younger versus older CF airways and the association with pulmonary function is rudimentary at best. Using a phylogenetic microarray, we examine the airway microbiota in age stratified CF patients ranging from neonates (9 months) to adults (72 years). From a cohort of clinically stable patients, we demonstrate that older CF patients who exhibit poorer pulmonary function possess more uneven, phylogenetically-clustered airway communities, compared to younger patients. Using longitudinal samples collected form a subset of these patients a pattern of initial bacterial community diversification was observed in younger patients <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> progressive <b>loss</b> of diversity over time in older patients. We describe in detail the distinct bacterial community profiles associated with young and old CF patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> particular focus on the differences between respective "early" and "late" colonizing organisms. Finally we assess the influence of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) mutation on bacterial abundance and identify genotype-specific {{communities in}}volving members of the Pseudomonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae amongst others. Data presented here provides insights into the CF airway microbiota, including initial diversification events in younger patients and establishment of specialized communities of pathogens associated with poor pulmonary function in older patient populations...|$|R
