25|$|In {{a fossil}} fuel power plant the {{chemical}} energy stored in fossil fuels such as <b>coal,</b> <b>fuel</b> oil, natural gas or oil shale and oxygen {{of the air}} is converted successively into thermal energy, mechanical energy and, finally, electrical energy. Each fossil fuel power plant is a complex, custom-designed system. Construction costs, , run to US$1,300 per kilowatt, or $650 million for a 500 M We unit. Multiple generating units may be built at a single site for more efficient use of land, natural resources and labor. Most thermal power stations in the world use fossil fuel, outnumbering nuclear, geothermal, biomass, or solar thermal plants.|$|E
25|$|Attenborough {{points out}} that because of natural forces, the Earth's {{temperature}} has been fluctuating for millions of years, long before humans arrived. However, it is the additional carbon dioxide, leading {{to an increase in}} the greenhouse effect, which must also be taken into account. When fossil fuels are burnt, such as <b>coal,</b> <b>fuel</b> oil or natural gas, the carbon emissions combine with oxygen to further thicken the Earth's atmospheric 'blanket' and thus warm the planet. An analysis of ice cores can provide information from thousands of years ago. Comparisons of carbon dioxide levels show that those of today are far beyond anything seen in the past. The scientists interviewed are convinced that humans are responsible.|$|E

25|$|During {{the year}} 2013-14, The plant load factor (PLF) of {{coal-fired}} thermal power stations is only 65.43% whereas these stations can run above 85% PLF comfortably provided there is adequate electricity {{demand in the}} country. The additional electricity generation at 85% PLF is nearly 240 billion units which is adequate to replace all the LPG and Kerosene consumption in domestic sector. The incremental cost of generating additional electricity is only their <b>coal</b> <b>fuel</b> cost which is less than 3 Rs/kWh. Enhancing the PLF of coal-fired stations and encouraging domestic electricity consumers to substitute electricity in place of LPG and Kerosene in household cooking, would reduce the government subsidies and idle capacity of thermal power stations can be put to use economically. The domestic consumers {{who are willing to}} surrender the subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits or eligible for subsidised LPG / Kerosene permits, may be given free electricity connection and subsidised electricity tariff.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all coal, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, {{solar thermal}} electric, and waste {{incineration}} plants, {{as well as}} many natural gas power stations are thermal. Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers. [...] The waste heat from a gas turbine, in the form of hot exhaust gas, can be used to raise steam, by passing this gas through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) the steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency. Power stations burning <b>coal,</b> <b>fuel</b> oil, or natural gas are often called fossil-fuel power stations. [...] Some biomass-fueled thermal power stations have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power stations, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use co-generation are sometimes referred to as conventional power stations.|$|E
