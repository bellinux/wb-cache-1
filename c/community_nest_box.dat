In the laboratory, a shelter or refuge is an easily applicable form of enrichment which may enhance {{the welfare of}} laboratory mice by giving them {{more control over their}} environment. Six <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> made of different materials were evaluated in a preference test with male and female mice of two strains (C 57 BL/ 6 J and BALB/c). In general, mice showed a preference for cages with a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> made of grid metal as compared to clear or white perspex <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> or no <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> They also showed a preference for a cage with a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> of perforated metal as compared to <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> made of grey PVC or sheer metal, or no <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> When offered a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with one open side or a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with two open sides, most mice preferred the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with one open side and were observed to lie in it with their heads directed towards the opening. The results of this study show that <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> may be used for enrichment purposes in caged mice, although it is not yet entirely clear what are the main features influencing the animals' preferences. When providing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> as shelters, the structure and design of this type of enrichment should be taken into account, because these may {{have an effect on the}} social structure of groups of mice...|$|R
40|$|Nest box {{selection}} in the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in Southern Norway was estimated from fieldwork in Trysil Municipality in 2007 and {{by use of}} additional field data from 2005 and 2006. Used versus not used <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> was used as response variables and tested against multiple explanatory variables.

Microhabitat analyses within a 0. 1 ha quadrate around the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> and macrohabitat analyses outside this quadrate gave "general preference" over time, "year effect" preference and "early arrival" preference. Kestrels generally selected <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in open, flat habitats such as bogs and falling areas where there were not too many competing pairs nearby. Differences in vole numbers between years resulted in year effect when voles were scarce. Kestrels selected <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> {{in close proximity to}} developed areas in 2005 when voles were scarce, probably because of higher density of alternative prey, such as birds, lizards and insects. Neither <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> size nor construction was important for <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> selection, but kestrels seemed to prefer boxes where the entrance hole was not too big. Some degree of cover around the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> tree, measured as number of trees around the <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> also seemed to matter. In addition, south facing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were selected earlier than others.

40|$|Nest {{boxes are}} {{frequently}} used in conservation programs for tree-cavity dependent wildlife. There is growing {{concern that the}} poor insulation properties of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> may produce an ecological trap, because species may require microclimates less extreme or less variable than those experienced inside <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> I investigated the fitness consequences of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use in a non-flying mammal. Fifty-two of 104 squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) trapped over a 3 -year period used <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> Population modelling of the capture data revealed that the probability of apparent survival increased with increasing <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use.

The estimate of annual survival of animals using <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (0. 60), was equivalent to estimates at locations where squirrel gliders were either reliant on <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (0. 54) or on tree cavities (0. 55) for shelter.

40|$|Biodiversity {{offsetting}} {{is widely}} applied but its effectiveness is rarely assessed. We evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> program intended to offset clearing of hollow-bearing trees associated with a freeway upgrade in southern Australia. The offset targeted three threatened vertebrates: squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) and superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii). Clearing led to the loss of 587 tree hollows and the offset was the placement of an equivalent number of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in nearby woodland (1 : 1 ratio). Of these, we monitored 324 <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in six sample periods between 2010 and 2013, yielding 2485 individual checks of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> For the three target species, we found: (1) no records of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use by the superb parrot, (2) two records of the brown treecreeper (0 - 0. 76 % of accessible <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> used per survey period), and (3) seven records of use of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> by the squirrel glider (0 - 2. 1 % of accessible <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> used per survey period). Rates of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use by the superb parrot and squirrel glider were markedly lower than rates of use of hollow-bearing trees observed in other investigations. Low levels of use by target species coupled with the extent of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> attrition suggest the offset program will not have counterbalanced the loss of the hollow-bearing trees. We make suggestions for improving future offset programs including a greater emphasis on: (1) avoiding impacts on hollow-bearing trees; (2) offset effectiveness as a measure of compliance; and (3) using realistic offset ratios...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{artificial}} <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> {{has led to}} significant progress in bird conservation and {{in our understanding of}} the functional and evolutionary ecology of free-ranging birds that exploit cavities for roosting and reproduction.

A total of 566 pairs of seven bird species used the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> from 1997 to 2006, 562 of which were secondarycavity-nesters. Sympatric tits such as varied tits (Parus varius), great tits (P. major), and marsh tits (P. palustris) were common breeding birds in <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> and showed clear preferences for 4. 0 cm, 3. 5 cm and 3. 0 cm nestholes, respectively.

We did not detect selection for the directional orientation for the entrance hole,but the birds appeared to avoid <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> that faced steep or gentle upward slopes and those less than 1. 8 m from the ground. These results are probably related to avoidance of disturbance and predation. We suggestthat diverse species can be supported by the placement of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> with entrance holes of various sizes andthat specific species can be targeted by selecting the hole sizes preferred by those species.

And then, the breeding birds using the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were recorded during the breeding season of 2003 and 2004 for finding the effectiveness of two different <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> A total bred birds were five species, Great Tit (Parus major), Coal Tit (Parus ater), Varied Tit (Parus varius), Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) and Yellow-rumped Flycatcher (Ficedula zanthopygia). Sixteen pairs Great tits were bred in the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> so this species was the most dominant breeder and followed by Coal Tit three pairs, Varied Tit three pairs, Tree Sparrow two pairs and Yellow-rumped Flycatcher two pairs. The using rate of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> was 28. 2 % (11 out of 39) and 38. 5 % (15 out of 39) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Thus, the using rate was increased in 2004. Birds were using only A-type <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> so the using rate of A-type was 68. 0 % (17 out of 25) while none of bird used B-type (0 out of 14).

Especially little is known of these effects for species that nest in burrows or crevices, such as the Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus). On Southeast Farallon Island, California, USA, a subset of the Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s auklet (hereafter auklet) population nest in artificial <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> The <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> are above ground and made out of a single layer of plywood. Temperatures in unshaded <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> can increase significantly with high ambient temperatures (to 3 ̆e 35 °[*]C). Shaded structures put on top of occupied <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> help mediate <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> temperatures, but the effects of elevated temperatures on auklet incubation behaviors and egg viability remain equivocal. We used egg data loggers to measure the temperatures and turning rates of auklet eggs in natural burrows, shaded <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> and unshaded <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> on Southeast Farallon Island. Nest box (13. 93 [*]±[*] 1. 26 °[*]C) and egg (37. 43 [*]±[*] 1. 92 °[*]C) temperatures were highest and most variable in unshaded <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> Mean hourly egg turning rate was 2. 11 [*]±[*] 2. 02 turns/hour and turning rates were greater at night. Egg turning rates also varied with fluctuating nest and egg temperatures, being positively correlated with nest temperatures during the day and negatively correlated with egg temperatures during the night. Our results suggest that <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> design can influence incubation behaviors of breeding birds. As seasonal temperatures and the number of extreme heat events rise, understanding the impacts of temperature on auklets nesting in artificial nests can have positive implications for conservation and management of the species, such as implementing improved artificial <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> designs to prevent overheating of burrow nesting seabirds. © 2015 The Wildlife Society...|$|R

40|$|Tree-cavity-dependent {{wildlife}} faces future {{shortages of}} cavities {{due to a}} decline in the abundance of large, old trees {{in many parts of the}} world. Nest boxes are proposed as a tool to restore habitat value but evidence of their effectiveness for arboreal mammals remains equivocal. This may arise from a poor understanding of design preferences. We conducted investigations in two landscapes in eastern Australia to determine whether species show a preference for specific designs. We observed a preference by some mammal species for particular designs (33 – 78 % occupied/used), suggesting that design refinement can improve the frequency with which <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> are used. Although feral species may out-compete target species for <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> we did not observe this. We recorded feral honeybees (Apis mellifera) in 6 – 9 % of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> but they did not remain, and many occupied boxes were later used by mammals. The introduced common myna bird (Acridotheres tristis) was prevalent in one landscape, but competition for <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> was localized. For <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> to be an effective habitat restoration tool, they must be able to be occupied over long periods of time.

The Naděje fishpond system is created by 16 different sized fishponds and it is situated approximately 8. 5 km to the south of the town Veselí nad Lužnicí. The Prátr fishpond system is situated approximately 1 km to the south of the town Třeboň and it is created by 9 fishponds. The monitor was realised in term from 17. 3. 2015 to 27. 7. 2015. The other species of water birds were also counted. In the year 2014 10 <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were occupied and in the year 2015 17 <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were occupied. The <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> which were located on the fishpond´s islands were preferred. Both of the mobile scouting cameras recorded European Pine Marten (Martes martes) devastating the nest. The Common Goldeneye was occurred on the both fishpond systems in 2015. In the year 2015 was observed the female of the Common Goldeneye with 8 ducklings on the Prátr fishpond system...|$|R
40|$|Secondary cavity nesting (SCN) birds {{breed in}} holes {{that they do}} not {{excavate}} themselves. This is possible where there are large trees whose size and age permit the digging of holes by primary excavators and only rarely happens in forest plantations, where we expected a deficit of both breeding holes and SCN species. We assessed whether the availability of tree cavities influenced the number of SCNs in two temperate forest types, and evaluated the change in number of SCNs after adding <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> First, we counted all cavities within each of our 25 -m radius sampling points in mature and young forest plots during 2009. We then added <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> at standardised locations during 2010 and 2011 and conducted fortnightly bird counts (January–October 2009 – 2011). In 2011 we added two extra plots of each forest type, where we also conducted bird counts. Prior to adding <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> counts revealed more SCNs in mature than in young forest. Following the addition of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> the number of SCNs increased significantly in the points with <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in both types of forest. Counts in 2011 confirmed the increase in number of birds due to the addition of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> Given the likely benefits associated with a richer bird community we propose that, as is routinely done in some countries, forest management programs preserve old tree stumps and add <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> to forest plantations in order to increase bird numbers and bird community diversity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the design of a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> {{consisting}} of two compartments for the breeding in cages of wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The first compartment was a chamber measuring on the inside 17 × 23 × 20 cm (base and height), conforming to the small body size of the wild rabbit and similar to its breeding burrows. A plastic tray was placed inside the chamber, in which the doe could build her nest. The other part of the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> was a tunnel with an inner cross-section of 9 × 8 cm leading to the nesting chamber and designed to make the doe enter the nest slowly. The does made considerable use of the <b>boxes</b> as <b>nesting</b> places since, out of a total number of 41 births, 85. 4 % of the does gave birth to all of their kits inside the <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> and in 71. 4 % of these cases the does suckled their litters there. No differences were found {{in the use of the}} <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> between does born in breeding burrows and those born in the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> tested here. It was concluded that this <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> is appropriate for breeding captive wild rabbit...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate pens switching, closing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> after egg laying and <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> switching inside the same pen as management procedures for controlling broodiness in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders and their role in circulating prolactin. Black bronze turkey (n. = 350) and Muscovy duck (n. = 700) were randomly selected and housed on deep litter. The results showed a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) increase in egg production in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pens switching and closing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> after end of egg laying. While, there was no significant (P > 0. 05) difference in egg production in response to switching of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in turkey hens but a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) result was found in Muscovy ducks. On the other hand, there were significant (P ≤ 0. 05) decreases in circulating prolactin level and broodiness in both turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pen switching, closing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> after egg laying and <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> switching. In conclusion, application of these management procedures was associated with increased egg production while decreased expression of broodiness (incubation behaviour) and circulating prolactin in turkey hens and Muscovy ducks...|$|R

40|$|Alternative housing {{systems for}} laying hens are {{increasingly}} {{adopted by the}} US egg industry. However, information still lacks with regards to behavioral and production responses of the hens to resources allocation in such alternative housing systems. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the nesting behavior and the location of eggs laid in an enriched colony housing (ECH) system. The experiment was conducted in laboratory scale, involving an ECH commercial module with the capacity of 60 hens per colony. The nesting behaviors were evaluated using an ultra-high frequency radio-frequency identification (UHF RFID) system that consists of four antennas located inside the <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> one reader, and 60 individual transponders (one per bird) attached to the hen legs. The following behaviors were quantified: time spent in the <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> maximum number of hen occupancy, oviposition time and place, daily number of visits to the <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> and number of visits per egg laid in the <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> Preliminary results to date show that laying hens in the ECH spent on average 56 (± 5) (mean ±SE) minutes inside <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> during laying or exploring visits and made an average of 17. 8 (± 1. 4) visits per day. The number of visits per egg laid in the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> was 21. 3 (± 0. 6). The maximum occupancy averaged 11. 0 (± 0. 5) birds, which occurred within 5 - 6 hours after the light was turned on. Most of the daily eggs (92. 7 ± 1. 5 %) were laid in the <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> while 4. 4 (± 1. 1) % eggs were laid in the scratch area, and 2. 9 (± 0. 4) % in the perches area. Data collection and analysis is continuing. Information derived from this study is expected to provide insight into better design of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> for laying hens...|$|R
40|$|In {{many species}} of birds, {{the quality of the}} nest site may have {{important}} fitness consequences. The focus {{of the present study was}} to see if <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> choice in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major) is mainly genetically determined or if it is based on early learning, and also if one sex is more involved in the selection than the other. If it is based on early learning, the birds may learn when they are in their natal nest and/or by observing the behavior of conspecifics after fledging. The study area was a natural habitat containing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> of two sizes, where the general observation is that blue tits prefer small and great tits large <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> The methods adopted were a comparison between size of <b>nesting</b> <b>box</b> and natal box, observation of the same individual’s choice in successive years, and a study of the effect of interspecific cross-fostering. Cross-fostering resulted in more blue tits being reared in large <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> and more great tits in small <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> than in the case of controls, and gave an opportunity for cross-fostered individuals to learn from a different foster species. None of the results seemed to indicate a strong effect of either inheritance, based on genetic variation at the individual level, or cultural transmission. Blue tits seemed to prefer small <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> regardless of the size of their natal box or the species of the rearing parents. The exception was cross-fostered blue tit females in heterospecific pairs (male great tit x female blue tit) that had been reared in a large <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> These females tended to nest in large <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> In great tits, most controls preferred large <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> while cross-fostered individuals, especially the females, tended to use small <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> Alternative explanations, based on competition for nest sites and female condition (laying date of first egg, clutch size and egg volume) were also considered. However, with a possible exception of clutch size in great tits, none seemed to explain the patterns observed. Choice of nest site in blue tits and great tits may primarily be a general trait at the species level, where blue tits prefer small <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> and great tits prefer large. It may thus have a genetic basis, but with little variation among individuals within the species. Males and females were analyzed separately in the main analyses, and the results suggest that, at least in great tits, the female is the most influential in nest site choice, but that the male may have some influence. This is reasonable, because the female builds the nest and incubates the clutch, whereas both parents feed the young...|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} need for tree cavities, akepa rely on old-growth ōhia and koa forests for nesting. Although the largest populations of akepa live within {{protected}} lands, large trees appear to be falling faster than they are replaced. It is unclear how management can deal with this in the medium-term, except by use of artificial <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> Past experiments with <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (Freed et al., 1987) have shown that birds will occasionally use them, with high nesting success.
