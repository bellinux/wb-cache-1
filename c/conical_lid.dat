50|$|The {{soapstone}} baptismal font, {{with its}} <b>conical</b> wooden <b>lid,</b> is of gothic style {{and is still}} in use. On a special mount {{on the wall of}} the church is a statue of the Virgin Mary, crowned and dressed in a golden robe lined with vair and holding the similarly crowned and robed Christ Child enthroned on her lap. The statue dates from the early 13th century as does the wooden tabernacle in the form of a church. The Hedal church was originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary and this statue originally stood on the principal altar in the apse in front of a polytych painted with scenes of her life, which could be closed over it during times of fasting. This polytych was repainted in the Baroque period and now forms the altarpiece, in front of which is displayed a medieval crucifix of Christ on the cross in the shape of a stylized tree of life. Both the statue of the Virgin and Child and the crucifix are among the most beautiful works of medieval art to survive from the Norwegian Middle Ages.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{relations}} between the Maltese Archipelago and the Aegean in the Bronze Age and in the Early Iron Age has been neglected due to the scant evidence available. Recent research on unpublished pottery coming from several Middle and Late Bronze Age Maltese sites, held at the National Museum of Archaeology of Valletta, offered new data for the interpretation of a Mediterranean connection that linked Malta and Crete in the Early Iron Age. In this paper three classes of objects, extraneous to the local tradition and probably of Cretan derivation, coming from the excavations of the Borg in-Nadur temple and from the Borg in-Nadur culture layers of the Bahrija village, are discussed. The first object, a clay model of local fabric resembling a circular plan building, can be related to the well-known Cretan production of the cylindrical models, developed between the Late Minoan and Late Geometric period. The second is an fragment of an imported kalathos with simple geometric painted decoration that can be compared with several examples of the Early and Middle Geometric production of the Messara plain. The last case is represented by three knobs related to conical lids, of local fabric, that can be interpreted as local imitation of the <b>conical</b> <b>lid</b> with finial knobs popular in the Cnossian necropoleis in the Early and Middle Geometric period. This new evidence that shows a chronological and geographical coherency informs us about a hitherto unknown relation between Malta and Crete, {{by the end of the}} IXth century and the beginning of the VIIIth century BC, that can be tentatively explained through the agency of Phoenician middlemen, operating in Crete from at least the Xth century BC, and very interested in the Maltese islands, as the subsequent colonization of the mid VIIIth century will testify. peer-reviewe...|$|E
