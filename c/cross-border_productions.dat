40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the repercussions of}} <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> sharing for the welfare effects of preferential trade liberalization. In a general-equilibrium context, {{a free trade agreement}} (FTA), which incorporates production sharing, raises the likelihood of welfare improvement. Thus, two members of a free trade area, who each have comparative disadvantage in the production of a final product relative to a non-member, may nevertheless enjoy net trade creation if they jointly possess comparative advantage in key components of that product. At a minimum, <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> sharing reduces the trade-diverting elements of an FTA. It follows, that rules of origin, viewed as constraints on cross-border fragmentation, augment the negative, trade-diverting elements of free trade areas...|$|R
40|$|A {{key feature}} of {{globalization}} {{in the current}} era has been the rapid spread of <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> sharing in many regions of the world, including Europe, North America and Asia. The effects of these developments {{in the context of}} regional trade integration have been examined in the recent literature. This paper looks at their implications for regional monetary integration and exchange-rate policies. <b>Cross-border</b> <b>production</b> networks and the intra-industry trade associated with them affect exchange-rate behavior, balance of payments adjustment, and the transmission of shocks and disturbances. This paper examines the policy implications of regional production networks that (i) are confined to the countries of a given region, and (ii) involve a dominant extra-regional economy.

40|$|In {{the new era}} of globalisation, {{participation}} in the global production network (GPN) initiated by transnational corporations (TNC) has created upgrading possibilities for local firms in developing countries, through the backward linkages of TNCs. Drawing upon the GPN approach with emphasis on its conceptualisation of embeddedness, this study demonstrates that <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> networks of Taiwanese PC investment in Dongguan could be regarded as an exclusive network, which is characterised by closed backward linkages with pre-established Taiwanese electronics suppliers while relatively weak ties with local suppliers in Dongguan. One of the results is that <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> of Taiwanese PC investment has not substantially brought about industrial upgrading of Dongguan {{over the past two}} decades, which is different from previous empirical experiences of TNC-driven clusters in other countries and regions in East Asia.

In a clear departure from the conventional practice, the trade flow analysis of the paper {{is based on a}} careful disaggregation of reported trade data into components and final goods, with a view to delineating supply-side complementarities arising from <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> fragmentation. There is clear evidence that network-related trade in components has strengthened Southeast Asia's trade links with China, opening up new opportunities for the expansion of component production/assembly writhing vertically integrated global industries. However, these trade links with China have not lessoned the dependence of growth dynamism of these countries on the global economy; the dynamism of regional <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> networks depends inexorably on China's trade in final goods with North America and the European Union.

When a country’s exports contain imported components, changes in exchange rates tend to have offsetting effects on imports and exports.

The effect of domestic and foreign GDP on imports and exports is also altered by production sharing.

Using a complete trading system, we compute bilateral trade in value added for 87 countries and regions. The ratio of value added to gross exports {{is a measure}} of the intensity of production sharing. Across sectors, manufacturing has a relatively low ratio and thus accounts for a smaller share of exported value added than gross exports. Across countries, aggregate ratios are negatively correlated with exporter income, primarily due to cross-country differences in the composition of exports. Across bilateral partners, ratios vary widely and contain information on both bilateral and triangular production chains. Further, bilateral imbalances measured in value added differ from gross imbalances...|$|R

Following a stage-setting survey of trends and patterns of export performance over the past four decades, it focuses on two key themes central to the current policy debate, namely the implications of China's emergence as a key player in world markets in labour intensive manufactured goods and the link between the crisis-propelled real exchange rate depreciation and export performance. There is strong evidence to suggest that the 'China fear' is vastly exaggerated. Real exchange rate depreciation has been a significant determinant of the post-crisis export recovery.

40|$|This {{paper was}} based upon a study of a Hong Kong-based comic {{enterprise}} entering the PRC comics market. By taking the advantages of <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> in Suzhou and Shenzhen, the enterprise is supposed to produce comic content related to Chinese mythic stories {{in the direction of}} the mainland cultural authority. Such a maneuver implies (1) eliminating the provincial differences on the tastes of the contents and capturing the wider, barely literate, and rural audiences, and (2) diluting and even dispelling the cultural influences of manga and anime in China pointing to any disguised Japanese expansionism perceived as “soft power”. Drawing upon analyses by Ronald Robertson and Naoki Sakai, we suggest the interactive dynamics of such “soft power” of China and Japan lies in the fundamental question of inter-state rivalry and/or reconciliation in imitation of western modernity, and more precisely, in the politics of cultural nationalism...|$|R

Descriptive analysis suggests that advances in the European integration process have led to a spatial extension of the networks to the East rather than to a replacement of traditional locations. This finding is supported by our econometric analysis that, estimating an extended gravity panel data model, shows that, besides EU membership and comparative advantages, variables such as good quality infrastructure, a minimum threshold of development, a headquarter effect as well as other unobserved country characteristics are key determining factors to be integrated in <b>cross-border</b> <b>production</b> networks.

I show that the bilateral trade cost elasticity of value added exports is about two-thirds of that for gross exports. Moreover, bilateral value added exports depend not only on bilateral trade costs but also on trade costs with third countries through which value added transits en route from source to destination.

This paper engages with this issue by developing a model that combines the insights of earlier unequal exchange theorists and new work on global commodity chains to clarify the distributive dynamics of the expansion of low-wage manufacturing in the developing world. In this framework, the ability of productivity-led development to raise employment incomes in low-wage manufacturing is constrained and depends on how the benefits of productivity improvements are captured – as lower prices for consumers or higher rents for brandname multinationals. In contrast, consumption-led growth in relatively affluent consumer markets will contribute to income convergence when demand for manufactured consumer imports is sufficiently income elastic. However, in the long-run, labor market, macroeconomic, and environmental constraints will likely compromise this form of export-led employment growth. trade, global commodity chains, multinational corporations, subcontracting, branding, inequality...|$|R

EU RoO are complex, restrictive and discriminatory, hampering this integration of African producers in world trade. The paper explores the consequences of moving to a single product-specific RoO which would allow a maximum foreign content (MFC) to satisfy the substantial transformation criterion. We suggest that the developmental objective of the EPAs would be satisfied with a MFC of 90 %- 95 % for LDCs and a 60 %- 70 % for non-LDCs.
