The i3 also has a rapid charging option suitable for public DC charging stations and can take less than 30 minutes to charge from 0% to 80%. In the US, it can also be charged from any public charging station with an SAE J1772 connector. In 2016, BMW and the PG utility in California expanded an experiment of delaying charge-up during peak demand and compensating i3 owners for the delay.|$|E

50|$|At high voltages, it is {{unnecessary}} {{to come into}} direct contact with <b>charged</b> <b>equipment</b> to be shocked. An electric field surrounds all charged devices.
