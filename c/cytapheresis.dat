40|$|Summary: During the {{procedure}} of centrifugation <b>cytapheresis</b> donors occasionally experience adverse clincial reactions. We evaluated {{the possibility of}} whether activation of granulocytes and their subsequent release reactions, {{which may have been}} triggered by this extracorporeal circuit, were responsible for these adverse effects. Six blood samples were obtained during various set intervals during plateletapheresis. Of these, four samples were taken directly from each donor. The remaining two were drawn from the efferent lines, i. e. those which return blood from the <b>cytapheresis</b> machine back to the donor. Reactive oxygen species produced by granulocytes were monitored by chemiluminescence using microamounts of whole blood or isolated granulocytes. Furthermore, secreted granulocyte products such as neutral proteinase elastase, present in plasma in a complex with oti-proteinase inhibitor (complexed elastase), and lysosomal-glucuronidase were examined. A complete blood cell count, as well as values of haemoglobin, haematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase, protein, albumin and proteinase inhibitors such as oc 2 -macroglobulin and αϊ-proteinase inhibitor were also determined. Complexed elastase increased from a preapheresis value of about 140 μg/l to about 180 μg/l {{at the end of the}} <b>cytapheresis.</b> All other clinical chemical and cytological values were 8 to 12 percent lower than preapheresis values, which can be attributed to inherent plasma volume expansion.

It has been shown recently to have clinical efficacy in various disease states, such as leukaemia, autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, renal allograft rejection and sickle–cell anaemia. The current study was undertaken to produce an affinity-binding column, based upon a macroporous monolithic cryogel with a structure of interconnected pores, with pore size and low flow resistance potentially suitable for use in <b>cytapheresis.</b> The affinity column was produced from poly (2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) PHEMA cryogels synthesized by free radical polymerization at - 12 °C.

Newly-characterized autoantibodies in neuromyelitis optica, Guillain-Barre variants, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitides, etc., exemplify the modern molecular biology which now provides a rigorous framework of understanding for the clinical practice of plasmapheresis. Clinical trials continue to clarify the appropriate use of therapeutic plasmapheresis (TPE) in these and other diseases. Centrifugal (cTPE) and membrane filtration (mTPE) types of plasmapheresis are compared, with details of the plasmapheresis prescrip-tion, anticoagulation choices, replacement fluids and other practical considerations. Plasma removal is more effi-cient with cTPE; mTPE systems have a lower plasma extraction ratio, and therefore require higher blood flow rates or longer procedure times. Autoantibodies and other pathogenic macromolecules targeted for removal by plasmapheresis can be depleted predictably when the plasma is discarded, as in conventional TPE. On-line plasma processing to regenerate the patient’s own plasma avoids the need for replacement albumin solutions or plasma transfusion, but is inherently less efficient at removing the target molecule, so usually requires a longer procedure.

Patients and Methods: We reviewed the clinical course of 65 patients with steroid-dependent UC with moderate activity, who were treated with either low-dose AZA/ 6 -MP (T-group, n = 38) or with CAP (C-group, n = 27). The efficacy and safety for the first 10 weeks {{after the start of}} the therapies were compared between the two groups. The cumulative probability curves of treatment failure were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Clinical remission was defined as an ulcerative colitis activity index value of less than 150 without any other treatments.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the management of patients with IBD during pregnancy. Methods: We identified 19 patients (five with Crohn's disease and 14 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) who became pregnant with a total of 23 pregnancies between May 2005 and May 2015 by reviewing the medical records of Kyoto University Hospital. The following data were collected: the maternal variables, the IBD treatment type, the disease activity, the pregnancy outcome, and the mode of delivery.

METHODS: We report four cases of corticosteroid-dependent ulcerative colitis (UC) and two Crohn’s disease (CD) cases with severe cutaneous lesions who received GMA therapy. The frequency of CD 4 + CD 25 high (Tregs) in peripheral blood was analyzed by flow cytometry and the expression of FoxP 3 and TGF beta in purified CD 4 + T cells was determined by real time PCR prior to and one month after the last apheresis session, and at the time of endoscopic and clinical assessing. RESULTS: Increased expression of Fox P 3 mRNA was found in all five patients who responded to <b>cytapheresis</b> with remission of clinical symptoms, mucosal inflammation and cutaneous lesions, and an increased frequency of circulating Tregs was found in four patients. These changes were not observed in the patient with UC who did no respond to GMA. Variations in TGF-β (mRNA) did not parallel that of FoxP 3 mRNA. CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of GMA on IBD and related extra intestinal manifestations was associated with an expansion of circulating CD 4 + CD 25 + Tregs and higher expression of FoxP 3 in CD 4 + T cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} clinical-grade enriched human regulatory T cells (Treg) to attenuate experimental xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) induced by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMNCs; autologous to Treg) infusion in NSG mice, as well as verified their inability to induce xenogeneic GVHD when infused alone. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Human Treg were isolated from peripheral blood apheresis products with a cell separation system (CliniMACS, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH) using a two-step procedure (simultaneous CD 8 and CD 19 depletion followed by CD 25 -positive selection) in six independent experiments with six different healthy volunteer donors. Sublethally (2. 5 [*]Gy) irradiated NSG mice were given 2 [*]×[*] 10 (6) <b>cytapheresis</b> (PBMNC) product cells intravenously (IV) without (PBMNC group) or with 1 [*]×[*] 10 (6) Treg (PBMNC[*]+[*]Treg group), while other NSG mice received 2 [*]×[*] 10 (6) enriched Treg alone (also in IV; Treg group). RESULTS: The first five procedures were successful at obtaining a relatively pure Treg population (defined as > 50 %), while the sixth procedure, due to a technical problem, was not (Treg purity, 42 %). Treg cotransfusion significantly delayed death from xenogeneic GVHD in the first five experiments, (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) but not in the sixth experiment. Importantly, none of the mice given enriched Treg alone (Treg group) experienced clinical signs of GVHD, while, interestingly, the CD 4 + cells found in these mice 26 days after transplantation were mainly conventional T cells (median CD 25 +FoxP 3 + cells among human CD 4 + total cells were only 2. 1, 3. 1, and 12. 2 % in spleen, marrow, and blood, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of clinical-grade enriched Treg delayed the occurrence of xenogeneic GVHD without inducing toxicity in this murine model...|$|E
40|$|Cells of the {{macrophage}} lineage {{are considered}} to be of special importance in the defense of the host against tumor development and spread. Immunotherapeutic strategies to stimulate macrophage (MAC) tumor cytotoxicity make use of activating compounds such as gamma-interferon which are given systemically. However, there are several lines of evidence that in malignant disease the generation of cytotoxic effector MACs is impaired. Both defective cell maturation and loss of responsiveness to activation are described. Here, a first clinical phase I trial of adoptive immunotherapy in cancer patients using autologous MACs generated in vitro from blood monocytes (MOs) is reported. Mononuclear cells were isolated by <b>cytapheresis</b> and density centrifugation and cultured in hydrophobic Teflon bags for 7 days with 2 % autologous serum and recombinant human gamma-interferon being present for the last 18 h. Cytotoxic MO-derived MACs were then purified by countercurrent elutriation and reinfused into the patient. A total of 72 therapies have been performed with patients being treated i. v. (n = 8) and i. p. (n = 7). In vitro generated MACs proved to be mature as judged by the expression of maturation-associated surface molecules (MAX antigens, CD 16, CD 51, CD 71), were cytotoxic to U 937 tumor cells, and were efficient secretory cells. Cell dose escalation was performed in the first patients beginning with 10 (8) MACs to finally infuse the total number of cells recovered from one single cycle of isolation and culture. MAC yield varied from 1 to 17 x 10 (8) representing 13 - 79 % of MOs initially seeded. Adoptive MAc transfer was well tolerated. Side effects observed were low-grade fever (less than 38. 5 degrees C), induction of the coagulation cascade, and abdominal discomfort after i. p. application. The procoagulant activity of MAC autografts was cell dose dependent and demonstrated by detection of circulating fibrin monomers and thrombin-antithrombin complexes. Biological responses observed included elevated serum neopterin levels and the appearance of interleukin- 6 in sera and ascitic fluids. Indication of a possible therapeutic effect was only observed in i. p. -treated patients and consisted of disappearance of malignant ascites in 2 of 7 patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitive}} {{detection of}} human cells in immunodeficient rodents {{is a prerequisite}} for the monitoring of micrometastasis of solid tumours, dissemination of leukaemic cells, or engraftment of haematological cells. We developed a universally applicable polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of a human-specific 850 -bp fragment of the α-satellite DNA on human chromosome 17. The method allows the detection of one human cell in 106 murine cells and could be established as both, a conventional DNA polymerase chain reaction-assay for routine screening, and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-assay using TaqMan-methodology. It was applied to the following xenotransplantation systems in SCID and NOD/SCID mice: (1) In a limiting dilution assay, cells of the MDA-MB 435 breast carcinoma were injected into the mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice. It could be shown that 10 cells mouse− 1 were sufficient to induce a positive polymerase chain reaction signal in liver and lung tissue 30 days after transplantation as an indicator for micrometastasis. At this time a palpable tumour was not yet detectable in the mammary fat pad region. (2) Cells of a newly established human acute lymphatic leukaemia were administered intraperitoneally to SCID mice. These cells apparently disseminated and were detectable as early as day 50 in the peripheral blood of living mice, while the leukaemia manifestation was delayed by day 140. (3) In a transplantation experiment using mature human lymphocytes we wanted to standardise conditions for a successful survival of these cells in NOD/SCID mice. It was established that at least 5 × 107 [*]cells given intravenously were necessary and that the mice had to be conditioned by 2 [*]Gy body irradiation to get positive polymerase chain reaction bands in several organs. (4) Engraftment studies with blood stem cells originating from <b>cytapheresis</b> samples of tumour patients or from cord blood were undertaken in NOD/SCID mice in order to define conditions of successful engraftment and to use this model for further optimisation strategies. The polymerase chain reaction method presented allowed a reliable prediction of positive engraftment and agreed well with the results of immunohistochemical or FACS analysis. All together, the polymerase chain reaction method developed allows a sensitive and reliable detection of low numbers of human cells in immunodeficient hosts. In combination with real-time (TaqMan) technique it allows an exact quantification of human cells. As this method can be performed with accessible material of living animals, follow up studies for the monitoring of therapeutic interventions are possible in which the survival time of mice as evaluation criteria can be omitted...|$|E
