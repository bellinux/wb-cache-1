40|$|The {{nephrotic}} syndrome {{may be defined}} as gross proteinuria, predominantly albuminuria, with con-sequent selective hypoproteinaemia; usually accom-panied by oedema, ascites, and hyperlipaemia, and sometimes by systemic hypertension, azotaemia, or excessive erythrocyturia. Grouping of Nephrotic Syndrome The syndrome falls into three groups. (1) <b>Congenital</b> <b>nephrosis.</b> A group of dis-orders present at and presenting soon after birth, which are familial and may be acquired or inherited. Persistent oedema attracts attention in the first weeks of life. The disease may be rapidly lethal, but occasionally the patient will survive {{for a year or}} more without fatal infection or lethal azotaemia...|$|E
40|$|High {{concentrations}} of alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP) {{were found at}} 14, 19, and 21 weeks gestation in the serum {{of a woman with}} a history of unexplained fetal death in her previous pregnancies. The alpha-FP concentration of the liquor also was high at 21 weeks and the pregnancy was terminated. Though the fetus was macroscopically normal, measurement of albumin, alpha-FP, IgG, and alpha 2 -macroglobulin in the fetal urine showed a selective proteinuria, and <b>congenital</b> <b>nephrosis</b> was diagnosed after examination of the fetal kidneys by electron microscopy. Possibly some fetuses reported to be "false-positive for neural tube defect" may have had renal lesions of this nature. Examination of fetal urine may be the simplest initial diagnostic procedure in any future case...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nephrin is a podocyte cell {{adhesion}} protein {{located at the}} slit diaphragm area of the kidney glomerulus. Mutations in the nephrin gene (NPHS 1) lead to <b>congenital</b> <b>nephrosis,</b> suggesting that nephrin {{is essential for the}} glomerular filtration barrier. This prompted this study of the expression of nephrin in acquired pediatric kidney diseases using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization for nephrin mRNA was performed in biopsy samples from patients with proteinuria caused by minimal change nephrosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy. The expression of nephrin mRNA was evaluated by grading the signal intensity visually and by counting the number of grains in separate glomeruli. No significant difference was observed in these samples as compared with controls. Immunostaining for nephrin was performed using antibodies directed agains...|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} this occurs in the <b>congenital</b> {{disorder}} Finnish-type <b>nephrosis,</b> which is characterised by neonatal proteinuria leading to end-stage renal failure. This disease {{has been found to}} be caused by a mutation in the nephrin gene.|$|R
40|$|Improved {{prenatal}} {{diagnosis of the}} congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type based on DNA analysis. Haplotype analysis and α-fetoprotein quantitation comprise a {{prenatal diagnosis}} of <b>congenital</b> <b>nephrosis.</b> Congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by massive proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome from birth. Prenatal diagnosis of CNF has previously been based on the quantitation of α-fetoprotein (AFP) in the amniotic fluid and maternal serum, but an increased AFP is not specific for the disease. We have recently localized the CNF gene to the chromosome 19 ql 3. 1 region and observed a strong linkage disequilibrium to the genetic markers D 19 S 610, D 19 S 608, D 19 S 224 and D 19 S 220 in this chromosomal area. Four main CNF-haplotypes have been observed in Finnish kindreds. In the present study, linkage and haplotype analyses have been applied to prenatal diagnosis of six families {{with a history of}} CNF. The results diminish the risk of false positive diagnosis and abortions of healthy fetuses in families at risk...|$|E
40|$|Studies of Mendelian {{forms of}} focal {{segmental}} glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and nephrotic syndrome have provided {{new insights into}} the mechanism of these diseases. Congenital nephrotic syndrome and familial forms of FSGS form a spectrum of podocyte diseases of varying severity and age of onset. Mutations in both nephrin gene (NPHS 1) alleles lead to <b>congenital</b> <b>nephrosis,</b> podocyte foot process effacement, and loss of slit-diaphragm structure. Mutations in both podocin gene (NPHS 2) alleles lead {{to a wide range of}} human disease, from childhood-onset steroid-resistant FSGS and minimal change disease to adult-onset FSGS. Dominantly inherited mutations in ACTN 4, the -actinin- 4 gene, can lead to a slowly progressive adult-onset form of FSGS. In addition, FSGS is observed as part of several rare multisystem inherited syndromes. Here we review recent progress in understand-ing the genetic basis of FSGS in humans. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. THE ROLE OF GENETIC factors in the de-velopment of focal segmental glomeruloscle-rosis (FSGS) in humans has become increasingly apparent in recent years. Genetic studies also have helped strengthen the notion that glomerular vis-ceral epithelial cell (or podocyte) disorders lead t...|$|E
40|$|Nephrin {{is a key}} {{functional}} component of the slit diaphragm, the structurally unresolved molecular filter in renal glomerular capillaries. Abnormal nephrin or its absence results in severe proteinuria and loss of the slit diaphragm. The diaphragm is a thin extracellular membrane spanning the approximately 40 -nm-wide filtration slit between podocyte foot processes covering the capillary surface. Using electron tomography, we show that the slit diaphragm comprises a network of winding molecular strands with pores {{the same size as}} or smaller than albumin molecules, as demonstrated in humans, rats, and mice. In the network, which is occasionally stratified, immunogold-nephrin antibodies labeled individually detectable globular cross strands, about 35 nm in length, lining the lateral elongated pores. The cross strands, emanating {{from both sides of the}} slit, contacted at the slit center but had free distal endings. Shorter strands associated with the cross strands were observed at their base. Immunolabeling of recombinant nephrin molecules on transfected cells and in vitrified solution corroborated the findings in kidney. Nephrin-deficient proteinuric patients with Finnish-type <b>congenital</b> <b>nephrosis</b> and nephrin-knockout mice had only narrow filtration slits that lacked the slit diaphragm network and the 35 -nm-long strands but contained shorter molecular structures. The results suggest the direct involvement of nephrin molecules in constituting the macromolecule-retaining slit diaphragm and its pores...|$|E
40|$|We report five fetuses and a {{child from}} three {{families}} who shared a phenotype comprising cerebral ventriculomegaly and echogenic kidneys with histopathological findings of <b>congenital</b> <b>nephrosis.</b> The presenting features were greatly elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) or amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFAFP) levels or abnormalities visualized on ultrasound scan during the second trimester of pregnancy. Exome sequencing revealed deleterious sequence variants in Crumbs, Drosophila, Homolog of, 2 (CRB 2) consistent with autosomal-recessive inheritance. Two fetuses with cerebral ventriculomegaly and renal microcysts were compound heterozygotes for p. Asn 800 Lys and p. Trp 759 Ter, one fetus with renal microcysts was a compound heterozygote for p. Glu 643 Ala and p. Asn 800 Lys, and one child with cerebral ventriculomegaly, periventricular heterotopias, echogenic kidneys, and renal failure was homozygous for p. Arg 633 Trp in CRB 2. Examination of the kidneys in one fetus showed tubular cysts at the corticomedullary junction and diffuse effacement of the epithelial foot processes and microvillous transformation of the renal podocytes, findings that {{were similar to those}} reported in congenital nephrotic syndrome, Finnish type, that is caused by mutations in nephrin (NPHS 1). Loss of function for crb 2 b and nphs 1 in Danio rerio were previously shown to result in loss of the slit diaphragms of the podocytes, leading to the hypothesis that nephrosis develops from an inability to develop a functional glomerular barrier. We conclude that the phenotype associated with CRB 2 mutations is pleiotropic and that the condition is an important consideration in the evaluation of high MSAFP/AFAFP where a renal cause is suspected...|$|E
40|$|Clustering-induced {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation of nephrin by Src family kinases. BackgroundNephrin is a recently discovered protein of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. In the kidney, {{it is located}} at the slit diaphragm, which forms the decisive size-selective filter of glomerular ultrafiltration barrier and locates between the interdigitating foot processes of podocytes. Nephrin is mutated in <b>congenital</b> <b>nephrosis</b> of the Finnish type (NPHS 1) and has been demonstrated to be an essential component of the slit diaphragm. Based on its domain structure, nephrin {{is likely to be a}} cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion protein that may have a signaling function. In this study, we hypothesized that the clustering of nephrin with antibodies on cell surface mimics the situation where the interaction between nephrin and its extracellular ligand(s) is altered. MethodsNephrin was clustered on the surface of stably transfected HEK 293 cells by a monoclonal antinephrin antibody and polyclonal secondary antibody. Clusters were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Changes in protein phosphorylation were studied employing immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis. A specific inhibitor and cotransfection experiments were used to investigate role of Src family kinases in nephrin phosphorylation. ResultsClustering of nephrin induced its own {{tyrosine phosphorylation}}. This phosphorylation was inhibited by PP 2, an inhibitor of Src family kinases. Several members of Src family kinases were able to induce nephrin phosphorylation when cotransfected to HEK 293 cells with nephrin. Moreover, the Src family kinase Fyn was consistently found to be coimmunoprecipitated with nephrin. Interestingly, clustering of nephrin induced also tyrosine phosphorylation of a 46 kD protein that was as well found to be coimmunoprecipitated with nephrin. ConclusionNephrin is a signaling protein phosphorylated by Src family kinases...|$|E
40|$|Crumbs family {{proteins}} are apical transmembrane proteins {{with ancient}} roles in cell polarity. Mouse Crumbs 2 mutants arrest at midgestation with abnormal neural plate morphology and {{a deficit of}} mesoderm caused by defects in gastrulation. We identified an ENU-induced mutation, wsnp, that phenocopies the Crumbs 2 null phenotype. We show that wsnp is a null allele of Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (Poglut 1), which encodes an enzyme previously shown to add O-glucose to EGF repeats in the extracellular domain of Drosophila and mammalian Notch, but the role of POGLUT 1 in mammalian gastrulation has not been investigated. As predicted, we find that POGLUT 1 is essential for Notch signaling in the early mouse embryo. However, the loss of mouse POGLUT 1 causes an earlier and more dramatic phenotype than does the loss of activity of the Notch pathway, indicating that POGLUT 1 has additional biologically relevant substrates. Using mass spectrometry, we show that POGLUT 1 modifies EGF repeats in the extracellular domain of full-length mouse CRUMBS 2. CRUMBS 2 that lacks the O-glucose modification fails to be enriched on the apical plasma membrane and instead accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. The data demonstrate that CRUMBS 2 is the target of POGLUT 1 for the gastrulation epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and that all activity of CRUMBS 2 depends on modification by POGLUT 1. Mutations in human POGLUT 1 cause Dowling-Degos Disease, POGLUT 1 is overexpressed {{in a variety of}} tumor cells, and mutations in the EGF repeats of human CRUMBS proteins are associated with human <b>congenital</b> <b>nephrosis,</b> retinitis pigmentosa and retinal degeneration, suggesting that O-glucosylation of CRUMBS proteins has broad roles in human health...|$|E
