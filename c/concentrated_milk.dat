40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of our research}} was to modify the current indirect casein method for bovine milk to enable it {{to be applied to}} bovine <b>milk,</b> bovine <b>milk</b> <b>concentrates,</b> and <b>milks</b> of other species that contain a protein concentration up to 9 % (wt/wt). Our work used a series of bovine <b>milk</b> <b>concentrates</b> from about 3 to 9 % protein with the same casein as a percentage of true protein to determine the amount of buffer required and pH of the noncasein nitrogen (NCN) filtrate to achieve consistent estimates of casein and casein as percent of true protein. As the concentration of protein in milk increased (either in bovine <b>milk</b> <b>concentrates</b> or in <b>milks</b> of other species), the amount of buffer needed for the NCN sample preparation method to achieve a filtrate pH of 4. 6 increased. In {{the first part of the}} study using a series of bovine <b>milk</b> <b>concentrates,</b> it was demonstrated that the method gave more consistent predictions of casein as a percentage of true protein when the final NCN filtrate pH was between 4. 5 and 4. 6 at 38 °C. When the amount of buffer added to the sample was not sufficient (i. e., the filtrate pH was too high), the filtrates were not clear. A polynomial equation was developed for prediction of the amount of acetic acid or sodium acetate buffer required to achieve pH 4. 5 to 4. 6 for milk protein concentrations from 3 to 9 % protein using bovine <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>concentrates.</b> When the equation developed using cow milk was applied to goat, sheep, and water buffalo milks, it correctly predicted the volume of reagents needed to achieve a final NCN filtrate pH of 4. 6 at 38 °C. We also verified as part of this work that the ability to measure NPN content of milk was not influenced by protein content of milk in the range from 3 to 9 % protein. The results of this study will be used as the basis for proposed changes in the official methods for measurement of the casein content of milk to expand the scope of the method so it can be used to achieve accurate results for <b>milk</b> <b>concentrates</b> and <b>milks</b> of other species...|$|R

The effects of alteration of process variables on SEF in full-cream milk powders (300 g total fat·kg– 1 powder) were examined.

Full-cream milk powders {{with high levels}} of SEF (up to approximately 400 g·kg– 1 total fat in powder) could be obtained by separating full-cream milk into cream and skim milk fractions, pasteurizing the cream fraction, then, either cooling the cream and recombining it with a skim <b>milk</b> <b>concentrate</b> or homogenizing it at high temperature and pressure prior to combi-ning with a skim <b>milk</b> <b>concentrate.</b> Full-cream <b>milk</b> <b>concentrates</b> produced by either process were then spray dried without homogenization.

50|$|Dairy {{products}} like cheese and yogurt {{can also be}} made through fermentation using microbes. Cheese was produced {{as a way to}} preserve the nutrients obtained from milk, through fermentation thus elongating the shelf-life of the product. Microbes are used to convert the lactose sugars into lactic acid through fermentation. The bacteria used for such fermentation are usually from Lactococci, Lactobacilli, or Streptococci families. Sometimes these microbes are added before or after the acidification step needed for cheese production. Also these microbes are responsible for the different flavors of cheese, since they have enzymes that breakdown milk sugars and fats into multiple building blocks. Some other microbes like mold may be purposely introduced during or before the aging of the cheese, in order to give it a different flavor. The production of yogurt starts from the pasteurization of milk, where undesired microbes are reduced or eliminated. Once the milk is pasteurized the milk is ready to be processed to reduce fat and liquid content, so what remains is mostly solid content. This can be done by drying the milk so that the liquid evaporates or by adding <b>concentrated</b> <b>milk.</b> Increasing the solid content of the milk also increases the nutritional value since the nutrients are more concentrated. After this step is accomplished, the milk is ready for fermentation where the milk gets inoculated with bacteria in hygienic stainless steel containers and then gets carefully monitored for lactic acid production, temperature and pH.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Stale flavor {{development}} has been recognized as a defect of stored dry milk powders for several years. Recently, stale flavor {{development has}} been found to occur upon storage of sterilized <b>concentrated</b> <b>milk,</b> and is recognized as the principal limiting factor to commercial utilization of this process (Seibert, 1963). Some {{attempts have been made to}} identify the volatile flavor components of sterilized <b>concentrated</b> <b>milk</b> (Patel et al, 1963; Bingham, 1964). The flavor components responsible for the stale flavor defect as it occurs in sterilized <b>concentrated</b> <b>milk</b> have not been identified, however. The purpose of this work was to identify the compounds responsible for the stale flavor defect of sterilized <b>concentrated</b> <b>milk.</b> It was felt that this information was essential to an understanding of the staling phenomenon, which in turn might eventually lead to correction of the defect. Commercial samples of sterilized <b>concentrated</b> <b>milk</b> were obtained. Stale flavor development was hastened in some of the samples by storing them at 21 °C. Subjective flavor panel evaluation of stored and fresh samples revealed significant differences between the two. Gas chromatographic analysis of the volatile head space components by the procedure described by Morgan and Day (1965) revealed only minor differences between the fresh and stale samples. It was reasoned, therefore, that the compounds responsible for the stale flavor defect were primarily of a less volatile nature, A technique for isolating the higher-boiling flavor components was developed. This technique consisted of lyophilization of the sterile <b>concentrated</b> <b>milk,</b> uniform wetting of the lyophilized milk with water to 10...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} century in the Netherlands milk {{production}} per cow has almost tripled. Accordingly, the amount of concentrates yearly fed per cow strongly increased. Furthermore, automation and robotisation has changed dairy management, especially {{by the introduction of}} automatic <b>concentrate</b> feeders and <b>milking</b> systems. A new management concept, emerging in the last decades, is Precision Livestock Farming (PLF). The objective of PLF is to optimize livestock production, by on-line monitoring and control of the production process, utilizing the technical possibilities of automation and robotisation. Nowadays, individual settings for daily <b>concentrate</b> supply and <b>milking</b> frequency are based on standards, ignoring individual variation in milk yield response on <b>concentrate</b> intake and <b>milking</b> frequency. This leads to the main hypothesis for this thesis research that profitability of dairy farming can be improved by utilizing information on individual variation in response. The first objective of this research was to quantify the individual variation in milk yield response to <b>concentrate</b> intake and <b>milking</b> interval length, in order to assess the economic prospects of applying individual optimal settings for <b>concentrate</b> supply and <b>milking</b> frequency. The second objective was the development and testing of adaptive models for on-line estimation of the actual individual response in <b>milk</b> yield to <b>concentrate</b> intake and <b>milking</b> interval length. The conclusion is that on-line estimation of the actual individual response in milk yield and milking duration is possible following a Bayesian approach for time series using an adaptive dynamic model. Besides estimation of the actual response the Bayesian approach adequately detects process deteriorations.
