5000|$|The A-Series {{design was}} {{licensed}} by Nissan of Japan, {{along with other}} Austin designs. Improvements were rapid. Early change was to a fit 5 main bearing <b>crank.</b> <b>Head</b> was modified for first E series by swapping plugs and ports, plugs fitted between pushrods and 8 ports eliminated the Siamesed inlet and exhaust ports. Nissan modified the design into the later Nissan A engine that was launched in 1966 with an aluminium head and wedge combustion chambers. It {{became the basis for}} many of their following engines notably the later OHC Nissan E engine, was scaled up into Nissan CA engine and ultimately the DOHC 170bhp CA18DET. All these engines show their lineage by the characteristic un-skirted crankcase block of the BMC A series, the A and E also having the bulge in the sump joint face for the oil pump drive. (Nissan engines with deep crankcase skirts are derived from the Mercedes OHC inline 6 that Nissan also licensed in the 1950's.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Toyota {{never made}} a wide-valve angle [...] "7A-GE" [...] based on the 7A, but many enthusiasts have created one using a {{combination}} of 7A-FE parts (block and <b>crank),</b> 4A-GE parts (<b>head,</b> pistons) and custom connecting rods. The '7A-FE' has a smaller crank journal, and smaller wrist pins (press fit) so a few companies have made special rods to accommodate these builds. Likewise, an unofficial supercharged [...] "7A-GZE" [...] has also been built from 7A-FE parts (block, <b>crank),</b> 4A-GZE parts (<b>head,</b> pistons) and custom connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|The cattle catch (also {{referred}} to as reverse crucifix, iron cross or stocks) is a hyperflexing neck crank involving trapping the opponent's hands and forcing the head towards his or her chest. The technique is performed with the opponent lying {{on his or her}} back, and the combatant performing the neck crank perpendicularly face-down in a side mount position above the head of the opponent, with the opponent's head resting towards his armpit. The combatant traps one arm using the legs, and the other using the arms. By using the pinned arms and legs as a point of leverage, the combatant can forcefully <b>crank</b> the <b>head</b> towards the opponent's chest.|$|R
50|$|The company's logo was a three-spoke bicycle <b>crank</b> {{with the}} <b>head</b> of a griffin, the {{coat of arms}} of Scania, in the middle, and after the merger the same logo was used {{for more than five}} and a half decade before being replaced. Since 1984, the logo once again depicts the griffin on a shape {{simplified}} from the crank, even if the succeeding company neither has any relation to the region, nor manufacture bicycles.|$|R
5000|$|If {{an engine}} hydrolocks while at speed, a {{mechanical}} failure is likely. Common damage modes include bent or broken connecting rods, a fractured <b>crank,</b> a fractured <b>head,</b> a fractured block, crankcase damage, damaged bearings, or {{any combination of}} these. Forces absorbed by other interconnected components may cause additional damage. Physical damage to metal parts can manifest as a [...] "crashing" [...] or [...] "screeching" [...] sound and usually requires replacement of the engine or a substantial rebuild of its major components.|$|R
6000|$|As {{he walked}} through the train, looking for {{familiar}} faces, he saw only one person whom he knew, and that was Seneca Doane, the lawyer who, after the blessings of being in Babbitt's own class at college and of becoming a corporation-counsel, had turned <b>crank,</b> had <b>headed</b> farmer-labor tickets and fraternized with admitted socialists. Though he was in rebellion, naturally Babbitt did not care to be seen talking with such a fanatic, but in all the Pullmans he could find no other acquaintance, and reluctantly he halted. Seneca Doane was a slight, thin-haired man, rather like Chum Frink except that he hadn't Frink's grin. He was reading a book called [...] "The Way of All Flesh." [...] It looked religious to Babbitt, and he wondered if Doane could possibly have been converted and turned decent and patriotic.|$|R
25|$|Several key {{leaders in}} the IU School of Medicine's history were drawn from Johns Hopkins. After Allison Maxwell, Charles P. Emerson from JHU was named the new dean. In 1912 Willis D. Gatch, who {{received}} an M.D. from JHU, began his career at Indiana. Gatch invented the Gatch adjustable hospital bed, which {{with the aid of}} a <b>crank</b> the patient's <b>head</b> and feet could be raised or lowered. One of IUSM's first faculty members, George Bond was initially employed at JHU. He became perhaps the first individual to operate an electrocardiograph in the nation.|$|R
5000|$|Remnants {{of other}} FPE parts were much later {{found by the}} then-owner of 1954 Kieft F1 chassis, Gordon and Martyn Chapman, in an air-raid cellar in the {{abandoned}} building which used to belong to Bill Lacey (of Power Engines Ltd., a Coventry Climax specialist) near the main entrance of Silverstone Circuit, including 3 blocks, 2 <b>cranks,</b> 16 cylinder <b>heads,</b> 20-some cam covers (carriers?), two cardboxes full of timing gears and camshafts, which all belonged to [...] "Doc Murfield" [...] who had purchased the parts from Andrew Getley in 1968-69 and had entrusted them to Bill Lacey.|$|R

5000|$|The 327 cu in V8, {{introduced}} in 1962, had a bore of 4 in and {{a stroke of}} [...] Power ranged from 210 hp to 375 hp depending on the choice of carburetor or fuel injection, camshaft, cylinder heads, pistons and intake manifold. In 1962, the Duntov solid lifter cam versions produced , [...] with single Carter 4-barrel, and 360 hp, [...] with Rochester FI. In 1964, horsepower increased to [...] for the now dubbed L-76 version, and 375 hp for the fuel injected L-84 respectively, making the L-84 the most powerful naturally aspirated, single-cam, production small block V8 until {{the appearance of the}} , [...] Generation III LS6 in 2001. This block is one of three displacements that underwent a major change in 1968/1969 when the main journal size was increased from 2.30 to 2.45 in. It's also interesting to note that in 1965 Chevrolet released the now legendary L-79, which was nothing more than an L-76 (11.0:1 forged pop-up pistons, forged steel rods and <b>crank,</b> 2.02 Corvette <b>heads),</b> but with the 30-30 Duntov cam replaced by the #151 hydraulic cam.|$|R
5000|$|Several drag racers {{have driven}} funny cars for Chuck Beal, {{including}} Jeff Arend (who now drag races for Jim Dunn Racing). One of Chuck Beal's racers, Jeff Diehl, {{was in an}} explosion while driving in Beal's nitro Funny Car during the Firebird Raceway NHRA National Time Trials event. Beal {{was quoted as saying}} [...] " [...] "It's a big, big dent in my pocketbook ... It was pretty devastating. It took out a brand-new TFX block. It may be salvageable, but it took out the <b>crank</b> and one <b>head.</b> The blower, obviously, is junk, but all of the safety equipment -- the blower and valve-cover restraints--did their job, so my hat is off to Deist. The body is cracked and will need to be repaired, but I've got a spare." [...] In 2009, Beal and his crew finished work on a new car that was intended to help get Welch his competitive license. The completion of the vehicle was celebrated with a visit to the Cajon Classics Cruise Funny Car Frenzy at El Cajon, California. Chuck Beal Racing has multiple sponsors, including UnderCover Truck Bed Covers, TruXedo Tonneau Covers, ProZ, and TruXP.|$|R
5000|$|Good News for People Who Love Bad News was {{released}} to widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 83, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album all five stars {{and said that}} [...] "Ultimately, what makes Good News so successful is that it retains the melancholy mood of past works, {{while at the same}} time adding depth and maturity." [...] Spin gave it an A and said it was [...] "Half expansive, burnished radio-rock, half swampy Delta hoodoo-hollerin' that reeks of Brock's Southern sojourn." [...] Filter gave it a score of 92% and said that it would soon be [...] "one of the best albums of 2004". NME gave it a score of nine out of ten and called it [...] "A real-life pop record. Well, not pop in the Girls Aloud sense of the word obviously, more in the drop-dead, fuzz-box brilliant 'Here Comes Your Man' sense." [...] Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a daring yet accessible disc". The New York Times also gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "the best Modest Mouse album yet." [...] E! Online gave it a B+ and said that [...] "If there's a touchstone band for this album, it's Little Creatures-era Talking <b>Heads</b> <b>cranking</b> out songs that are joyously eccentric, celebratory and catchy." [...] Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "It just feels that amidst his bare and heartfelt explorations of life and the old wooden box wherein we all end up, Brock has learned to dance, learned to allow himself a smile." [...] Mojo gave the album four stars out of five and said that [...] "Moments of simple, exultant joy are plentiful." [...] Q also gave it four stars out of five and said that the album consisted of [...] "45 bonkers minutes". Alternative Press likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated, [...] "If Good News... isn't the pillar-like masterpiece Modest Mouse fans have waited years for, it's proof that things haven't completely fallen apart." [...] Dusted gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a more varied album than The Moon and Antarctica (which did seem to have only one speed), and with the return of original member Dan Gallucci, Brock appears to have revived the heavy lead guitar playing of their early work." [...] The A.V. Club also gave it a favorable review and stated, [...] "The songs still rely on Brock's echoing guitar patterns and Mobius-strip lyrics, delivered in the voice of a harried, hip-hop-inflected square-dance caller, but though the vehicle stays the same, the scenery outside the window changes considerably." ...|$|R
