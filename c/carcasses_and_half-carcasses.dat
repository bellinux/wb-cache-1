40|$|In this work, {{the risk}} of {{contamination}} of cattle and pig carcasses with pathogens {{at different stages of}} their slaughter and processing was assessed. The analysis of meat (carcasses, half carcasses and cuts) and meat semi-prepared products from beef and pork for the presence of the microorganisms of the genera Salmonella and Listeria, and Listeria monocytogenes in the samples taken by the destructive (from the depth) and nondestructive (from the surface) methods was carried out to determine the critical points. It was found that the deep layers of beef and pork cuts were not contaminated with the microorganisms of the genus Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. However, surface contamination of cattle and pig <b>carcasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>half-carcasses</b> with Salmonella and L. monocytogenes was revealed at the stages of hide removal and evisceration of the carcasses. Dry and wet cleaning of <b>carcasses</b> <b>and</b> <b>half-carcasses</b> did not facilitate the reduction of contamination. This fact is the cause of contamination of meat semi-prepared products (small-sized and minced), which was established during the study. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} the tissue composition, the ratios between different issues, and the allometric growth of tissues from the commercial cuts neck, shoulder, rib, and leg, <b>and</b> of the <b>carcass</b> of Texel lambs. Thirty uncastrated male lambs born from single calvings {{were used in}} this experiment. Lambs were weaned, confined individually, and distributed into five treatments with six replications. Each treatment consisted of a predefined slaughter weight (T 23 – initial slaughter, T 25, T 30, T 35, and T 40). The proportion of bone decreased linearly in the shoulder, rib, and legs, but remained constant in the neck. The proportion of muscle decreased in the rib, whereas in the other cuts it remained constant. The percentage of fat increased as the slaughter weight of the lambs was increased, for all cuts. In all cuts <b>and</b> in the <b>carcass,</b> bone <b>and</b> muscle showed early growth (b 1). The proportion of bone decreased and fat increased linearly in the <b>carcass,</b> <b>and</b> the proportion of muscle was not influenced by the slaughter weight of the lambs. The muscle/fat ratio decreased in all cuts, and consequently in the half-carcass, as the slaughter weight was increased. The muscle/ bone ratio increased in the shoulder, rib, leg, <b>and</b> <b>half-carcass,</b> {{but there was no}} significant effect on the neck. The bone and muscle tissues showed early growth, whereas the fat had late growth in the different commercial cuts <b>and</b> <b>carcass</b> of Texel lambs. The tissue growth pattern of the shoulder may be representative of the allometric growth of the different carcass tissues. An increase in the slaughter weight of Texel lambs leads to a reduction of the muscle/fat ratio, due to the higher deposition of fat in the carcass of these animals...|$|R

40|$|In three {{separate}} studies (156 pigs total), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and ultrasound were compared as methods for measuring live body composition of pigs at 60 and 100 - 110 kg BWt. DXA measured total body fat and lean content, BIA measurements of resistance (Rs) and reactance (Xc) {{were used to}} calculate total body lean mass and ultrasound measurements of backfat (BF) depth and longissimus muscle area (LMA) were used to calculate total carcass lean mass. Following the 100 – 110 kg measurements, the pigs were slaughtered <b>and</b> the <b>half-carcass</b> analyzed chemically for fat and water content. At 110 kg both DXA and ultrasound measurements were significantly correlated with the percentages of <b>carcass</b> fat <b>and</b> water, although correlations were higher for DXA. The correlations between DXA and BF measurements were higher at 110 kg than at 60 kg, whereas they were lower for DXA and LMA. For pigs measured at 100 kg there were high correlations between the DXA values and the BIA estimates for both percentage of fat-free lean mass (FFM %) and FFM kg. Furthermore, {{the correlations between the}} BIA estimates of FFM <b>and</b> <b>carcass</b> fat <b>and</b> water content were similar to those for DXA <b>and</b> the same <b>carcass</b> values. This study also provided a side-by-side comparison of the BIA and ultrasound lean measurements relative to DXA <b>and</b> <b>carcass</b> composition.

40|$|<b>Carcass</b> <b>and</b> organs {{characteristics}} of two breeds and sexes of poultry which include Duck and Guinea fowl (GF) were investigated. A total of twenty four matured birds with twelve from each breed {{were used for}} this study in a 2 × 2 (Breed × Sex) factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design. The birds were slaughtered in batches of four properly bled, defeathered <b>and</b> dressed, the <b>carcasses</b> <b>and</b> organs weighed. The birds carcasses were chilled at 4 ºC for 24 hrs prior to fabrication into primal cuts. The results showed that duck had higher (P< 0. 05) <b>carcass</b> <b>and</b> organs weight and percentages than GF, also males irrespective of the breed gave higher (P< 0. 05) <b>carcass</b> <b>and</b> organs weight and percentages than their female counterparts. At interaction level male ducks still gave higher (P< 0. 05) cut-up parts weight and percentages than female, while female GF elicited higher (P< 0. 05) primal cuts weight and percentages. It was observed from this study that Duck <b>and</b> GF <b>carcass</b> <b>and</b> organs cut-up parts were heavy enough to supply needed protein like chicken. These birds can therefore, be integrated into commercial poultry production to make animal protein more available to consumers...|$|R

40|$|In a 2 -year experiment, 66 Belgian Blue (BB) double-muscled culled {{females have}} been divided in three groups {{according}} to the calving number (heifers-H, cows culled after two calvings-C 2 or four calvings-C 4) and finished on a maize silage-based diet in order to compare animal performance <b>and</b> evolution of <b>carcass</b> <b>and</b> meat characteristics with age. Four females per group were slaughtered on day 0 to assess <b>carcass</b> <b>and</b> meat characteristics of lean animals. The initial and final live weights, the <b>carcass</b> weight <b>and</b> the daily food intake increased with advancing age, while the live weight gain and feed efficiency decreased. The H presented the higher killing-out and muscle proportions and the lower adipose tissue proportion. Their meat was less dark and less red than that of older cows.

There were 360 -day-old chicks of the crossbred, allocated to 9 dietary-protein treatments. The treatments were P 1 (21 %- 17 % CP), which was the ration with 21 % CP given to chicks aged of 0 - 6 weeks, then continued with 17 % CP ration up to 12 week of age; P 2 was 21 %- 15 % CP; P 3 was 19 %- 19 % CP; P 4 was 19 %- 17 % CP; P 5 was 19 %- 15 % CP; P 6 was 17 %- 17 % CP; P 7 was 17 %- 15 % CP; P 8 was 15 %- 19 % CP and P 9 was 15 %- 15 % CP. At 6 and 12 weeks of age each two out of 10 birds per cage were randomly picked for <b>carcass</b> <b>and</b> <b>carcass</b> portion analysis. Results showed that <b>carcass</b> <b>and</b> wings of 6 weeks of age birds were not significantly (P> 0. 05) influenced by dietary protein, whilst breast and thighs & drumsticks were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower on lower dietary protein.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{origin of}} beef contamination and genetic diversity of Escherichia coli populations in beef cattle, on <b>carcasses</b> <b>and</b> ground beef, was examined by using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) {{analysis of the}} fliC gene. E. coli was recovered from the feces of 10 beef cattle during pasture grazing and feedlot finishing <b>and</b> from hides, <b>carcasses,</b> <b>and</b> ground beef after slaughter. The 1, 403 E. coli isolates (855 fecal, 320 hide, 153 <b>carcass,</b> <b>and</b> 75 ground beef) were grouped into 121 genetic subtypes by using the RAPD method. Some of the genetic subtypes in cattle feces were also recovered from hides, prechilled <b>carcasses,</b> chilled <b>carcasses,</b> <b>and</b> ground beef. E. coli genetic subtypes were shared among cattle at all sample times, {{but a number of}} transient types were unique to individual animals. The genetic diversity of the E. coli population changed over time within individual animals grazing on pasture and in the feedlot. Isolates from one animal (59 fecal, 30 hide, 19 <b>carcass,</b> <b>and</b> 12 ground beef) were characterized by the PCR-RFLP analysis of the fliC gene and were grouped into eight genotypes. There was good agreement between the results obtained with the RAPD and PCR-RFLP techniques. In conclusion, the E. coli contaminating meat can originate from cattle feces, and the E. coli population in beef cattle was highly diverse. Also, genetic subtypes can be shared among animals or can be unique to an animal, and they are constantly changing...|$|R
