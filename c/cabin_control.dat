In the cabins an average energy saving of 25% is achieved. A simple system automatically switches all energy using devices off in the cabins, such as the main light, bathroom light, socket-outlets and hair dryers whenever the cabin is empty. A Cabin Monitoring System regulates air conditioning in all cabins allowing guests to set their own cabin temperature. Centralized air-conditioning control is replaced with local <b>cabin</b> <b>control</b> significantly reducing energy waste.

40|$|Enabled by RISC technologies, {{low-cost}} commodity microprocessors {{are performing}} at ever increasing levels, significantly via instruction level parallelism (ILP). This in turn increases {{the opportunities for}} their use {{in a variety of}} day-to-day applications ranging from the simple control of appliances such as microwave ovens, to sophisticated systems for <b>cabin</b> <b>control</b> in modern aircraft. Indeed, "embedded" applications such as these represent segments in the computer industry with great potential for growth. However, this growth is currently impeded by the lack of robust optimizing compiler technologies that support the assured, rapid and inexpensive prototyping of real-time software in the context of microprocessors with ILP. In this paper we describe a novel notation, TimeC, for specifying timing constraints in programs, independent of the base language being used to develop the embedded application; TimeC specifications are language independent and can be instrumented into imperat [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} {{and characteristics of}} a large multi-parameter environmental simulation cabin are introduced. Due to the difficulties of control methods and the easily damaged characteristics, control systems for the large multi-parameter environmental simulation cabin are difficult to be controlled quickly and accurately with a classical PID algorithm. Considering the dynamic state characteristics of the environmental simulation test chamber, a lumped parameter model of the control system is established to accurately control the multiple parameters of the environmental chamber and a fuzzy control algorithm combined with expert-PID decision is introduced into the temperature, pressure, and rotation speed control systems. Both simulations and experimental results have shown that compared with classical PID control, this fuzzy-expert control method can decrease overshoot as well as enhance the capacity of anti-dynamic disturbance with robustness. It can also resolve the contradiction between rapidity and small overshoot, and is suitable for application in a large multi-parameter environmental simulation <b>cabin</b> <b>control</b> system...|$|E

40|$|For thermal <b>cabin</b> <b>control</b> of {{commercial}} aircraft, the cabin is usually divided {{into a small}} number of temperature zones. Each zone features its own air supply pipe. The necessary installation space for ducting increases significantly with the number of zones. This requires the number of temperature zones to be low. Factors such as seating layout, galley placement and passenger density result in deviations in heat flux throughout the cabin. These deviations cannot be compensated by the control system, if they occur within the same temperature zone. This work presents a novel temperature regulation concept based on local mixing. In this concept, two main ducts span the complete cabin length, and provide moderately warm and cold air. At each temperature zone, cabin supply air is locally mixed using butterfly valves. In this way, the number of temperature zones can be individually scaled up without any additional ducting, only requiring additional valves for each temperature zone. The access to hot trim air {{at the site of the}} mixing chamber can therefore be omitted. The advantages of this concept are bought at the expense of a more complex control system and a more sophisticated management of failure modes. Pneumatic coupling between temperature zones is much more pronounced compared with the traditional architecture. A centralized control architecture is required. A prototype architecture is presented, as well as a corresponding control system candidate. Possible strategies for the handling of failure modes are discussed. High fidelity simulations using the object-oriented equation-based modelling language Modelica are used to demonstrate robust performance under a wide range of boundary conditions...|$|E

The objective of this thesis was to develop a simulation model of an aircraft’s ECS and use it to acquire more knowledge of the ECS’s dynamic response. Another area of interest was how modifications affect ECS performance. The project also included comprehensive measurements in order to verify the simulation model. The thesis resulted in a partially verified simulation model which is valid {{in some of the most}} common flight situations. The model still needs further development and thorough testing to increase simulation accuracy and validity. Especially accurate implementation of the dynamic response needs further investigation and research.
