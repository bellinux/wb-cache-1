2500|$|The XK8 was {{launched}} in 1996 to replace the XJ-S. [...] Two body styles were produced - a coupé and a convertible. [...] The car {{was the first in}} the Jaguar line-up to use Jaguar's newly developed V8 engine - the AJ-V8. [...] In 2000, the supercharged XKR was added to the range. [...] The XKR featured 370 supercharged horsepower, a subtle rear spoiler, wire mesh front grille, and red exterior emblems. [...] The XKR's motor was made in England, the ignition system was from NGK in Japan, the transmission was a Mercedes-Benz 722.6, the lighting system was by Valeo in France, and the supercharger was made by Eaton in the USA. [...] So it was truly a world car. [...] The 2000-2002 XKR's had the 4.0 engine which featured a plastic timing <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> and plastic finned water pump. [...] Replacement of these plastic items with metal ones is a prudent investment. The 2000 XKR received positive reviews from magazines including Road & Track, Car & Driver, and Automobile.|$|E

50|$|Alfine is {{the name}} of a comfort and urban {{oriented}} product series by Shimano. It is mainly known for internally geared hubs, but includes also hydraulic disc brakes and levers, <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners,</b> dynamo hubs, cranksets, shift levers, and complete wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake discs}} were {{increased}} {{in size to}} aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners</b> were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, {{with the addition of}} a thermostatically controlled fan.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{derailleur}} serves double duty: moving the chain between rear sprockets and taking up chain slack caused by {{moving to a}} smaller sprocket at the rear or a smaller chainring by the front derailleur. In order to accomplish this second task, it is positioned {{in the path of}} the bottom, slack portion of chain. Sometimes the rear-derailleurs are re-purposed as <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners</b> for single-speed bicycles that cannot adjust chain tension by a different method.|$|R

The XKR 100 featured all the available optionals and an Anthracite paint finish, Recaro seats, 20-inch BBS alloy wheels, Brembo brakes, specific dark wood dashboard panels and GPS.As it was produced only after 2001 all the engines were fitted with upgraded metal <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners</b> and fuel pump, solving the common engine failures due to the weakness of plastic and semi-plastic tensioners.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, {{a revised}} version of the XLV750R was introduced, bearing the {{additional}} designation [...] "F". The XLV750R(F)-models were improved in some details (tamer cams resulting in 6 hp less power, improved automatic cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners,</b> improved carburetor setup, among other minor modifications) and had a black engine and golden rims with black hubs. These motorcycles were painted in the colour combinations black/blue metallic, black/red metallic and black/silver grey and were mainly marketed in Italy, France, and Australia. Honda never officially offered them in Germany, probably because the demand was very low due to the mainly negative press the XLV had received there (see for example [...] and [...] ).|$|R

5000|$|Various {{derailleur}} {{systems were}} {{designed and built}} in the late 19th century. One example is the Protean two-speed derailleur available on the Whippet safety bicycle. The French bicycle tourist, writer and cycling promoter Paul de Vivie (1853-1930), who wrote under the name Vélocio, invented a two speed rear derailleur in 1905 which he used on forays into the Alps.Some early designs used rods to move the chain onto various gears. 1928 saw {{the introduction of the}} [...] "Super Champion Gear" [...] (or [...] "Osgear") from the company founded by champion cyclist Oscar Egg, as well as the Vittoria Margherita; both employed chainstay mounted 'paddles' and single lever <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners</b> mounted near or on the downtube. However, these systems, along with the rod-operated Campagnolo Cambio Corsa were eventually superseded by parallelogram derailleurs.|$|R
5000|$|Dirt jumping, {{urban and}} street {{mountain}} bikes lie {{somewhere in between}} a BMX bike and a freeride bike. They are either arranged as rigid or hardtail bikes, with 3 to 4.5 in of front suspension, and rigid, durable frames with low bottom brackets and short chainstays to improve maneuverability. Dirt Jump bikes often overlap in design with Four-Cross bikes, though that discipline has largely fallen out of favor, with many frames including removable derailleur hangers and/or integrated <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners</b> to allow for single speed and multi-speed arrangements (Four-Cross bikes mostly use derailleurs while Dirt Jumpers usually use single speed setups). Tires on these bikes are usually 24 or 26" [...] diameter, fast-rolling slicks or semi-slicks, with narrow casings (approx. 1.8-2.2"). Dirt jumpers usually have low seatposts and oversized handlebars, {{to make room for}} tricks. Most dirt jumpers have an extended rear brake cable installed and have no front brake, which allows the rider to spin the handle bars multiple times without tangling the brake cables.|$|R
40|$|Development of {{combustion}} engines {{can be characterized}} by continuous {{increase in the number}} of computational simulations being applied in all areas. There is a clear trend to use chain or belt drives for the design of timing drives. Computational simulation of these drives has not been developing too long due to high demands on the computational technology. The paper focuses on simulation of dynamics of the timing chain drive with the use of a multi-body system. A mass-produced four cylinder in-line engine with two camshafts and two valves per cylinder has been used as a computational model. Key words: chain drive, four cylinder in-line engine, contact force, <b>tensioner,</b> <b>chain</b> stiffnes...|$|R
5000|$|On {{bicycles}} with fixed chain-lines, no <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> is required, eliminating a {{part that}} could otherwise become damaged in rough terrain- an advantage for off-road cyclists. Where a tensioner is required, a short cage is usually sufficient {{to take up}} the chain slack.|$|E

40|$|A {{photoelastic}} {{stress analysis}} technique {{has been used}} to determine the contact stresses in an automotive <b>chain</b> drive <b>tensioner.</b> The tensioner in normal operation is subject to high magnitude, short duration impact stresses. These stresses are known to cause surface damage, wear, and surface pitting. In order to adequately design the drive system layout, a means for stress quantification is needed. A replica tensioner was made from epoxy resin and tested in a variety of configurations. A simple model has been created to relate the chain link load to the resulting tensioner sub-surface stress field. This model {{has been used to}} correlate the observed and predicted location of isochromatic fringes, and hence to evaluate the chain link load from the photoelastic fringe pattern. A series of static load tests were performed to calibrate the apparatus. The tensioner specimen was then assembled in a chain drive test facility. The apparatus was used to run a chain under realistic engine loading conditions. A high-speed digital camera was used to capture sequences of photoelastic images, which were then used to find the impact loading caused by individual links in the chain. Once the load was determined the contact model was used to determine the magnitude and location of the resultant peak stresses. Measured impact stresses were found to be several times higher than those which would have been calculated from a static analysis. Copyright © 2006 SAE International...|$|R
5000|$|All {{versions}} {{featured a}} low-maintenance timing chain with a self-adjusting hydraulic <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> and hydraulic valve tappets. The M42 also incorporates the Bosch Motronic M1.7 DME, eliminating a distributor {{in favor of}} fully electronic ignition timing. [...] The DME was configured to fire four individual remotely mounted coils. Furthermore, in markets that required emissions controls, the DME also incorporates an upstream O2 sensor and three-way catalyst.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the M42 developed problems with the camshaft chain drive. The hydraulic tensioner, chain guides, idler wheel and rear lower chain case have all been updated to resolve mechanical wear problems experienced in the early {{versions of the}} M42. Since the updated cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> is shared with the M44, people commonly refer to the revised tensioner as a [...] "M44 tensioner".|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{evolutionary}} development of the Boxer line, the engine was a longitudinal opposed 2-cylinder boxer engine with lower camshaft and overhead valves. Driving the camshaft was a duplex (later simplex) chain with a spring-loaded <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner.</b> The clutch was a single dry plate with cable actuation. A 5-speed manual transmission, with an optional kickstarter for the early models, and shaft drive to the rear wheel completed the drivetrain.|$|E
50|$|Some systems combine {{internally}} geared hubs {{with external}} derailleurs. A freewheeling hub with a sprocket suitable for narrow chain {{can be combined}} with a double or triple crankset and front derailleur, {{in order to provide}} a wider range and closer gear ratio spacing. A <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> or a rear derailleur is needed to take up chain slack, and care is needed not to over-torque the hub by using too small a chainring/sprocket ratio.|$|E
50|$|The changes {{extended}} to the engine where Honda's late 1970s issues with cam chains were dealt with via the introduction of an automatic tensioner replacing the manual version on the earlier models. Other changes also meant that the standard valve clearances were reduced, possibly through tighter manufacturing control. Sports model engines are identifiable via {{the lack of a}} cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> bolt and the revised valve covers which feature black painted stripes and satin alloy flat areas.|$|E
50|$|The cam lobes act {{directly}} on bucket type tappets, which are adjusted {{by means of}} shims between {{the underside of the}} bucket and the top of the valves. Two duplex chains drive the camshafts, one from the crankshaft to a sprocket {{at the level of the}} combustion chambers, and one from the sprocket to each camshaft. The original sprung slipper design of the lower cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> proved to be too weak and after a couple of years was changed to an improved hydraulic design, using engine oil pressure.|$|E
50|$|Single-speed bicycle {{builders}} have converted {{many former}} multi-geared cycles into single or fixed speed through {{the removal of}} the derailleurs and associated hardware. The simplest conversion uses the existing freewheel/cassette and crankset, the chain being cut to fit the desired gear ratio. However this retains unnecessary weight and the chainline will most likely not be perfect. A more thorough conversion will involve replacing the freewheel with a single-speed one, and re-dishing the rear wheel. On bicycles with vertical dropouts, a <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> is often required to allow the correct tension on the resulting shorter chain.|$|E
50|$|Manufactured from 1987 to 1996 in the USA to late 1999 in {{the rest}} of the world, the Hurricane went through only three major revisions. In 1989, the bike {{received}} a cosmetic makeover with a complete redesign of the front fairing, improvements to the bike's front suspension, larger tyres were added to help cope with the bike's heavy weight and to accommodate radial tyres, improvements were also added to the bike's cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> in an attempt to remove the annoying cam chain rattle some riders had reported. The 1989 model also had its power slightly increased, and it gained weight.|$|E
50|$|Rear {{vertical}} dropouts {{have the}} slot facing downwards. The {{advantage is that}} the wheel axle cannot slip forward compared with horizontal dropouts. The disadvantage is that on a bicycle without a rear derailleur but with vertical dropouts, the chain tension cannot be adjusted by moving the wheel forwards or backwards, and needs another means of chain-tensioning, by a derailleur, <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner,</b> or eccentric bottom bracket or rear hub. Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of chain tensioning device, because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake.|$|E
50|$|QBP {{purchased}} Salsa Cycles in 1997, a California-based mountain-bike manufacturer. The following year, QBP {{entered the}} emerging single-speed bike market with its in-house designed Singleator <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner.</b> Later in 1998, this product {{and the new}} Rat Ride single-speed frame (soon renamed the 1X1) helped launch the company’s new start-up, Surly Bikes. After that, the company continued developing brands for under-served markets, adding specialty parts with Problem Solvers, value parts and accessories with Dimension, and high-end components with Winwood. QBP also became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Jagwire, a Taiwan-based manufacturer of bicycle brake and derailleur components including pads, cables and cable housing.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{affected}} by an oil sludge problem and premature timing <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> failure, which were fixed around 2002-2004. The oil sludge issue {{appears to have been}} caused by issues with the crankcase ventilation system, and while it affected a minority of engines, it could cause complete failure In some cases, neglected maintenance aided in premature failure (missed oil changes or increased intervals between oil changes). Also this engine was plagued with issues regarding the water pump gasket leaking coolant internally and diluting the oil. Such coolant leaks must be addressed instantly or engine failure is imminent.|$|E
50|$|In industry, it is usual {{to monitor}} the {{movement}} of the <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> (whether manual or automatic) or the exact length of a drive chain (one rule of thumb is to replace a roller chain which has elongated 3% on an adjustable drive or 1.5% on a fixed-center drive). A simpler method, particularly suitable for the cycle or motorcycle user, is to attempt to pull the chain away from the larger of the two sprockets. Any significant movement (e.g. making it possible to see through a gap) probably indicates a chain worn up to and beyond the limit. Sprocket damage will result if the problem is ignored.|$|E
5000|$|Historically stock bikes all had 135 mm spaced {{dropouts}} to take {{a standard}} mountain bike rear hub. There is a subcategory of Stock trials bikes, sometimes called 'Modstock Bikes', which have 26" [...] wheels but have horizontal dropouts spaced at 116 mm, similar to mod bikes. Horizontal dropouts at both spacings {{are becoming more and}} more common in stock bikes as they eliminate the need for a <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner,</b> making the bike lighter (The chain is tensioned by moving the wheel backwards in the dropouts; vertical dropouts are designed to hold the wheel in one position only and therefore require a separate means of tensioning the chain to accommodate wear).|$|E
50|$|The 1981 XL250S was {{the last}} year to have the unique 23-inch front wheel, rear twin shock, and 6-volt {{electrical}} system. It also had upgraded rear brakes in a larger hub and a modified 5 plate clutch, and handsome twin speedo and tacho gauges in the Australian, continental variants. In 1982 the engine had the balancing cam sprocket driven rather than chain making the engine quieter and a six-speed gearbox was introduced with an automatic cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner.</b> From 1982 Honda reverted to the 21-inch front wheel and introduced the rear single shock suspension, known as the Pro-Link, and a 12-volt system. The 1984-1987 models were equipped with dual carburetors and the RFVC type of engine.|$|E
