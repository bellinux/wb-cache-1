5000|$|In 1353, Innocent VI {{declared}} {{these first}} <b>Capitulations</b> invalid with his Apostolic Constitution, Sollicitudo, citing a Constitution of Pope Gregory X, Contingit, which prohibited papal conclaves from dealing with issues {{other than the}} election of a Pope. This papal response would be repeated for most future <b>Capitulations,</b> which were generally disregarded. For this reason, papal historian Frederic Baumgartner calls <b>capitulations</b> [...] "an exercise in futility." [...] Another papal historian, Van Dyke, surmises that by the election of Pope Sixtus IV (1471), [...] "all the Popes for forty years had signed and promptly broken" [...] the [...] "Capitulation of the Conclave." [...] Jugie considers the [...] "regular recourse to capitulation" [...] to be [...] "above all, an admission of weakness." [...] Despite their ineffectiveness, <b>Capitulations</b> still give an insight into the thinking of the Cardinals as they prepared to vote for a pope.|$|R
