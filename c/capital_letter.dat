Its current helmet {{design features}} an Oxford blue background, with an Oxford blue and Cambridge blue round shield inscribed with a white, <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> A. For {{most of the}} team's history, the logo featured some form of a boat, often incorporating a football.|$|E
5|$|The {{data also}} allowed for an {{investigation}} into whether visual prominence {{is an important factor}} in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{his work}} {{inspired}} many French printers and punchcutters such as Robert Estienne and Claude Garamond from 1530 onwards, {{even though the}} typeface of De Aetna with its original capitals was apparently used in only about twelve books between 1496 and 1499. Historian Beatrice Warde suggested in the 1920s that its influence {{may have been due}} to the high quality of printing shown in the original De Aetna volume, perhaps created as a small pilot project. De Aetna was printed using a mixture of alternate characters, perhaps as an experiment, which included a lower-case p in the same style as the <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> with a flat top. In 1499, Griffo recut the capitals, changing the appearance of the typeface slightly. This version was used to print Manutius' famous illustrated volume Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.|$|E

5|$|Supernova discoveries are {{reported}} to the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova. The name is the marker SN followed by the year of discovery, suffixed with a one or two-letter designation. The first 26 supernovae of the year are designated with a <b>capital</b> <b>letter</b> from A to Z. Afterward pairs of lower-case letters are used: aa, ab, and so on. Hence, for example, SN2003C designates the third supernova reported in the year 2003. The last supernova of 2005 was SN2005nc, indicating {{that it was the}} 367th supernova found in 2005. Since 2000, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009; 231 in 2013).|$|E

5000|$|Block {{letters may}} {{also be used as}} a synonym of block capitals, which means writing in all <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> or in large and small <b>capital</b> <b>letters,</b> imitating the style of typeset <b>capital</b> <b>letters.</b> This is not a {{necessary}} implication, however: in at least one court case involving patents, trademarks and registration of designs, the term [...] "block letters" [...] was found to include both upper and lower case.|$|R

50|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>letters</b> {{should not}} be used to {{accentuate}} words on a form or document; it is too distracting and disrupts the look of the form or document. When <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> are absolutely necessary, say {{in the case of an}} acronym or abbreviation, small caps should be used, with or without initial caps. When <b>capital</b> <b>letters</b> are not absolutely necessary, the technical communicator should evaluate the effectiveness of italicizing the word or phrase for emphasis.|$|R
