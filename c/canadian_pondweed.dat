50|$|The lake {{supports}} {{a range of}} pondweeds that include Potamogeton perfoliatus and P. lucens, <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Elodea canadensis), {{and a variety of}} stoneworts (Chara spp., such as C. pedunculata and C. curta) which are marl or hard-water lake indicators.|$|E
50|$|Open water {{habitats}} include rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, ponds and, uniquely, turloughs). Common {{species of}} wet places include common reed, marsh willowherb, common marsh bedstraw, water avens, angelica, brooklime, marsh pennywort, water plantain, marsh cinquefoil, marsh marigold, watermint, yellow water lily, bulrush and the invasive species <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Potamogeton is a genus of aquatic, mostly freshwater, {{plants of}} the family Potamogetonaceae. Most are known by the common name pondweed, {{although}} many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Elodea canadensis). The genus name means [...] "river neighbor", originating from the Greek potamos (river) and geiton (neighbor).|$|E
50|$|Elodea canadensis (American or <b>Canadian</b> {{waterweed}} or <b>pondweed)</b> is {{a perennial}} aquatic plant, or submergent macrophyte, native {{to most of}} North America. It has been introduced widely to regions outside its native range and was first recorded from the British Isles in about 1836.|$|R
50|$|Despite their proximity, the two pools differ ecologically. 'Double Kettle' is fed {{by surface}} runoff and its water is turbid, {{supporting}} only an impoverished surface vegetation of pondweeds, including the alien <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed,</b> Elodea canadensis; it is fringed mainly by common reed, Phragmites australis, with some saw-sedge and common club-rush, Scirpus lacustris.|$|E
50|$|The {{health of}} the lake is {{indicated}} by the variety of zooplankton in it - rotifers (Anuraeopsis fissa, Synchaeta grandis, S. longipes, Ascomorpha ovalis, Brachionus angularis, B. caliciflorus, Keratella cochlearis, K. tecta, Polyarthra dolichoptera, Trichocerca similis), Bosmina meridionalis, Calamoecia lucasi, Mesocyclops leuckarti, nauplii. However, there are also weed species such as willow, pampas, kikuyu and <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{lake was}} {{originally}} installed during Captain Traherne's {{ownership of the}} estate. Throughout the decades the lake 'silted-up' {{due to a lack}} of management and by the early 1980s had become more recognisable as a marsh than a lake. During the renovations, completed before the parks opening, in 1986 the lake was dredged and a sluice was installed to help regulate its water levels during periods of heavy rain. The lake is now largely unmanaged as previous measures to control the invasive <b>canadian</b> <b>pondweed</b> have proved successful.|$|E
50|$|The loch is botanically-rich loch and Martnaham Wood {{is one of}} {{the largest}} oak woods in Ayrshire; {{although}} it was clear felled in 1914, it has regenerated with little disturbance. The loch exhibits vegetation of submerged, floating and emergent type plant communities. The margin has extensive areas of reed-swamp dominated by common reed. Branched bur-reed, water-plantain, nodding bur-marigold, trifid bur-marigold, greater spearwort, and eight-stamened waterwort are found at the site. In the deeper water white and yellow water-lilies dominate. <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed</b> is an invasive plant and is here in abundance. The loch is classed as mesotrophic (moderately nutrient-rich), however it has eutrophic characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The loch has had spoil, {{effluent}} {{and other}} pollutants discharged into {{it when the}} Glengarnock Iron and then Steel Works were operational; the remaining slag in the loch is relatively rich in phosphates which exacerbates the pollution problems. In the 1990s the loch become eutrophic {{as a result of}} high levels of nutrient input which has sometimes resulted in algal blooms in the summer, counteracted by bales of barley straw. These algal blooms can be dangerous to both humans and dogs. The source of this input has not been clearly tracked down, however a reedbed may be established to act as a filtration system. The loch is rather poor in terms of invertebrate faunal diversity under its present conditions, not helped by the invasive pondweeds, such as <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed.</b>|$|E
50|$|These declines {{probably}} {{reflect the}} widespread damage to riverine landscapes across lowland Europe, {{and in particular}} the loss of many features such as back channels, oxbow lakes and floodplain ponds as rivers are channelised and engineered for flood defence and agricultural purposes. The largest British populations are in disused or rarely boated canals, which cannot be the primary habitat for grass-wrack pondweed and are not a sustainable long-term habitat. However, in the short-term, canal populations are an important reservoir for this species. Competition with introduced Elodea canadensis (<b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed)</b> and E. nuttallii (Nuttall's water-thyme) may also be problematic. It is possible that the widespread reintroduction of beaver across Europe may help to arrest or reverse the decline of grass-wrack pondweed, as beaver ponds may well be a suitable habitat for this species.|$|E
40|$|There is current {{interest}} {{in the use of}} artificial wetlands and macrophyte-cultured ponds for the treatment of agricultural drainage water, sewage, and industrial effluents. Aquatic plant-based water treatment systems have proved effective and economical in improving the quality of wastewaters containing excess nutrients, organic pollutants, and heavy metals. This investigation was conducted to test the hypothesis that herbicide-tolerant aquatic plants can remediate herbicide-contaminated waters. The addition of Ceratophyllum demersum (coontail, hornwort), Elodea canadensis (American elodea, <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed),</b> or Lemna minor(common duckweed) significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) reduced the concentration of [14 C]metolachlor (MET) remaining in the treated water.

40|$|Lake Steinsfjorden is {{the most}} {{important}} noble crayfish locality in Norway. The crayfish population has been monitored annually since 1979 including data on total trapping effort, yield and population composition before and after the catching season. The harvest has ranged from 0. 7 - 4. 7 kg. ha- 1. The catch per trap night decreased prior to 1991 and the yield was reduced by some 50 % over the years 1987 - 1992 as compared to 1979 - 1986. This was due to removal of small crayfish, high exploitation and the establishment of dense stands of <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Elodea canadensis). Baited traps catch a large fraction of crayfish < 95 mm total length minimum size. These should according to the regulations immediately be released into the lake. However, it is apparent from the size composition that release of these small crayfish was rather incomplete. In 1983, trap mesh size was increased from 17. 5 mm to 21 mm to reduce the fraction of undersized crayfish in the trap catches, yet no effects of this increased mesh size on crayfish size distribution were observed. The legal season has been reduced three times during the study period. In 1983, the closing date was changed from 31 December to 15 September. In 1989 the legal season was further reduced to two weeks and finally in 1995 to 10 days. This reduced total trap effort by 45 %. The shorter season allow many crayfish to moult twice instead of once between seasons and the fraction of large crayfish has thus increased and so has the catch per trap night. <b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed</b> has established dense annual stands and thus has made large parts of the shallow areas unsuitable for crayfish, causing an overall decrease in crayfish population size and production...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} and spread of {{invasive alien species}} (IAS) constitutes {{one of the most}} important drivers of global change in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Robust risk assessment methods are required for IAS to provide the foundation upon which to prioritise appropriate action. In a previous study (Roy, Schonrogge et al. 2014) minimum standards were developed to provide an assessment framework for risk assessments and ultimately for underpinning the development of a proposed list of “IAS of EU concern”, in accordance to the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 1143 / 2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the prevention and management of the {{introduction and}} spread of invasive alien species. In practice, of the protocols assessed in detail, only four (GB NNRA, EPPO DSS, Harmonia+ and ENSARS) were sufficiently compliant with the minimum standards to be considered and of these only the GB NNRA and EPPO DSS have published IAS risk assessments. As a result, using the information from such “substantially compliant” protocols, a draft list of approximately 50 species was compiled. It is important to note that this list of species is based on availability of robust risk assessments already completed through methods which are almost compliant with the minimum standards, and it does not constitute the list of “IAS of EU concern”. In view of the application of the forthcoming EU Regulation on IAS (and building-on ENV. B. 2 /ETU/ 2013 / 0026) the Commission hosted a 2 -day scientific workshop to examine the selected risk assessments and pool the existing knowledge existing in the EU to complete the missing information, on the basis of robust scientific evidence, in order to make them fully compliant with the minimum standards, wherever possible. The workshop was led by Helen Roy (CEH) and Riccardo Scalera (ISSG). An additional 16 experts from fifteen member states were selected based on their expertise in invasion biology and represented a breadth of expertise from a variety of perspectives including taxonomic (all taxa), environmental (freshwater, marine and terrestrial), impacts (environmental, socio-economic and health) and disciplines (ecologists, conservation practitioners, scientists, policy-makers, risk assessors). In view of the gaps across risk assessments for ecosystem services and climate change two experts were invited to guide the development of approaches for these specific themes. In total the risk assessments for 56 species were considered. The GB NNRA and EPPO DSS have published IAS risk assessments which, when considering species that score medium to high impact, together cover 51 species (noting that Fallopia japonica and F. sachalinensis are separate species). Two further risk assessments were suggested for consideration by the GB Non-Native Species Secretariat which follow the GB NNRA protocol: coati (Nasua nasua) and skunk (Mephitis mephitis), although scored as low impact. Finally an additional three species have been considered through new European–wide risk assessments, with the reported outcome of high impact, for this project which again follow the GB NNRA protocol: Pallas squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus), grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and coypu (Myocastor coypus). The main gaps across all risk assessments were in relation to climate change and ecosystem services but additional information was also required on benefits as mentioned with minimum standard “Description (Taxonomy, invasion history, distribution range (native and introduced), geographic scope, socio-economic benefits) ” and in some cases information to support the minimum standard “Includes status (threatened or protected) of species or habitat under threat“ was missing. It was agreed that systematic consideration of a list of questions in relation to the minimum standards on ecosystem services and climate change would be useful guidance for experts. An outline of the approaches agreed through the workshop for the minimum standards “Includes possible effects of climate change in the foreseeable future“ and “Can broadly assess environmental impact with respect to ecosystem services” were developed as guidance for documenting information in relation to climate change and ecosystem services. Each species was considered separately with the experts providing an overview of the information available for addressing the identified gaps. After all species had been considered the workshop participants (excluding the EC, Helen Roy and Riccardo Scalera) adopted a consensus approach to confirm whether or not the risk assessment was compliant with the minimum standards and whether the overall score of the risk assessment remained applicable. No changes were made to the scores but any recommendations were noted. There were very few recommendations for change. The outcome for each risk assessment was agreed and summarised as “compliant” or “not compliant” with the minimum standards. Of the risk assessments for the 56 species considered through this project, 53 were agreed to be fully compliant with the minimum standards. However, Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, although compliant with the minimum standards should be excluded as it is not within the scope of the regulation (see art 2. e) because it is listed in annex IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 708 / 2007 of 11 June 2007 concerning use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture. Four of the risk assessments were not considered to be compliant because of major information gaps: Elodea canadensis (<b>Canadian</b> <b>pondweed),</b> Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed), M. mephitis (skunk), N. nasua (coati) ...|$|E
