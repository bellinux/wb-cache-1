In this way gales have their physiognomy. You remember them by your own feelings, and no two gales stamp themselves in the same way upon your emotions. Some cling to you in woebegone misery; others come back fiercely and weirdly, like ghouls bent upon sucking your strength away; others, again, have a catastrophic splendour; some are unvenerated recollections, as of spiteful wild-cats clawing at your agonized vitals; others are severe, like a visitation; and one or two rise up draped and mysterious, with an aspect of ominous menace. In each of them there is a <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> at which the whole feeling seems contained in one single moment.

6000|$|Obliquity of the eyebrows.--Two points {{alone in}} the above {{description}} require further elucidation, and these are very curious ones; namely, the raising of the inner ends of the eyebrows, and the drawing down of {{the corners of the}} mouth. With respect to the eyebrows, they may occasionally be seen to assume an oblique position in persons suffering from deep dejection or anxiety; for instance, I have observed this movement in a mother whilst speaking about her sick son; and it is sometimes excited by quite trifling or momentary causes of real or pretended distress. The eyebrows assume this position owing to the contraction of certain muscles (namely, the orbiculars, corrugators, and pyramidals of the nose, which together tend to lower and contract the eyebrows) being partially checked by the more powerful action of the central fascim of the frontal muscle. These latter fasciae by their contraction raise the inner ends alone of the eyebrows; and as the corrugators at the same time draw the eyebrows together, their inner ends become puckered into a fold or lump. This fold is a highly <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> in the appearance of the eyebrows when rendered oblique, as may be seen in figs. 2 and 5, Plate II. The eyebrows are at the same time somewhat roughened, owing to the hairs being made to project. Dr. J. Crichton Browne has also often noticed in melancholic patients who keep their eyebrows persistently oblique, [...] "a peculiar acute arching of the upper eyelid." [...] A trace of this may be observed by comparing the right and left eyelids of the young man in the photograph (fig. 2, Plate II.); for {{he was not able to}} act equally on both eyebrows. This is also shown by the unequal furrows on the two sides of his forehead. The acute arching of the eyelids ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{accurate}} optical {{inspection of}} IC chip, {{it is necessary}} to recognize and calibrate the IC micro-topography completely and accurately. Positioning method of <b>characteristic</b> <b>points</b> in IC chip’s micro-topography based on cross correlation matching and image projection transformation is investigated to realize high precision detection of surface topography. On the basis of extracting wavelet high-frequency components of IC topography conjugate images which is shot by high-definition CCD cameras from different space positions, the coordinate information of some selected topography’s <b>characteristic</b> <b>points</b> is shown. Cross correlation matching is applied to definite the <b>characteristic</b> <b>point’s</b> relative positions in the projected images, then relationship of image projection transformation is established for calculating and determining the <b>characteristic</b> <b>point’s</b> absolute coordinates, which facilitates following topography detection of IC chip. Experiment analysis and data comparison indicate that accurate coordinate positioning results of <b>characteristic</b> <b>points</b> can be obtained by this method, the research basis for following IC topography model structuring and micro- flaw characteristic detecting can also be provided...|$|R

60|$|On the Manner of Action of Sexual Selection with mankind.—With primeval {{men under}} the {{favourable}} conditions just stated, {{and with those}} savages who {{at the present time}} enter into any marriage tie (but subject to greater or less interference according as the habits of female infanticide, early betrothals, &c., are more or less practised), sexual selection will probably have acted in the following manner. The strongest and most vigorous men,—those who could best defend and hunt for their families, and during later times the chiefs or head-men,—those who were provided with the best weapons and who possessed the most property, such as a larger number of dogs or other animals, would have succeeded in rearing a greater average number of offspring, than would the weaker, poorer and lower members of the same tribes. There can, also, be no doubt that such men would generally have been able to select the more attractive women. At present the chiefs of nearly every tribe throughout the world succeed in obtaining more than one wife. Until recently, as I hear from Mr. Mantell, almost every girl in New Zealand, who was pretty, or promised to be pretty, was tapu to some chief. With the Kafirs, as Mr. C. Hamilton states,[462] “the chiefs generally have the pick of the women for many miles round, and are most persevering in establishing or confirming their privilege.” We have seen that each race has its own style of beauty, and we know that it is natural to man to admire each <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> in his domestic animals, dress, ornaments, and personal appearance, when carried a little beyond the common standard. If then the several foregoing propositions be admitted, and I cannot see that they are doubtful, it would be an inexplicable circumstance, if the selection of the more attractive women by the more powerful men of each tribe, who would rear on an average a greater number of children, did not after the lapse of many generations modify to a certain extent the character of the tribe.|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt the}} {{perceptive}} powers {{of man and}} the lower animals are so constituted that brilliant colours and certain forms, as well as harmonious and rhythmical sounds, give pleasure and are called beautiful; but why this should be so, we know no more than why certain bodily sensations are agreeable and others disagreeable. It is certainly not true that {{there is in the}} mind of man any universal standard of beauty with respect to the human body. It is, however, possible that certain tastes may in the course of time become inherited, though I know of no evidence in favour of this belief; and if so, each race would possess its own innate ideal standard of beauty. It has been argued[446] that ugliness consists in an approach to the structure of the lower animals, and this no doubt is true with the more civilised nations, in which intellect is highly appreciated; but a nose twice as prominent, or eyes twice as large as usual, would not be an approach in structure to any of the lower animals, and yet would be utterly hideous. The men of each race prefer what they are accustomed to behold; they cannot endure any great change; but they like variety, and admire each <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> carried to a moderate extreme.[447] Men accustomed to a nearly oval face, to straight and regular features, and to bright colours, admire, as we Europeans know, these points when strongly developed. On the other hand, men accustomed to a broad face, with high cheek-bones, a depressed nose, and a black skin, admire these points strongly developed. No doubt characters of all kinds may easily be too much developed for beauty. Hence a perfect beauty, which implies many characters modified in a particular manner, will in every race be a prodigy. As the great anatomist Bichat long ago said, if every one were cast in the same mould, there would be no such thing as beauty. If all our women were to become as beautiful as the Venus de Medici, we should for a time be charmed; but we should soon wish for variety; and as soon as we had obtained variety, we should wish to see certain characters in our women a little exaggerated beyond the then existing common standard.|$|E

[...] He had been {{speaking}} with growing bitterness, quite losing sight of his mother's pain and bewilderment in the passionate joy of publishing his wrongs. Since he was hurt, he must cry out; since he was in pain, he must scatter his pain abroad. Of his never thinking of others, save as they spoke and moved from his cue, as it were, this extraordinary insensibility to the injurious effects of his eloquence was a capital example; the more so as the motive of his eloquence was never an appeal for sympathy or compassion, things to which he seemed perfectly indifferent and of which he could make no use. The great and <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> with him was the perfect absoluteness of his own emotions and experience. He never saw himself as part of a whole; only as the clear-cut, sharp-edged, isolated individual, rejoicing or raging, as the case might be, but needing in any case absolutely to affirm himself. All this, to Rowland, was ancient history, but his perception of it stirred within him afresh, at the sight of Roderick's sense of having been betrayed. That he, under the circumstances, should not in fairness be the first to lodge a complaint of betrayal was a point to which, at his leisure, Rowland was of course capable of rendering impartial justice; but Roderick's present desperation was so peremptory that it imposed itself on one's sympathies. [...] "Do you pretend to say," [...] he went on, [...] "that she did n't lead me along to the very edge of fulfillment and stupefy me with all that she suffered me to believe, all that she sacredly promised? It amused her to do it, and she knew perfectly well what she really meant. She never meant to be sincere; she never dreamed she could be. She 's a ravenous flirt, and why a flirt is a flirt is more than I can tell you. I can't understand playing with those matters; for me they 're serious, whether I take them up or lay them down. I don't see what 's in your head, Rowland, to attempt to defend Miss Light; you were the first to cry out against her! You told me she was dangerous, and I pooh-poohed you.

When looking at the specimen, he noticed that the characteristics seen in Stereosternum were also seen in Mesosaurus. At the time, E.D.

He does note that the specimen looked like no other reptile known from the Carboniferous.

Also, he had difficulties in trying to determine the position of Stereosternum, reporting that some <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> it into Rhynchocephalia or into Sauropterygia.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for computing the transmission index of parallel mechanisms. The approach {{is based on an}} extended concept to compute the maximal virtual coefficient, which is an important notion involved in the formulation of dimensionally homogeneous transmission indices for singularity analysis and dimensional optimization of parallel mechanisms. By exploiting the dual property of the virtual coefficient, two characteristic points instead of one as in {{the current state of the}} art are defined: one <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> – termed the transmission <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> – is located on the ‘floating’ axis of the transmission wrench, as in existing approaches, while a second one – termed the output <b>characteristic</b> <b>point</b> – is located on the floating axis of the output twist of the platform, which is a novel concept. This allows one to define two characteristic lengths, namely, the transmission and output characteristic lengths, respectively, of which the larger is then used for the measure of the “distance” between the transmission wrench screw and the output twist screw. As shown in this paper, this new measure makes it possible to discern more finely the configuration-dependent properties of kinematic performance of parallel mechanisms, thus making it more suitable for dimensional optimization. Confidence in this statement is demonstrated through the comparative study of two in-parallel mechanisms using the new method and previously existing ones...|$|E
