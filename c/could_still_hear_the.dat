60|$|For {{a moment}} he was silent, thinking. The searching party had passed on. They <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> purring of the motor as Maenck's car moved slowly up the street.|$|E
60|$|Great {{branches}} of the elm loaded with leaves swung about us in a sudden burst of wind, but when it died down I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> conversational voice above. I could hear two voices.|$|E
60|$|Although I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{wind blowing}} {{strongly}} outside, I too {{was glad that}} its force had diminished so far that we felt no more the violent jerking that had disturbed us, and I soon fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|Striped Chipmunk {{sat on a}} mossy old log, {{laughing}} {{until his}} sides ached. [...] "Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!" [...] laughed Striped Chipmunk, holding his sides. Over in the Green Forest he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> Chatterer <b>the</b> Red Squirrel crying [...] "Thief! Robber!" [...] as he chased his big cousin, Happy Jack, {{and every time he}} heard it, Striped Chipmunk laughed harder.|$|R
60|$|When he had {{finished}} his search, he {{came down to the}} ground floor and entered the room corresponding with the one from which he had heard voices in the adjoining house. He crouched here upon the dusty boards for some time, listening. Now and then he fancied that he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> voices on <b>the</b> other side of the wall, but he was never absolutely certain.|$|R
60|$|The evening fell cloudy; not a {{star was}} to be seen when {{the first round of}} the night passed through our shed and wound off along the ramparts; and as we took our places, we <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear,</b> over <b>the</b> murmurs of the {{surrounding}} city, the sentries challenging its further passage. Laclas, the sergeant-major, set us in our stations, engaged our wands, and left us. To avoid blood-stained clothing, my adversary and I had stripped to the shoes; and the chill of the night enveloped our bodies like a wet sheet. The man was better at fencing than myself; he was vastly taller than I, being of a stature almost gigantic, and proportionately strong. In the inky blackness of the shed it was impossible to see his eyes; and from the suppleness of the wands, I did not like to trust to a parade. I made up my mind accordingly to profit, if I might, by my defect; and as soon as the signal should be given, to throw myself down and lunge at the same moment. It was to play my life upon one card: should I not mortally wound him, no defence would be left me; what was yet more appalling, I thus ran the risk of bringing my own face against his scissor with the double force of our assaults, and my face and eyes are not that part of me that I would the most readily expose.|$|R
60|$|At {{once all}} the lights went out, for the fire-flies fled in every direction; but in the {{darkness}} Twinkle thought she <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> drone of the big bass fiddle and the flute-like trill of the ladybugs.|$|E
60|$|Presently the hen espied {{a hollow}} {{underneath}} the King's rocky throne, and crept into it unnoticed. She <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> chattering {{of those around}} her, but it was almost dark underneath the throne, so that soon she had fallen fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|She thrust him to {{the door}} of the anteroom; yet even when he had entered that apartment, and shut the door, he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> Queen talk in a loud and {{determined}} tone, as if giving forth orders, until at length the voice died away in a feeble and continued lamentation.|$|E
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> Murray fuming {{and cursing}} {{as he passed}} out into the barroom, {{at the front of}} which was Feinheimer's office.|$|R
6000|$|... "Granny's {{led them}} way {{off on the}} mountain. Good old Granny!" [...] thought Reddy Fox. Then he crawled {{right up to the}} very doorway. He <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> Jenny Wren scolding and fussing.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: most huanted {{theater in}} Las Vegas Nevada. People {{would say they}} would hear {{something}} whispering or talking to them even scrachtes on the arms also you <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> screams outside of the building ...|$|R
60|$|Behind me I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{cries of}} the watch and the crackle of musketry as the lobster backs fired at random, for it was not {{possible}} that Hiram yet remained in view, and with this noise were mingled the shouts of citizens who had been wakened from their slumbers, until there was a perfect bedlam at that corner of Hull and Salem streets.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning we}} trekked away, {{and my eyes}} were so full of tears as I sat beneath the tent of the first waggon that the {{familiar}} landscape and the home where I lived for twenty years and more were blotted from my sight. But I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> long-nosed spy who had bought the farm, and who as waiting to enter into possession, talking to Jan.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had {{not thought}} of such things where would your {{education}} have been, miss?" [...] retorted the angry old man; and Robert stole quietly away to his room, whence amid his canvases he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> hoarse voice and the clear in their never-ending family jangle. More and more sordid seemed the surroundings of his life, {{and more and more}} to be valued the peace which money can buy.|$|E
50|$|Chief Justice Chase {{held that}} while the United States Congress had enacted {{legislation}} in 1868 eliminating one route to a habeas corpus <b>hearing</b> before <b>the</b> court, <b>the</b> court <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> cases of a similar nature under its appellate jurisdiction under the Judiciary Act of 1789. Chase concluded that the court had jurisdiction to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case {{and the power to}} direct its writ at a military officer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Still</b> <b>hears</b> <b>the</b> distant {{music of}} your voice.|$|R
50|$|Local {{residents}} living nearby claimed {{of strange}} noises in late hours of night. For instance, {{despite the fact}} that the place didn’t have doors, they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> banging doors, windows, clattering of dishes, and voices of screaming and agonizing people.|$|R
60|$|Then {{it started}} downward, slowly at first, {{but as the}} incantation {{increased}} in rapidity, with greater speed. At {{the end of the}} line Tarzan <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> grumbling of the disgruntled priest. The man's voice rose louder and louder. A priestess near him spoke in sharp tones of rebuke. The knife was quite near to Tarzan's breast now, but it halted for an instant as the high priestess raised her eyes to shoot her swift displeasure at the instigator of this sacrilegious interruption.|$|E
6000|$|She {{sat down}} again, and leaning both her arms upon the table, hid her face within her hands. He was now standing, {{and for the}} moment did not speak to her. Indeed he could {{not bring himself to}} break the silence, for he saw her tears, and <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> {{violence}} of her sobs. And then she was the first to speak. [...] "If it were not for him," [...] she said, raising her head, [...] "I could bear it all. What will he do? what will he do?" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} tall figure and titanic energy of Flambeau {{appeared}} {{in the doorway of the}} mansions and dominated the little mob. Talking at the top of his voice like a fog-horn, he told somebody or anybody to go for a surgeon; and as he turned back into the dark and thronged entrance his friend Father Brown dipped in insignificantly after him. Even as he ducked and dived through the crowd he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> magnificent melody and monotony of the solar priest still calling on the happy god who is the friend of fountains and flowers.|$|E
60|$|The {{wardrobe}} {{was invisible}} in the darkness, but they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> Elspeth's breathing as she slept, and the exhausted woman listened long to it, as if she would fain carry away {{with her to the}} other world the memory of that sweet sound.|$|R
6000|$|He {{heard her}} hang up, and was surprised, the next moment, that somehow he was {{reluctant}} to yield to the happiness that he had claimed was his. Rather, did it seem that he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> her voice and Graham's recklessly singing the [...] "Gypsy Trail." ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{argument}} went on {{for some}} time. I was attacked across the table {{by a man named}} Burshort about my Endowment of Motherhood schemes, but in the gaps of that debate I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> Weston Massinghay at intervals repeat in a rather thickened voice: [...] "THEY didn't get dysentery." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{no sooner}} said, than the canoes again got in motion. The {{darkness}} might now {{have been a}} sufficient protection had there been no rice, but the plant would have concealed the movement, even at noon-day. The fire in the hut served as a beacon, and enabled le Bourdon to find the canoes. When he reached the landing, he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> dogs barking on the marsh, and the voices of those with them, calling in loud tones {{to two of the}} savages who had remained at the chiente, as a sort of camp-guard.|$|E
60|$|The stove flung out a drowsy heat, {{and it was}} {{not long}} before his eyes grew heavy. He <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> wailing of the wind and the swish of the snow that whirled about the lonely building, and listened for a while with {{tranquil}} contentment; for the wild weather he was not exposed to enhanced the comfort of the warmth and brightness he enjoyed. Then, the sounds grew less distinct and he heard nothing at all until he straightened himself suddenly in his chair as a cold draught struck him. A few flakes of snow also swept into the room and he saw that the door was open.|$|E
6000|$|Down {{the narrow}} stairs he groped his way, {{with the music}} of the orchestra, the fierce hysterical cries of the women, the mock cheering of those who crowded round, in his ears. He passed out into the blue-grey dawn. The stars were faint in the sky, and away eastwards little fleecy red clouds were strewn over the house-tops. He stood on the {{pavement}} and drew in a long breath. The morning breeze was like a draught of cold water; it was as though he had come back to life again after an interlude spent in some other world. Overhead he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> music of the [...] "Valse Amoureuse," [...] the swell of voices. He shivered, with the cold perhaps--or the memory of the nightmare! ...|$|E
3000|$|Lale: “My {{sister-in-law}} and {{my brother}} would say – just when he [the supervisee, SR] was leaving the room, so he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> it –: “Oh, he is so smart! He’s {{going to go to}} university, just like his aunt”. And then I would react like: “Yes, for sure, he is really smart. He really studies hard!”.” [...]...|$|R
50|$|Ives also {{experimented with}} quoting famous musical {{excerpts}} in different keys {{from the main}} theme. This idea stems from an incident when Ives was listening to two different marching bands, and <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> one band marching away while the other was marching towards him, thus sounding like two pieces simultaneously played in two different keys.|$|R
6000|$|So, {{after waiting}} {{a moment or}} two, Bowser turned and limped away through the trees, and he limped in the {{direction}} which Blacky the Crow had taken. You see, he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> Blacky's voice calling [...] "Caw, caw, caw", and somehow {{it made him feel}} better, less lonesome, you know, to be within hearing of a voice he knew.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{soldiers}} of the Cross, who should shun the glance of a woman as {{the eye of a}} basilisk, live in open sin, not with the females of their own race only, but with the daughters of the accursed heathen, and more accursed Jew. Beaumanoir, thou sleepest; up, and avenge our cause!--Slay the sinners, male and female!--Take to thee the brand of Phineas!--The vision fled, Conrade, but as I awaked I <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> clank of their mail, and see the waving of their white mantles.--And I will do according to their word, I WILL purify the fabric of the Temple! and the unclean stones in which the plague is, I will remove and cast out of the building." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he moved}} with dignity out of the room, Paul {{remained}} blankly staring after him. Was it all a dream?--or was this Colonel Pendleton the duelist? Had the old man gone crazy, or was he merely acting to veil some wild purpose? His sudden arrival showed that Yerba must have sent for {{him and told him}} of Don Caesar's threats; would he be wild enough to attempt to strangle the man in some remote room or {{in the darkness of the}} passage? He stepped softly into the hall: he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> double tread of the two men: they had reached the staircase--they were DESCENDING! He heard the drowsy accents of the night porter and the swinging of the door--they were in the street! ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pendyce tripped; his bucket {{rolled out}} of his hand; he lay where he had fallen, too {{exhausted}} to move. He <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> crash of the Rector's axe, {{the sound of his}} shouts. Somebody helped him up, and trembling so that he could hardly stand, he caught an axe out of the hand of a strapping young fellow who had just arrived, and placing himself by the Rector's side, swung it feebly against the boarding. The flames and smoke now filled the whole cow-house, and came rushing through the gap that they were making. The Squire and the Rector stood their ground. With a furious blow Mr. Barter cleared a way. A cheer rose behind them, but no beast came forth. All three were dead in the smoke and flames.|$|E
60|$|Yvonne, {{with eyes}} closed, hardly breathed, {{but through the}} veil of semi-consciousness which mercifully wrapped her senses, she <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> those awful words, and feel the {{pollution}} of those loathsome kisses with which--true to his threat--this creature--half man, wholly devil, whom she could not see, but whom she hated and feared as she would Satan himself--now covered her face and throat.|$|R
6000|$|VENABLES. I {{have heard}} nothing of that, Mrs. Shand. [He shakes his wise head.] And in any case, I am afraid--[He <b>still</b> <b>hears</b> <b>the</b> wooden leg.] ...|$|R
50|$|Local myth has it {{that one}} can <b>still</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> church bells of Rungholt ringing under the water when sailing through the area on a calm night.|$|R
