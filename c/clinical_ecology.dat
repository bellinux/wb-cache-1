40|$|Item {{response}} {{theory is}} a set of models and methods allowing for the analysis of binary or ordinal variables (items) that are influenced by a latent variable or latent trait- that is, a variable that cannot be measured directly. The theory was originally developed in educational assessment but has many other applications in <b>clinical</b> research, <b>ecology,</b> psychiatry, and economics. The Mokken scales have been described by Mokken (1971, A Theory and Procedure of Scale Analysis [De Gruyter]). They are composed of items that satisfy the three fundamental assumptions of item response theory: unidimensionality, monotonicity, and local independence. They can be considered nonparametric models in item response theory. Traces of the items and Loevinger's H coefficients are particularly useful indexes for checking whether a set of items constitutes a Mokken scale. However, these indexes are not available in general statistical packages. We introduce Stata commands to compute them. We also describe the options available and provide examples of output.

30|$|Antibiotic therapy must be {{initiated}} promptly in febrile neutropenic patients. In high-risk patients, initial empirical treatment with piperacillin-tazobatam or cefepime is recommended. In addition, the initial antibiotic strategy should be adapted {{based on the}} basis of initial <b>clinical</b> assessment, bacterial <b>ecology</b> in the hospital, and bacterial history in the patient. The use of vancomycin should be reserved for patients with suspected methicillin-resistant Gram-positive infections and/or signs of severe sepsis or septic shock. There is some evidence to support adding an aminoglycoside to the extended-spectrum β-lactams in critically ill neutropenic patients. Persistent fever requires adaptation of the initial antibiotic regimen if the clinical condition deteriorates or if a resistant pathogen is isolated. Addition of an antifungal agent must be considered. Giving the growing emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs is now mandatory.|$|R

While at least two genres of CMA have emerged, both of which are involved in a dialogue with each other, proponents of other perspectives often misread or "misconstruct" the agenda of CMA as both a theoretical framework and a strategy for health activism. This essay in particular critiques this process among proponents of the interpretative or cultural constructivist perspective.

40|$|Wallemia sebi is a deuteromycete fungus {{commonly}} found in agricultural environments {{in many parts of}} the world and is suspected to be a causative agent of farmer's lung disease. The fungus grows slowly on commonly used culture media and is often obscured by the fast-growing fungi. Thus, its occurrence in different environments has often been underestimated. In this study, we developed two sets of PCR primers specific to W. sebi that can be applied in either conventional PCR or real-time PCR for rapid detection and quantification of the fungus in environmental samples. Both PCR systems proved to be highly specific and sensitive for W. sebi detection even in a high background of other fungal DNAs. These methods were employed to investigate the presence of W. sebi in the aerosols of a farm. The results revealed a high concentration of W. sebi spores, 107 m− 3 by real-time PCR and 106 m− 3 by cultivation, which indicates the prevalence of W. sebi in farms handling hay and grain and in cow barns. The methods developed in this study could serve as rapid, specific, and sensitive means of detecting W. sebi in aerosol and surface samples and could thus facilitate investigations of its distribution, <b>ecology,</b> <b>clinical</b> diagnosis, and exposure risk assessment...|$|R

When considering the combined effects {{of the number of}} positive and negative self-schemas, antisociality, and parental alcoholism on drinking outcomes, the number of negative self-schemas directly predicted early drinking onset, whereas the number of positive self-schemas moderated the effects of antisociality on early drunkenness. Moreover, although self-concept properties at baseline did not differentiate level of alcohol involvement at follow-up in mid-adolescence, they did distinguish earlier from later age of onset among those who initiated, with effects tending to be somewhat stronger for boys than girls. Self-schemas appear to be an additional risk factor in the pathway to problem alcohol involvement in adolescence, above and beyond the contributions of such known risk factors as antisocial behavior and parental alcoholism...|$|R
40|$|Tick-borne {{encephalitis}} virus (TBEV) is {{an emerging}} pathogen in Europe and Asia. We investigated TBEV in Kyrgyzstan by collecting small mammals and ticks from diverse localities and analyzing them {{for evidence of}} TBEV infection. We found TBEV circulating in Kyrgyzstan much farther south and at higher altitudes than previously reported. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. The TBEV positive-sense RNA genome is translated as a polyprotein and subsequently cleaved into 3 structural and 7 nonstructural (NS) proteins (1). TBEV has 3 subtypes — European, Siberian, and Far-Eastern—each of {{which has its own}} <b>ecology,</b> <b>clinical</b> presentation, and geographic distribution (2). The vectors are Ixodes ricinus ticks for the European subtype and I. persulcatus ticks for the other 2 subtypes. TBEV circulates through a complex cycle involving small mammals, ticks, and large mammals (3); it can also be transmitted through consumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products (4). Our unpublished data and that of others suggest that TBEV circulates in Kazakhstan. However, we have found no reports (in English) since 1978 of TBEV infection in the neighboring Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan). Kyrgyzstan has extensive alpine and subalpine habitats (94 % of Kyrgyzstan is> 1, 000 m above sea level) (5); the Tien Shan mountain range dominates and physiographically links Kyrgyzstan to the Himalayas and western People’s Republic of China.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{continue to}} be a major cause of death in the human population, with tuberculosis and malaria affecting 500 million people and causing 1 – 2 million deaths annually [1]. The situation is aggravated by the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the risk that terrorists might use infectious organisms to aggress target populations. During the past decade, we have also witnessed the emergence of many new pathogens not previously de-tected in humans, such as the avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola. The ap-pearance of these novel agents and the reemergence of previously eradicated pathogens may be associated with the growing human population, flooding, and other environmental perturbations; global travel and migration; and animal trade and domestic animal husbandry practices. Simultaneously, we have seen an explosion of genome sequence data. Sequencing is now the method of choice for character-ization of new disease agents, as exempli-fied by the rapid sequencing of the genome of the SARS virus, which was made available within a month of identi-fication of the virus [2, 3]. Like SARS, most newly emerging disease agents orig-inate in animals and have been transmit-ted to humans recently at food markets, by insect bites, or through hunting [1]. The new sequencing technologies enable small academic research groups to create huge genome datasets at low cost. As a result, scientists with expertise in other fields of research, such as <b>clinical</b> microbi-ology and <b>ecology,</b> are just beginning to face the challenge of handling, comparing, and extracting useful information from millions of sequences.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{virtually}} all healthy adult dogs and cats harbor spiral helicobacters in their gastric mucosa. Three species, Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter bizzozeronii, and Helicobacter salomonis have been isolated in vitro from the gastric mucosa of these animals. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate the efficacy of an isolation method for canine and feline gastric helicobacters that has been developed at the University of Helsinki; to estimate the prevalence and distribution of these taxa in the samples examined; and to assess the efficacy and validity of an extensive set of standardized conventional phenotypic tests, whole-cell protein profiling, and ultrastructural analysis in identifying the different species isolated from canine and feline gastric mucosa. We cultured 95 and 22 gastric mucosal biopsies from dogs and cats, respectively. Twenty-one H. bizzozeronii strains, 8 H. felis strains, 8 H. salomonis strains, 3 mixed cultures, 2 “Flexispira rappini”-like organisms, and 3 as yet uncharacterized strains were isolated from the dogs, and 3 H. felis strains were isolated from the cats. The methods used here yielded Helicobacter isolation rates of 51 % from dogs and 13. 6 % from cats, which exceed those reported previously. The main difficulties were primary isolation, mixed cultures, and identification to the species level. In the species identification, a detailed morphological examination was found to yield important phenotypic characteristics. A large panel of biochemical and tolerance tests did not clearly differentiate the closely related species H. bizzozeronii, H. felis, and H. salomonis. Highly standardized whole-cell protein profiling was shown to be an excellent method for species identification. Improvements in culture conditions for these bacteria are still needed, especially for cats. A genetic identification method not requiring culture is needed for future studies of these very fastidious helicobacters, as the <b>clinical</b> significance and <b>ecology</b> of these species within the gastric mucosa of the domestic carnivores remain largely unknown...|$|R

However, cholera continues to cause extensive suffering and needless deaths across the country, particularly among the poor. The urgent need to eliminate transmission of cholera persists: compared to the same period in 2014, the first 4 months of 2015 saw three times the number of cholera cases. Drawing upon epidemiology, clinical work (and <b>clinical</b> knowledge), policy, <b>ecology,</b> and political economy, and informed by ethnographic data collected in a rural area of Haiti called Bocozel, this paper evaluates the progress of the nation&# 39;s 10 -year Plan for the Elimination of Cholera. Bocozel is a rice-producing region where most people live in extreme poverty. The irrigation network is decrepit, the land is prone to environmental shocks, fertilizer is not affordable, and the government&# 39;s capacity to assist farmers is undermined by resource constraints. When peasants do have rice to sell, the price of domestically grown rice is twice that of US-imported rice. Canal water is not only used to irrigate thousands of acres of rice paddies and sustain livestock, but also to bathe, wash, and play, while water from wells, hand pumps, and the river is used for drinking, cooking, and bathing. Only one out of the three government-sponsored water treatment stations in the research area is still functional and utilized by those who can afford it. Latrines are scarce and often shared by up to 30 people; open defecation remains common. Structural vulnerabilities cut across all sectors – not just water, sanitation, health care, and education, but agriculture, environment, (global and local) commerce, transportation, and governance as well. These are among the hidden sicknesses that impede Haiti and its partners&# 39; capacity to eliminate cholera. Keywords: water, sanitation, WASH, oral cholera vaccination, elimination ...|$|R

40|$|Public {{interest}} in diet and nutrition, {{and the current}} trend towards a higher fibre, lower fat diet, have been generally welcomed by health professionals. Unfortunately {{there has been a}} parallel public con-cern, probably unwarranted but greatly fuelled by the media, that ’allergy ’ to foods, food additives, beverages and even water, causes a wide range of distressing physical and psychological problems and chronic, disabling diseases. All of us have experienced adverse reactions to ingested foods. The clinical manifestations may be minimal- simple distaste or uncomfortable satiety, or there may be significant symptoms, suggestive of organic disease. In some individuals food is the primary cause of a defined clinical condition, such as coeliac disease. The mechanisms responsible for these adverse reactions are likely to be as varied as the clinical effects but unfortunately the term ’food allergy’, implying an immunological basis, has been widely used. Furthermore, unorthodox and non-medical organisations such as the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Ecology</b> movement (which publicises possible dangers of con-taminants, additives and other substances in our food and water) and many highly articulate patients, insist that there is collusion and denial by doctors, nutrition scientists and industrialists as to the mere existence of this problem. ’ In fact, a substantial amount of rele-vant research has been undertaken and reported in the medical and scientific press. There have been considerable advances in the understanding of immunological and pharmacological mechanisms of food intolerance, and psychologically-based reactions to foods have been clearly defined. In addition to the many books, symposia and journal supplements devoted to the topics of food allergy and intolerance, there has been a series of authoritative monographs {{from both sides of the}} Atlantic.

40|$|This study briefly reviews both {{historical}} and recent conceptualizations of dependency. In particular, {{it focuses on}} this concept's applicability to patients with chronic illnesses, especially those with allergies. Type and degree of dependency were seen as {{an important factor in}} the approach to the medical and psychological treatment of <b>clinical</b> <b>ecology</b> patients. The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop an objective measure of dependency which could quickly identify patients whose dependency conflicts interfere with the treatment process. The study was divided into three phases. In the first phase test responses by 84 inpatients to the CAQ, MMPI, and the HAT as well as {{historical and}} demographic data were analyzed by a series of stepwise discriminant analysis. The 53 resulting items were examined for those which most concisely discriminated between the two identified groups (pathologically dependent and nonpathologically dependent). These 15 items were used to test 120 additional patients in phase II. Fourteen items were retained and the coefficients obtained classified the patients in phase I and II with a 98. 81 percent and 94. 17 percent degree of accuracy respectively. These classification coefficients were used to classify another 30 patients in phase III with a 96. 67 percent rate of accuracy. These results provide exceptionally strong support for the hypothesis that group classification can be obtained through the use of an objective screening instrument. The pathologically dependent patients tend to focus on disease, frequently are unemployed, have histories of childhood illnesses, have limited emotional controls, are depressed, ambivalent, and distrustful. Additionally, they experience difficulty establishing goals or accepting personal responsibility. Those patients identified as nonpathologically dependent exemplify the more positive aspects of these traits. The pathologically dependent patients appear to be caught in a dilemma between wellness and satisfaction of dependency needs. While all patients need an organized approach to treatment, the pathologically dependent require an extremely structured repititious approach and may require long term psychological intervention in order to make positive steps toward wellness...|$|E
