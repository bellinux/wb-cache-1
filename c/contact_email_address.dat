40|$|The {{traditional}} and universal assumption that rape and sexual assault are gendered in nature - perpetrated by men upon women {{in order to}} control, oppress, or subordinate them - has implications for victim/survivors of every other form of unwanted sexual contact and non-contact. The historical focus upon male-to-female rape has overlooked the fact that – regardless of gender – children and adults are sexually victimised by {{people of all ages}} and genders. In my thesis, I explore the experiences of a group of victim/survivors who national and international research, and anti-sexual-victimisation efforts, have essentially ignored: women who have been sexually victimised by another woman, or women. From my reading, my thesis constitutes the first documented primary research endeavour to create a methodology that combines an auto/biographical approach with an occupational science perspective. This supports my belief that I cannot divorce myself from any aspect of my research, whilst ensuring my perspective remained occupation-focused. I used a web-based survey to generate data regarding the experience and awareness of woman-to-woman rape and sexual assault amongst those members of the general public who responded. One-hundred and fifty-nine surveys were used for analysis. Twenty countries were recorded to describe the respondents’ nationalities, with the large majority from the United Kingdom (UK). Respondents who are victim/survivors of female-perpetrated rape and sexual assault totalled n= 59 (37. 3 %). These are people who identified as a woman and were over 16 years old (the UK age of sexual consent) {{at the time of their}} victimisation. No respondents indicated they do not believe woman-to-woman rape and sexual assault is possible. Used as a sampling tool, survey respondents interested in sharing their story in more depth provided a <b>contact</b> <b>email</b> <b>address.</b> I interviewed 10 respondents face-to-face, in various UK locations. An eleventh respondent shared her story through correspondence with me. As intended, hearing and reading these stories enabled me to conduct a deep exploration of the respondents’ victimisations, and their subsequent experience of disclosure, reaction, and support. Four key themes emerged: Identity; Emotion; Survival; and Occupation. Specifically, the victim/survivors expressed the emotional and deleterious impacts which influenced their subjective experience of occupation. Hence, the daily activities, tasks, and things they need or want to do (occupation), that contribute to who they are, their sense of self, their relationship to others (identity), and their experience of health and wellbeing, was affected. Considered in the social and cultural context within which it occurs, my thesis contributes new and unique evidence regarding woman-to-woman rape and sexual assault; this has significance for relevant disciplines and service providers, including criminal justice, health, and sexual victimisation support services. Woman-to-woman rape and sexual assault is a complex form of sexual offending which has an equally complex impact upon victim/survivors; for my respondents, this has remained largely unaddressed and, for many, unresolved. I contend it is unacceptable to perceive rape and sexual assault as only committed by men against women; these are not solely gendered perpetrations and should not, therefore, be exclusively understood and addressed as gendered crimes...|$|E
40|$|The signing authors {{together}} with the journal Systematic and Applied Microbiology (SAM) have started an ambitious project that has been conceived to provide a useful tool especially for the scientific microbial taxonomist community. The aim {{of what we have}} called >The All-Species Living Tree> is to reconstruct a single 16 S rRNA tree harboring all sequenced type strains of the hitherto classified species of Archaea and Bacteria. This tree is to be regularly updated by adding the species with validly published names that appear monthly in the Validation and Notification lists of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. For this purpose, the SAM executive editors, {{together with}} the responsible teams of the ARB, SILVA, and LPSN projects (www. arb-home. de, www. arb-silva. de, and www. bacterio. cict. fr, respectively), have prepared a 16 S rRNA database containing over 6700 sequences, each of which represents a single type strain of a classified species up to 31 December 2007. The selection of sequences had to be undertaken manually due to a high error rate in the names and information fields provided for the publicly deposited entries. In addition, from among the often occurring multiple entries for a single type strain, the best-quality sequence was selected for the project. The living tree database that SAM now provides contains corrected entries and the best-quality sequences with a manually checked alignment. The tree reconstruction has been performed by using the maximum likelihood algorithm RAxML. The tree provided in the first release {{is a result of the}} calculation of a single dataset containing 9975 single entries, 6728 corresponding to type strain gene sequences, as well as 3247 additional high-fquality sequences to give robustness to the reconstruction. Trees are dynamic structures that change on the basis of the quality and availability of the data used for their calculation. Therefore, the addition of new type strain sequences in further subsequent releases may help to resolve certain branching orders that appear ambiguous in this first release. On the web sites: www. elsevier. de/syapm and www. arb-silva. de/living-tree, the All-Species Living Tree team will release a regularly updated database compatible with the ARB software environment containing the whole 16 S rRNA dataset used to reconstruct >The All-Species Living Tree>. As a result, the latest reconstructed phylogeny will be provided. In addition to the ARB file, a readable multi-FASTA universal sequence editor file with the complete alignment will be provided for those not using ARB. There is also a complete set of supplementary tables and figures illustrating the selection procedure and its outcome. It is expected that the All-Species Living Tree will help to improve future classification efforts by simplifying the selection of the correct type strain sequences. For queries, information updates, remarks on the dataset or tree reconstructions shown, a <b>contact</b> <b>email</b> <b>address</b> has been created (living-tree@arb-silva. de). This provides an entry point for anyone from the scientific community to provide additional input for the construction and improvement of the first tree compiling all sequenced type strains of all prokaryotic species for which names had been validly published. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.
