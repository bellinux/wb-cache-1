50|$|Cyclists {{are also}} {{significantly}} affected by <b>crosswinds.</b> Saving energy by avoiding riding in wind {{is a major}} part of the tactics of road bicycle racing, and this particularly applies in <b>crosswinds.</b> In <b>crosswinds,</b> groups of cyclists form 'echelons', rotating from the windward and leeward side. Riders who fail to form part of an echelon will have to work much harder, and can be dropped by the group that they are with. <b>Crosswinds</b> are common on races near the coast, and are often a feature of the Belgian classic one-day races, or flat stages of the Tour de France.|$|R
5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a <b>crosswind,</b> {{the nose of the}} plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong <b>crosswind</b> caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E
5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during <b>crosswind</b> landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5000|$|Schedule: The <b>Crosswinds</b> {{calendar}} {{is divided}} into four quarters, and each quarter is separated by a break.

Instead of a traditional summer vacation, <b>Crosswinds</b> students have part of the months of November, February, May, and August off. Students have the option to take elective classes called [...] "intersession" [...] during these break periods.|$|R

5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A <b>crosswind</b> is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E
5|$|The M40 motorway, {{which was}} nearing {{completion}} {{at the time}} of production, doubled for the fictitious M104. In the run-up to the filming of the plane's near-miss with the bridge between Junctions 4 and 5, at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass, the Ministry of Transport and the local police ordered that in accordance with Ministry of Civil Aviation regulations, the manoeuvre be performed with the wheels in contact with the tarmac at all times. During a take, a <b>crosswind</b> sprang up and the drag caused by the dummies left Hughes concerned that she would lose control of the Tiger Moth if it were to hit the ground. She therefore kept the plane in mid-air while passing under the bridge, clearing it by nine feet (2.7m) as originally planned. On another attempt, the continuing adverse conditions necessitated a second low-level glide, angering the Ministry of Transport official supervising the filming; subsequently, Hughes and production manager were arrested. Hughes, a pilot with more than three decades' flight experience by 1968, later commented that this dangerous stunt marked only {{the first time in her}} career that she had feared for her safety.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly <b>crosswind</b> on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E

It is particularly important for high cube wagons. At present, no experimental data for <b>crosswinds</b> effects on these high cube wagons are available to assess the rollover risks in Australia. Therefore, the primary objectives {{of the study were}} to determine the steady <b>crosswinds</b> effects on high cube wagons under a range of <b>crosswinds</b> conditions. In order to address these objectives, a scale model was built and tested in the RMIT Industrial Wind Tunnel. The side force and rolling moment coefficients have increased with the increase of yaw angles. The highest side force coefficient was generated in between 75 and 90 degree yaw angles...|$|R

25|$|Tailwheel {{aircraft}} {{are more difficult}} to taxi during high wind conditions, due to the higher angle of attack on the wings which can then develop more lift on one side, making control difficult or impossible.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Cheju at 21:07 for Seoul. The flight was cleared to land on runway 14R with a <b>crosswind</b> component as the wind was from 220 degrees at 22 knots. Upon touchdown, the captain misused the reverse thrusters {{in a way the}} No. 1 engine failed to provide reverse thrust. Coupled with the fact the captain was confused with <b>crosswind</b> conditions and the first officer was preoccupied and not paying attention to the landing, the 747 failed to stop {{before the end of the}} runway. The aircraft swerved to the right and slid into a ditch at 50 knots with the fuselage splitting up.|$|E

25|$|The NTSB {{conducted}} a full {{investigation of the}} accident. It found that although the aircraft had encountered a <b>crosswind</b> during landing, the conditions were well within the safe capabilities of the aircraft. However, {{it was discovered that}} the first officer did not properly line up the plane before touchdown, nor did she slow the plane adequately before touchdown, so that the plane came down excessively hard. As the plane came down, due to the <b>crosswind,</b> the right wing suddenly lowered approximately six degrees. This was beyond the design capabilities for the right main landing gear, and it snapped as a result. The NTSB also cited the captain for failing to check the work of the first officer.|$|E

25|$|Changing wind {{conditions}} are another risk factor. In conditions of strong winds, and turbulence during hot days the parachutist can {{be caught in}} downdrafts close to the ground.
