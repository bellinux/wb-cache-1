5|$|Homer and Marge wake on New Year's Day with hangovers {{after the}} family's New Year's Eve celebration. As Homer {{takes out the}} garbage, Chief Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou arrive and issue him {{multiple}} citations and fines - the result of recently passed, frivolous laws intended to bring in revenue for the city when broken. Taking Moe's suggestion that he bribe a city official to clear up the fines, Homer leaves a sack full of <b>cash</b> <b>on</b> the official's desk but is promptly arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate Fat Tony, who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.|$|E

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen a stream of {{innovation}} in financial markets, especially in corporate bonds. Some of these innovations-notably, hybrid debt-have provided firms with more flexibility in designing <b>cash</b> flows <b>on</b> borrowings, allowing them to match <b>cash</b> flows <b>on</b> financing more closely to <b>cash</b> flows <b>on</b> assets. In so doing, {{the use of such}} innovative securities has increased corporate debt capacity and hence firm value. 1999 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
5|$|Individual {{contributions}} made up {{the most}} of the campaign cash that Tancredo received, making up about 97% of his total pocketbook. PAC contributions were comparably low, producing only around $75,500, of the $1,311,869. He granted himself $200 for the campaign and received no federal funding. $88,457 of his money came from interest from the campaign's bank accounts and loans from outside sources. It {{should be noted that the}} majority of Tancredo's funds were not disclosed during the campaign As of September 30, 2007 the campaign raised $3,538,244 and spent $3,458,130, leaving only $110,079 <b>cash</b> <b>on</b> hand.|$|E
5|$|Later in June, Fox News did {{a report}} on the {{families}} of the candidates running for President. Jim Gilmore's family was described as being busy with school and employment, limiting them from full-time campaigning. Two of the candidate's sons, Ashton and Jay were examined for the report. Ashton Gilmore worked full-time for his father's campaign headquarters, and Jay Gilmore worked in Washington and was only able to campaign as his schedule allowed. In election polling, unpromising results surfaced for the Gilmore campaign. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Gilmore failed to register half a percentage point among Republican voters. A grimmer portrait was painted for the campaign when end of the month finances revealed it was nearly broke with only $61,765 <b>cash</b> <b>on</b> hand from the $391,693 that had been raised overall.|$|E

He also starred with Cushing in Hammer's <b>Cash</b> <b>on</b> Demand, playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, The Gold Inside. He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He {{did not wish to}} repeat himself.|$|E

Three days later, he was charged under his real name {{for the murder of}} Gerard Lowe in a River View Hotel room some time between 8 March and 9. In subsequent hearings, he was additionally charged with forgery (forging Lowe's signature five more times to obtain cash and goods worth $3,200), vandalism (smashing the glass panel), possession of an offensive weapon (the electroshock weapon), and possession of a controlled drug (he had 24 sticks of cannabis {{at the time of his}} arrest).|$|E
5|$|On October 29, {{responding}} to growing concerns that Enron might have insufficient <b>cash</b> <b>on</b> hand, news spread that Enron was seeking a further $1–2 billion in financing from banks. The next day, as feared, Moody's lowered Enron's credit rating from Baa1 to Baa2, two levels above junk status. Standard & Poor's affirmed Enron's rating of BBB+, {{the equivalent of}} Moody's Baa1. Moody's also warned that it would downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, the consequence of which would likely prevent the company from finding the further financing it sought to keep solvent.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. <b>cash</b> <b>on</b> November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as Thompson was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E

5|$|The {{team won}} a prize for each {{obstacle}} completed, escalating in value up {{to a grand}} prize for completing the entire course. Two-person teams split the cash earnings, and both contestants received the same prize for each obstacle. Prizes included televisions, concert tickets, encyclopedias, gift certificates, non-motorized modes of transportation and, on the Fox Family Double Dare, <b>cash.</b> <b>On</b> the original and Super Sloppy versions, the grand prize was usually a vacation or an experience at Space Camp. All eight prizes were usually worth a total of between $3,000 and $4,000, with some episodes featuring a prize package nearing $10,000. On the Fox Family Double Dare, {{as well as the}} first season of the Nickelodeon run, the grand prize was a vehicle, making all eight prizes worth between $15,000 and $25,000. The grand prize was once again a vacation for the second season of Nickelodeon's Family Double Dare.|$|E

They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of <b>cash.</b> <b>On</b> being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares to blow it up, taking the money with him.|$|E
