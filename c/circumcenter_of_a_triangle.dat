40|$|A {{hundred years}} ago, if you'd asked people why Leonhard Euler was famous, {{those who had}} an answer would very likely have {{mentioned}} his discovery of the Euler line, the remarkable property that the orthocenter, {{the center of gravity}} and the <b>circumcenter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>triangle</b> are collinear. But times change, and so do fashions and the standards by which we interpret history. At {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, triangle geometry was regarded as one of the crowning achievements of mathematics, and the Euler line was one of its finest jewels. Mathematicians who neglected triangle geometry to study exotic new fields like logic, abstract algebra or topology were taking brave risks to their professional careers. Now it would be the aspiring triangle geometer taking the risks. Still, the late H. S. M. Coxeter made a long and distinguished career without straying far from the world of triangles, and he introduced hundreds of others to their delightful properties, especially the Euler line. This month, we look at how Euler discovered the Euler line and what he was trying to do when he discovered it. We will find that the discovery was rather incidental to the problem he was trying to solve, and that the problem itself was otherwise rather unimportant. This brings us to the 325 th paper in Gustav Eneström's index of Euler's published work, "Soluti...|$|E

Given that the data and the final results of the geometric constructions are stored using single precision floating point representation (typically fixed size integers), the proposed algorithms first perform the geometric construction in IEEE double precision floating point arithmetic, the rounding error is estimated, and only if the error estimation indicates that the result of the floating point computation may be wrong, the computation is repeated with exact arithmetic. The basic advantage is that exact computations are in most cases avoided, thus reducing both the storage and the required computation time...|$|R
