Digitalization is likely to pose new challenges to requirements engineering. Chances are that digitalization will change the competences that are necessary for successful requirements engineering. This paper proposes a research design that will be used for clarifying which <b>competences</b> <b>requirements</b> engineers need nowadays and how these competences change due to digitalization. To that end, qualitative and quantitative research methods will be combined for developing a comprehensive <b>competence</b> profile for <b>requirements</b> engineering on a scientific basis. The resulting competence profile constitutes a starting point for devising competence-oriented learning settings. Thus, our research contributes {{to a better understanding of}} <b>competences</b> for <b>requirements</b> engineering and improves education of future requirements engineers, in particular for coping with challenges posed by digitalization...|$|R

In addition, this study explored whether the forensic accountant possesses higher levels of SR, KR and FRA requirements than the auditor in an evolving area of fraud prevention, detection and response. The study embraced positivist paradigm, adopted cross-sectional design and a survey method. Of the 400 questionnaires distributed, 363 questionnaires were returned and out of which 316 questionnaires were retained for further analysis. The variables are ope rationalized {{with a total of}} 29 observable items, which included demography information. The study results confirmed the significant positive relationship between skill and knowledge on FRA. Furthermore, the findings showed that the forensic accountant has significantly higher levels of knowledge, skill and FRA than auditor regarding issues of fraud prevention, detection and response. The implication of this study might result in the overall reduction of corruption and fraud in the public sector, enhancement of institutional, regulatory, ethical and legal framework, and create awareness amongst the accounting and auditing systems management in Nigeria especially and similar developing nations in general. The results add value to the theory, method and practice on fraud prevention, detection, and response by introducing the empirical examination of KR, SR, and FRA in a workplace...|$|R

40|$|Purpose– The “multi‐criteria selection” {{has become}} popular {{practice}} in selecting contractors, especially for public works, which involve multiple stakeholders. In line with this development, contractors {{need to consider}} more factors apart from offering a lower bidding price in formulating a bidding strategy. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce a quantitative method, namely the fuzzy <b>competence</b> <b>requirement</b> (FCR) model, for assisting a contractor to formulate a better bidding strategy by better utilising its competence for meeting the best multiple criteria imposed by clients. Design/methodology/approach– The fuzzy linear programming with multiple objectives technique is applied in this paper and an illustrative example is introduced to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. Findings– The FCR model can assist in generating a range of bidding strategies by assuming different confidence levels that contractors may perceive. These strategies could be valuable references for contractors to develop their competitive bidding strategy, which enables contractors to efficiently utilise their competence to meet clients' multiple selection criteria. Research limitations/implications– The FCR model can provide contractors with useful information for formulating their bidding strategy. However, other factors, such as the sense of the market and estimation of rivals' bidding strategy, should also be considered in the bidding decision. Practical implications– The FCR model can help contractors make better decisions in bidding by considering their competence and meeting client's multiple criteria. Originality/value– This paper introduces a new model – FCR model – for helping contractors improve the efficiency of their bidding decision. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor {{engineers}} {{to be effective}} leading global players in the workforce arena, engineers need to master a myriad of interdisciplinary and interpersonal competencies like teamwork, critical thinking, decision making and communication skills. The challenge faced by prospective graduates is to rise and {{meet the challenges of}} such industry practitioners. The question we ask ourselves is, “Can graduates of today rise to meet the competency requirement of tomorrow's workforce?” Many ponder if existing language and communication courses in the existing engineering curriculum meet the employer competency requirement. One such particular competency requirement is that of communicative competence in the business of oral communicative events, i. e. technical oral presentations. Technical oral presentations represent one of the many oral communicative events expected of engineers at the workplace. This study explores two sub-sets of communicative competence, i. e. rhetorical style competence, and interpersonal and interactive <b>competence</b> <b>requirement</b> as perceived by selected participants of the academic and professional engineering community. Members of the academia include students and lecturers while professional engineers form the remaining focal group from the industry. Underpinning theoretical implication of the learning theory amplify that perceptions held by communities of practice mirror legitimate peripheral participation of a said community. This study attempts to discuss the perceptions held by the focal groups on the apparent academia-industry practitioner discord on communicative competence in technical oral presentations. The study also intends to explore graduates’ communicative competence preparedness for tomorrows’ workplace and its pedagogical implication in order to walk the talk of engineers of the 21 st century...|$|R
