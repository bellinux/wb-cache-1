Charpy testing is conducting with U- or V-notches whereby the striker contacts the specimen directly behind the notch, whereas the now largely obsolete Izod method involves a circular notch facing the striker.

This work characterizes the impact resistance and fracture toughness of several fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites.

Recently, instrumented <b>Charpy</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> method is widely used {{for the evaluation of}} toughness of various specimens of different materials with different sizes. It is important to record an accurate impact load in order to improve the reliability of this test method. In some standards of instrumented <b>Charpy</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> method such as ISO and ASTM, they havent clearly standardized striker geometry which seem to directly influence the obtained impact load. There are some differences between standards, although standard procedures are well defined. Therefore, instrumented <b>Charpy</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> method has a problem that measurement value is different depending on each standard. In the present study, the effect of striking edge geometries, which are difference between ISO and ASTM, on load-deflection curve and absorbed energy were investigated. According to ISO and ASTM, two types of striker having different radius were machined. There was no difference between the two different striking edge geometries for values of absorbed energy per unit ligament area less than 0. 75 J/mm 2. However, striking edge geometry according to ASTM is not propriety for <b>Charpy</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> method because of four, instead of three, point bending on process of fracture at high level of absorbed energy. The effect of brinelling deformation, which was considered as an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM, is very small on instrumented <b>Charpy</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test.</b> Consequently, there seem to be not an advantage of striking edge geometry according to ASTM.
