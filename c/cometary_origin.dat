Nearly all deuterium found in nature was produced in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, as the basic or primordial ratio of hydrogen-1 to deuterium (about 26 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogen atoms) has its origin from that time. This is the ratio found in the gas giant planets, such as Jupiter (see references 2,3 and 4). However, other astronomical bodies are found to have different ratios of deuterium to hydrogen-1. This {{is thought to be}} a result of natural isotope separation processes that occur from solar heating of ices in comets. Like the water cycle in Earth's weather, such heating processes may enrich deuterium with respect to protium. The analysis of deuterium/protium ratios in comets found results very similar to the mean ratio in Earth's oceans (156 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogens). This reinforces theories that much of Earth's ocean water is of <b>cometary</b> <b>origin.</b> [...] The deuterium/protium ratio of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as measured by the Rosetta space probe, is about three times that of earth water.

Another strong indication of <b>cometary</b> <b>origin</b> is the fact that some damocloids have retrograde orbits, unlike any other minor planets.

In the processing of individual 5 microns IDP's and determination of entry velocities, a few dozen microtome slices {{that can be used for}} a variety of detailed TEM, IR, and ion probe studies were preserved.

40|$|Samples of ablated {{materials}} are analyzed to determine properties {{expected to be}} characteristic of particulates generated by the ablation of primitive meteoric bodies. Analyses of carbonaceous-chondrite fusion crusts and samples artificially ablated in the laboratory indicate that most meteor-ablation debris should consist of assemblages of silicate minerals, principally olivine, and micron-sized magnetic grains. It is expected that ablation debris of at least 10 microns should have abundances of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ni {{similar to those found}} in chondritic meteorites. Volatile species such as S, H 2 O, and Cl are lost during ablation and normally should not be found in ablated material. The major findings of this study are supported by analysis of spherules collected in the atmosphere which are thought, on separate grounds, to be genuine meteor-ablation products. The majority of meteoric bodies probably have <b>cometary</b> <b>origins,</b> and it is hoped that the ability to collect and identify meteor-ablation debris reliably will provide an opportunity to do laboratory analysis of cometary matter. ...|$|R

The occultations took place between 2 - 7 deg S latitude and yielded atmospheric temperature profiles between pressure levels of 10 - 900 mbar, an altitude range of 100 km. The mole fractions of hydrogen and helium in the tropopause were estimated, in conjunction with IR data, to about 0. 85 and 0. 10 - 0. 20, respectively.

40|$|Anhydrous chondritic porous inter-planetary dust {{particles}} (CP IDPs) contain {{an assortment of}} highly primitive solar system components, molecular cloud matter, and presolar grains. These IDPs have largely escaped parent body processing that has affected meteorites, advocating <b>cometary</b> <b>origins.</b> Though the stardust abundance in CP IDPs is generally greater than in primitive meteorites, it can vary widely among individual CP IDPs. The average abundance of silicate stardust among isotopically primitive IDPs is approx. 375 ppm while some have extreme abundances up to approx. 1. 5 %. H and N isotopic anomalies are common in CP IDPs and the carrier of these anomalies has been traced to organic matter that has experienced chemical reactions in cold molecular clouds or the outer protosolar disk. Significant variations in these anomalies may reflect different degrees of nebular processing. Refractory inclusions are commonly observed in carbonaceous chondrites. These inclusions are among the first solar system condensates and display 16 O-rich isotopic compositions. Refractory grains have also been observed in the comet 81 P/Wild- 2 samples re-turned from the Stardust Mission and in CP IDPs, but they occur with much less frequency.

A motivation for the investigation was to see if the procedure would help distinguish between IDPs of asteroidal and <b>cometary</b> <b>origin.</b> The use of a sequence of short-duration heat pulses to perform the extractions is an improvement over the employment of a step-heating sequence, as was used in a previous investigation. The particles studied were fragments of larger parent IDPs, other fragments of which, in coordinated experiments, are undergoing studies of elemental and mineralogical composition in other laboratories. While the present investigation will provide useful temperature history data for the particles, the relatively large size of the parent IDPs (approximately 40 micrometers in diameter) resulted in high entry deceleration temperatures.

40|$|Chondritic-porous interplanetary dust {{particles}} (CP IDPs) exhibit strongly heterogeneous and unequilibrated mineralogy at sub-micron scales, are enriched in carbon, nitrogen and volatile trace elements, and contain abundant presolar materials [1 - 4]. These observations suggest that CP IDPs have largely escaped the thermal processing and water-rock interactions that have severely modified or destroyed the original mineralogy of primitive meteorites. CP IDPs {{are believed to}} represent direct samples of {{the building blocks of}} the Solar System - a complex mixture of nebular and presolar materials largely unperturbed by secondary processing. The chemical and isotopic properties of CP IDPs and their atmospheric entry velocities are also consistent with <b>cometary</b> <b>origins.</b> GEMS (glass with embedded metal and sulfides) grains are a major silicate component of CP IDPs. GEMS grains are < 0. 5 microns in diameter objects that consist of numerous 10 to 50 nm-sized Fe-Ni metal and Fe-Ni sulfide grains dispersed in a Mg-Si-Al-Fe amorphous silicate matrix [2, 5]. Based on their chemistry and isotopic compositions, most GEMS appear to be non-equilibrium condensates from the early solar nebula [2]. If GEMS grains are a common nebular product, then they should also be abundant in the matrices of the most physically primitive chondritic meteorites. Although amorphous silicates are common in the most primitive meteorites [6 - 9], their relationship to GEMS grains {{and the extent to which}} their compositions and microstructure have been affected by parent body processing (oxidation and aqueous alteration) is poorly constrained.

Refractory inclusions and chondrules in meteorites, however, have oxygen isotopic compositions that are suggestive of a mixing between isotopically separated reservoirs. Understanding the processes that produced 16 O-rich and 17, 18 O-rich reservoirs has been a major objective of cosmochemical research for several decades. One complication of investigations into the nature of oxygen isotope heterogeneity has been the alteration of chondritic components on asteroidal parent bodies, which modify the original isotopic signatures of primordial dust. Comets accreted in distal cold regions of the solar nebula, and dust from comets probably experienced minimal parent body processing relative to asteroidal samples. Much of the dust collected in the stratosphere likely has <b>cometary</b> <b>origins,</b> but until the return of samples from NASA’s Stardust spacecraft, definitive links to comets had not been established. Stardust successfully returned particles from a known comet 81 P/Wild 2, but the silica aerogel collectors severely altered the oxygen isotope compositions of the fine-grained dust component. Impacts of Wild 2 dust into aluminum foils produced craters that retained material as a melt residue, providing an opportunity to measure the oxygen isotopic composition of coarse and fine-grained components of comet dust. This dissertation describes oxygen isotope measurements of Wild 2 impact crater residues via Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS). Hypervelocity experiments that simulated the collection conditions of Wild 2 dust were preformed using minerals of known oxygen isotope composition; the resulting craters were used to develop analytical techniques, to assess modification to the oxygen isotope composition due to hypervelocity capture, and as standards for oxygen isotope measurements of Wild 2 craters. This dissertation also describes the oxygen isotope measurements of interplanetary dust particles with hydrated mineralogy, in an attempt to observe 17, 18 O-enriched water that is predicted to be a consequence of some proposed mechanisms for producing observed oxygen isotope heterogeneity. Relationships between interplanetary dust particles, comet dust, and carbonaceous chondrites are examined, and implications for models of comet formation and oxygen isotope heterogeneity are discussed...|$|R
