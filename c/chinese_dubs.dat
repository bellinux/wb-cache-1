5000|$|Commander ApeTrully (voiced by Ian James Corlett) - Commander ApeTrully is the eccentric, well-meaning {{leader of}} Big Green. Commander ApeTrully formed Big Green {{in hopes of}} {{restoring}} friendship between animals and humans. In most episodes, Commander ApeTrully would end up captured by the animals he visits when trying {{to make peace with}} them with piles of gold. When in danger, he activates the device on his head to call for First Squad. In [...] "Parrot Castle", he is revealed to be the king of the Monkeys (Monkey King) in disguise as {{he was the first to}} see through HighRoller's lies, but keeps it a secret to preserve Big Green's morale (in his words, he does not want humans to know it was a monkey who led them). In [...] "Shark Castle" [...] and [...] "Crab Castle", he would accompany First Squad to the underwater castles when riding in Sammo the Whale in order to make peace with the aquatic animals that way. His name is a joke referring to the fact that he's an ape, truly. In the <b>Chinese</b> <b>dub,</b> he was named Song Chang and there was no explanation saying he was a monkey. Classified on the official website as Hero 001. The only thing he can do is use his monkey skills and use almost an endless supply of gold seen on every episode. In [...] "The Rise of Lin Chung", it is shown that Commander ApeTrully owns a diamond that is larger than his body.|$|R
5000|$|Yaksha - Due to a spell cast on Mystique Sonia, {{anyone who}} {{declares}} {{their love for}} her three times turns into a Yaksha. Yaksha is a purple and pink creature which rests upon Mystique Sonia's head like a hat. It is also an extremely flexible and stretchable being shown to turn into various forms to aid Mystique Sonia like an accessory, a dress, and a trampoline. It can even extend its arms to propel Mystique Sonia forward. By putting Yaksha's eyes over her own eyes, Mystique Sonia can see heat and the body heat given of by animals. Curiously, this ability works on chameleons {{despite the fact that}} they do not give off heat. Yaksha can also put his arms out like plane wings and if Mystique Sonia does her tongue attack from a short radius as if her tongue were a planes propeller, Mystique Sonia can fly. When Mystique Sonia gets mad at Yaksha for his jealousy as seen in [...] "Scorpion Castle" [...] and [...] "Sheep Castle", he will usually rest on Mighty Ray's head. When Mystique Sonia is not mad at Yaksha, he usually gives her a rose. It is unknown who was the first to fall for Sonia, but in [...] "Liger Castle", he was killed in action as a Yaksha. It was soon replaced by a new Yaksha who was once a Tank Army member and a devoted member of Mystique Sonia's fan club. In [...] "Scorpion Castle", when Yaksha ate 100 buns he transformed into a robot-like Yaksha with Lin Chung for the head, Sonia and Jumpy for the hands, and Mighty Ray and Mr. No Hands for the legs. In the <b>Chinese</b> <b>dub,</b> references of Yaksha and Mystique Sonia's relationship were never mentioned and his voice is completely different from the North American dub.|$|R
5000|$|...Our first {{video was}} about love between two girls," [...] Katina says. [...] "We do not {{pretend to be}} lesbians -- we've never said we were. Julia {{just had a baby}} and {{currently}} has a girlfriend, and we've both always had boyfriends. We share a special bond." [...] —t.A.T.u member Lena Katina, interviewed by Billboard. The song has appeared in multiple television events. It was WWE professional wrestler Victoria's theme song from December 15, 2002 (at WWE's Armageddon pay-per-view, where she debuted it) to May 2004 with the song starting from [...] "Yes I lost my mind". Also, the song was played during the final scenes of the Birds of Prey series on the WB network, in the 2003 episode [...] "Devil's Eyes". This theme was also featured as the opening song of the Chinese drama, Legend of the Heavenly Stones, as a <b>Chinese</b> language <b>dub.</b>|$|R
5000|$|HighRoller (voiced by Brian Drummond) - A former trainee under Chiung Ming, he {{was once}} a court jester who ended up banished from the Eastern Capital for {{insulting}} its emperor and wandered into the Hidden Lands. Upon getting struck by lightning, he gained {{the ability to communicate}} with animals and tricked them into thinking humans were their enemies. As the new Emperor of the East Citadel, HighRoller gets to do whatever he wants, and what he typically wants to do is attack humans (or get animals to attack humans for him), eat candy, read comic books, and play games. A flashback in [...] "Folk Game Competition II" [...] revealed that he was a classmate of Woo the Wise. HighRoller is also the master of the Folk Game Competition and these skills actually translate to the battlefield in dangerously unexpected ways. For the first Folk Game Competition he held, HighRoller held it to distract everyone from the traffic. He later held the second Folk Game Competition as a diversion for the Zebra Brothers to eliminate all the books, since he hated studying as a child. He once beat Jumpy Ghostface in the first Folk Game Competition (by cheating), but the second one against Lin Chung ended in a draw when HighRoller discovered that the Zebra Brothers also took his comic books. Combining this {{with the fact that he}} likes to play dirty makes HighRoller a formidable opponent for even the most skilled members of First Squad, as even Lin Chung can have a hard time trying to stop him one time when HighRoller combined with Bearstomp to form the High-Stomp formation as seen in [...] "Firework Festival at East Citadel" [...] and [...] "Strongest Punch & Kick". In Season 2, he is the servant of his master Twin Masters as seen in [...] "The Rise of Lin Chung". In the <b>Chinese</b> <b>dub,</b> HighRoller was Kao Chao and his origin was different as in the Chinese version, he was the true emperor until a magic arrow shot his head stealing his ability to speak English but gaining the ability to speak animal language instead. In the Romanian dub, he was renamed Sportiflex.|$|R
50|$|Digimon Xros Wars {{was first}} {{publicly}} {{revealed in the}} June 2010 issue of Shueisha's V Jump magazine, including {{the name of the}} series and brief descriptions of the series and several main characters. The series was the first to be broadcast in widescreen 16:9 and in HD 1080i and aired on TV Asahi between July 6, 2010, and March 25, 2012. Crunchyroll began streaming the series outside Japan for the original Japanese version with English subtitles in November 2011. Disney XD in Malaysia aired a William Winckler-produced English version along with original <b>Chinese</b> and Malay <b>dubs</b> based on the original Japanese version from December 8, 2012, titled Digimon Fusion Battles.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, 45 Squadron {{served in}} the Malayan Emergency, flying out of RAF Station Tengah {{on the island of}} Singapore. There the unit engaged in ground attack {{operations}} against Communist Terrorists (CTs) engaged in a <b>Chinese</b> backed insurgency. <b>Dubbed</b> Operation Firedog, these operations lasted for 12 years until the successful conclusion of the war. The unit also engaged in operations to quell unrest on the Sarawak coast in British North Borneo during this time period. While operating in Malaya the unit initially flew Bristol Beaufighters but then transitioned to the Bristol Brigand (1949/1950) and then the de Havilland Hornet, de Havilland Venom, de Havilland Vampire and English Electric Canberra. The unit also had service aircraft, including the Bristol Buckmaster and the Harvard. Unit commanders during this time included Sqdn. Ldr. E. D. Crew who served from a date uncertain until the rotation to Squadron Leader A. C. Blythe in February 1950, among others.|$|R
5000|$|Lin Chung (voiced by Andrew Francis) - Classified as Hero 006, Lin Chung {{is known}} {{by some as}} the most accomplished, most skilled warrior in all of Big Green. He {{possesses}} the legendary Panther Vision, which allows him to see great distances, or {{to see the world}} in slow motion while he moves with speed. He wields a staff that can shoot edible bamboo shoots out at enemies. Lin Chung's also has his [...] "Master Stroke" [...] in his arsenal which is devastating to all enemies. This move involves a great leap into the air while spinning his staff. He catches the staff, which propels his full body into a spin, projecting him at his opponent with massive force which was proven in [...] "Rabbit Castle". He has a hobby of drawing and sometimes dropping out of battles just to draw when he finds an inspiration like in the episode [...] "Elephant Castle". In reality, his drawings are awful, but his friends do not tell him that so he will not go into a state of depression up until Woo the Wise made a comment about art not being better than science in [...] "Pitched Battle of the Air Force". His drawing skills got better as the series progressed. He is also an honorable member of the Air Force as he was the only member of First Squad to pass each of the tests required to assist the Air Force. If his First Squad team members cannot find him, they know to look for Lin Chung in the bamboo forest where he mediates, calmly waiting standing on his staff for more bamboo shoots to grow because he is using them for ammunition. Unfortunately, he is often distracted from battle by an intriguing image that he feels he must paint. A gag in [...] "Shark Castle" [...] is that Lin Chung can create great art, but only unintentionally (like being distracted or by accident) which would get him frustrated. In the <b>Chinese</b> <b>dub,</b> he was unofficially credited as PantherEye in the Chinese CGI promos (possibly from the Panther Vision) and there was no explanation of him being an artist. He, ApeTrully and HighRoller are the only characters that had names which were changed. It is later revealed that Lin Chung was trained by Tien Kwan during the events of [...] "The Rise of Lin Chung", gaining the ability to convert chaos energy into harmonious energy while named new leader of First Squad. The Harmonic energy has shown to make Lin Chung seemingly omnipotent, as he was shown to fly, breathe underwater, create air bubbles, generate force fields, use chlorokinesis (control over plants), shoot energy blasts from his body and undo the effects of chaotic energy, all through the power of his harmonic energy. In [...] "The Yeti & Phoenix", it is revealed that every member of Big Green has harmonic energy, but Lin Chung is the only member who can channel and use it. In [...] "Animals Inside", it is revealed that Lin Chung holds the Panther Spirit when he, Mighty Ray, and Mystique Sonia enter the Spirit Cave and are transformed into their inner animals. In this form, he passes himself off as the Panther King in a plot to rescue Commander ApeTrully from HighRoller.|$|R
5000|$|Mighty Ray (voiced by Ian James Corlett) - Classified as 025, Mighty Ray is {{a warrior}} of First Squad. Mighty Ray {{was once a}} member of Mr. No Hands' giant foosball team. They were playing a match, but it was {{postponed}} as HighRoller, the Zebra Brothers, Bear Stomp {{and some of the}} toughest animal kings attacked the stadium. Mighty Ray defeated the animal kings, but the Zebra Brothers used their ghost lanterns to turn Mighty Ray's eyes to stone. Mr. No Hands took Mighty Ray to a temple where Commander ApeTrully took Mighty Ray to see a giant stone skeleton monkey, who traded his own eyes for Mighty Ray's eyes. He has the power to shoot electrical bolts of energy from his eyeballs. To recharge his eyeballs, Mighty Ray must eat more bananas which he dislikes. The reason Mighty Ray dislikes bananas is because when he first tried out his magical electrical eyeballs, he figured that the more bananas Mighty Ray eats at once, the more powerful his eyes get. But when Mighty Ray tried to defeat HighRoller (for payback on turning his original eyes to stone), Mighty Ray ate too many bananas, which overloaded his eyeballs causing bolts of electricity to fire every where. ApeTrully said Mighty Ray was lucky he didn't go blind. He can also form a giant eyeball and emit sonic waves to confuse his enemy as seen in [...] "Rabbit Castle". His eyeballs are also removable. He is able to change the properties of the lightning by pressing on his left eye which allows him to shoot at single targets or at a whole group. Even though his energy bolts are his main attack, he is quite formidable at close range with his bare hands. He is intensely jealous of Lin Chung being praised as the finest warrior in First Squad and jumps at chances to best him. Mighty Ray also goes by the name of Mr. Comedy when performing all sorts of comedy. Mighty Ray is definitely the burly force of First Squad. More of a doer than a thinker, Mighty Ray takes great pride in being the right guy for any job even if he's actually not. However, his overzealous and sometimes inept nature can occasionally win the day. Mighty Ray enjoys loud burps, farts and bad comedy all of which are usually his own. His eyeballs can also be used as lanterns or thrown like grenades. Sometimes they pop out of his head and slide away, making them very difficult to find. Mighty Ray's signature yell is [...] "I am Mighty Ray! Fear my eyeballs!" [...] Mystique Sonia is the only member of First Squad who knows Mighty Ray is afraid of the dark as seen in [...] "Crocodile Castle". One of the symbols on his eye seems to be [...] "電" [...] or [...] "Diàn", meaning [...] "electricity". In the <b>Chinese</b> <b>dub,</b> he touches his eyeballs to charge them up to shoot instead of eating bananas. In [...] "Animals Inside", it is revealed that Mighty Ray holds the Boar Spirit when he, Lin Chung, and Mystique Sonia enter the Spirit Cave and are transformed into their inner animals. In this form, he passes himself off as the Boar King in a plot to rescue Commander ApeTrully from High Roller. Mighty Ray's boar form involves him eating bananas in order to shoot electric bolts from his tusks.|$|R
