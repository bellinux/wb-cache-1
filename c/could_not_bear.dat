5|$|Armin {{was once}} a troubled young man from Capital City, and finds himself in the Army. There, he met and befriended the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner, who became his mentor and helped him find meaning in his troubled life. Seymour told Armin that his dream was to become an {{elementary}} school principal after the war. Later, Seymour was declared missing and presumed dead. Armin took {{the news of the}} apparent death to Seymour's mother, Agnes. Upon meeting him, however, Agnes mistook him for her son, and Armin <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> to deliver the message. He instead allowed Agnes to call him Seymour, and took over Seymour's life. Meanwhile, the real Seymour Skinner spent five years in a POW camp, then worked in a Chinese sweatshop for two decades until it was shut down by the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce was {{generous with}} {{his time and}} money, believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a {{significant}} portion of their income to the needy. Yearly, he gave away thousands of pounds, much of it to clergymen to distribute in their parishes. He paid off the debts of others, supported education and missions, and in a year of food shortages, gave to charity more than his own yearly income. He was exceptionally hospitable, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> to sack any of his servants. As a result, his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity. Although he was often months behind in his correspondence, Wilberforce responded to numerous requests for advice or for help in obtaining professorships, military promotions and livings for clergymen, or for the reprieve of death sentences.|$|E

5|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of Rama bhakti movement in the 12th century, numerous works adopted the concept of Maya Sita. Devotees <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> that Sita – the consort of Rama and the chief goddess of Rama-centric sects – was kidnapped by the demon Ravana and had to suffer his imprisonment and was defiled by his touch. The Maya Sita concept saves Sita from suffering Ravana's custody and succumbing to the temptation of acquiring the illusory deer. Instead, the texts create an illusory Sita, who does not recognize the illusory deer. The illusory deer motif in the Ramayana may have inspired the Maya Sita concept too. Maya Sita also excuses Sita from rebuking Lakshmana when she forces him to leave her and aid Rama in the illusory deer tale.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to succeed as chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining of the marsh and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year is illustrated in the statement by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> the weight of a cow, and local men of the time remembered when horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E
5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies {{before they can be}} retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that survivors are being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight members of the team have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> to put her in danger once more. They discuss giving up their Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They both know that Daren must transfer off the Enterprise. They kiss once more, and Daren makes Picard promise not to give up music.|$|E

5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

25|$|Presbyterians, {{who were}} {{concentrated}} in the northern province of Ulster and mostly descended from Scottish settlers, also suffered from the Penal Laws. They could sit in Parliament but not hold office. Both Catholics and Presbyterians were also barred from certain professions (such as law, the judiciary and the army) and had restrictions on inheriting land. Catholics <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> arms or exercise their religion publicly.|$|E
25|$|The Rig Veda {{mentions}} {{that during the}} Vedic period, a man could {{have more than one}} wife. The practice is attested in epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Dharmashastras permit a man to marry women of lower castes provided that the first wife was of equal caste. Despite its existence, it was most usually practiced by men of higher castes and higher status. Common people were only allowed a second marriage if the first wife <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> a son.|$|E

The minister-general replied that the only way for Lagun Ein to escape the execution was for him to assassinate Minkhaung. Lagun Ein reluctantly accepted the offer. Byat Za still needed to convince the king, who grudgingly agreed.|$|E

25|$|Chapman {{took over}} the editorship of the New Zealand Law Reports after Fitzgerald's death. Chapman was a Wellington City Councillor (1888–1890) {{and a member of}} the council of the Wellington Law Society. He had an {{aptitude}} for languages and as a young man, he became proficient in French and German. He later learned Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, and Dutch when he was at old age. He once gave as his reason for taking up Spanish because he planned to go on a trip to that country, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> the thought of not being able to read the local newspapers.|$|E
25|$|Rodezno’s term as {{the leader}} {{emphasized}} politics and propaganda rather than organization and militancy; some scholars claim that obsolete structures of Communión, favoring “placentera y anárquica autonomia”, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> the weight of dynamically growing movement. This, combined with internal protest against pro-Alfonsist advances and his “tactica transaccionista y el gradualismo”, brought about a major challenge. When former Integrists suggested that Manuel Fal becomes president of the Junta, Rodezno proposed he rather becomes personal secretary to the claimant. As Don Alfonso Carlos at that time decided to abandon plans of dynastic reconciliation, in April 1934 Rodezno agreed to step down from leadership.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for the Germans, {{during their}} retreat earlier that autumn they had {{destroyed}} the Losheim-Losheimergraben road {{bridge over the}} railway. German engineers were slow to repair the bridge {{on the morning of}} 16 December, preventing German vehicles from using this route. A railroad overpass they had selected as an alternative route <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> the weight of the German armor. Peiper instead directed his lead tank to cross the railroad and climb the embankment, but as soon as it reached the top on the far side, Peiper received new orders directing him west along the road through Lanzerath to Bucholz Station. He pulled back and headed for Lanzerath instead.|$|E
25|$|Until his death, Borel {{attended}} the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, {{where he studied}} electromechanics and did quite well academically. He {{was said to be}} a disciplined and quiet student. However, in his last year at school there was a radical change in behavior. He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bear</b> it anymore at home, that he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also told one of his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing two or three people.|$|E

The animal was being beaten by a man with a hickory stick. She implored him to stop. Wheatley gave him a half dollar and begged him to restrain his temper. When she left the mule's handler was coaxing him in a soothing manner, which pleased Wheatley. Previously she had intervened to prevent small children from rocking a dog and stopped a cab driver from abusing an old horse.|$|E
