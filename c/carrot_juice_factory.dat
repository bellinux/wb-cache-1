40|$|Carrots are a cold-weather crop {{well suited}} for {{cultivation}} {{in the south of}} Sweden. Carrots are generally rather inexpensive, with a market price below € 1 /kg (Sweden, 2003), whereas fresh <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> has a price of around € 5 /kg. The fresh <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> produced today has a short shelf-life of approximately three days, which makes centralised industrial production and distribution difficult, and there is also a high degree of spoilage in the retail outlet. It is therefore of interest to produce a <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> with a sustainable high quality and thus a longer shelf-life. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of different unit operations on the quality and shelf-life of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice.</b> High-quality <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> was defined as a cloud-stable juice with fresh taste, appealing intense colour, high carotene content and a healthy dietary fibre balance. The effects on the pomace were also considered in order to gain knowledge on by-product applications of the waste material and thus decrease the environmental load. Three different two-stage expression lines were investigated. It was concluded that the composition of the juice and pomace, as well as the physical properties of the pomace, were affected by both juice yield and the type of equipment used. The primary juice expressed was found to have higher quality than secondary juice in terms of higher values for colour, optical density, carotene and dietary fibre content. During juice expression the density of the press-cake seemed to influence primarily the amount of carotene expressed, but also that of dietary fibre. The water-holding capacity of the pomace decreased after hard pressing, although the total amount of dietary fibre per gram dry matter increased. Cloud formation was investigated and a combined effect of temperature and acidification was found. Cloud formation occurred at lower temperatures for lower pH. <b>Carrot</b> <b>juice</b> has a pH of 6. 3, and at a pH of 4. 4 cloud formation was found to occur immediately at room temperature. The shelf-life of fresh <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> is primarily determined by microbial growth in the juice. The method of isothermal calorimetry in determining the microbial status of the juice was compared with total colony forming units found by plate counts. The results showed that isothermal calorimetry could be used to determine the shelf-life of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice.</b> When stored at 17 °C the shelf-life was less than 20 % of that under refrigerated storage at 8 °C, and the shelf-life was found to be limited by the mesophilic flora in both cases. The shelf-life of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> was prolonged by mixing with other juices and acidification. The effect on shelf-life varied according to the acid used, and was related to the undissociated acid concentration. Using combinations of acids had greater effects at the same pH and thus a positive effect on shelf-life could be achieved without cloud formation. However, storage of the <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> under a modified anaerobic atmosphere had no effect on shelf-life...|$|R

A first order kinetic model, describing loglo D in <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> as a function of pressure and temperature was formulated that allows to identify process conditions (pressure, temperature, holding time) resulting in a desired level of inactivation of E. coli.

Several secondary models (first and second order polynomial and Weibull) were evaluated, but all had poor fitting capacities.

Here we present evidence showing that the PC is essential for odor-aversion learning. Unlike sham-operated slugs, PC ablation 7 d prior to conditioning showed that most slugs did not avoid <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> in the memory retention test conducted 24 h after the conditioning. Slugs with the PC ablated 3 h, 1 d, 3 d, or 7 d after conditioning and examined by the memory retention test at 3 d after the PC ablation were also less likely to avoid <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> than sham-operated slugs. The PC ablation did not damage the ability of the slugs to sense attractive odor (everyday food) or innately aversive odor (onion or garlic). These results demonstrate that the PC is a necessary component in the retention and/or retrieval of odor-aversion memory...|$|R
