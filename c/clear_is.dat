While hiding out in a {{fortified}} cabin Alex recalls switching seats with two girls in his premonition but not before the explosion in reality, meaning <b>Clear</b> <b>is</b> actually next, and he rushes to save her while being chased by agents. Meanwhile, <b>Clear</b> <b>is</b> trapped inside her car with a leaking gas tank, surrounded by loose live wires. Alex arrives in time to save Clear and grabs the wire, allowing her {{to escape from the}} car seconds before it explodes, leaving Alex incapacitated.|$|E

Due to her house experiencing short-circuits, she attempted to escape with her car. Despite the car being trapped by livewires, Alex manages to save her and they both survive the ordeal. Months later in Paris, Alex has doubts about their triumph over Death. Noticing signs of impending doom Clear saves Alex from a speeding bus but they both witness Carter's demise by a falling sign.|$|E
5|$|Going <b>Clear</b> <b>is</b> based {{closely on}} Lawrence Wright's book, {{covering}} {{much of the}} same ground with the aid of archive footage, dramatic reconstructions, and interviews with eight former Scientologists: Paul Haggis, the Oscar-winning director; Mark Rathbun, the church's former second-in-command; Mike Rinder, {{the former head of the}} church's Office of Special Affairs; the actor Jason Beghe; Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor, former liaison to John Travolta; and former Scientologists Tom DeVocht, Sara Goldberg, and Hana Eltringham Whitfield.|$|E

5|$|Wighard (or Wigheard; died between 664 and 667) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What {{little is known}} about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but {{inconsistencies}} between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard's election and whether he was ever confirmed in that office. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome.|$|E
5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities sometimes conflict as to who did what. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Fred was a manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, a tobacconist and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts of London.|$|E
25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be <b>clear,</b> <b>is</b> not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can {{be shown to be}} conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.|$|E

25|$|The Aboriginal {{history from}} this area is not {{especially}} well recorded. There was a mountain clan, the Ja-itma-thang, centred on the Omeo area, but this clan would have interacted regularly with nearby tribes, including the Gunai or Kurnai of Gippsland proper. Population levels are uncertain, but were likely highly underestimated by European settlers, especially with consideration given {{to the fact that}} observation in the mountains and forests of Gippsland is far more difficult than in the more open parts of Australia. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that like elsewhere, population levels quickly declined following European occupation due to both disease and conflict, and people from this clan are no longer found in the area.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a {{standard}} gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so then perhaps {{it would have been}} cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is probably why it was permitted to use broad gauge. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster {{at about the same time}} as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway.|$|E
25|$|What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Harappan {{society was}} not entirely peaceful, with the human {{skeletal}} remains demonstrating {{some of the highest}} rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory. Paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at Harappa, with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from Area G (an ossuary located south-east of the city walls). Furthermore, rates of cranio-facial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilization collapsed amid illness and injury. The bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at Harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety, a basic feature of hierarchical societies world-wide.|$|E

25|$|In 1160, Malcolm {{returned}} to Scotland having spent months campaigning {{in the service}} of the English on the Continent. After successfully dealing with a considerable number of disaffected magnates at Perth, the Chronicle of Holyrood and the twelfththirteenth-century Chronicle of Melrose reveal that he launched three military expeditions into Galloway. The circumstances surrounding these invasions is unclear, although what is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Fergus submitted to the Scots before the end of the year. Specifically, according to Gesta Annalia I, once the Scots subdued the Gallovidians, the conquerors forced Fergus to retire to the abbey of Holyrood, and hand over his son, Uhtred, as a royal hostage. The Chronicle of Holyrood and the fifteenth-century Ordinale of Holyrood corroborate Fergus' monastic retirement, with the former source further recording Fergus' grant of the lands of Dunrod to the abbey.|$|E
25|$|In later {{books of}} the Old Testament, Aaron and his kin are not {{mentioned}} very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later. The books of Judges, Samuel and Kings mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The book of Ezekiel, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King David's priests. It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period. Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form early in this period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E
