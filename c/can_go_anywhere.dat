Erik Johnson, the game's project lead, states that the Hunters are [...] "big and impressive, but they <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>anywhere</b> the player can go", as the player can encounter them both indoors and outdoors. Ted Backman, senior artist for Valve, talks about how the Hunter can express emotions, being a somewhat non-human character. [...] "We want the Hunter {{to be able to}} express nervousness or aggression, [...] whether it's aggressive, hurt, or mad." [...] Hunters are very aggressive and they tend to operate in packs, but can also be found supporting other Combine troops. Late in the game, they can be found escorting Striders, using their flechette guns to protect the Striders that the player is trying to attack.|$|E

Landy monitored Brian's drug intake and used Sol Samuels to prescribe him medication. His assistant Kevin Leslie stood with Brian at every moment, earning Leslie the nickname [...] "Surf Nazi". Leslie also gave Brian medication at Landy's direction. Initially, Leslie was paid salary by Landy, but was eventually paid directly by Brian. In the mid 1980s, Landy stated, [...] "I influence all of 's thinking. I'm practically a member of the band... partners in life." [...] Even though the Beach Boys had hired Landy, part of Landy's treatment involved cutting Brian's contact from the group, as Landy reasons: [...] "You can't deal with people who only want to use you." [...] Brian later responded to allegations with, [...] "People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge." [...] Landy echoed: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car.

In his introductory note, Davies cites as examples of the Doctor's previous associations with music: the First Doctor disguising himself as Ancient Rome's most famous lyre-player in Emperor Nero's court in The Romans; the Second Doctor playing his recorder; the Third Doctor singing Aggedor to sleep with a Venusian lullaby in The Curse of Peladon; the Fourth Doctor shattering glass by singing {{in the style of}} Dame Nellie Melba in The Power of Kroll; the Fifth Doctor playing a harp on Gallifrey in The Five Doctors; the Sixth Doctor singing opera; the Seventh Doctor playing the spoons; the Eighth Doctor admiring composer Giacomo Puccini; and the Ninth Doctor dancing with Rose Tyler to [...] "In The Mood" [...] by Glenn Miller in [...] "The Doctor Dances".

Such robots will travel in outdoor terrain that is too steep, rutted, rocky, wet, muddy, and snowy for conventional vehicles. They will travel in cities and in our homes, doing chores and providing care, where steps, stairways and household clutter limit the utility of wheeled vehicles. Robots meeting these goals will have terrain sensors, sophisticated computing and power systems, advanced actuators and dynamic controls. We will give a status report on BigDog, an example of such rough-terrain robots. 1...|$|R

[...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{approach}} to the lifelong learning paradigm is required to include transnational learners. This research shows that migrant workers, who by definition belong to multiple communities, seek learning experiences to sustain and enhance capabilities as contemporary workers. This {{is the case for}} why global non-elites form transnational agency with learning priorities. In this so-called “global era, ” geographical borders are often said to have disappeared. Dramatic changes have facilitated the flow of capital, information, products and labour on a global scale and, with these flows, the mobility of the world’s workers has increased. According to Ohmae (1991, 1995) workers have fewer and fewer barriers to employ themselves and <b>can</b> <b>go</b> virtually <b>anywhere</b> in this borderless world. This may explain the lives of some groups of jet-setter professionals, who we might imagine working for the giant multinational corporations in the great cities of the world. It does not, however, explain the ever-present challenges facing many contemporary workers, who remain vulnerable and under “pressure to keep cost[s] down and profit[s] up” (Newlands, 2002, p. 217). Many of them cross borders to offer their labour in countries whic...|$|R

One of five county officials listed in the state constitution, sheriffs in Georgia are full-service county officers. Article IX, Section I of the constitution specifies that sheriffs [...] "shall be elected by the qualified voters of their respective counties for a term of four years and shall have such qualifications, powers and duties as provided by general law." [...] However, several metropolitan counties have opted to form a county police to perform law enforcement functions leaving the sheriff to court functions. Others also have a county marshal who provide civil law enforcement. Even with other agencies in the same county, such as county police, the Sheriff is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of each county. All law enforcement officers in Georgia have statewide jurisdiction if the crime happens in their immediate presence, but sheriffs have statewide jurisdiction also if the crime originated in their county. This means if someone breaks the law in one county and flees to another the sheriff <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>anywhere</b> inside the state to investigate the crime, make the arrest, and transport the accused back to the original county.|$|E
