50|$|The {{exact method}} {{and timing of}} topping up a wine barrel is {{determined}} by the individual wineries and can depend on the type of wine or grape variety that is being produced. A barrel can be topped off anywhere from once a week to every month and a half. The position of the barrel can affect the speed and degree of evaporation and the need for topping up. If the barrel is sitting with its bung hole on top, aeration and evaporation occurs more quickly. If the barrel is turned to <b>the</b> side <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bung</b> over position, <b>the</b> <b>bung</b> is kept moist with the wine and aeration occurs at a slower pace. The wine that is replaced during the topping up is usually the same wine taken from another smaller container (such as a carboy) with the barrel filled to the very top to where the reinsertion of <b>the</b> <b>bung</b> causes some spillage.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{tooth root}} is {{probably}} the least desirable problem in gear unit operation; it often leads to failure. Signals produced by a gear with a <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tooth root, produced through real operating conditions, and signals caused by a faultless gear are used for the analysis. By monitoring vibrations {{it is possible to}} detect the presence of a crack. A fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tooth root brings about significant changes in tooth stiffness. Other faults are usually linked with modifications of other dynamic parameters. Time Frequency Analysis tools, e. g. Wavelets Analyses, are used to analyse a non-stationary signal. The wavelet transform is chosen for the analysis. The wavelet function similar to the dynamic reaction of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tooth root is selected. By means of the methods and <b>the</b> analysis presented <b>in</b> this paper, <b>the</b> reliability of determining modifications in signal vibrations is improved...|$|R
