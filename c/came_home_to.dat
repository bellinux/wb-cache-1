5|$|In summer 1857, Smetana <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Prague {{and found}} Kateřina in failing health. In June, Smetana's father František died. That autumn Smetana {{returned}} to Gothenburg, with Kateřina and their surviving daughter Žofie, but before doing so he visited Liszt in Weimar. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt's Faust Symphony and the symphonic poem Die Ideale, which invigorated and inspired him. Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, {{and at this}} time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of Gothenburg.|$|E
5|$|Momolo <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> {{find the}} {{apartment}} empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, {{and another in}} which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police {{down the stairs to}} the street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E

5|$|Bryant became {{familiar}} with the socialist journal The Masses through Portland resident and lawyer C. E. S. Wood, who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine. Enthusiastic about its contents, particularly articles by Portland native John Reed, Bryant began raising subscriptions for it. Emma Goldman, a well-known anarchist whom Wood had defended in court, gave a speech in Reed's honor at the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) hall in Portland. She and other political activists, such as Alexander Berkman, were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband. In 1914, Reed, a Harvard graduate and established writer who by then lived in Greenwich Village, came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the University Club of Portland against the class system. Exactly how or when or how often Bryant and Reed met is uncertain, but near Christmas 1915 when Reed again <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> visit his widowed mother, the young couple announced their love at a dinner party. Reed returned to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, abandoning her marriage, followed him three days later. Trullinger filed for divorce, which was granted in July 1916, on grounds of desertion.|$|E
5|$|Turner {{had never}} been a head coach before; he faced a team {{convinced}} that Baugh had been treated shabbily by Wismer and had difficulty uniting the players. After the Titans split their first two games against Oakland and the Chargers (who had moved to San Diego), the team <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> no paychecks. The players refused to practice, though they worked out on their own on Friday. They then flew to Buffalo and defeated the winless Bills. Public attention in New York was focused on the established local teams, as well as the abysmal record of the fledgling Mets, who nevertheless attracted a cult following. The Titans received little publicity and attracted only 4,719 fans to the home opener against Denver. They were required to wait {{until the end of the}} Mets' season before they were allowed to use the Polo Grounds. The Broncos defeated the Titans, 32–10, and Titans quarterback Dean Look suffered a career-ending injury. New York's financial and football woes continued through October 1962, and at the beginning of November, Wismer informed AFL commissioner Joe Foss that he lacked the money to continue operations. The league assumed the cost of running the team for the rest of 1962; Wismer remained in nominal charge. The Titans had little success on the field (the highlight was a 46–45 victory at favored Denver on Thanksgiving), and finished the season insolvent with a 5–9 record.|$|E

Dzhokhar Dudayev {{had started}} a {{rebellion}} against Soviet, later Russian rule, but the Northern part of Chechnya where Kakiyev hailed from was not so enthusiastic about the secession. After allegedly witnessing atrocities, Kakiyev joined the opposition against Dudaev. In 1993 he was seriously hurt when a hand grenade meant for Dudayev exploded in his own hands. He lost a hand, an eye and his nose and had to have his face reconstructed beyond recognition, {{at a hospital in}} Moscow's Arbat Street. After the operation, Said-Magomed briefly studied at Alma Ata University and returned to Russia to take a tax police training course.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to this iteration of the Dalton saga was sharp. [...] Drew Fetherston, reviewing the movie for Newsday, called it [...] "claptrap" [...] and that [...] "action [...] is all that this NBC stinker has to offer". Faye Zuckerman of the Gainesville Sun called Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a [...] "plodder", complaining that [...] "this film insults its predecessor". Chicago Sun-Times reviewer Daniel Ruth gave Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a half-star review calling it [...] "revisionist", [...] "distasteful", and [...] "terrible television". Deriding the film as [...] "poorly written, badly acted, sloppily directed and choppily edited", he called it [...] "another {{slap in the face}} of the men and women who went to Southeast Asia to do a dirty job and <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> even dirtier exploitation". Ruth concluded, [...] "The viewer's best [...] "Code of Vengeance" [...] would be to reject these films." ...|$|E
500|$|The third season, {{which was}} filmed in 1983 and {{consisted}} of 130 half-hour episodes, had different goals than the previous seasons. [...] One of its goals was instructing its viewers and their families about basic hygiene, [...] "a matter of critical importance {{in an area of}} the world where gastrointestinal diseases abound and infant mortality rates are high". [...] The third season of the show included characters created to [...] "expose young Latin American children to both traditional and nontraditional role models". [...] The producers created characters that demonstrated family diversity, in order to fulfill their curriculum goal of presenting more egalitarian lifestyles by modeling overcoming stereotypes, demonstrating different career options for both men and women, and exhibiting the sharing of household responsibilities. [...] They cast performers in two different families. [...] The first family was more traditional {{and consisted of}} a middle-aged couple named Tono, a mechanic (played by Maurico Herrara), and Alicia, a public health nurse (Alicia de Bari), who had two children. [...] The adults in the second family were young working professionals; the wife was a veterinarian and the husband was a music teacher who worked from home. [...] Other human characters included: Jose, a shopkeeper and his young assistant, a student named Mercedes (Xochiti Vigil): a truck driver played by Tony Diaz; and a pilot (Fernando Balzaretti), who travelled throughout Latin American and <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> tell his adventures to his friends on the plaza.

500|$|The track segues {{directly}} into [...] "What's My Age Again?", also penned by Hoppus, who created it partially {{as a joke}} to amuse friends. It was originally titled [...] "Peter Pan Complex", referencing the subject matter: one who refuses to grow up. [...] "Dysentery Gary" [...] leads off {{the second half of}} the album, and was written by DeLonge about a crush that instead chooses someone else. Left with [...] "nothing better to do," [...] the devastated friend chooses to mock her boyfriend. It was one of the first songs the band wrote with Barker, who incorporated a [...] "Latin groove" [...] into his drumming. [...] "Adam's Song," [...] the piano-laced seventh track of the record, was written primarily based on the loneliness that Hoppus experienced during the unending days of touring the previous year. When Hoppus brought the song to the band, the trio reacted positively but showed reluctance to add it to the record, believing the dark subject matter might off-put listeners. Although usually vocals would take many alternate takes to complete, Hoppus completed the vocal track for [...] "Adam's Song" [...] in a single take. The power pop-inspired [...] "All the Small Things" [...] was composed by DeLonge as both an ode to his girlfriend and one of his favorite bands, the Ramones. During the recording process of Enema of the State, DeLonge <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> find roses at the top of the stairs from his girlfriend, which inspired the line: [...] "She left me roses by the stairs; surprises let me know she cares." ...|$|E
