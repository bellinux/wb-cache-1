50|$|During the Boxer Rebellion, Imperial Chinese forces {{deployed}} a <b>command-detonated</b> <b>mine</b> {{field at}} the mouth of the Peiho river before the Dagu forts, to prevent the western Allied forces from sending ships to attack.|$|E
50|$|The detainee {{is said to}} {{have told}} several people that he was {{preparing}} to conduct <b>command-detonated</b> <b>mine</b> attacks against U.S. Forces. Shortly after this threat, U.S. Forces discovered and destroyed in place two apparently command-detonated, probably plastic shelled, anti-tank mines that had been pladed in holes on a highway in Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|On 5 April {{a patrol}} from Company G 3/7 Marines {{triggered}} a mine near their night defensive position southeast of Nui Dau. A medical evacuation {{of the two}} wounded Marines was requested and a UH-1E gunship #151852 from VMO-6 arrived {{to pick up the}} wounded; the helicopter was instructed to hover over the landing zone in case there were any more mines, but as it did so a <b>command-detonated</b> <b>mine</b> made from a 250 lb bomb was detonated destroying the helicopter and a further mine was detonated as Marines rushed to assist, killing all 4 helicopter crew and 8 Marines and Navy corpsmen.|$|E
25|$|This {{depended}} {{on the use of}} <b>command-detonated</b> <b>mines</b> which were triggered by hidden troops who held a detonating device connected to the demolitions by electrical wire. Mine ambush kill zones might also include punji traps or other homemade traps, land mines and natural obstacles. However, the ambush was always triggered by electrically detonating a mine, when enemy troops moved within the mines killing range.|$|R
50|$|The Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre {{also carried}} out patrolling against Two Sisters; Sergeant Joseph Wassell and Lieutenant Fraser Haddow played an {{important}} part in the capture of the mountain when they discovered with their binoculars from their observation post on Goat Ridge, the <b>command-detonated</b> barrels of <b>mines</b> the Argentinian Marine engineers had dug in and planned to use on the eastern half of the mountain.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{the losses}} {{suffered}} by the communists, the combined American and Australian force had only succeeded in partially clearing the area and the tunnel network it concealed, and consequently the Ho Bo Woods would remain a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war. Indeed, {{the bulk of the}} communist force had successfully withdrawn intact, leaving only rear guard elements in defence, prompting the communists to also declare the operation a victory, claiming almost 2,000 American troops killed or wounded, 100 vehicles destroyed, and 50 aircraft shot down. Yet, such claims were based on estimates of casualties caused by <b>command-detonated</b> <b>mines,</b> punji sticks and other booby traps, and proved to be wildly inaccurate. In fact Operation Crimp had rattled the communists, and they subsequently ordered their units in the south to prevent the Americans from concentrating their forces in the future. Regardless, it also highlighted the inherent weakness of the search-and-clear operations that would later become standard operating procedure for the US Army in Vietnam. The Ho Bo Woods were again targeted by the Americans in January 1967, during a much larger operation known as Operation Cedar Falls. However, despite [...] heavy casualties again being inflicted on the Viet Cong, the tunnels continued to remain a problem for the Americans and they were later used as a communist staging area for the attack on Saigon during the 1968 Tet offensive. Finally in 1970, American B-52 bombers carried out a number of heavy air-strikes on the area, dropping thousands of delayed-fuse bombs that buried deep into the ground before exploding, ending the tunnels' utility. Operation Crimp was 1 RAR's third and last foray into the communist heartland and following the fighting they had more than two weeks rest in Bien Hoa—their longest break from operations during the battalion's tour. Further operations followed in the months afterwards, including the Battle of Suoi Bong Trang on the night of 23–24 February 1966.|$|R
50|$|Maneuvering {{under heavy}} fire, Sergeant Walkabout {{positioned}} himself where the enemy were concentrating their assault and placed continuous rifle {{fire on the}} adversary. A <b>command-detonated</b> <b>mine</b> ripped through the friendly team, instantly killing three men and wounding all the others. Although stunned and wounded by the blast, Sergeant Walkabout rushed from man to man administering first aid, bandaging one soldier's severe chest wound and reviving another soldier by heart massage. He then coordinated gunship and tactical air strikes on the enemy's positions. When evacuation helicopters arrived again, he worked single-handedly under fire to board his disabled comrades. Only when the casualties had been evacuated and friendly reinforcements had arrived, did he allow himself to be extracted. He retired as a second lieutenant.|$|E
5000|$|Westchester County {{spent the}} early weeks of 1968 {{continuing}} {{service as a}} Mobile Riverine support ship. On 26 January the ship {{began a series of}} lifts from Okinawa and the Philippines to Vietnam. She underwent repair availability and training exercises from 16 July through 22 September. The ship resumed duty with the Mobile Riverine Forces on 22 September. On 1 November while Westchester County lay anchored in the vicinity of My Tho, Vietnam two giant underwater explosions ripped through it, killing 26 men. Vietcong divers had attached limpet mines to the hull about amidships on the starboard side causing ruptured berthing compartments and fuel and storage tanks. <b>Command-detonated</b> <b>mines</b> were used extensively on [...] "The Long Tau" [...] (Saigon—Vung Tau). U.S. minesweepers normally operated between Nha Be south to the ocean, and South Vietnamese operated from Nha Be to Newport. The day following the explosion, the entire Mobile Riverine Force moved from My Tho to Đồng Tâm. After beaching at Đồng Tâm for temporary repairs, she returned to Yokosuka, via Subic Bay, on 26 November. Westchester County went into drydock at the United States Naval Ship Repair Facility where it remained until 5 February 1969. Upon completion of refresher training and upkeep, the ship got underway on 10 March 1969 for [...] "Operation Market Time" [...] off the Vietnam coast. From 5 July through 23 August, Westchester County joined in the first phase of Vietnam troop withdrawal. The remainder of 1969 was spent carrying personnel and equipment from Korea, Japan, and Okinawa to Vietnam with intermittent periods of repair and liberty. The beginning of the 1970s found Westchester County operating off the northern coast of Vietnam. During February, she conducted troop and equipment withdrawal from South Vietnam, then underwent restricted availability at Yokosuka beginning on 4 March. April through July were spent transporting personnel and cargo from Japan and Okinawa to Vietnam. On 2 August she relieved the [...] off the Ca Mau Peninsula for [...] "Operation Solid Anchor", which consisted of fueling boats and helicopters. Nine of Westchester County's sailors received the Combat Action Ribbon when they withstood enemy small arms and rocket fire while transiting the Bo De River.|$|R
25|$|On 16 February, {{just prior}} to a ceasefire for the Tet New Year festival, the Australian command had {{received}} information from an agent about the location of large weapon caches {{in the north of}} AO Tiki, and a large Viet Cong force was also expected to be in position. B and W Companies 4 RAR/NZ, each accompanied by a tracker team and a Centurion tank troop from B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment were subsequently tasked to patrol to the area by separate routes. Accompanied by the Hoi Chanh, B Company—under the command of Major Bill Reynolds—crossed an open area during the early afternoon and moved into some dense vegetation, patrolling up to an occupied communist position unaware. Well concealed in bunkers the Viet Cong successfully initiated a <b>command-detonated</b> directional <b>mine</b> and opened fire with small-arms and RPGs, killing one Australian and wounding five others. In response the Australian tanks—under the command of Second Lieutenant Brian Sullivan—moved forward to support the infantry, and in the ensuring battle two were damaged, including one which was knocked out by a rocket propelled grenade which penetrated the turret and inflicted severe injuries on the crew. Yet under the leadership of Reynolds, B Company fought to regain its balance following the initial onslaught, and was able to withdraw under the fire of the surviving tanks which engaged the bunkers at point-blank with their 20 pounder main armament, using solid shot and canister anti-personnel rounds which stripped the undergrowth. The Australian casualties were moved back to safety by stretcher bearers who had moved forward under covering fire, and the damaged tank was also successfully recovered.|$|R
