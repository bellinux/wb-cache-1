5|$|To {{strengthen}} the city's firefighting capabilities, the city established a reserve unit called the Exempt Fireman's Company, so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> {{it was made}} up of firemen who were exempt from militia and jury duty. The company was led by veteran fireman Zophar Mills, who had helped stop the great 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost in a general election, is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status. The MP is so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> {{he or she does}} not represent any constituency (or electoral division) in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is <b>called,</b> <b>because</b> of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

5|$|Other {{rooms in}} the state suite include the Red Room— so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> its walls are covered in red brocade— a large drawing room {{containing}} paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> the Capitol building in downtown Washington could {{be seen from the}} tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of the}} Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo Lawn is so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> of the {{replica of}} the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was {{presented}} by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn {{is part of the}} original balustrade of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826.|$|E
50|$|The Upanishad {{states that}} Rudra is {{resident}} {{in the soul}} in the heart. In chapter 4, the text offers mystical explanations to why Rudra is described the way he is. He is called Om, states the text, because when uttered he makes Prana go upwards. He is called the holy <b>call</b> <b>because</b> he {{is the essence of}} all the Vedas. He is <b>called</b> all prevading <b>because</b> he permeates the silence of the universe. He is <b>called</b> infinite <b>because</b> when uttered there is no end of it in any dimension, states the text.|$|R

A son was <b>called</b> Bela, <b>because</b> Joseph was swallowed up (nivla) among the peoples. A son was <b>called</b> Becher, <b>because</b> Joseph was the firstborn (bechor) of his mother. A son was <b>called</b> Ashbel, <b>because</b> God sent Joseph into captivity (shevao el). A son was <b>called</b> Gera, <b>because</b> Joseph dwelt (gar) in a strange land. A son was <b>called</b> Naaman, <b>because</b> Joseph was especially beloved (na'im). Sons were called Ehi and Rosh, because Joseph was to Benjamin [...] "my brother" [...] (achi) and chief (rosh). Sons were called Muppim and Huppim, because Benjamin said that Joseph did not see Benjamin's marriage-canopy (chuppah). A son was <b>called</b> Ard, <b>because</b> Joseph descended (yarad) among the peoples. Others explain that he was <b>called</b> Ard, <b>because</b> Joseph's face was like a rose (vered).|$|R
5|$|The bayside {{residential}} area called La Playa lies somewhat {{north of the}} original La Playa, the beach where commercial and military ships anchored during {{the early days of}} the city. La Playa includes some of the most expensive homes in San Diego. Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats. The hills above La Playa are known as the Wooded Area on the bay side of Catalina Boulevard (so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> of the many mature trees in the area), and the College Area on the ocean side (because of the proximity of Point Loma Nazarene College). The Sunset Cliffs neighborhood is on the west side, above ocean bluffs, and is known for its views of the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nearly}} 100,000 hatt-ı hümayuns in the Ottoman {{archives}} in Istanbul. Among the more famous are the Edict (hatt-ı şerîf) of Gülhane of 1839 and the Imperial Reform Edict (hatt-ı hümayun) of 1856. For this last one, the Turkish term Tanzimat Fermanı is more accurate. This decree, which started the so-called Tanzimat reforms, is so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> it carries a handwritten order by the sultan {{to the grand}} vizier to execute his command.|$|E
5|$|The Baths of Zeuxippus {{were popular}} public baths {{in the city}} of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. They were built between 100 to 200, {{destroyed}} by the Nika revolt of 532 and then rebuilt several years later. They were so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> they were built upon the site where a Temple of Jupiter (Zeus) had formerly existed. They were built around 500 yards south of the much older baths of Achilles of the earlier Greek Acropolis in Byzantion. The baths were famed primarily for the many statues that were built within, and the famous people they each represented. However, they were later used for military purposes, during the seventh century. Excavations of the site and the Baths were made in 1928.|$|E
50|$|They are <b>called</b> 'Koteyavaru' <b>because</b> 'Kote' in Kannada means 'Fort' and 'Koteyavaru' means 'people {{belonging}} to fort (Killedara)'.

5|$|The unpopularity of Henry VI's {{counsellors}} and his belligerent consort, Margaret of Anjou, {{as well as}} his own ineffectual leadership, led to {{the weakening}} of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> its head, a descendant of Edward III, was Richard, Duke of York. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, Edward IV, led the Yorkists to victory in 1461. The Wars of the Roses, nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son Edward V and brother Richard III. Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by Henry Tudor, in 1485, when Richard III was killed in the Battle of Bosworth Field.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Brahmins {{fall under}} the Pancha Dravida Brahmin {{classification}} of the Brahmin community in India. Other Brahmin sub-castes {{in the region are}} Karhade Brahmin, Devrukhe, Konkanastha and Goud Saraswat Brahmin, but these sub-castes only have a regional significance. Goud Saraswat Brahmins {{fall under the}} Pancha Gauda Brahmin classification, i.e. North Indian Brahmins. The Vedas are the world's oldest texts that are still used in worship and they are the oldest literature of India. Four Vedas exist of which the Rig Veda is the oldest. They were handed down from one generation of Brahmins to the next verbally and memorised by each generation. They were written down sometime around 400 BC. Other Vedas include the Yajur Veda, the Atharva Veda and the Sama Veda. Two different versions of the Yajur Veda exist, the White (Shukla in Sanskrit) and the black or (Krishna in Sanskrit). The Shukla Yajur Veda has a two different branches (Shakha in Sanskrit) called the Kanva and the Madhyandin. Deshastha Brahmins are further classified in two major sub-sects, the Deshashatha Rigvedi and the Deshastha Yajurvedi, based on the Veda they follow. The Yajurvedis are further classified into two groups called the Madhyandins and the Kanavas. The Madhyandins follow the Madhyandin branch of the Shukla Yajur Veda. The word Madhyandin is a fusion of two words Madhya and din which mean middle and day respectively. They are so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> they perform Sandhya Vandana at noon.|$|E
5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so <b>called</b> <b>because</b> they were sworn {{officers of the}} court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
