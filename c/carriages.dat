5|$|Early {{passenger}} <b>carriages</b> were {{of similar}} design {{to those used}} on railways in England at the time, holding eighteen passengers on first class <b>carriages,</b> and thirty on second class. Third class <b>carriages</b> originally had seats, but on 15 April 1840 a board decision declared that all future third class <b>carriages</b> were to be made without seats. All existing third class <b>carriages</b> also had their seats removed. A later board decision on 3 July 1840 ordered that third class <b>carriages</b> would be situated closest to the engine, followed by second class, with first class at the rear.|$|E

For the longer extension to Watford, the LER and the LNWR ordered 72 new <b>carriages</b> from the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. Manufacture of this rolling stock was delayed by the war, and, while it was waiting for delivery, the Bakerloo Tube used spare 1915 stock <b>carriages</b> ordered for an unfinished extension of the CLR to Ealing Broadway and more spare Gate stock <b>carriages</b> from the GNP Delivery of the <b>carriages</b> for the Watford service, known as the Watford Joint stock because ownership was shared with the LNWR, began in 1920; they were painted in the LNWR's livery to distinguish them from trains operating only on the Bakerloo Tube's tracks.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock <b>carriages</b> from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment <b>carriages</b> were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage <b>Carriages</b> Trust has three preserved Dreadnought <b>carriages.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s {{a number}} of {{heritage}} railways had been established in Victoria on closed branch lines. These railways serve both as tourist attractions, and to preserve the railway past.

5|$|From the 1854 {{establishment}} of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered aboard trains; passengers {{were allowed to}} bring food with them. Train stations also lacked dining facilities. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen. He established the restaurant at Drammen Station, and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the Bergen Line, which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two <b>carriages</b> from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. These were {{to be paid for}} by the state, but the Parliament of Norway delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant <b>carriages</b> on trains. The plans were opposed by the teetotaler faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor of dining service. To get the <b>carriages</b> in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the <b>carriages</b> was refunded by NSB. In 1910, when President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt visited Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, several restaurant <b>carriages</b> were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant <b>carriages</b> were put in regular service on the Østfold Line.|$|E
5|$|Initially trains {{were made}} up of eight <b>carriages,</b> but after 1879 nine became the standard.

5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear <b>carriages</b> were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five <b>carriages,</b> were the worst affected, and the rear four first class <b>carriages</b> were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded <b>carriages</b> remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the <b>carriages.</b> Most injuries occurred in the front two <b>carriages.</b> The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment <b>carriages</b> constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gas— two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. Initially the <b>carriages</b> were braked with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all <b>carriages.</b> The operation of the chain brake could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some <b>carriages</b> on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E

5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for the whole length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the <b>carriages</b> is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the <b>carriages</b> is painted grey. Red colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms red parallelograms when the <b>carriages</b> are combined. When asked why the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was {{in need of}} major improvements. Before preservation, the station had {{contained}} only a fan of sidings, which meant {{that there was no way}} for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the <b>carriages.</b> As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the <b>carriages</b> to the front of the train. A loop was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class <b>carriages</b> {{at each end of}} the train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it is equipped with a pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered <b>carriages</b> is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|Early {{vehicles}} were {{built by a}} number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build <b>carriages</b> at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway's rolling stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and slip coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk at express speeds. Representative examples of these <b>carriages</b> survive in service today on various Heritage railways up and down the country.|$|E
40|$|During {{a two-year}} period from January 1979, 260 {{patients}} {{have been involved in}} an outbreak of <b>carriage</b> and infection due to gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria. We have examined the duration of <b>carriage</b> of such enterobacteria and have compared the <b>carriage</b> of Klebsiella with that of other resistant enterobacteria. <b>Carriage</b> of gentamicin-resistant enterobacteria occurred most frequently and was least sporadic in the intestinal tract. Vaginal <b>carriage</b> was observed in 49 out of 68 patients tested and occurred more frequently in older patients. Oral <b>carriage</b> was noted in 36 % of patients but was more sporadic than intestinal <b>carriage.</b> Rates of oral <b>carriage</b> were greater among moribund patients. <b>Carriage</b> at skin sites was related to their proximity to the perineum. Intestinal <b>carriage</b> of gentamicin-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiellae but not Klebsiella oxytoca nor Citrobacter persisted for long periods (half lives of 140 and 100 days respectively). Cessation of <b>carriage</b> of gentamicin-resistant Klebsiellae was due to loss of both the organism and its plasmid rather than a shedding of the plasmid.
