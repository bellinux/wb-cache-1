Despite much progress there are still major issues with building a timescale with multiple chronometers and for testing synchroneity of anomalous events in Earth history. Improvements in methods for determining U-Pb zircon dates has led to their application at precisions of 0. 2 % or better in rocks even younger than a million years (e. g., Crowley et al., 2007, Geology), and significantly better than 0. 1 % in some cases (e. g., Bowring et al., 2006, Paleontological Society Papers, Volume 12). Additionally, the inter-calibration experiments for U-Pb using the EARTHTIME tracer have yielded excellent agreement among labs (0. 05 %) and these values are traceable back to SI units through the EARTHTIME tracer calibration experiment (e. g., Condon et al., in press, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta).

METHODS: Six ECAA national control laboratories provided certified values for the freeze dried plasmas {{in terms of the}} human plain international reference preparation (IRP) (BCT/ 441) with the manual prothrombin time technique. Eight other ECAA national laboratories determined international sensitivity index (ISI) values in full fresh plasma same species and <b>cross</b> species WHO <b>calibrations</b> against a low ISI human IRP (BCT/ 441) of the ECAA low ISI human thromboplastin and high ISI ECAA rabbit thromboplastin. Parallel calibrations were performed using the certified values. RESULTS: Calibrations on fresh plasmas of the human ECAA reference thromboplastin (stated ISI = 0. 95) gave ISI of 0. 957 against the human IRP and 1. 66 against the rabbit IRP. The ECAA rabbit (stated ISI = 1. 67) gave an identical value on the fresh plasma calibration v the human IRP. With freeze dried depleted plasmas certified in terms of the human IRP, the ISI of the ECAA human was 1. 01, but the ECAA rabbit (stated ISI = 1. 67) gave a low ISI of 1. 47. The freeze dried coumarin plasmas gave an ISI of 0. 943 for the ECAA human but only 1. 493 for the ECAA rabbit.

Settings: 2011 Andalusian Health Survey, a crosssectional population survey based on face-to-face home interviews. Participants: 6507 people aged 16 years or older and living in Andalusia, Spain. Outcomes: Design weights, linear calibration based on marginals and on crossings, and model-assisted calibration were used to estimate the prevalence and variance of DCP, for the whole sample and for the domains of sex and age groups (16 – 44; 45 – 64; + 65). Results: Calibration variables were sex, age groups and educational level. In the whole sample, DCP prevalence calibration reduced by more than 5. 2 % and 8. 2 % the estimated prevalences and variances, respectively, obtained with the design weights. Regarding the domains, prevalence reductions are from 33 % to 1 %, and variance reductions are from 0. 2 % to 1 %. Model-assisted calibration is the best technique to estimate DCP prevalence for the whole population and <b>crossing</b> <b>calibration</b> for their domains, although with almost no differences compared to marginal calibration. Conclusions: The validity and accuracy of estimations of DCP prevalence are improved by calibration adjustments.

40|$|The {{derivation}} of integral fluxes from instrument coincidence rates requires accurate {{knowledge of}} their effective energies. Recent <b>cross</b> <b>calibrations</b> of GOES with the high-energy-resolution Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) 8 Goddard Medium Energy Experiment (GME) (Sandberg et al., Geophys. Res. Lett, 41, 4435, 2014 a) gave significantly lower effective energies than those currently used by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center to calculate solar proton integral fluxes from GOES rates. This implies systematically lower integral fluxes than currently produced. This paper quantifies {{the differences between the}} current and the cross-calibrated GOES integral fluxes and validates the latter. Care is taken to rule out the spectral resolution of the measurements or different integration algorithms as major contributors to differences in the magnitudes of the derived integral fluxes. The lower effective energies are validated by comparison with the independent, high-resolution observations by the STEREO Low-Energy Telescope (LET) and High-Energy Telescope (HET) during the December 2006 solar proton events. The current GOES product is similar to the > 10 [*]MeV integral fluxes recalculated by using the Sandberg et al. [2014 a] effective energies but is substantially greater at higher energies. (The median ratios of the current to the recalculated fluxes are 1. 1 at > 10 [*]MeV, 1. 7 at > 30 [*]MeV, 2. 1 at > 60 [*]MeV, and 2. 9 at > 100 [*]MeV.) By virtue of this validation, the cross-calibrated GOES integral fluxes should be considered more accurate than the current NOAA product.

40|$|RapidEye is {{a leading}} {{provider}} of quality high-resolution satellite imagery. With a constellation of five earth observation satellites, RapidEye images up to five million square kilometers of earth every day, and adds over one billion square kilometers of imagery to its archive every year. The satellites are equally phased in a sun-synchronous orbit which allows {{for the possibility of}} imaging any point on the Earth (between 75 ͦS to 75 ͦN) each day. As RapidEye data features a combination of wide area repetitive coverage and five meter pixel multi-spectral imagery covering visible and near infrared wavelengths, it is a natural choice for many industries and government agencies. Users of RapidEye imagery count on consistent data, regardless of the satellite used to take the image. However, slight variations inherent in custom manufacturing and different experiences on-orbit mean each imager is unique. To ensure a consistent response across the constellation, each instrument is calibrated to the other instruments in the constellation to a very high degree. This calibration is updated routinely and fosters the creation of consistent data over the lifetime of the fleet. This paper will detail the lifetime intra-constellation calibration of the RapidEye sensors over pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS). The use of these sites for the purposes of calibrating on-orbit sensors is well documented. RapidEye uses over twenty sites, further broken down into 25 x 25 kilometer tiles, to not only monitor the lifetime trends of the individual sensors but also to compare each sensor’s response {{to the rest of the}} fleet. Each tile is evaluated individually and compared to the other tiles from the same site, each site is compared to the other sites, and each band is compared to the same bands from the other spacecraft.
