40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the actual {{condition}} of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> in Japan, based on a questionnaire survey. A way of working called "coworking" and a place for such work called "coworking space" have been attracting attention in recent years because they may provide a more flexible work style, diverse members to interact with, and open spaces than are experienced when working in a specific company or corporate office. However, we still have not acquired the whole picture of <b>coworking</b> and <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> because of insufficiency of the comprehensive research. Thus, we attempt to shed some light on the current status of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> in the following steps. Firstly, we review previous studies about coworking. Secondly, we will present the current status and issues of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces,</b> based on a questionnaire survey conducted among almost all <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> operating in Japan. Finally, we consider the significance of our findings, comparing with those in previous studies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how managed <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> {{affect the}} innovation process of their members. Managed <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> are working environments for independent professionals, with {{an active role}} of {{the manager of the}} space to foster collaboration and interaction. These locations emerged in the late 2000 s and were designed to host people who endeavor to break isolation and to find a convivial environment that favors meetings and collaboration (Moriset, 2013). It is often taken for granted that coworking contributes to innovation (Botsman & Rogers, 2011). Earlier research discussed outcomes of coworking, such as cooperative working (e. g. Leforestier, 2009, Spinuzzi, 2012), getting access to new knowledge (van Winden et al., 2012), or having new business opportunities (Groot, 2013). Yet, it is not fully understood how <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> can be effective in fostering these outcomes, and what role management could play. The managers of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> deploy a variety of strategies to foster interaction and collaboration, but there has been very little systematic analysis of the effects on interaction and innovation. This paper proposes a typology of strategic management tools applied by <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces,</b> and aims to shed light on the effectiveness for interaction and innovation. In the empirical part, we describe and analyze two <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> in Amsterdam. The implications for proprietors of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> and policy makers are analyzed in view of the potential contributions of these spaces to local collaborations, knowledge transfer and new business opportunities...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> {{are shared}} office environments for {{independent}} professionals. Such spaces have been increasing rapidly throughout the world, and provide, {{in addition to}} basic business infrastructure, the opportunity for social interaction. This article explores social interaction in <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> and reports the results of two studies. Study 1 (N = 69 coworkers) finds that social interaction in <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> can {{take the form of}} social support. Study 2 further investigates social support among coworkers (N = 154 coworkers) and contrasts these results with those of social support among colleagues in traditional work organizations (N = 609). A moderated mediation model using time pressure and self-efficacy, based on the conservation of resources theory, is tested. Social support from both sources was positively related to performance satisfaction. Self-efficacy mediated this relationship in the employee sample, while in the coworking sample, self-efficacy only mediated the relationship between social support and performance satisfaction if time pressure was high. Thus, a mobilization of social support seems necessary in <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces.</b> We conclude that <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces,</b> as modern social work environments, should align flexible work infrastructure with well-constructed opportunities for social support...|$|R

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the economic crisis <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> that exemplify new ways of organising labour in project-based and largely freelance occupations as found in the cultural and creative industries (CCIs) has emerged. <b>Coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> have become hubs for the entrepreneurs, freelance professionals and organizations that are building Europe’s future economy, innovation, jobs, and growth. <b>Coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> activate and strengthen networks and links of {{the tens of thousands of}} creative people and businesses they host. In <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> you can find increased interaction, sharing of know- how and experience. However CCIs still need support to create cross-border networks and platforms to help structure and strengthen the sector. Through CONEcT project we want to promote coworking in MED region to reach its full potential and empower networks in CCIs to increase transnational activity and raise competitivenes of the MED area. In the first phase the project will give state of the art in CCIs sector and analyze different <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces.</b> For empowerment of coworking communities study tours and on-line trainings will be organized. To increase international activity of innovative networks international business boot camp will be organized from which new services/products as well as new international networks will derive.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze {{correlations}} about the actual condition of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> in Japan, based on a questionnaire survey. A way of working called "coworking" and a place for such work called "coworking space" have been attracting attention in recent years because they may provide a more flexible work style, diverse members to interact with, and open spaces than are experienced when working in a specific company or corporate office. However, the understanding of this phenomenon is insufficient. There is still hardly any empirical research that discusses the actual conditions of <b>coworking</b> and <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> especially in Japan, though we can find some implicative descriptive papers on this phenomenon. Thus, we attempt to shed some light on the current status of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> in the following steps. Firstly, we review previous studies about coworking, focusing primarily on the annual Global Coworking Survey conducted around the world. Secondly, we show the result of correlation analysis based on a questionnaire survey conducted among almost all <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> operating in Japan from six viewpoints: facility, management organization, business strategy, activity, space users, and performance...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the financial and economic crisis of 2007 and 2008, a new type of collaboratively oriented workplace has emerged in cities. These <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> and the associated practice of coworking exemplify new ways of organising labour in project-based and largely freelance occupations as found in the cultural and creative industries. But <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> are not just flexible shared office spaces for creative professionals ‘working alone together’ (Spinuzzi, 2012). Coworking promotes a collective, community-based approach to the organisation of cultural and creative work where a particularly important role is accorded to the coworking host, whose activities are described as a curatorial practice aimed at creating a collaborative atmosphere and social relationships. <b>Coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> can therefore be regarded as a new form of urban social infrastructure enabling contacts and collaborations between people, ideas and connecting places...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this working paper is to {{introduce}} the concept of ‘coworking’ to an academic audience. It argues that coworking is a complex social phenomenon that can be differentiated from other spatial concepts that relate to work, learning and social interactions. The paper provides an historical account {{of the origins of}} coworking and reviews the existing scholarly and popular literature, offering a theoretical distinction between <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> and serviced offices that hinges upon the degree of social collaboration versus the importance of location and facilities of the office environment. An overview of recent data on the number and location of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> across the world is provided, including a few examples that demonstrate the spatial distribution of <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> within cities. It also provides some data on typical coworking profiles, and links coworking to the broader contextual debates on non-standard and creative work.

This chapter focuses on nomadic patterns of designers, freelancers, hackers, and creative professionals, and seeks to map the urban spaces that they occupy and navigate in order to go about their work practices. After a brief introduction on the use of office space and recently emerged city bound working practices, we first review previous studies and current literature about the impact of digital connectivity and mobility on collaboration and <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces.</b> Two cases (the Centre for Social Innovation in Toronto, Canada, and The Edge, a digital culture centre at the State Library of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia) will be introduced as examples of social practices in, and uses / employments of <b>coworking</b> and collaboration <b>spaces.</b> The subsequent discussion of best practices and future designs of collaboration and <b>coworking</b> <b>spaces</b> will focus on three distinct themes: First, the tension between universal vs specialised demands on space; second, the need for perpetual messiness, and; third, the unfolding urban ecology of work spaces. Finally, we will conclude with some considerations on the configuration and promotion of collaborative working practices especially with regards to urban planning...|$|R
