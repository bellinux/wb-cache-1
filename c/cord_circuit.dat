40|$|Presently {{there exists}} {{no cure for}} spinal cord injury. However, {{transplantation}} of embryonic tissue into spinal cord lesions resulted in axon outgrowth across the lesion site and some functional recovery, fostering hope for future stem cell therapies. Although in vivo evidence for functional recovery is given, the exact cellular mechanism of the graft support remains elusive: either the grafted cells provide a permissive environment for the host tissue to regenerate itself or the grafts actually integrate functionally into the host neuronal network reconnecting the separated spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits.</b> We tested the two hypotheses in an in vitro spinal cord lesion model {{that is based on}} propagation of activity between two rat organotypic spinal cord slices in culture. Transplantation of dissociated cells from E 14 rat spinal cord or forebrain re-established the relay of activity over the lesion site and, thus, provoked functional regeneration. Combining patch-clamp recordings from transplanted cells with network activity measurements from the host tissue on multi-electrode arrays we here show that neurons differentiate from the grafted cells and integrate into the host circuits. Optogenetic silencing of neurons developed from transplanted embryonic mouse forebrain cells provides clear evidence that they replace the lost neuronal connections to relay and synchronize activity between the separated spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits.</b> In contrast, transplantation of neurospheres induced neither the differentiation of mature neurons from the grafts nor an improvement of functional regeneration.

40|$|The {{motor cortex}} {{controls}} motor behaviors by generating movement-specific signals and transmitting them through spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits</b> and motoneurons to the muscles. Precise and well-coordinated muscle activation patterns {{are necessary for}} accurate movement execution. Therefore, the activity of cortical neurons should correlate with movement parameters. To investigate the specifics of such correlations among activities of the motor cortex, spinal cord network and muscles, we developed a model for neural control of goal-directed reaching movements that simulates the entire pathway from the motor cortex through spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits</b> to the muscles controlling arm movements. In this model, the arm consists of two joints (shoulder and elbow), whose movements are actuated by six muscles (4 single-joint and 2 double-joint flexors and extensors). The muscles provide afferent feedback to the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits.</b> Cortical neurons are defined as cortical "controllers" that solve an inverse problem based on a proposed straight-line trajectory to a target position and a predefined bell-shaped velocity profile. Thus, the controller generates a motor program that produces a task-specific activation of low-level spinal circuits that in turn induce the muscle activation realizing the intended reaching movement. Using the model, we describe the mechanisms of correlation between cortical and motoneuronal activities and movement direction and other movement parameters. We show that the directional modulation of neuronal activity in the motor cortex and the spinal cord may result from direction-specific dynamics of muscle lengths. Our model suggests that directional modulation first emerges {{at the level of}} muscle forces, augments at the motoneuron level, and further increases {{at the level of the}} motor cortex due to the dependence of frictional forces in the joints, contractility of the muscles and afferent feedback on muscle lengths and/or velocities...|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of rhythmic electrical activity is a prominent feature of spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits</b> {{that is used}} for locomotion and also for circuit refinement during development. The mechanisms involved in rhythm generation in spinal cord networks are not fully understood. It is for example not known whether spinal cord rhythms are driven by pacemaker neurons and if yes, which neurons {{are involved in this}} function. We studied the mechanisms involved in rhythm generation in slice cultures from fetal rats that were grown on multielectrode arrays (MEAs). We combined multisite extracellular recordings from the MEA electrodes with intracellular patch clamp recordings from single neurons. We found that spatially restricted oscillations of activity appeared in most of the cultures spontaneously. Such activity was based on intrinsic activity in a percentage of the neurons that could activate the spinal networks through recurrent excitation. The local oscillator networks critically involved NMDA, AMPA and GABA / glycine receptors at subsequent phases of the oscillation cycle. Intrinsic spiking in individual neurons (in the absence of functional synaptic coupling) was based on persistent sodium currents. Intrinsic firing as well as persistent sodium currents were increased by 5 -HT through 5 -HT 2 receptors. Comparing neuronal activity to muscle activity in co-cultures of spinal cord slices with muscle fibers we found that a percentage of the intrinsically spiking neurons were motoneurons. These motoneurons were electrically coupled among each other and they could drive the spinal networks through cholinergic recurrent excitation. These findings open the possibility that during development rhythmic activity in motoneurons is not only involved in circuit refinement downstream at the neuromuscular endplates but also upstream at the level of spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R

40|$|Primary sensory neurons are {{responsible}} for cutaneous somatosensory transduction. These neurons can transduce mechanical force, temperature, and chemical sensitivity, which we perceive as pressure, position, heat, cold, itch, and pain. It has long been recognized that different afferents are specific for distinct modalities, {{but it has not}} been clear if afferent sensitivities represent a continuum or unique populations of afferents with common properties. I found that mouse dorsal root ganglion afferents can be clearly divided into groups by their transcriptional expression and that these groups share common modality sensitivities and functional properties. Further investigation revealed that the levels of some individual transduction channels may be an even more accurate way to track modality sensitivity, giving a potential molecular signature for function in murine afferents. These findings imply that recognized histological projection bands in the spinal cord (Substance P, CGRP, IB 4, etc.) reflect subpopulations of afferents with unique properties that are projecting to unique areas of the spinal cord. This is relevant to sensory coding models, but may also be very important for the development of neuropathic pain after nerve injury. Nerve injury and regeneration alters mRNA and protein expression, and causes parallel changes in afferent properties. These functional changes in afferents could cause unusual activity in corresponding spinal cord circuits (e. g. a spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuit</b> that is normally mechanically insensitive would receive mechanical input). I investigated this possibility and discovered population-specific regulation of transcripts. This included a mechanotransducer, Piezo 2, which is upregulated in the small peptidergic subpopulation. Subsequent knockdown using Piezo 2 siRNA reduced the number of mechanically sensitive afferents. These findings suggest that Piezo 2 is necessary for mechanotransduction in injured afferents and could be responsible for induced neuropathic pain...|$|E

This finding suggests a hyper-excitable stretch reflex in the affected forelimb. We then performed immunohistochemical and western blot analyses to examine the expression of the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC 2) and phosphorylation of the KCC 2 serine residue, 940 (S 940), since this is the main chloride extruder that affects neuronal excitability. We also performed immunohistochemical analyses on the number of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT 1) -positive boutons to count the number of Ia afferent fibers that connect to motoneurons. Western bolts revealed that, compared with sham mice, experimental mice had significantly reduced KCC 2 expression at 7 d post-stroke, and dephosphorylated S 940 at 3 and 7 d post-stroke in motoneuron plasma membranes. We also observed a lower density of KCC 2 -positive areas in the plasma membrane of motoneurons at 3 and 7 d post-stroke. However, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that there were no differences between groups 21 and 42 d post-stroke, respectively. In addition, at 7 and 42 d post-stroke, experimental mice exhibited a significant increase in vGluT 1 boutons compared with sham mice.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) leads to {{permanent}} motor and sensory deficits {{due to the}} damage of ascending and descending fiber tracts. In addition, malfunctions such as neuropathic pain or muscle spasms develop in many patients, possibly caused by injury-induced plastic changes of neuronal circuits {{above and below the}} lesion. New treatment strategies for spinal cord injury aim at enhancing plasticity and neurite growth, for example, by blocking the key neurite growth inhibitor Nogo-A or its downstream effectors. It is therefore crucial to investigate potential effects of such treatments on malfunctions such as muscle spasms. In addition, locomotor training, now a standard therapeutic tool to improve walking ability in incomplete SCI subjects, can be expected to influence the rearrangement of spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits</b> and the development of muscle spasms and other malfunctions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we present and validate a new rat model for muscle spasms after incomplete SCI and show that both intrathecal anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment and locomotor training, started early after injury, permanently reduce the development of muscle spasms. INTERPRETATION: The results show that an antibody-mediated suppression of the growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A leads to functional recovery and a lower level of malfunctions, suggesting the formation of functionally meaningful connections in the damaged spinal cord.

40|$|Assigning {{function}} to genes {{is essential for}} {{a better understanding of}} biological systems. To date, approximately half of the genes in the vertebrate genome have known function. Domestic animals are a rich source for trait mapping and in this thesis we have mapped three distinct equine phenotypes. The result provides increased knowledge regarding gene function and importantly, practical implications for horse welfare. In paper I and IV, we confirm that Equine Multiple Congenital Ocular Anomalies (MCOA) syndrome is inherited as an incompletely dominant trait (p= 2. 2 x 10 - 16). By first identifying a 208 kb identity-by decent (IBD) region and subsequently excluding polymorphic sites identified through Illumina sequencing, we conclude that the gene PMEL causes these defects in horse. Our findings, together with functional analyses recently published, support that the cause of MCOA syndrome is a missense mutation (Arg 625 Cys) near the transmembrane region of PMEL that results in altered biochemical properties. In paper II we show that variants in the MHC-II region influence the susceptibility to equine Insect Bite Hypersensitivity with the same marker risk allele identified in two distinct populations, OR 4. 19 (p= 2. 3 x 10 - 5) and 1. 48 (p= 0. 04) for Icelandic horses and Exmoor ponies respectively. In addition, homozygosity across the MHC-II region confers a higher risk of developing disease, OR= 2. 67 (p= 1. 3 x 10 - 3). Finally, in paper III we utilize the EquineSNP 50 BeadChip to identify the first Gait locus in horse. A highly significant SNP (EMP 2 = 2. 0 x 10 - 4) was identified to be consistent with a recessive mode of inheritance for the lateral gait pace in Icelandic horses, and confirmed in an independent sample set (p= 2. 4 x 10 - 14). Illumina sequencing of an established IBD region identified a nonsense mutation in the gene DMRT 3. A clearly dichotomous distribution in a panel of gaited and non-gaited breeds revealed that the DMRT 3 mutation is permissive for a variety of alternate gaits. The mutation also has a favorable effect in harness racing horses. Functional characterization of the truncated protein demonstrated correct localization and an intact DNA binding profile. mRNA expression in a small population of commissural neurons from the spinal cord was confirmed in mutant and wild type horses. Further, a DMRT 3 null mouse displayed a change in spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuit</b> signaling and locomotion. These findings reveal a new molecule involved in the regulation of limb movement...|$|E

However, the presence of glutamatergic neurochemical markers in spinal neurons has not been investigated. In this study, we report for the first time the expression of a vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) in the spinal cord of the sea lamprey. We also study the distribution of glutamate in perikarya and fibers. The largest glutamatergic neurons found were the dorsal cells and caudal giant cells. Two additional VGLUT-positive gray matter populations, one dorsomedial consisting of small cells and another one lateral consisting of small and large cells were observed. Some cerebrospinal fluid-contacting cells also expressed VGLUT. In the white matter, some edge cells and some cells associated with giant axons (Müller and Mauthner axons) and the dorsolateral funiculus expressed VGLUT. Large lateral cells and the cells associated with reticulospinal axons are in a key position to receive descending inputs involved in the control of locomotion.

Our objectives were 1) to establish the decerebrate cat as an appropriate model for further research into the sensory mechanisms of postural control and 2) to observe what elements of the postural response can be generated by the brain stem and spinal cord. Ten animals were decerebrated using a modified premammillary technique, which consists of a premammillary decerebration that is modified with a vertical transection near the subthalamic nucleus to eliminate spontaneous locomotion. Horizontal support surface perturbations were applied to all four limbs and electromyographic recordings were collected from 14 muscles of the right hindlimb. Muscle activation was quantified with tuning curves, which compared increases and decreases in muscle activity to background and graphed the difference against perturbation direction. Parallels were drawn between these tuning curves, which were further quantified with a principal direction and breadth (range of directions of muscle activation), and data collected by other researchers from the intact animal. We found a strong similarity in the direction and breadth of the tuning curves generated in the decerebrate and intact cat.

Until now no spinal cord slice culture model for the study of axonal growth has been available. Here we present a spinal cord slice culture model that is well suited for the study of axonal growth. The spinal cord slices were cut not in the transverse but in the sagittal longitudinal plane such that several spinal cord segments were included in the slice culture. In these cultures the typical ventro-dorsal polarity of the spinal cord was maintained and intrinsic spinal cord axons formed a strong fibre tract extending along the longitudinal axis of the slice. The axons became myelinated during the culture period and synaptic contacts were present in these cultures. After mechanical lesions the intrinsic spinal cord axons had a substantial potential for axonal growth and regeneration. The number of regenerating axons crossing the lesion site decreased with increasing maturation of the culture, but even in mature cultures a small number of crossing fibres were present. This slice culture model could provide an important tool for several aspects of spinal cord research in the fields of axonal growth and regeneration, synapse formation, formation of intrinsic spinal <b>cord</b> <b>circuits</b> and myelination...|$|R
40|$|Chick lumbosacral motoneurones {{were caused}} to {{innervate}} foreign muscles by surgically rotating or shifting the limb bud about the anterior-posterior axis in stage 17 - 18 embryos. The activation pattern of such wrongly projecting motoneurones was assessed at stages 35 - 38 by recording electromyographic activity from muscles {{in an isolated}} spinal cord/hind limb preparation. Muscle activity was classed as flexor- or extensor-like according to {{the characteristics of the}} patterned sequence of bursts elicited by a single shock to the thoracic cord. Wrongly projecting motoneurones did not have their activation pattern altered to one appropriate for the muscle innervated; therefore in some cases a particular muscle was activated with a pattern similar to its original one, and in other cases in an opposite manner. Mixed flexor-extensor-like activation of a single muscle was, however, rare. The identity of motoneurones projecting to a muscle was determined by their cord location following retrograde labelling with horseradish peroxidase. This allowed us to conclude that motoneurones could develop their normal pattern of activation even when projecting to foreign muscles. It is concluded that the <b>cord</b> <b>circuits</b> (presumably composed of local interneurones responsible for the activation of motoneurones in the isolated cord preparation are not altered by retrograde influences from the muscle. Wrongly projecting motoneurones, which were maintained throughout the normal cell death period, were activated during spontaneous embryonic movements, and in many cases were found to have a behaviourally inappropriate activation pattern. These observations are discussed in relation to proposed mechanisms by which developmental errors in connectivity are corrected...|$|R
