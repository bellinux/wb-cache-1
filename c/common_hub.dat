40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that sentences are comprehended via widespread brain regions in the fronto-temporo-parietal network in explicit language tasks (e. g., semantic congruency judgment tasks), and through restricted temporal or frontal regions in implicit language tasks (e. g., font size judgment tasks). This discrepancy has raised questions regarding a common network for sentence comprehension that acts regardless of task effect and whether different tasks modulate network properties. To this end, we constructed brain functional networks based on 27 subjects' fMRI data that was collected while performing explicit and implicit language tasks. We found that network properties and network hubs corresponding to the implicit language task were similar to those associated with the explicit language task. We also found <b>common</b> <b>hubs</b> in occipital, temporal and frontal regions in both tasks. Compared with the implicit language task, the explicit language task resulted in greater global efficiency and increased integrated betweenness centrality of the left inferior frontal gyrus, which is a key region related to sentence comprehension. These results suggest that brain functional networks support both explicit and implicit sentence comprehension; in addition, these two types of language tasks may modulate the properties of brain functional networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Practically {{all major}} {{metropolitan}} and large scale modern intelligent transportation systems have a centralized traffic management center (TMC) at their logical and functional core. The TMC provides control, coordinates system wide communications, and typically {{serves as a}} <b>common</b> <b>hub</b> from which multiple agencies plan and execute coordinated incident responses. Early {{in the development of}} the Oklahoma statewide ITS, it became clear that the costs associated with building and operating a large, centralized TMC would be prohibitive. An alternative design strategy emerged built around a distributed peer-to-peer network of low-cost ITS consoles based on desktop PC’s equipped with innovative software and special hardware to support efficiently handling multiple video streams simultaneously. This has led to a geographically distributed, fault-tolerant communications and control system where the desirable functionality of a large centralized TMC is realized by a virtual TMC that enables the stakeholder agencies to remain physical located in their current facilities around the State. In this paper, we provide an overview of the system architecture as it has evolved through the first quarter of 2009 and highlight some of the recently developed system enhancements. I...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{amount of}} inosine monophosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (IMPDH), a pivotal enzyme for the biosynthesis of the guanosine tri-phosphate (GTP), is frequently increased in tumor cells. The anti-viral agent ribavirin and the immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA) are potent inhibitors of IMPDH. We recently showed that IMPDH inhibition {{led to a}} necrotic signal requiring the activation of Cdc 42. Methodology/Principal Findings: Herein, we strengthened the essential role played by this small GTPase in the necrotic signal by silencing Cdc 42 and by the ectopic expression of a constitutive active mutant of Cdc 42. Since resistance to apoptosis is an essential step for the tumorigenesis process, we next examined {{the effect of the}} MPA–mediated necrotic signal on different tumor cells demonstrating various mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis (Bcl 2 -, HSP 70 -, Lyn-, BCR-ABL–overexpressing cells). All tested cells remained sensitive to MPA–mediated necrotic signal. Furthermore, inhibition of IMPDH activity in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cells was significantly more efficient at eliminating malignant cells than apoptotic inducers. Conclusions/Significance: These findings indicate that necrosis and apoptosis are split signals that share few if any <b>common</b> <b>hub</b> of signaling. In addition, the necrotic signaling pathway induced by depletion of the cellular amount of GTP...|$|E

To reduce transmission losses caused by the highly dynamic nature of the wireless channel around the human body, we explore variable TDMA scheduling techniques that allow the order of transmissions within each TDMA round to be decided on the fly, rather than being fixed in advance. Using a simple Markov model of the wireless links, we devise a number of scheduling algorithms that can be performed by the hub, which aim to maximize the expected number of successful transmissions in a TDMA round, and thereby significantly reduce transmission losses as compared with a static TDMA schedule. Importantly, these algorithms do not require a priori knowledge of the statistical properties of the wireless channels, and the reliability improvement is achieved entirely via shuffling the order of transmissions among devices, and does not involve any additional energy consumption (e. g., retransmissions). We evaluate these algorithms directly on an experimental set of traces obtained from devices strapped to human subjects performing regular daily activities, and confirm that the benefits of the proposed variable scheduling algorithms extend to this practical setup as well...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a typical body area network (BAN) {{setting in which}} sensor nodes send data to a <b>common</b> <b>hub</b> regularly on a TDMA basis, {{as defined by the}} emerging IEEE 802. 15. 6 BAN standard. We explore variable TDMA scheduling techniques that allow the order of transmissions within each TDMA round to be decided on the fly, rather than be fixed in advance. Our approach is related to opportunistic scheduling used in other multiuser wireless systems, which aims to maximize the system throughput by allocating transmission opportunities to users with the ‘best ’ instantaneous channel. However, the energy overheads of opportunistic scheduling, which requires the continuous reporting of channel states to the scheduler, make it incompatible with body area networks where nodes turn their radio off (‘sleep’) until it is their turn to transmit, as an energy-saving measure. Accordingly, we consider variable TDMA scheduling strategies that decide on the transmission order at the start of each TDMA round based on the last known channel state of each sensor. We formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the expected throughput (or, equivalently, minimizing the expected loss rate) based on a Markov model of the wireless channel, and present some simple approximate heuristics that can be computed quickly yet perform well in practice. We evaluate the performance of these strategies and heuristics numerically {{in a wide range of}} scenarios, and demonstrate the marked improvement they achieve over a fixed TDMA allocation. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models corresponding to a single set of variables under several distinct conditions. This problem is motivated by the task of recovering transcriptional regulatory networks {{on the basis of}} gene expression data {containing heterogeneous samples, such as different disease states, multiple species, or different developmental stages}. We assume that most aspects of the conditional dependence networks are shared, but that there are some structured differences between them. Rather than assuming that similarities and differences between networks are driven by individual edges, we take a node-based approach, which in many cases provides a more intuitive interpretation of the network differences. We consider estimation under two distinct assumptions: (1) differences between the K networks are due to individual nodes that are perturbed across conditions, or (2) similarities among the K networks are due to the presence of <b>common</b> <b>hub</b> nodes that are shared across all K networks. Using a row-column overlap norm penalty function, we formulate two convex optimization problems that correspond to these two assumptions. We solve these problems using an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, and we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that allows us to decompose the problem into independent subproblems so that our algorithm can be scaled to high-dimensional settings. Our proposal is illustrated on synthetic data, a webpage data set, and a brain cancer gene expression data set. Comment: 42 pages, 16 figures. Accepted to JMLR, 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a body area network (BAN) {{setting in which}} sensor nodes send data to a <b>common</b> <b>hub</b> regularly on a TDMA basis, {{as defined by the}} emerging IEEE 802. 15. 6 BAN standard. Our previous work has established the benefits of variable TDMA scheduling in this setting, where the order of communication with nodes in each TDMA round is determined on the fly by the hub, based on the actual outcomes (success or failure) of their recent transmissions. This technique takes into account the very slow fading nature of wireless channels in BANs, and can minimize the expected rate of transmission losses merely by ordering nodes according to their most recent channel state information, without any additional energy overhead. In this paper, we focus on an extended TDMA setting where the length of each TDMA round is greater than the number of nodes, i. e. a number of ‘spare ’ slots are reserved for retransmissions of lost packets. We consider delay-constrained data transmissions based on a Markov model of the wireless channels. We evaluate several variable scheduling strategies in terms of the trade-off between the energy consumption due to the additional retransmissions and the reduction of the loss rate. We show how the best strategy depends on the energy budget of the sensor nodes, and demonstrate the considerable reduction in the loss rate (up to 18 %) that can be achieved over a naı̈ve approach where static TDMA scheduling is combined with retransmission slots {{at the end of the}} round.
