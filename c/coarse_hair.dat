25|$|According to the American Academy of Dermatology, {{the most}} common types of moles are skin tags, raised moles and flat moles. Benign moles are usually brown, tan, pink or black (especially on dark-colored skin). They are {{circular}} or oval and are usually small (commonly between 1–3mm), though some can be larger than {{the size of a}} typical pencil eraser (>5mm). Some moles produce dark, <b>coarse</b> <b>hair.</b> Common mole hair removal procedures include plucking, cosmetic waxing, electrolysis, threading and cauterization.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{thinking}} {{it to be}} related to the South American sloths, Shaw and Nodder in 1791 called the species Bradypus ursinus, noting that it was bear-like, but giving weight to the long claws and the absence of upper middle incisors. Meyer (1793) identified it as a bear and called it Melursus lybius, and in 1817, de Blainville called it Ursus labiatus because of the long lips. Iliger called it Prochilus hirsutus, the Greek genus name indicating long lips, while the specific name noted its long and <b>coarse</b> <b>hair.</b> Fischer called it Chondrorhynchus hirsutus, while Tiedemann called it Ursus longirostris.|$|E

25|$|The coarse outer fibers {{have been}} {{traditionally}} used by nomads to make ropes and tents. In earlier times, the <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> was mixed with down hair {{to make the}} weaving denser. However, the current increasing demand for the down fiber from the international market means that the fine fiber is mostly sold. The rarity of the white hair implicates that ropes made out of white and black Yarn is admired for its appearance and uniqueness. In west Sichuan, China, 34% of the animal fiber comes from yak hair alone. In Bhutan, the long hair is used for weaving tents, bags, rugs and slings, whereas in Mongolia it is used for clothing tents and bags. To obtain the optimal length, nomads comb the hair and then spin it into yarn. During this process, the loom determines {{the width of the}} tent squares and the length of the tent. The tent squares are then sewn tightly together by men.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s, {{the breed}} {{began to be}} revived through {{increased}} public interest. Breed societies have been established in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, and in 1996 the first World Shire Horse Congress was held in Peterborough. The first use within the breed of artificial insemination through frozen semen was with several Australian mares in 1997. Between the 1920s and 1930s and today, the Shire has changed in conformation. The Clydesdale was used for cross-breeding in the 1950s and 1960s, which changed the conformation of the Shire and most notably changed the feathering on the lower legs from a mass of <b>coarse</b> <b>hair</b> into the silky feathering associated with modern Shires. At the peak of their population, Shires numbered [...] over a million. In the 1950s and 1960s, this number declined to a few thousand.

500|$|Icelandic horses weigh between [...] {{and stand}} {{an average of}} [...] high, which is often {{considered}} pony size, but breeders and breed registries always refer to Icelandics as horses. Several theories have been put forward as to why Icelandics are always called horses, among them the breed's spirited temperament and large personality. Another theory suggests that the breed's weight, bone structure and weight-carrying abilities mean it can be classified as a horse, rather than a pony. The breed comes in many coat colors, including chestnut, dun, bay, black, gray, palomino, pinto and roan. There are over 100names for various colors and color patterns in the Icelandic language. [...] They have well-proportioned heads, with straight profiles and wide foreheads. The neck is short, muscular, and broad at the base; the withers broad and low; the chest deep; the shoulders muscular and slightly sloping; the back long; the croup broad, muscular, short and slightly sloping.

Polynesians lack characteristic Mongoloid shovel-shaped incisors, because this characteristic Mongoloid trait disappeared in the Polynesian population as the teeth of Polynesians reduced in size over the course of their evolutionary history.|$|E

It can also be {{physically}} distinguished from a baboon by the bright patch of skin on its chest. This patch is hourglass-shaped.
