60|$|Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway {{and square}} hat above large slops <b>crossed</b> the <b>quay</b> in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, {{scratching}} actively behind his coattails.|$|R
25|$|On 7 July 1932, {{there was}} a {{collision}} between a car and a train on an ungated level <b>crossing</b> between St. <b>Quay</b> and Portrieux. Two people were killed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s work began {{on a new}} station which has been built on <b>Cross</b> Wall <b>Quay.</b> The {{construction}} work was completed in 2000 and the service from the station began in August 2001. The current lifeboat is a Severn-class lifeboat called City of London (ON 1220) [...] which has been on station since 1997 and is the seventeenth lifeboat to be stationed at Dover.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 the Dover station began {{operations}} again. This {{time they}} once again were re-located {{to what had}} been used as the Motor Torpedo Boat pens in the East Docks area. The rapid expansion of the Dover ferry terminal in the 1980s saw the lifeboat station moved again. The station was to be located to the Tug Haven situated in the inner harbour across from the <b>Cross</b> Wall <b>Quay.</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 2014, a major southward {{expansion}} of the PATH network brought it closer to the Toronto waterfront, {{with the opening of}} a covered pedestrian bridge connecting Air Canada Centre south to WaterPark Place on Queens <b>Quay</b> (<b>crossing</b> the Lake Shore Boulevard/Gardiner Expressway corridor and Harbour Street).|$|R
50|$|At {{the east}} end of the station is a signal box with an {{adjacent}} level crossing where the road from Kidwelly to the old <b>quay</b> <b>crosses</b> the railway line. The west end of the station ends with a bridge over the river. A World War II pillbox remains intact just before the bridge.|$|R
50|$|South Steyne was {{the largest}} ferry to operate on Sydney Harbour. As a Manly ferry from 1938, she <b>crossed</b> between Circular <b>Quay</b> and Manly over 100,000 times over her 36 years, {{carrying}} well in excess of 92 million passengers. On Sundays, from 1953 until 1973, she gave short ocean cruises to Broken Bay.|$|R
25|$|London Buses route ELC New Cross Gate – New <b>Cross</b> – Surrey <b>Quays</b> – Canada Water (Monday-Friday every 5–10 minutes, {{weekends}} every 15 minutes) {{started on}} 23 December 2007. It was withdrawn on 25 September 2009 following a 40% drop in passenger numbers. Transport for London estimated that this saved around £1million {{over the period}} to June 2010.|$|R
5000|$|The Dutchflyer service lets {{passengers}} {{travel from}} any UK railway station served by Abellio Greater Anglia to [...] (formerly Parkeston <b>Quay),</b> <b>cross</b> the North Sea by Stena Line ferry, and continue, after arrival at [...] to any {{station in the}} Netherlands (or in the reverse direction). Trains to and from London and [...] are timed to meet the ferry.|$|R
5000|$|The line southwards to the <b>Quay</b> <b>crossed</b> Polperro Road (i.e. {{the road}} on Looe Bridge) on the level; it {{extended}} {{as far as the}} site of the present Buller Street. It was named Buller Quay after J F Buller, a prominent local landowner who [...] "arranged the funding for the quay construction from various sources". The harbour lines were closed in 1954.|$|R
50|$|The {{town has}} a public library located on King Street. Within the {{triangle}} of Station Avenue, Station Road and Quay Road are the Town Hall, Magistrates Court {{and several other}} government buildings. On South Marine Drive there is an RNLI Life Boat Station. There has been a Life Boat in the town since 1805 and is manned entirely by volunteers. Close to the junction of the A165 with the A614 is the Hospital and Ambulance Station and {{on the opposite side}} closer to the town centre is the Fire Station established in 1960 with a mix of full-time and on call crew. There is a Post Office & Depot located not far from the level <b>crossing</b> on <b>Quay</b> Road.|$|R
5000|$|The Port of Liverpool {{is one of}} Northern Europe's largest {{container}} {{ports and}} principal ports for trade with the United States and Canada. The port handles over 33 million tonnes of freight cargo per year and serves more than 100 global destinations including Africa, Australia, China, India, the Middle East and South America. Imports of grain and animal feed and exports of scrap metal for recycling are greater than any other UK port, and traffic <b>crossing</b> the <b>quays</b> includes timber, steel, coal, cocoa, crude oil, edible oils and liquid chemicals. [...] Major investment, including a second container terminal dubbed ‘Liverpool 2' at Seaforth, will be designed to handle the largest Post-Panamax vessels and will double the port's capacity.|$|R
500|$|Queens Dock {{was opened}} in August 1877 as a [...] dock for {{exporting}} goods from {{the centre of}} Glasgow. A [...] steam crane was constructed west of the current one in the 1890s, until it was demolished {{to make way for}} a proposed bridge <b>crossing</b> between Finnieston <b>Quay</b> and Mavisbank Quay that was never built. The present crane, constructed as a replacement, was the last giant cantilever crane to be built on the Clyde.|$|R
50|$|The District of Tendring wards of Alresford, Ardleigh and Little Bromley, Bradfield, Wrabness and Wix, Brightlingsea, Great and Little Oakley, Great Bentley, Harwich East, Harwick East Central, Harwich West, Harwich West Central, Lawford, Manningtree, Mistley, Little Bentley and Tendring, Ramsey and Parkeston, and Thorrington, Frating, Elmstead and Great Bromley, and the Borough of Colchester wards of Dedham and Langham, East Donyland, Fordham and Stour, Great Tey, Pyefleet, West Bergholt and Eight Ash Green, West Mersea, Wivenhoe <b>Cross,</b> and Wivenhoe <b>Quay.</b>|$|R
50|$|Provision {{for a major}} {{water pipe}} never eventuated, and the closer spacing of {{stringers}} in the centre to support a tramway was not utilised. The decorative towers were intended to support overhead cables for the proposed tramway. The bridge originally <b>crossed</b> the North <b>Quay</b> underpass on two continuous, reinforced-concrete girder spans, each 33 ft with girders of variable depth. These have since been replaced by precast, prestressed concrete deck units above Coronation Drive, which links onto the Riverside Expressway, {{and in the process}} the footpath widths have been reduced.|$|R
50|$|A {{provisional}} committee met on 26 March 1825 and unanimously recommended {{proceeding with}} the railway option, and about £20,000 in share subscriptions were taken that evening. A prospectus and public invitation to subscribe was published on 28 March The {{first meeting of}} the provisional Newcastle upon Tyne and Carlisle Rail-Road Company met on 9 April 1825; James Losh was elected chairman. A route was published on 12 November 1825. It ran from Carlisle to Newcastle <b>quay,</b> <b>crossing</b> over to {{the north side of}} the River Tyne at Scotswood and running on the north bank to Newcastle.|$|R
50|$|The route {{begins in}} the Maritime Quarter near the Swansea Bay barrage. It runs {{alongside}} the Tawe west bank past the Sainsbury's store where cyclists have to cross via a pedestrian <b>crossing</b> at the <b>Quay</b> Parade bridge. Once across the road, the route turns right over the Quay Parade bridge. Once over the bridge, there is an immediate left turn into a dedicated path which follows {{the west bank of}} the River Tawe as far as the Pentre-Chwyth traffic junction, in the White Rock area. To the left of this path the Hafod copper works are visible.|$|R
50|$|By 1972, Lymington was {{too small}} for her owners' needs. Arrival of new ferries led to her being {{withdrawn}} and placed on the sale list. She was bought by Western Ferries for their new <b>crossing</b> from Hunter's <b>Quay</b> to McInroy's Point. Returning to the Clyde, she was modified to suit her new owner's needs and renamed Sound of Sanda. She served Western Ferries faithfully from late August 1974 until 1989, latterly being relegated to carrying cement tankers to Faslane while the new Trident submarine base was under construction. She had served Western Ferries well - but {{no longer had a}} viable role in the fleet due to her age and small capacity.|$|R
5000|$|In 1899 {{construction}} works commenced on the westward {{extension of the}} North Cornwall Line towards Padstow via the salt marsh and the tidal Camel estuary to the port of Padstow. In order to accommodate the extra traffic anticipated, an island platform 105 yd in length was added between the existing platform and the engine shed, both sides of which were in use as platforms 2 and 3; the original platform being Platform 1. Access to this new island platform was gained by a wooden lattice footbridge situated towards the Down (Padstow) end of the station. A waiting room and a generous canopy were also installed. The works also involved considerable re-arrangement of the track layout and signalling, with the original goods connection over Molesworth Street, using the existing level <b>crossing,</b> to the <b>quay</b> being upgraded to a passenger line. The original signalbox was closed and replaced by two new signalboxes, [...] "Wadebridge East" [...] and [...] "Wadebridge West". The first passenger train to use this stretch ran on 27 March 1899.|$|R
50|$|Completion of the harbour barrier proved difficult, {{partly due}} to damage by storms, and a further Act had to be secured for an {{extension}} of time. This Act also permitted the company to operate steam vessels between Brading Harbour and mainland ports. By June 1881 the BHIR was {{in the hands of}} a Receiver. That month a Sunday School excursion train took local children to Ryde; a temporary platform was erected. Now in serious financial difficulties, the BHIR gave notice that its goods service between St Helens and Brading would be discontinued; whether the IoWR immediately took over working the goods trains in 1881 is not clear. In an agreement of 28 February 1882 the Brading company and the IoWR arranged that the latter would work the line as part of its system for 50% of gross receipts. The IoWR used two BHIR locomotives, named St Helens and Bembridge, but provided rolling stock, station and maintenance staff itself. On 25 May 1882 Colonel Yolland inspected BHIR line, as well as the enlarged IoWR junction station at Brading and the IoWR goods branch to Brading Quay. Except for some attention to fencing, he found the BHIR line in good condition for the opening to passenger trains; there were stations at St Helens and Bembridge. The IoWR line was 43 chains in length; Brading station had been altered to provide a bay platform for the branch and a run-round loop; there was a level <b>crossing</b> near Brading <b>Quay.</b> The railway opened to passenger traffic on 27 May 1882. Because of lack of space at Bembridge station a sector plate was installed to give access to the run-round loop. It was of 16 ft 5in length, but in 1936 it was replaced by a 25 ft turntable, for the introduction of the larger O2 class engines.|$|R
50|$|Situated between Four <b>Crosses</b> and Pool <b>Quay,</b> the Halt {{came under}} the control of the Station Master at Four Crosses. Arddleen Halt was 154 ft in length and was sited on the up side of the single running line. The {{platform}} was constructed of fabricated stone block, in-filled and laid with a tarmac surface.Access to the halt was from a small lane that ran parallel to the towpath of the Montgomeryshire Canal and the railway.A stone built house stood adjacent to the railway and was called Station House, but with no railway architectural features it bore no original connection to the railway; instead it was connected with the canal which was opened in 1821, having been authorised as early as 1794.The house was however used as family accommodation for railway personnel from the opening of the railway until its closure in 1965. It is known that until the early part of the 20th century there was a Station Master resident in the house.Under the GWR Directive 'Halts Where Staff are Not Employed', it was the responsibility of the Station Master at Four Crosses in later years to visit the halts which were under his supervision to see that the premises were in proper condition and that notice boards, gates, lamps and shelters etc. were properly looked after.In later years there were very few scheduled stops at Arddleen, although request stops were generally possible. There was almost an hourly service between Welshpool and Oswestry but only one or two of these trains were timetabled to stop at Arddleen. Some trains only stopped on a few specific days of the week.Arddleen Station (Halt) was closed to passengers on 18 January 1965 by the British Railways Board as part of the closure of the section from Oswestry to Buttington Junction.|$|R
