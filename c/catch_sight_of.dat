5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they <b>catch</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.|$|E

25|$|In 1860, Livingstone {{returned}} to the area and made a detailed study of the falls with John Kirk. Other early European visitors included Portuguese explorer Serpa Pinto, Czech explorer Emil Holub, who made the first detailed plan of the falls and its surroundings in 1875 (published in 1880), and British artist Thomas Baines, who executed {{some of the earliest}} paintings of the falls. Until the area was opened up by the building of the railway in 1905, though, the falls were seldom visited by other Europeans. Some writers believe that the Portuguese priest Gonçalo da Silveira was the first European to <b>catch</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the falls back in the sixteenth century.|$|E
25|$|At {{the opening}} of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking {{directly}} to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart, and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet Mozart in person, during a salon at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does <b>catch</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart himself lacks the grace and charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.|$|E
2500|$|The siting of the {{homestead}} on its flood-free position enabled {{management of the}} land from then onwards. Early writers commented on {{the homestead}}'s siting {{and the beauty of}} its setting. It was [...] "very prettily situated on a hill overlooking a grassy margined lake of considerable size, surrounded by high hills, and when you first <b>catch</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> it, you naturally say, 'well, this takes a lot of beating'. And so it does, for beauty of landscape". A second wrote, [...] "This well-known station home...is beautifully situated on a rise overlooking the Herbert, just before that river takes its plunge down the scrub-clad gullies {{to the level of the}} coast".|$|E

2500|$|Dol Guldur (...) (Sindarin: [...] "Hill of Sorcery") was Sauron's stronghold in Mirkwood in {{the fictional}} world of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. [...] It is first {{mentioned}} (as [...] "the dungeons of the Necromancer") in The Hobbit. [...] The hill itself, rocky and barren, was the highest point in the southwestern part of the forest. [...] Before Sauron's occupation it was called Amon Lanc [...] "Naked Hill". [...] It lay near {{the western edge of}} the forest, across the Anduin from Lothlórien. [...] In a passage that appears to apply the name Dol Guldur principally to the fortress rather than the barren hill it rose from, the company of the Ring first <b>catch</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> it from Cerin Amroth in Lórien.|$|E
2500|$|Caragiale arguably won as much acclaim for his {{rigorous}} {{approach to}} playwriting {{as for his}} accomplished style. With Alexandru Vlahuţă, George Coşbuc and others, he belonged to {{the first generation of}} Romanian authors to take a noted interest in imposing professionalism. He was specific about this requirement—on one occasion, he used sarcasm to overturn a common misconception, saying: [...] "Literature is an art that needs not be learned; whoever knows how to turn letters into syllables and the latter into words has had sufficient preparation to engage in literature." [...] Commenting on this, Vianu stressed: [...] " [...] even under the appearance of ease, [...] lets us <b>catch</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the severe law of his art" [...] (adding elsewhere that [...] " [...] was a scrupulous and tormented artist").|$|E
2500|$|Following this success, {{she acted}} in several revivals and classics, and many French writers offered her new plays. In 1887, she {{acted in a}} stage version of the {{controversial}} drama Thérèse Raquin by Emile Zola. Zola had previously been attacked due to the book's confronting content. Asked why she chose this play, she declared to reporters, [...] "My true country is the free air, and my vocation is art without constraints." [...] The play was unsuccessful; it ran for just 38 performances. She then performed another traditional melodrama, Francillon by Alexandre Dumas, fils in 1888. A short drama she wrote herself, L'Aveu, disappointed both critics and the audience and lasted only 12 performances. She had considerably more success with Jeanne d'Arc by the poet Jules Barbier, in which the 45-year-old actress played Joan of Arc, a 19-year-old martyr. Barbier had previously written the librettos {{for some of the}} most famous French operas of the period, including Faust by Charles Gounod and The Tales of Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach. Her next success was another melodrama by Sardou, Cleopatra, which allowed her to wear elaborate costumes and finished with a memorable death scene. For this scene, she kept two live garter snakes, which played the role of the poisonous asp which bites Cleopatra. For realism, she painted the palms of her hands red, though they could hardly be seen from the audience. [...] "I shall see them," [...] she explained. [...] "If I <b>catch</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> my hand, it will be the hand of Cleopatra." ...|$|E
