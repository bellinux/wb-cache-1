5000|$|Since the {{inception}} of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, shoppers from the Republic of Ireland have increasingly been crossing the border to Newry to buy cheaper goods due to the difference in currency. This owes to a combination of factors: the harsh budget in the Republic of Ireland in October 2008; the growing strength of the euro against the pound sterling and VAT reductions in the United Kingdom, compared with increases in the Republic of Ireland. This remarkable increase in cross-border trade has become so widespread that it has lent its name to a general phenomenon known as the Newry effect. In December 2008, The New York Times described Newry as [...] "the hottest shopping spot within the European Union's open borders, a place where consumers armed with euros enjoy a <b>currency</b> <b>discount</b> averaging 30 percent or more".|$|E

40|$|Well-known {{empirical}} puzzles {{in international}} macroeconomics concern the large {{divergence of equilibrium}} outcomes for consumption across countries from the predictions of models with full risk sharing. It is commonly believed that these risk-sharing puzzles are related to another empirical puzzle-the home-bias in equity puzzle. However, we show {{in a series of}} dynamic models that the full risk sharing equilibrium may not require much diversification of equity portfolios when there is price stickiness of the degree typically calibrated in macroeconomic models. This conclusion holds under a range of assumptions about home bias in preferences, price setting as PCP or LCP, and with or without nominal wage stickiness {{as long as there is}} some price rigidity.

" since such action {{was thought to be}} welfare improving during times of high currency demand. This paper considers the welfare implications of an "elastic currency" regime within the context of an overlapping generations model of fiat money that includes banks that face aggregate risk. Although in the economy's stationary equilibrium the bank chooses to hold both fiat currency and illiquid capital in its portfolio, it would prefer to hold additional amounts of currency (were they available) during periods of high withdrawal demand. To remedy this problem, a central bank is introduced that offers zero-interest, intraperiod loans of <b>currency</b> via a <b>discount</b> window. When the central bank optimally chooses the size of the loan, it is shown that the resulting stationary equilibrium supports the economy's "golden rule" allocation. ...|$|R

The new coinage went into general circulation on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and the coins (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to mean that they were accepted, or that Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good) was in operation.

30|$|Following Winther and Achtenhagen (2008, p. 100), {{based on}} a {{systemic}} understanding of operational sub-processes and their reconstruction from real company data in real professional situations, commercial competence {{is defined as the}} ability to make business decisions and to validate them. From a theoretical and instructive perspective, one can distinguish between domain-linked (dl) and domain-specific (ds) facets of commercial competence, as proposed by Gelman and Greeno (1989). The domain-linked category refers to the notion of key vocational abilities, such as knowledge that is general but also relevant for solving vocational or professional problems. Domain-linked content is related to the general skills (mostly linguistic and mathematical) that are relevant in (commercial) occupational practice (Klotz et al. 2015); it differs from the content of the general education sector in its emphasis on professional relevance to economic areas. By way of an example, we might cite the understanding or reading of simple mathematical algorithms (e.g., the rule of three to calculate <b>currency</b> conversions or <b>discounts).</b> Domain-specific content includes specific sets of rules and a practical knowledge of a professional community, exclusively in commercial professions (Klotz and Winther 2016; Oates 2004; Winther et al. 2016 a).|$|R

50|$|More importantly, its {{unrivalled}} {{ability to}} run current account deficits through the issuance of its unquestioned <b>currency</b> and its <b>discount</b> rate endowed Britain with a special privilege. The effects of the discount rate had a “controlling influence on Britain’s balance of payments regardless of what other central banks were doing” (Cleveland, 1976, p. 17). When other central banks engaged in a tug of war over international capital flows, “the Bank of England could tug the hardest” (Eichengreen, 1985, p. 6). In this regard, British monetary hegemony was seldom threatened by crises of convertibility for its gold reserves were insulated by the discount rate and all foreign rates followed the British rate. The prominence of London’s credit drains led Keynes (1930) to write that the sway of London “on credit conditions throughout the world was so predominant that the Bank of England could almost have {{claimed to be the}} conductor of the international orchestra” (p. 306-307).

40|$|Asset price {{movements}} play credible role {{as leading}} indicator for activity, financial distress and general economic wellbeing, and as such, are closely monitored by investors and policymakers alike. All assets’ prices {{are expressed in}} a unit of account, usually the home currency of the jurisdiction in which the asset is domiciled, and the values of these currencies continually vary, depending on the balance of demand and supply. The continuous variation {{in the value of}} currencies suggests that, at best, they can only be an inappropriate unit of measure of an asset. This dissertation aims to shed more light on why single currencies are inaccurate units of measure of asset prices. Our first study investigates how the currency of valuation affects the outcome of the return and volatility spillovers between the stock market and the foreign exchange (FX) market. Evidence from our study suggests the presence of exchange rate premium in asset prices, which in turn significantly affects {{the nature of the relationship}} between the equity and FX markets when asset prices are measured in an aggregate unit of account rather than pair-wise or single currency. In our second study, we examine the currency effect on the predictability of stock returns in the short term. Although previous studies have concentrated on investigating the factors or models that best predict asset returns, our study investigates the effect of currency of valuation on stock return predictability. Our results suggest that reducing the volatility of the variables by valuing them in an aggregate unit of account improves the predictability of stock returns on the short horizon. Our last study investigates the currency effect on the long-term relationship between the stock market and macroeconomic variables. Our results show evidence of significant changes in the relations between the stock market and macroeconomic variables with the introduction of the aggregate currency factor, marked by reducing the effect of the aggregate currency-denominated US macroeconomic variables on the aggregate currency-denominated stock index. Moreover, the results show that the previously documented relations between the stock market and macroeconomic variables, without accounting for the influence of the currency of valuation, might not necessarily hold when the <b>currency</b> factor is <b>discounted...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} have moved towards more {{flexible exchange rate}} regimes {{over the last decade}} to take advantage of greater monetary policy autonomy and flexibility in responding to external shocks. Some reluctance to let go of pegged exchange rates persists, however, despite the benefits of flexibility. The institutional and operational requirements needed to support a floating exchange rate, as well as difficulties in assessing the right time and manner to exit, tend to be additional factors in this reluctance. This volume presents the concrete steps taken by a number of countries in transition to greater exchange rate flexibility and elaborates on the operational ingredients that proved helpful in promoting successful and durable transitions. It attempts to provide a better understanding (and hence a "road map") of how these various operational ingredients were established and coordinated, how their implementation interacted with macro and other conditions, and how they contributed to the smoothness of each transition.

40|$|A {{decade of}} {{extremely}} high and volatile copper prices has disturbed industries {{and raised the}} need for an extensive understanding of current predictors by means of indicators, signals, events and developments concerning the copper market. The goal of this research is to find a suitable method to prioritise events (including developments) on their impact on the copper market and to identify the root causes for these impacts. In order to asses future scenarios, this study can be used to identify predictors, which will improve the understanding of the dynamics of the copper market. In this research a large set of open data sources was analysed. This data was retrieved from USGS, World Bank, company reports, commodity reports and scientific researches. Furthermore, 29 case studies were analysed on various topics. These case studies consist of time series analyses, logical reasonings and assessments on future potential impacts. By interviewing external experts, different perspectives on the copper market were identified. Events were prioritized on the impact each caused on the copper market. To quantify this impact, a new indicator was developed. This indicator was derived from a surprise component, which was defined from literature. The surprise component indicates the effect of economic news on the commodity markets. The surprise component includes the market uncertainty at a specific moment in time and the deviation of the actual price from the expected price. The general idea of the developed indicator is to include the duration of an event. This is realized by a summation of the consecutive surprise components within this duration. Because the deviations are generally larger for long term events, a linear bias occurs. This bias was eliminated making the newly developed indicator also suitable for expressing the impact of long term events. This indicator enabled {{the first step in the}} root cause analysis and identified the events which caused the most impact, such as major wars, economic booms and technological developments. However, other types of events have caused more severe price shocks (a deviation from the expected price which is more than the standard deviation). The cyclical nature of the market, financial crises and a rapidly transforming climate for investment in a supply region are considered to be events causing the most severe price shocks. To identify the root causes for the events' and developments' impacts, associated indicators and signals were determined. By means of the case studies, those indicators and signals could be objectively valued. From the identified root causes, awarenesses of additional complexity are revealed. For example, it is assumed that economic growth in China will affect the copper market significantly. However, due to China's current status in several economic indicators, the significance of this impact is questioned. Economic growth in underdeveloped regions, such as India or Sub-Saharan Africa, will affect the copper market more significantly. Another key example is the recycling industry, which is much less matured as common statements make one believe, since the recycling efficiency continues to stay below 35 %. The case studies verified the indicators and signals and have provided information on the likelihood, future progress and impact of events affecting the copper industry. In order to assess the current relevance and significance of the studied indicators and signals, each was brought into today's perspective. It is presumed that certain indicators and signals might have changed in significance. First; the oil price, this study proves that pre- 2000 events on the oil market only caused minor impacts on the copper markets. However, causal relations were deduced between the recent oil peak and the high marginal costs of copper. This suggests a possible increase in relevance of the oil market affecting the copper market. Secondly, the newly developed incentive for a transition to a sustainable society with an efficient use of energy. This will require appliances with a high content of copper. Massive embracing of these new appliances could boost the demand for copper. Lastly, the impact of an increase in demand due to wars. While the copper market is growing rapidly, magnitude of war would need to increase to affect the market with the same impact. The assessments for today's significances show that new drivers will enter the market and old drivers could reduce. This study revealed that the copper market was subject to both random and non random events. Pattern recognition does not seem a suitable tool to provide an understanding the behaviour of the copper price, but comprehending the root causes and the consequences of the events is of use. This study defined a set of indicators and signals (e. g. U. S. dollar <b>currency</b> index, <b>discount</b> rate and gold price) which stakeholders can use to optimize risk analyses. Monitoring and stimulating the development of alternative sources for copper, including recycling and deep sea mining, will enable the possibility to bypass risks. Lastly, indicators and signals, related to the sustainable energy transition, economy, company strategies and new innovations in processing and extraction technologies, will indicate how the balance in supply and demand will develop. This study improves the understanding of current dynamics of the copper market and the identified set of predictors will benefit stakeholders to improve their strategies. Updating this study will ensure industries are prepared for future market fluctuations...|$|R
