The walls of the box body are 40 -mm-thick steel plate welded into a tight complete structure, with a cover plate thickness of 60  mm, and the design pressure is 6  MPa. The primary box’s length, width and height are 1600, 1200 and 1200  mm, respectively. The maximum experimental coal sample mass is about 1200  kg. The front and rear surfaces of the main box body contain 24 holes with different height distributions in three layers; 23 of these have a 14  mm diameter for conveying sensor cables and the remaining holes with 12  mm diameters are standard screw drills for gas injection. A special high-pressure hose {{is connected to the}} external side, and the hole’s internal side is connected with a cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of the}} primary box (Fig.  2 b). The cribriform ventilation device is designed as a cribriform pectinate strip. The height of the pectinate strip is 20  mm, and the upper surface of the strip contains well-distributed ventilation holes. In this way, plane-charging can be fulfilled to simulate natural gas sources. A thread-cutting <b>coal</b> <b>drill</b> pipe exists inside the box body, which is used to simulate the mining work face. Two auxiliary boxes are located on both sides of the primary box, where the coal cutting power transmission shaft is located. The side boxes are also used as a container for drilled coal.

This Permo-Triassic basin trends north-northwest-south-southeast and is concealed beneath the south-eastern portion of the Murray Basin. The basin overlies the Ovens Graben (Ovens Valley Graben in Victoria) which extends from the Murrumbidgee River west of Darlington Point in New South Wales to Wangaratta in Victoria. It is approximately 25 km wide at Oaklands and approximately 15 km wide at its northern extent. The Oaklands Basin hosts to more than 1000 m thick sediments. The basin was first discovered in 1916 when water drillers discovered coal near Coorabin. Coal has been the main focus for exploration within the basin since this time.

40|$|Overexposure to {{airborne}} respirable {{crystalline silica}} dust can cause disabling or fatal respiratory disease, and mine worker exposure to silica dust {{continues to be}} an ongoing occupational health concern. Exposures of surface coal mine rock drillers to respirable crystalline silica are of particular concern. On surface <b>coal</b> mine <b>drills,</b> bailing air flushes the cuttings out of the drill hole. Conveyor belting material is typically used to fabricate a shroud around the drill deck in an effort to contain the drill dust {{so that it can be}} captured by a collector. Dust leakage from the drill shroud is usually the worst dust source problem on most drills. The focus of this work is drill shroud dust leakage and the relationships of various drill parameters on this leakage. Experimental data were obtained and used in combination with dimensional analysis to establish these relationships. In general, it is found that airborne respirable dust (ARD) concentrations vary in a direct relationship with shroud leakage area and in an inverse relationship with drill deck cross sectional area and shroud height. This work expands the testing and dimensional analysis previously reported for collector/bailing air flow ratios ranging from 2 : 1 to 4 : 1 to include ratios approaching 1 : 1. A semi empirical mathematical model has been developed and expanded to describe ARD generation on surface <b>coal</b> mine <b>drills.</b> Geometric parameters included are drill deck height and cross sectional area, shroud leakage associated with the deck shroud, and the operational parameters of bailing airflow and dust collector airflow. The relationships can be described by logarithmic functions and yield predictive ARD values, which fall in the range measured on operating drills for collector/bailing air flow ratios greater than 2. However, at values of collector/bailing air flow ratios of approximately 1. 1, the amount of ARD shows minimal response, if any, to drill deck shroud improvements that do not result in near perfect seals. This is a condition that can occur in actual operation and is a substantially different result than previously expected and reported. Application of these results should provide mine operators with sufficient information to determine (1) the relative magnitude of their dust emissions, (2) where they should focus their efforts to reduce ARD emissions and (3) the improvement they could reasonably expect to achieve. Given that exposures of surface coal mine rock drillers to respirable crystalline silica are of particular concern, substantial reductions of airborne silica dust during drilling may be estimated and achieved through use of the analysis presented.

The coal body of the protected coal seam should first be loaded and then unloaded with the three-dimensional stress being reduced simultaneously. In accordance with the forcing process around the coal body of the protected coal seam, permeability experiments were performed under fixed axial displacement with unloading confining pressure (FADUCP) and fixed deviatoric stress with unloading confining pressure (FDSUCP) stress paths. During the loading stage before the unloading point, the permeability and axial strain have a negative exponential relationship. However, during the unloading stage after the unloading point, the permeability and axial strain have a positive exponential relationship.
