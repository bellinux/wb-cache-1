When you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you can't swallow anything, not {{even if it was}} a chocolate <b>caramel.</b> <b>I</b> had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious. I've often dreamed since then that I had a lot of chocolate caramels, but I always wake up just when I'm going to eat them. I do hope you won't be offended because I can't eat. Everything is extremely nice, but still I cannot eat." ...|$|E

50|$|After our round we {{went into}} the kitchen and asked if we could get {{something}} to eat. There was a Mrs. Hemple in charge of the kitchen and she fixed a real meal. Her dessert was a form of <b>caramel</b> pie and <b>I</b> still remember it fondly as her own special dish. Incidentally, Mrs. Hemple charged us each 50 cents for the dinner and she told us that we were the only two members to eat there that day. I found out later that most of the members brought their lunch and munched it in the clubhouse. Later {{on the board of directors}} passed a rule forbidding that practice in order to encourage members to eat in Mrs. Hemple’s dining room.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoupled to {{increasing}} consumer demand, food manufacturers have moved towards increased usage of approved natural colours. There {{is a legal}} requirement for governments to monitor the consumption of all food additives in the EU to ensure the ADIs are not exceeded, especially by young children. Validated analytical methods are needed to fulfil this requirement. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the available literature on methods of extraction for approved natural colours in food and drink. Available analytical methods for the determination of EU-permitted natural food colour additives in foods and beverages have been critically assessed for their fitness for purpose in terms of their the key extraction and analysis procedures, selectivity (range) and sensitivity, especially with regard to maximum permitted levels, and their applicability for use in surveillance and in an enforcement role. The advantages and disadvantages of available analytical methods for each of nine designated chemical classes (groups) of natural colours in different food and beverage matrices are given. Other important factors such as technical requirements, cost, transferability and applicability are given due consideration. Gaps in the knowledge and levels of validation are identified and recommendations made on further research to develop suitable methods. The nine designated natural colour classes covered are: 1. Curcumin (E 100), 2. Riboflavins (E 101 i-ii), 3. Cochineal (E 120), 4. Chlorophylls - including chlorophyllins and copper analogues (E 140 - 141), 5. <b>Caramel</b> Classes <b>I</b> - IV (E 150 a-d), 6. Carotenoids (E 160 a-f, E 161 b, E 161 g), 7. Beetroot red (E 162), 8. Anthocyanins (E 163) and 9. Other colours - Vegetable carbon (E 153), Calcium carbonate (E 170), Titanium dioxide (E 171) and Iron oxides and hydroxides (E 172) ...|$|R
60|$|A {{procession}} of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew {{a chunk of}} bread from under his foreboard, crammed {{it into his mouth}} and munched as he walked. Our staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl: no, M Glade's men. Doesn't bring in any business either. I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em. What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can't stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser Kansell, sold by Hely's Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: <b>caramel.</b> She knew <b>I,</b> I think she knew by the way she. If she had married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them. My heart's broke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker's daughter. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.|$|R
