40|$|To {{investigate}} {{progressive collapse}} behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) flat plate structures, {{a reliable and}} efficient numerical approach is developed in this study using spring connection modelling. This <b>connection</b> <b>unit</b> aims to simulate complicate punching shear behavior at critical regions surrounding the columns. Five springs are used as the connection elements: two for flexural and integrity steel bars and three for concrete contributions. The flexural and integrity steel bars embedded in the columns are modeled explicitly, which enables the model to present the structural behavior post punching shear failure. Bending and shear actions are represented by two concrete springs. The third concrete spring is assigned axial action property to restrain two end nodes of the connection on the model. In particular, the punching shear spring controls the <b>connection</b> <b>unit</b> when punching shear failure occurs. To apply the <b>connection</b> <b>unit,</b> the regions of slab-column connections are partitioned from the slab regions according to the critical shear surfaces. Then the <b>connection</b> <b>unit</b> links two corresponding nodes on the two edges formed from the partition. A physical experiment of a RC flat plate substructure under progressive collapse is simulated. Result comparison demonstrates that the numerical model has the capability to capture the structural behavior in progressive collapse. However, further improvement of the modelling technique is necessary to enhance numerical accuracy. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E

Device (iii) shows the highest current efficiency and the differences in device performance can be correlated with the electronic structure of the <b>connection</b> <b>unit</b> and its interface with the neighboring active layers. The working mechanisms of the connection-unit works are {{discussed in terms of}} band bending and charge carrier density. The electronic structures of the interface between layers in a <b>connection</b> <b>unit</b> are of particular importance to the device performance. Dopings of Mg in Al q 3 and F 4 -TCNQ in m -MTDATA led to bipolar heterojunction. Removal of either the n -type or the p -type dopants suppresses the band bending and the formation of space charge regions. The charge density accumulated at this interface estimated from Poisson's equation is 1018 cm 3, which is respectively 12 and 6 orders of magnitude higher than that in the Mg:Al q 3 / m -MTDATA and Al q 3 /F 4 -TCNQ: m -MTDATA connection units.

High-quality <b>connection,</b> <b>unit</b> support and organizational justice are traits structured within Marine aviation logistics. Miscommunication, however, continues to delay responsiveness. This thesis explores qualitative measurements and develops a proposed theoretical framework to study factors that might better predict readiness. The thesis also presents possible quantitative metrics of readiness within Marine aviation logistics as well as measures of effective communication and relationships. Motivating language theory provides the general framework to explore the omission of service levels. Data elements within the Aviation Maintenance and Supply Readiness Report and Individual Training Standards System aim to provide measurements of readiness.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, a novel green {{retaining}} wall technology, named as GRW (Green Retaining Wall), {{was developed to}} enhance constructability, cost-effective and geoenvironment friendly system. Up to now, the GRW system has been investigated mainly focusing on an establishment of the design procedure. The analyti-cal procedure for sand bag design has been proposed to evaluate frictional characteristics and stability of the GRW system. In addition, large-scale direct shear tests were performed to establish the frictional characteris-tics between the seeded sandbag and the <b>connection</b> <b>unit</b> of the GRW system. A stability analysis formula was proposed for the GRW system {{that can be applied}} to riverside or shoreline. Hydraulic experiments were per-formed to quantify the loss rate of sand from the sand bags. By conducting the safety analysis for the flow pressure proposed in this study, the maximum allowable velocity and the minimum required weight were cal-culated and compared with those of the conventional design cases. The insights into the behavior of the GRW system observed in this study will be reported and discussed. ...|$|E
