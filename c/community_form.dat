30|$|This dataset {{consists}} of 7115 nodes and 103, 689 edges. The data was tested by varying {{the number of}} <b>communities</b> <b>formed</b> by using the infomap community-detection algorithm on the data; for each set of communities, the α value, used in computing the Katz centrality values of each node over the entire graph, was varied. Largest λ value obtained for the value for the network would not change {{with the number of}} <b>communities</b> <b>formed,</b> and the largest λ value was 0.022. The metrics used in distributing the data using IGraph’s infomap method were the number of trails as 10 and the modularity value as TRUE. Infomap community detection method is used to identify communities in the network. We ran our proposed algorithm twice for each data set by varying the number of communities in the network. The number of <b>communities</b> <b>formed</b> in the first run is 499 and the number of <b>communities</b> <b>formed</b> in the second run is 508.|$|R
