40|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} in the contrarotating (CR) fan configuration in aviation and other applications where size and weight are important design factors. <b>Contrarotation</b> recovers swirl energy compared with the single-rotor design, but this advantage is not fully harnessed due to, perhaps, the issue of noise. This study explores passive noise reduction for a small, axial-flow, CR fan with perforated trailing-edge for the upstream rotor and perforated leading-edge for the downstream rotor. The fan is designed with simple velocity triangle analyses, which are checked by 3 D flow computations. The aerodynamic consequence and the acoustic benefit of such perforated blading are investigated experimentally. The results {{show that there is}} a reduction of total pressure compared with the baseline CR fan at the same rotating speeds, but this is easily compensated for by slightly raising the rotating speeds. A reduction of 6 - 7 dB in overall noise is achieved for the same aerodynamic output, although there is a moderate noise increase in the high frequency range of 12. 5 - 15. 0 kHz due to blade perforations. The effect of inter-rotor separation distance is also investigated for the baseline design. A clear critical distance exists below which the increased spacing shows clear acoustic benefits. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
