40|$|In this thesis, {{improved}} {{approaches to}} the laboratory characterisation of <b>cemented</b> <b>materials</b> are developed and verified enabling a more informed understanding of the load-carrying capacity of <b>cemented</b> <b>materials</b> used in road pavements. The increasing use of high productivity road freight vehicles {{and the application of}} mechanistic-empirical pavement analysis has led to the need for improved knowledge of the performance of pavement materials. In Australia, standard methods are not available for the elastic characterisation of <b>cemented</b> <b>materials.</b> As a result, presumptive values or correlations with parameters such as unconfined compressive strength (UCS) are used. In this study pavement design methods, failure mechanisms and approaches to <b>cemented</b> <b>materials</b> characterisation are investigated. Theoretical modelling and prediction of crack growth in <b>cemented</b> <b>materials</b> under repetitive loading is reviewed. The use of initial modulus and the reduction in modulus under repetitive loading is proposed as a pragmatic indicator of fatigue crack growth. Improved laboratory protocols for the characterisation of strength, breaking strain, modulus and fatigue are developed using a four-point bending, dynamic flexural beam test. The protocols were applied to two typical <b>cemented</b> <b>materials,</b> a hornfels with 3 % cement and a siltstone with 4 % cement at a range of curing ages. Breaking strain was identified as an indicator of initial micro-cracking. A stress controlled fatigue test was used to establish relationships between initial strain (S) and fatigue life (N) (load cycles to half initial modulus). The verification of the improved laboratory protocols involved a comparison of the labboratory test results with the results of full-scale accelerated pavement testing (APT). For the siltstone, the laboratory and field performance results aligned well. Differences between the laboratory and field materials properties resulted in a lesser alignment of the performance results for the hornfels. The relative performance ranking between the two <b>cemented</b> <b>materials</b> from the improved laboratory protocols matched that from the APT. The ranking from the traditional UCS did not align with the APT results. Further verification was sought using the Australian long term pavement performance study and anecdotal evidence of <b>cemented</b> <b>materials</b> performance to enable consideration of combined environmental and traffic effects over an extended timeframe. In the final stage of the study, the applicability of the improved laboratory protocols {{to a wide range of}} <b>cemented</b> <b>materials</b> was confirmed and a limited study into the extent of initial micro-cracking and the fatigue load-damage exponent was undertaken for two <b>cemented</b> <b>materials.</b> It was concluded that the four-point bending flexural beam test developed and verified in the study provided a significantly improved method of assessing the performance of <b>cemented</b> <b>materials</b> compared to the UCS test. The improved laboratory protocols were found to be suitable for testing a wide range of <b>cemented</b> <b>materials.</b> It was also found that, where consistent micro-cracking was present, the load-damage exponent was not dependent on the extent of initial micro-cracking...|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{cementation}} of soft clays {{has been}} used for several years for different ground improvement projects. Although considerable work has been done to develop advanced machinery and techniques for the implementation of artificial cementation, less knowledge is available on the mechanisms involving the formation of the artificial structure and the resulting mechanical behaviour. The primary objectives of the present work were to investigate the formation of microstructure in artificially <b>cemented</b> <b>material</b> with Portland <b>cement,</b> find the relationships between cementitious bonding and clay mineralogy, and create constitutive frameworks for predicting the mechanical behaviour of cement-treated clays. Qualitative and quantitative microstructural characterisation of reconstituted and <b>cemented</b> <b>material</b> has been performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The results confirmed the transformation of the void microstructure from a bimodal, dispersed material into a unimodal, flocculated material due to artificial cementation. The addition of cement was found {{to reduce the amount of}} macro-pores within the <b>cemented</b> <b>material,</b> resulting in a significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity. A further parametric study was conducted on data obtained in the laboratory by the author combined with those found in the literature, to investigate the effect of clay mineralogy on artificial cementation. The results indicated the major influence of the activity of the clay, along with the cement and water content, on the results of the cement treatment. The observed variations in the mechanical behaviour with respect to mineralogy and the important effect of curing time have been explained in terms of the pozzolanic reactions, and the limitations of applying Abrams’ law to cement-admixed clays are discussed. In addition, an experimental study has been conducted to investigate the yielding and stress-strain behaviour of artificially cemented Ottawa clay and to compare it with the behaviour of the same soil in its naturally structured state. The results indicate that although the natural clay exhibits a meta-stable structure, resulting in an abrupt post-yield loss of strength, the artificially <b>cemented</b> <b>material</b> undergoes a more gradual breakage of the cementitious bonds. This allows for the use of the critical state concept, along with a pseudo-normal compression line, to develop a constitutive model for the artificially <b>cemented</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R
