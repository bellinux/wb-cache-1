Radioactive materials previously buried underground in coal deposits are released as fly ash or, if fly ash is captured, may be incorporated into concrete manufactured with fly ash.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used predictor of acute radiation symptoms is the whole-body absorbed dose. Several related quantities, such as the equivalent dose, effective dose, and <b>committed</b> <b>dose,</b> are used to gauge long-term stochastic biological effects such as cancer incidence, {{but they are not}} designed to evaluate acute radiation syndrome. To help avoid confusion between these quantities, absorbed dose is measured in units of grays (in SI, unit symbol Gy) or rads (in CGS), while the others are measured in sieverts (in SI, unit symbol Sv) or rems (in CGS). 1rad = 0.01Gy and 1rem = 0.01Sv.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Retention, absorbed <b>dose,</b> <b>committed</b> {{equivalent}} <b>dose</b> and <b>committed</b> effective <b>doses</b> {{have been}} assessed due to acute ingestion of 1 Bq of 60 Co in human body. Calculations are done using “Internal Radiation Dose Assessment (IRDA) ” software {{which has been}} developed based on the biokinetic model. Due to ingestion maximum radiation dose is deposited in the gastro intestinal (GI) tract, assumed to consist of four tissue compartments, e. g. stomach (ST), small intestine (SI), upper large intestine (ULI) and lower large intestine (LLI). In this work actual tissue masses of GI Tract of Bangladeshi people have been considered to calculate the above mentioned quantities for different age groups, such as 1 yr, 10 yrs and adult (female and male). One hour after the ingestion, the retention and absorbed dose show the trend ST> SI> ULI> LLI. Regarding tissue compartments the variation of the <b>committed</b> equivalent <b>dose</b> pattern is LLI> ULI> ST> SI for the radionuclide. The variation of absorbed <b>dose,</b> <b>committed</b> equivalent <b>dose</b> and <b>committed</b> effective <b>dose</b> with respect to age follow the pattern: 1 yr> 10 yrs> adult female> adult male. The highest <b>committed</b> effective <b>dose</b> for ingestion of 1 Bq of the radionuclide under the study {{is found in the}} GI tract of 1 yr old child. This value is 6. 56 x 10 - 6 mSv. For other age groups these values are slightly less...|$|R

25|$|The highest {{background}} radiation in an inhabited area {{is found in}} Ramsar, primarily due {{to the use of}} local naturally radioactive limestone as a building material. The 1000 most exposed residents receive an average external effective radiation dose of 6mSv per year, (0.6 rem/yr,) six times the ICRP recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources. They additionally receive a substantial internal dose from radon. Record radiation levels were found in a house where the effective dose due to ambient radiation fields was 131mSv/a, (13.1 rem/yr) and the internal <b>committed</b> <b>dose</b> from radon was 72mSv/a (7.2 rem/yr).

30|$|Natural {{radioactivity}} {{levels in}} some selected medicinal plants {{commonly used in}} Ghana from the Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine were investigated to determine the activity concentration and the annual <b>committed</b> effective <b>dose</b> due to naturally occurring radionuclides of 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K. The activity concentration was determined using gamma-ray spectrometry. The results of the analysis indicated an average activity concentration of 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K in the medicinal plants to be 31.8 ± 2.8 Bq kg- 1, 56.2 ± 2.3 Bq kg- 1 and 839.8 ± 11.9 Bq kg- 1 respectively. Khaya ivorensis recorded the highest activity concentration of 238 U and 232 Th while Lippia multiflora recorded the highest activity concentrations of 40 K. The total annual <b>committed</b> effective <b>doses</b> ranged from 0.026 ± 0.001 to 0.042 ± 0.002 mSv a- 1 with an average value of 0.035 ± 0.001 mSv a- 1.
