25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was a wheel rim which broke and damaged the train six kilometres south of the accident site. The wheel rim penetrated the carriage floor and lifted the <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> {{of a set of}} points close to Eschede station. The broken-off <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> then forced the point blades of the following set of points to change direction, and the rear cars of the trainset were diverted to a different track. They hit the pillars of a street overpass, which then collapsed onto the tracks. Only three cars and the front powerhead passed under the bridge, the rest of the 14-car train jackknifed into the collapsed bridge.|$|R

50|$|The frog {{end of the}} {{switched}} crossing, despite {{still having}} a gap in one rail, is less problematic in this regard. The outer rail is still continuous, the wing rail (the part that turns out, after the frog gap) provides a gradual transition, and the <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> avoids the possibility of points splitting.

The leading (in {{the direction of}} travel) coupled wheels derailed to the right, by the flange climbing the high rail.

As the face increases in height, large sections of concrete rendering surround numerous areas of pick-faced exposed rock. Set in among eroded sandstone at various heights are sections of cut and dressed and mortared stone work. Small tufts of vegetation are scattered along the face.

In some cases the third rail was removed and in others it was moved along sleepers to serve as <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> on curves.

50|$|Gelli Felen Halt {{was opened}} by the LMS on 6 September 1933. It was {{situated}} {{to the west}} of the twin-bore Gelli Felen Tunnel (Down 386 yd; Up 352 yd) from which the station was reached on a sharp left-hand curve where flangeless 0-8-4T locomotives had in the past derailed. At this point the line ran along the sheer rock face of the cutting side which was reinforced with engineering brick. Gelli Felen railway halt was in an isolated location on a 1 in 38 gradient on a sharp curve requiring <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> to prevent derailment. Short staggered platforms were provided with a barrack-like brick huts as passenger shelters. To the west of the station there had been a signal box, crossover and siding but these had gone by 1931; the signal box was opened on the Up side in 1898 and was known as Gellavalln.|$|E
50|$|The Main Range Railway {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} sections of line for enginemen during the steam era on the Queensland Railways. Despite the advent of more powerful locomotives during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the combination of sharp curves, steep grades and tunnels created difficult conditions for crews. Railway workers needed to ensure adequate supplies of coal and water to negotiate the crossing and banking engines were employed between Murphy's Creek and Toowoomba to assist ascending trains. On curved sections of track inner <b>check</b> <b>rails</b> were laid to minimise the possibility of derailment after 1897. Sandboxes were placed along the line to assist wheel traction. Despite being a difficult stretch of railway to work, the Main Range line has been relatively free of major disasters. Of the fatal incidents that have occurred, the worst was the Murphy's Creek collision (1913) when six men were killed.|$|E

40|$|The turnout (Switch & Crossing) {{is a vital}} {{component}} in railway networks as it provides flexibility to traffic operation by allowing trains to switch between tracks. The flexibility comes at a cost as the common lack of a transition curve in the diverging route together with the variation and discontinuities in rail profiles result in higher rail degradation rates than in regular track. In this thesis, dynamic interaction between vehicle and turnout is studied using numerical tools for multibody dynamics with focus on laying a foundation for robust optimization of turnout geometry. Considering a stochastic spread in traffic parameters, quantitative and qualitative estimates of rail profile degradation are computed. The influence of wheel profile wear on wheel–rail interaction in a turnout is studied, and it is concluded that equivalent conicity is the wheel profile characterization parameter with the best correlation to rail damage of the investigated parameters. In addition, the influence of hollow worn wheels on rail damage is investigated and {{it is found that}} such wheel profiles display a significantly different and potentially more harmful running behaviour at the crossing. The influence of wheel–rail friction coefficient is studied and it is shown that friction correlates strongly to lateral contact forces and wear in the diverging route. Wheelset steering, considering the turnout specific configuration of rail profiles and the presence of <b>check</b> <b>rails,</b> is discussed. One of the track models studied is a discretized mass-spring-damper model with nine degrees-of-freedom. This track model can be tuned to capture the large phase delay at low frequencies found in measurements of dynamic track stiffness, while remaining sufficiently resilient at higher frequencies. Good agreement between the simulation model and field measurement data has been observed. It is concluded that the use of more resilient rail pads can reduce wheel–rail impact loads during the crossing transition...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{methodology}} for simulation of track settlement in railway turnouts (switches and crossings, S&C) is presented. The methodology predicts the accumulated settlement {{for a given}} set of traffic loads using an iterative and cross-disciplinary procedure. The different modules of the procedure include (I) simulation of dynamic vehicle–track interaction in a turnout applying a validated software for multibody vehicle dynamics considering space-dependent track properties, (II) calculation of load distribution and sleeper–ballast contact pressure using a detailed finite element model of a turnout that includes all of the rails (stock rails, switch rails, closure rails, crossing nose, wing rails and <b>check</b> <b>rails),</b> rail pads, baseplates and sleepers on ballast, (III) prediction of track settlement for a given number of load cycles and (IV) calculation of accumulated track settlement at each sleeper and the resulting vertical track irregularity along the turnout which is used as input in the next step of the iteration. The iteration scheme is demonstrated by calculating track settlement at the crossing when the studied turnout is exposed to freight traffic in the facing move of the through route. Due {{to the design of}} the crossing panel and the character of the impact loads induced by the transfer of wheels between wing rail and crossing nose, the load transferred into the track bed is not uniform and the resulting spatially varying (differential) settlement leads to vertical irregularities in track geometry. In the first paper of this work, track settlement is predicted using a discrete empirical model that gives the local vertical settlement {{based on the number of}} load cycles and the prescribed distribution of sleeper–ballast contact pressure. Such a model does not account for the material behaviour in, or the interaction between, different regions of the track substructure. In the second paper, a computationally efficient method for predicting long-term settlement in generic configurations of track (various combinations of track superstructure and substructure and nonsymmetric loading conditions) using a constitutive model accounting for the multi-axial stressstrain condition in the track substructure is developed. A key ingredient of the method is that the selected constitutive model evaluates track settlement in the cycle domain. The constitutive model is adopted for both the ballast and the sub-ballast but with different parameter sets. The dimensions of the three-dimensional finite element model of the track substructure and the number of sleepers that need to be included to obtain accurate settlement at the crossing are investigated. To predict a reliable distribution of settlement under a given sleeper, it is concluded that the loading on at least two sleepers on either side of the sleeper must also be included in the model...|$|E
40|$|Track {{stiffness}} in railway turnouts is variable due {{to differences}} in structural composition along the longitudinal direction, which will lead to severe dynamic interaction between train and turnout. In this paper, a transient analysis model is presented to investigate the stiffness characteristics of high-speed railway turnouts based on the finite element method and is applied to optimise the stiffness of railway turnouts. Furthermore, the effect of the stiffness variations on the dynamic train-turnout interaction is analysed. The calculation results show that the track stiffness characteristics are similar in the main and diverging line of railway turnout, except for the <b>check</b> <b>rail</b> sections. Due to the existence of shared baseplates and spacer blocks between different rails, the stiffness variations in the crossing panel are most severe in high-speed railway turnouts. The stiffness differences (calculated as the ratio of the maximum and minimum stiffness) of the longitudinal and lateral direction for Chinese number 18 ballasted turnout are 216 % and 229 %, respectively. The graded stiffness of the tie pads has been redesigned to optimise the stiffness of railway turnout based on the transient analysis model and the stiffness differences of the turnout are decreased. Altogether, the dynamic train-turnout interaction is enhanced remarkably by considering the turnout’s stiffness characteristics...|$|R
50|$|Between the 148 km and 149 km posts {{a number}} of {{stabilising}} features are set in {{to the base of}} low sections of bank opposite the railway. Running parallel to a section of <b>check</b> <b>railed</b> curving track is a stone retaining wall. The wall is rubble coursed, and is set into the base of a steep low bank. Much of the higher portion of the wall is rendered and there is evidence of collapse. The wall continues for approximately 15 metres, adjoining a low squared section of rock face close to the base, marked by a painted 7 within a white square. After passing a high tiered face of lightly coloured and loosely packed rock, a small low bank running parallel to a short, straight section of rail between two curves incorporates {{a number of}} features. Parallel to where the rail straightens is a steeply sloping retaining wall of brick. The bricks range in colour from orange to brown and are labelled: Campbells Redbank. The brickwork adjoins a low vertical section of pick-faced rock that extends until the next curve. The face contains a small section of cut and dressed stone and brickwork set in underneath the rock face to the base. Above the bank set into the hillside a section of stone walling is largely obscured by vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic train–track {{interaction}} {{is more complex}} in railway turnouts (switches & crossings) than on ordinary tangent or curved tracks. Multiple contacts between wheel and rail are common, and severe impact loads with broad frequency contents are induced when the nominal wheel–rail contact conditions are disturbed due to the continuous variation in rail profiles and the discontinuities in the crossing panel. The absence of transition curves at the entry and exit of the turnout, and the cant deficiency, lead to large wheel–rail contact forces and passenger discomfort when the train is switching into the turnout track. Two alternative multibody system (MBS) models of dynamic interaction between the train and a standard turnout design are developed. The first model is derived using a commercial MBS software. The second model {{is based on a}} multibody dynamics formulation that may account for the structural flexibility of train and track components (based on finite element models and coordinate reduction methods). The variation in rail profile is accounted for by sampling the cross-section of each rail at several positions along the turnout. Contact between the back of the wheel flange and the <b>check</b> <b>rail,</b> when the wheelset is steered through the crossing, is considered. Good agreement between the results from the two models is observed when the track model is taken as rigid...|$|R
