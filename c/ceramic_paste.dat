40|$|The <b>ceramic</b> <b>pastes</b> in Marrakech {{region are}} {{prepared}} {{on the base}} of six types of raw materials of different lithologies. Various products are manufactured. The production consists of cooking utensils (based on schist, colluviums, quartzose sand and silt), decoration products (based on argillite, washing residues and soil), vases and gourds products (based on schist and soil), tiles (based on silt decantation) and traditional dishes (based on soil and argillite). In this study we elaborate bricks from the different raw material and we evaluate some of their physical properties after firing at 1050 °C. In particular we measure the porosity to water and the mechanical strength of all the fired bricks. The aim is to compare the final product quality according to the origin (lithology) of the clayey raw material of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>pastes.</b> Based on our experiments, the bricks of the lower compressive strength (CS) and of the lower flexural strength (FS) are those based on sand (CS = 39 MPa; FS = 7 MPa), on silt decantation (CS = 25 to 39 MPa; FS = 10 to 18 MPa), and on schist and colluviums (CS = 20 to 51 MPa; FS = 6 to 17 MPa). Those of the highest values are based on argillites (CS = 33 to 102 MPa; FS = 13 to 28 MPa). The other pastes are characterized by intermediate values. The porosity ranges between 5 to 27 %. The bricks based on silt decantation have the greatest values (20 to 27 %), whereas those based on argillite have the lower values (5 to 10 %). Those physical properties are, in most cases, in agreement with the requested values of the bricks industry.

This contacting layer, is applied in a green state by wet-powder-spray or screen-printing, and in situ fired during stack commissioning.

Moreover the shrinkage usually observed during long term operation in temperature of this layer, due to sintering effect, lead to cracks and contact losses which hinder the cell performance. Increasing cell’s footprint, performance and lifetime at the stack level requires appropriate contacting solution.

We also demonstrate that these HA scaffolds show enhanced compressive strength (29. 4 MPa), whilst possessing large pore sizes (> 600 µm) that are suitable for bone grafting. The extrusion process involved forming a <b>ceramic</b> <b>paste</b> by mixing the HA powder with a binder and distilled water.

The scaffolds were then analysed for their chemical, physical, mechanical and biological properties to elucidate the effects of the sintering parameters on extruded HA scaffolds.

At 1300 oC, trace amounts of phase impurities were detected, however, scaffolds sintered at this temperature exhibited the highest mean compressive strength.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between social violence and ceramic resource procurement. Do people in middle-range societies alter resource use in response to conflict? Specifically, does social strife influence the distance to which potters in middle-range societies will travel to collect ceramic resources? Distance and quality are primary elements in clay selection. Clay is heavy, so for many potters distance is the determining factor in clay selection (Arnold 1985, 2000). Arnold (1985, 2000) estimated procurement thresholds using worldwide ethnographic data from 111 traditional societies. He found that for both clays and tempers, people prefer to travel only one kilometer, but they will go up to four kilometers if necessary. These thresholds were {{the basis for the}} field component of this research. Pottery production occurred throughout the American Southwest under conditions of pervasive conflict in the 13 th century A. D. The Gallina area is an ideal location for investigating resource procurement and social violence in northwestern New Mexico. Conflict in this area is evidenced by defensive architecture, such as towers and cliff houses (Haas and Creamer 1985; Mackey and Green 1979; Schulman 1949, 1950), burned structures with human remains (Gallenkamp 1953; Hibben 1944; Mackey and Green 1979), and human remains with embedded projectile points and skull trauma (Chase 1976; Mackey and Green 1979). Two sites in the Gallina area were chosen, one with a defensive setting and architecture the other with an open site plan and no defensive structures. Ceramics from each of the sites and the clay resources in proximity to the sites were examined to see if conflict affected resource selection. 	X-ray diffraction (XRD) determined the clay mineralogy of <b>ceramic</b> <b>pastes</b> and the collected natural clays, petrography identified the aplastic mineralogy of the sherds and collected samples, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) provided the chemistry of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>pastes</b> and the natural clays. Numerous field and laboratory characterizations provided more information about the qualities of the available clays and the ceramics themselves. The combined results of the laboratory tests, mineralogical studies, and chemical comparisons indicate that Gallina potters did not alter their resource selection in response to social violence.

Two types of <b>ceramic</b> <b>pastes</b> have been identified, but chemometric techniques support the hypothesis of a Campanian provenance for the raw materials. Degradation phenomena such as the partial devitrification of the glaze, i. e. the slow structural reorganisation towards stable crystalline phases, and the leaching by mineral dissolution in the soil, were determined...|$|R
40|$|DE 10342160 A UPAB: 20050506 NOVELTY - A {{production}} process for high-temperature fuel cells having electrically conductive connections between cathode (2) and an interconnector (1) comprises using conductive <b>ceramic</b> powder <b>paste</b> {{to give a}} plastically deformable coating between plates, pressurizing to form contact layers (3) and then heating to sinter. USE - As a {{production process}} for high-temperature fuel cells (claimed). ADVANTAGE - A constant electrical conductivity at the interconnector/cathode contact is achieved that is constant over cell life and is inexpensive to produce...|$|R
