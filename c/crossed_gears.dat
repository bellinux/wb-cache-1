On the other hand the <b>crossed</b> helical <b>gears</b> fail mainly by scuffing.

However, these are costly and mechanically complex, since they require additional spur gear reducers in the loop. ISO directives document the use of <b>crossed</b> helical <b>gear</b> pairs as virtual gears for hypoids to calculate the sliding velocity since, the flank geometry at the mean point can be precisely represented. The use of such pairs can be a cost effective and simpler alternative for testing purposes.

Using TCA, the load distribution on the tooth under quasi-static conditions and the sliding velocity are calculated for comparison purposes. By applying a selection algorithm, a single experimental <b>crossed</b> helical <b>gear</b> pair is chosen aiming to simulate the contact conditions of hypoid gears. Two test scenarios are studied using EHL film thickness equations and friction models for evaluating the power loss.

5000|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kia’s research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel efficient than Kia’s existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode. [...] Innovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd <b>gears.</b> This <b>crossed</b> <b>gear</b> shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project. The hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. The continuous power delivery of the DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission’s boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee’d GT line. Combined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT’s seven gears allow the GT Line’s diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine’s torque increased from 265 to 285 Nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine’s improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy. Reduction of noise, vibration and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT’s development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.After the Cee’d GT line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.|$|R

The objective of this work is to conduct a comparative study on helical gear design and its performance based on various performance metrics through finite element as well as analytical approaches. The theoretical analysis for a single helical gear system based on American Gear Manufacturing Association (AGMA) standards has been assessed in Matlab.

40|$|Background and aims: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of enforcement of new traffic laws on the fatal and non- fatal injury rates in Iran. Methods: In a longitudinal, interventional controlled trial study, all subjects with history of fatal and non-fatal injuries were studied. Their injuries were caused by six risky violations (unauthorized speed, illegal overtaking, red traffic light <b>crossing,</b> reverse <b>gear</b> movement in the highways, and vehicle arrestment due to two simultaneous violations) from June 2010 to November 2010 (as control) and from June 2011 to November 2011 (as case). Available forensic data were used and the outcome of new road traffic laws was analyzed. Results: The new traffic laws led to reduction of fatal and non-fatal road traffic injuries in urban and metropolitan roads after implementation, with a continuing trend during six months. Reduction of fatal and non-fatal road traffic injuries was higher for 20 - 29 years age group. The effect of new traffic laws on reduction of fatal and non-fatal injuries was 8. 7 and 33. 3, respectively. Reduction of fatality and injury rate at crash scene, {{after six months of}} intervention, was 0. 4 and 11. 1 per 100, 000 populations, respectively. Conclusion: The enforcement of the first phase of new traffic laws has reduced fatal and non-fatal rates of road traffic injuries in Iran. It seems that strict enforcement and amendment of new traffic regulations could further increase their efficiency...|$|R
