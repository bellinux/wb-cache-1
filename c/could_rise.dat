Ahmadinejad's administration contends that the negative side effects will be transient and that the projections are based on out-of-date models.|$|E
5|$|Albion's most capped {{international}} player, {{taking into}} account only those caps won while at the club, is Chris Brunt. He has appeared 38 times for Northern Ireland as a West Brom player, earning 48 caps in total. Jesse Pennington is the club's most capped England international, with 25 caps. The highest transfer fee paid by the club is £12million to Zenit Saint Petersburg for Salomón Rondón on 10 August 2015; the deal <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> to over £15million with appearance fee and other add-ons. The record transfer from Albion to another club is that of Curtis Davies to Aston Villa in July 2008 for a fee of £8.5million.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, New York's {{metropolitan}} area surpassed London's as the world's most populous {{metropolitan area}}. New York City's metropolitan area exceeded ten {{million by the}} early 1930s. The economic boom of the 1920s and the great speculation {{of the real estate}} market fostered a new wave of skyscraper projects in the city. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that the street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings' exterior walls away from the streets. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often decorated elaborately.|$|E

Norwegian media reported, however, that the fee was 35 million kroner (approximately €4million), which <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> to 70–75million kroner (approximately €8–8.5million) on certain conditions. In a press conference after the signing, Real Madrid announced that Ødegaard would train with both the club's first team and the reserves, Real Madrid Castilla. He would play for the latter team, which was managed by Zinedine Zidane at the time.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in glass fiber, {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E

The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to Baton Rouge. On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in {{the east of the}} city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} {{nature of}} past eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera {{suggests that this}} volcano poses a significant long-distance threat to communities across Canada. A large explosive eruption can produce large amounts of ash that could significantly affect communities across Canada. Ash columns <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> to several hundred meters above the volcano which would make this a hazard for air traffic along the coastal airway between Vancouver and Alaska. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure as well as damage to other aircraft systems. In addition, pyroclastic fall could also have a deleterious effect on the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield surrounding the volcano. Melting of glacial ice could cause lahars or debris flows. This in turn could endanger water supplies on the Machmell River and other local water sources.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1469, Henry Percy {{had taken}} his oath of fealty to the King, and had been {{released}} from the Tower. The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick. Montagu was forced to {{come down from the}} Scottish border to suppress it; this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he 'allowed the leaders to escape... ensuring that the rebellion <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> again' at a more opportune moment. Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a Robin of Holderness, but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom. The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469. King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion, and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north back to London.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Titanic {{began in}} July 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with {{the filming of}} the modern day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full scale RMS Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge which <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. For {{the safety of the}} stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.|$|E
5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates <b>could</b> <b>rise</b> too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E
