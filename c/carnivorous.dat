5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the <b>carnivorous</b> syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously <b>carnivorous.</b> In one of the earlier publications on <b>carnivorous</b> plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be <b>carnivorous</b> but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on <b>carnivorous</b> plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on <b>carnivorous</b> plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the <b>carnivorous</b> syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{demarcation}} between <b>carnivorous</b> and protocarnivorous is blurred by {{the lack}} of a strict definition of botanical carnivory and ambiguous academic literature on the subject. Many examples of protocarnivorous plants exist, some of which are counted among the ranks of true <b>carnivorous</b> plants as a matter of historical preference. Further research into these plants' <b>carnivorous</b> adaptations may reveal that a few protocarnivorous plants do meet the more rigid definition of a <b>carnivorous</b> plant.|$|E
5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} carnivore), {{according to}} some definitions, traps and kills insects or other animals but lacks the ability to either directly digest or absorb nutrients from its prey like a <b>carnivorous</b> plant. The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed <b>carnivorous</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{recently}} discovered <b>carnivorous</b> sponge that lives near hydrothermal vents hosts methane-eating bacteria, and digests some of them.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the strict}} and broad {{definitions}} require absorption of the digested nutrients stipulates {{that the plant}} must receive some benefit from the <b>carnivorous</b> syndrome. That is, the plant must display some increase in fitness because of the nutrients obtained from its <b>carnivorous</b> adaptations; {{that it must have}} increased growth rate, increased chance of survival, higher pollen production or seed set.|$|E

5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully <b>carnivorous</b> plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully <b>carnivorous.</b> Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>carnivorous</b> plants {{may also}} be able to {{increase}} their rate of capture through mimicry.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{correlation}} between location of Stylidium species and proximity of known <b>carnivorous</b> species, like sundews (Drosera), bladderworts (Utricularia), the Albany pitcher plant (Cephalotus follicularis), and the rainbow plant (Byblis). While this alone does not prove that Stylidium species are themselves <b>carnivorous,</b> the hypothesis is that the association arose because Stylidium species and the known <b>carnivorous</b> plants obtain scarce nutrients using the same source, namely captured insects. Preliminary proof is given that the trapping mechanisms of two associated plants are the same (the tentacles of Byblis and Drosera), though this may be only a coincidence and further research must be done.|$|E
5|$|Within the sea turtles, E. imbricata {{has several}} unique {{anatomical}} and ecological traits. It {{is the only}} primarily spongivorous reptile. Because of this, its evolutionary position is somewhat unclear. Molecular analyses support placement of Eretmochelys within the taxonomic tribe Carettini, which includes the <b>carnivorous</b> loggerhead and ridley sea turtles, {{rather than in the}} tribe Chelonini, which includes the herbivorous green turtle. The hawksbill probably evolved from <b>carnivorous</b> ancestors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carnivorous</b> {{bivalves}} have {{a greatly}} reduced style, and a chitinous gizzard that helps grind {{up the food}} before digestion. In other ways, their gut {{is similar to that}} of filter-feeding bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{about what}} {{criteria}} a plant must meet {{to be considered}} <b>carnivorous</b> has yielded two proposed definitions: one with strict requirements and the other less restrictive.|$|E
5|$|Mange and Lapblood: A {{male and}} female rat, respectively, {{who are trying to}} save their pups from the plague. Mange is eaten by a <b>carnivorous</b> plant, and his death deeply upsets Lapblood.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett had {{a fascination}} with natural history that he {{referred}} to many times, and he owned a greenhouse full of <b>carnivorous</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|Stylidium {{species with}} glandular trichomes on their sepals, leaves, flower parts, or scapes have been {{suggested}} to be protocarnivorous (or paracarnivorous). The tip of the trichome produces a sticky mucilage—a mixture of sugar polymers and water—that is capable of attracting and suffocating small insects. The ability to trap insects may be a defensive mechanism against damage to flower parts. However, trichomes of S.fimbriatum {{have been shown to}} produce digestive enzymes, specifically proteases, like other <b>carnivorous</b> plants. Adding species of Stylidium to the list of plants that engage in carnivory would significantly increase the total number of known <b>carnivorous</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|The Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event about 252 {{million years}} ago, {{which was a}} prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses, ended the dominance of <b>carnivorous</b> therapsids. In the early Triassic, most medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which, {{over an extended period}} (35 million years), came to include the crocodylomorphs, the pterosaurs and the dinosaurs; however, large cynodonts like Trucidocynodon and traversodontids still occupied large sized <b>carnivorous</b> and herbivorous niches respectively. By the Jurassic, the dinosaurs had come to dominate the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well.|$|E
5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are <b>carnivorous</b> and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though <b>carnivorous,</b> they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered <b>carnivorous,</b> the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is <b>carnivorous.</b> It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus is {{the only}} known <b>carnivorous</b> bipedal animal {{with a pair of}} horns on the frontal bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear; several interpretations have {{revolved}} around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey.|$|E
5|$|Cymothoida – Chiefly marine isopods {{with over}} 2,700 species. Members are mostly <b>carnivorous</b> or {{parasitic}}. Includes the family Gnathiidae, the juveniles {{of which are}} parasitic on fishes. The previously recognised suborder Epicaridea is included as two superfamilies within this suborder and Cymothoida now includes part of the formerly recognised suborder Flabellifera.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, the sticky, {{modified}} bracts of Passiflora foetida {{have been}} investigated for their <b>carnivorous</b> ability. A 1995 paper published in the Journal of Biosciences detailed {{the evidence that the}} glandular bracts played a distinct role in defense of the flower and were also capable of digesting captured prey and absorbing the nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>carnivorous</b> marine {{gastropods}} {{are known}} predators of L.canarium, including the volutes Cymbiola nobilis and Melo melo and the cone snail (Conus textile). The dog conch is also preyed upon by vertebrates. These include the crab-eating macaque, Macaca fascicularis, an opportunistic predator that scours intertidal environments. Humans {{are one of}} the dog conch's main predators, subjecting the species to intensive fishing and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Postglacial {{environmental}} change throughout eastern Beringia brought about wholesale changes in vegetation, the regional extinction {{of much of}} the megafauna, and the entrance of Homo sapiens. The large Late Pleistocene carnivores that were more <b>carnivorous</b> than their competitors faced greater vulnerability to extinction. The Beringian cave lion, saber-toothed cat, and short-faced bear went extinct {{at the same time as}} their large megafaunal prey. The omnivorous coyote, American black bear, brown bear, puma and bobcat survived. Both the Beringian wolf and the dire wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less <b>carnivorous</b> and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive. One extinction theory holds that the Beringian wolf was outcompeted and replaced by the ancestor of the modern gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|The Badlands are a rocky and hilly valley on the {{northern}} borders of the Septimus Heap world, where DomDaniel once practised his dark magic in an observatory atop a hill. They are inhabited by Land Wurms, giant <b>carnivorous</b> snakelike animals, making them a dangerous place. Simon Heap also used to live there with Lucy Gringe.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of insect life provided some food for birds, and birds in turn helped many species to become established on the island. The bodies of dead birds provide sustenance for <b>carnivorous</b> insects, while the fertilisation {{of the soil}} and resulting promotion of plant life provides a viable habitat for herbivorous insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{hemolymph}} usually lacks any respiratory pigment, although {{members of}} the families Arcidae and Limidae are known to possess haemoglobin dissolved directly into the serum. In the <b>carnivorous</b> genus Poromya, the hemolymph has red amoebocytes containing a haemoglobin pigment.|$|E
5|$|The red fox is {{considered}} a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and Bengal foxes {{in the direction of}} size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed. It is, however, not as adapted for a purely <b>carnivorous</b> diet as the Tibetan fox.|$|E
5|$|The tadpoles feed on detritus, algae, and bacteria. Tadpoles in more {{advanced}} phases of development may show {{a preference for}} vegetable matter, but also scavenge or become <b>carnivorous</b> on aquatic life. Captive tadpoles have eaten boiled lettuce and pet food in pellet form. If population density is high, tadpoles have cannibalised one another.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} fish, adult Murray cod are <b>carnivorous</b> and mainly eat other fish. The species {{exhibits a}} high degree of parental care for their eggs, which are spawned in the spring and are generally laid in hollow logs or on other hard surfaces. Murray cod are a popular angling target and aquaculture species. Often available through the aquarium trade, they are also a popular aquarium species in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively <b>carnivorous,</b> eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|After the Morris {{family and}} Clay {{discover}} that the gates have been locked to prevent their escape, the monsters surround them. In anger, Lizzy tries to remove a mask {{from one of the}} monsters, which she discovers is actually the Horror's face. The Horrors explain that they are monsters, but that the visitors' experiences were part of a television show. As an apology, the monsters say that they will lead them towards a new car, but they are led to <b>carnivorous</b> animals.|$|E
5|$|Along with Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus {{has come}} to {{represent}} the quintessential large, <b>carnivorous</b> dinosaur in western popular culture. It is a common dinosaur in American museums, due in particular to the excavations at the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry; by 1976, {{as a result of}} cooperative operations, 38museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland-Lloyd allosaur material or casts. Allosaurus is the official state fossil of Utah.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some <b>carnivorous</b> plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, much like the spider webs described above.|$|E
5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are <b>carnivorous,</b> and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} systematic scheme exists using gill morphology. This {{distinguishes between}} Protobranchia, Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia. The first corresponds to Newell's Palaeotaxodonta and Cryptodonta, {{the second to}} his Pteriomorphia, with the last corresponding to all other groups. In addition, Franc separated the Septibranchia from his eulamellibranchs because of the morphological differences between them. The septibranchs belong to the superfamily Poromyoidea and are <b>carnivorous,</b> having a muscular septum instead of filamentous gills.|$|E
