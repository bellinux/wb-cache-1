Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. Niccolò Zucchi, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book Optica philosophia of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held <b>concave</b> <b>lens</b> but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.|$|E

Such negative mass clumps would be located elsewhere than assumed dark clusters, as they would reside at the center of observed cosmic voids located between galaxy filaments within the lacunar, web-like large-scale structure of the universe. Such test based on negative weak lensing could help to falsify cosmological models proposing exotic matter of negative mass as an alternative interpretation to dark matter.|$|E

60|$|Water Spectacles.--When a man {{opens his}} eyes under water, he can see nothing distinctly; but {{everything}} is as much out of focus, as if he looked, in air, through a pair of powerful spectacles that were utterly unsuited to him. He cannot distinguish {{the letters of the}} largest print in a newspaper advertisement; he cannot see the spaces between the outstretched fingers, at arm's length, in clear water; nor at a few inches' distance in water that is somewhat opaque. I read a short paper on this subject, at the British Association in 1865, in which I showed the precise cause of this imperfection of vision and how it might be remedied. If the front of our eyeballs had been flat, we should have had the power of seeing under water as clearly as in air; but instead of being flat, they are very convex, consequently our eye stamps a <b>concave</b> <b>lens</b> of high power into the water, and it is the seeing through this concave eyeglass which our eyeball makes for itself, that causes the indistinctness of our vision. Knowing the curvature of the eyeball, it is easy to calculate (as I did in the memoir mentioned above) the curvature of a convex lens of flint-glass that should, when plunged into water, produce effects of an exactly equal and contrary value, exactly neutralizing the effects of the concave eyeglass of water, if it were held immediately in front of the pupil of the eye. I have made several experiments with a view to obtaining serviceable spectacles, for seeing under water. The result is as follows:--experience has shown the distance from the eyeball at which spectacle-glasses can be most conveniently placed; now at that distance, the joint effect of the concave water-lens and the convex glass spectacle-lens, is to produce an opera-glass of exceedingly low magnifying power, that requires a small adjustment for accurate definition at different distances.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the things}} cited by Zucchi in his 1652 book [...] "Optica philosophia experimentis et ratione a fundamentis constituta" [...] is his claim of {{exploring}} {{the idea of a}} reflecting telescope in 1616. Zucchi described an experiment he did with a <b>concave</b> <b>lens</b> and a bronze parabolic mirror he found in a cabinet of curiosities. Zucchi used the <b>concave</b> <b>lens</b> as an eyepiece, trying to observe the focused image produced by the mirror to see if it would work like a telescope. Although Zucchi described the mirror as [...] "ab experto et accuratissimo artifice elaboratum nactus" [...] (fabricated by an experienced craftsman) he apparently did not get a satisfactory image with it, possibly due to the mirror not being accurate enough to focus an image, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the view. Zucchi abandoned the idea. If Niccolò Zucchi's claim of exploring the idea of a reflecting telescope in 1616 was true, then it would be the earliest known description of the idea of using a curved mirror as an image forming objective, predating Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Francesco Sagredo's discussions of the same idea in the 1620s.|$|E

The mold {{for the formation of}} the PDMS lenses is fabricated by photopolymerizing a polyacrylamide (PAAm) pre-hydrogel. The shrinkage of PAAm after its polymerization forms <b>concave</b> <b>lenses.</b> The lenses are then transferred to PDMS by a single step molding to form PDMS microlens array on a flat substrate.
