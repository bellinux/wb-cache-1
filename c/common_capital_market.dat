Over dinner in July 1968 the friends decided that what was needed was a non-partisan Institute which would research such proposals and report on them to the political world and the wider public; the Institute for Fiscal Studies was formally launched on 21 May 1969 with Hopper as founder chairman. The Institute also had undeclared objectives of improving procedures for changing taxation, and making taxation more rational. While at Hill Samuel, he became involved in examining the possibility of the Common Market developing a <b>Common</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Market</b> which might include the United Kingdom; he knew this would transform the operation of the London capital markets. In 1975, Hopper left Hill Samuel to become a director of Morgan Grenfell. He was awarded the 'Deal of the Year' by Institutional Investor magazine in 1976 for his handling of a bond issue for the European Investment Bank.|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{constructed}} under {{the principle of}} subsidiarity. Political intervention should therefore happen primarily on a local level. With this in mind, we {{take a closer look}} at the policy field “financial reporting ” and attempt to answer the question whether the current accounting regulation in Europe can be justified with the theory of fiscal federalism. For our analysis we use criteria derived from comparative accounting literature: a) The member states ’ legal systems, b) the macro and micro-structure of European capital markets, c) taxation and d) financial stability (inflation). We conclude that local solutions in accounting are preferable for small and medium sized companies while big, listed firms rather need a central solution. This is due to locally different business environments in Europe on the one hand and an increasingly <b>common</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> across the EU on the other hand. 1...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the central}} {{conclusions}} that emerges from this thesis is that countries with large funded pension systems are {{in the long run}} negatively affected by the fact that other countries have extensive PAYG schemes. This is especially the case when PAYG countries use government debt to finance their pension burden. High levels of government debt may lead to inflationary pressures. In a monetary union like the EMU it will therefore be important for funded countries that the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are met and that the ECB is independent, credible and transparent. The thesis also shows that pension reform in a PAYG country can have adverse consequences for countries with funded pension schemes. In a <b>common</b> <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> like the EU, it would therefore be in the interest of funded countries that pension reform is not decided upon in isolation by separate member countries, but that there is some coordination or even centralisation of decision making. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore a}} dynamic commons problem {{and assess the}} welfare {{consequences}} of access to <b>capital</b> <b>markets.</b> The <b>commons</b> has a high intrinsic rate of return but its fruits cannot be secured by individual agents. <b>Capital</b> <b>market</b> access allows resources to be held securely and intertemporally transferred, but at a lower rate of return. In a two period model, we completely characterise symmetric consumption and extraction behaviour in four environments: un- der a strategic and a competitive equilibrium concept, and with and without market access. Strategic equilibria dominate competitive ones: while agents disagree over how to divide the resource, all would prefer it to be larger; the strategic concept allows them to anticipate returns to their conservation. As the number of agents becomes infinite, the strategic outcome converges to the competitive; {{as the number of}} agents falls to one, it converges to the planner's. Market access has a positive effect on welfare owing to its con- sumption and extraction smoothing properties and a negative effect owing to its creation of an outside option to the commons, encouraging its depletion. A sufficient condition for autarky to dominate market access for some levels of communal endowment is that the world market discount factor exceed the subjective discount factor. Multiple equilibria may arise: these result from market access, not the equilibrium concept.

Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes have been available since 1939 but are being replaced by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The Global Industry Classifications Standard (GICS) -super-SM system, jointly developed by Standard & Poor's and Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), is popular among financial practitioners, whereas the Fama and French [1997] algorithm is used primarily by academics. Our results show that GICS classifications are significantly better at explaining stock return comovements, as well as cross-sectional variations in valuation multiples, forecasted and realized growth rates, research and development expenditures, and various key financial ratios. The GICS advantage is consistent from year to year and is most pronounced among large firms. The other three methods differ little from each other in most applications.

The Great Recession brought attention to a tragedy of the <b>commons</b> in <b>capital</b> <b>markets,</b> in which market participants, from the first-time homebuyer to Wall Street financiers, acted in ways beneficial to themselves individually, but which together caused substantial collective harm. Two kinds of risk are at play in complex chains of transactions in financial markets: ordinary market risk and systemic risk. Two moral questions are relevant in such cases. First, from the standpoint of interactional morality, does a person have a moral duty to avoid risk of harm to others if their financial transactions contribute in some way, however small, to the loss or harm? This article identifies the conditions in which persons are morally responsible in such cases. Second, from the standpoint of institutional morality, how should society distribute the risk of harm associated with massively complex financial markets?

The euro has fostered the transformation of financial systems toward a more market based approach. Its impact in Eastern Europe will be even stronger. To ensure the success of EMU an active and open-market stance is required. The euro increases the cost of failure and thus provides a strong incentive to comply.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} connections between shifting notions of money and values in contemporary Romania {{as a way to}} analyze the unfolding economic, political, and social changes during postsocialism. It is based on the ethnographic analysis of disputes following the collapse of several mutual funds during the late 1990 s. Such ongoing disputes have taken the form of public protests, petitions to state authorities, media interventions, suggestions to improve regulations regarding the <b>capital</b> <b>market,</b> and, most conspicuously, legal actions against those responsible for the bankruptcies and for compensation to the investors whose money was lost. I situate such contentious interactions within histories of institutional importation after the end of socialism, such as the emerging <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s, the electronic market created soon after that with support from USAID, the mutual fund sector growing at the end of the 1990 s, and the regulatory reform of the <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> with Romania’s accession into the European Union in 2007. My informants were living not only a postsocialist transition to capitalism but also a neoliberal transformation in the global architecture of financial capitalism, and a reorganization of the state with its inclusion into the EU. I found that an ethos of chary opportunism was emerging both as a response to and as a catalyst of the economic transformations experienced by my interlocutors. I also argue that, as the financial instruments materializing indexical and performative forms of money engendered volatile registers of value <b>common</b> for the <b>capital</b> <b>market,</b> my informants faced growing economic uncertainties through a wary form of opportunistic conduct, the appeal to courts for solving key disputes about money and its value, and constant demands to the state to mitigate risks and the effects of the market. Their outlook makes it easier to understand that change is not determined by pre-existing configurations of values, but is often the result of attempts to apply previously tested routines to new situations. Change happens while many are still looking backwards, and the past enters the present not as continuity but as a template replicated instrumentally in situations of radical uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} the <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> {{efficiency}} is a central notion {{in the financial markets}} theory. This notion is generally useful to describe a <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> in which is relevant information. If relevant information is completely processed by the <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> price mechanism then such <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> is called to be efficient. Thus the <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> efficiency accentuates the informational efficiency of <b>capital</b> <b>markets.</b> It means that in the efficient <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> investors cannot expect achieving of enormous returns by long time. In other words, the <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> is efficient if the fluctuations of returns in time are unpredictable. Thus a time series of such fluctuations can be generated by some derivations of Brownian motion. Considering long range macroeconomic forces which are non-extensive, we use Tsallis’s approach for maximum entropy formulating. By this way it is possible to obtain fat tailed distributions by power laws optimizing Tsallis’s entropy and to give some theoretical base to some stylized facts on <b>capital</b> <b>markets.</b> For the estimating of the <b>capital</b> <b>market</b> efficiency is used the notion Tsallis entropy (information gain) ...|$|R
