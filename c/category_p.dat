The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate their association with sociodemographic and -economic characteristics in a general population of French adults. METHODS:Dietary intake was assessed using at least six 24 -hour dietary records collected during a 2 -year period from 4, 574 subjects aged 45 - 60 years who participated in the SU. VI. MAX cohort study from 1995 to 1997. Compliance with the meat/seafood/egg (1 - 2 servings/day) and the specific seafood (> or = 2 servings/week) recommendations, variety and daily costs were compared across sociodemographic and -economic categories using logistic regression and covariance analyses. RESULTS:Compliance with the sea- food recommendation was associated with older age (p(trend) < 0. 0001), higher education level (p(trend) = 0. 0002) and higher occupational <b>category</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 007). The variety of meat/seafood/egg intake was positively correlated with higher occupational <b>category</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 02) and not living alone (p = 0. 01). The meat/seafood/egg budget spent on white meat was higher for younger subjects (p(trend) = 0. 007) with a lower education level (p(trend) = 0. 001) and occupational <b>category</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 0006).

OBJECTIVES: To investigate and compare the dental changes {{associated with the use}} of monoblock and duoblock appliances. METHODS: Fifty-two pretreatment and follow-up study models of patients from a public hospital and private dental clinic were assessed. Seventeen subjects used a soft elastomeric monoblock appliance (MB), 29 subjects used a hard acrylic duoblock (DB) and six subjects wore a monoblock followed by a duoblock appliance (MB-DB). Measurements of dental and arch changes were obtained and analysed on study models and standardised bitewing radiographs. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction was observed in the maxillary intercanine distance in all splint categories, with DB users showing the greatest decrease (p < 0. 05). The change in the mandibular intercanine distances differed according to splint <b>categories</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05). MB and MB-DB patients demonstrated a decrease in this measurement variable, whereas an increase was seen in DB users. A statistically significant increase in the mandibular intermolar distance was also observed in all splint <b>categories</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05), with DB users showing the greatest increase.

40|$|Background—Elevated {{levels of}} C-reactive protein (CRP) are {{associated}} with an increased risk of coronary events, but whether inflammation is associated with inducible ischemia in patients with stable coronary disease is unknown. Methods and Results—We recruited patients with known coronary disease from 2 VA Medical Centers and 1 University-based medical center for the Heart and Soul Study. We measured CRP levels in 118 participants who had exercise-induced ischemia and in 111 who did not have inducible ischemia, as determined by stress echocardiography. We used logistic regression to examine the risk of exercise-induced ischemia associated with elevated CRP. We found that 75 % (39 / 52) of participants in the highest CRP category (0. 38 mg/dL) had inducible ischemia, compared with 45 % (79 / 177) in the lower 4 categories combined (adjusted odds ratio 4. 2; 95 % confidence interval 1. 6 to 11; P 0. 004). However, this association differed in users and nonusers of -blockers and statins. Among 89 participants who did not use -blockers, 93 % in the highest CRP category had exercise-induced ischemia, compared with 42 % in the lower 4 <b>categories</b> (<b>P</b> 0. 03).

40|$|Triage is {{the formal}} nursing {{assessment}} of all patients who present to an Emergency Department (ED). The National Triage Scale (NTS) {{is used in}} most Australian EDs. Triage decision making involves the allocation of every patient presenting to an ED {{to one of the}} five NTS categories. The NTS directly relates a triage category to illness or injury severity and need for emergency care. Triage nurses’ decisions not only have the potential to impact on the health outcomes of ED patients, they are also used, in part, to evaluate ED performance and allocate components of ED funding. This study was a correlational study that used survey methods. Triage decisions were classified as ‘expected triage’, ‘overtriage’ or ‘undertriage’ decisions. Participant’s qualifications were allocated to five categories: ‘nil’; ‘emergency nursing’; ‘critical care nursing’; ‘midwifery’; and ‘tertiary’ qualifications. There was no correlation between triage decisions and length of experience in emergency nursing or triage. ‘Expected triage’ decisions were more common when the predicted triage category was <b>Category</b> 3 (<b>P</b> < 0. 001) and ‘overtriage’ decisions were less common when the predicted triage category was <b>Category</b> 2 (<b>P</b> < 0. 0010).

Our objective {{was to investigate the}} impact of actual environmental temperature on lithium serum levels. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using available records of lithium serum levels for the period between January 1995 and July 2004, obtained from three large teaching hospitals in The Netherlands. Lithium serum levels were linked to season and average daily temperature data obtained from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. An analysis was performed on all lithium serum levels not accounting for the intra-individual dependency of lithium serum levels. The association between season, temperature and both absolute lithium serum level and the frequency of potentially toxic serum levels was investigated. A mixed model analysis, accounting for intra-individual dependency of lithium serum levels, was performed. Results:A total of 41, 102 lithium serum levels (3, 054 patients) were included. A significant difference in mean lithium serum levels across seasons (p < 0. 001) and temperature <b>categories</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 001) was found, peaking in summer [0. 761 mmol/L, +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) 0. 002] and at temperatures of 15 - 20 degrees C [0. 762 mmol/L (+/- SEM 0. 005) ], and at a minimum in winter [0. 748 mmol/L (+/- SEM 0. 002) ] and at < 0 degrees C [0. 741 mmol/L (+/- SEM 0. 005) ].

Here, we evaluated the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and MetS in euthyroid middle-aged subjects in a large cohort. MethodsA retrospective analysis of 13, 496 euthyroid middle-aged subjects who participated in comprehensive health examinations was performed. Subjects were grouped according to thyroid stimulating hormone, total triiodothyronine (T 3), total thyroxine (T 4), and T 3 -to-T 4 ratio quartile categories. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) for MetS according to thyroid hormone quartiles using logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. ResultsOf the study patients, 12 % (n= 1, 664) had MetS. A higher T 3 level and T 3 -to-T 4 ratio were associated with unfavourable metabolic profiles, such as higher body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin, and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The proportion of participants with MetS increased across the T 3 quartile <b>categories</b> (<b>P</b> for trend < 0. 001) and the T 3 -to-T 4 ratio quartile <b>categories</b> (<b>P</b> for trend < 0. 001). The multi-variate-adjusted OR (95 % confidence interval) for MetS in the highest T 3 quartile group was 1. 249 (1. 020 to 1. 529) compared to the lowest T 3 quartile group, and that in the highest T 3 -to-T 4 ratio quartile group was 1. 458 (1. 141 to 1. 863) compared to the lowest T 3 -to-T 4 ratio quartile group, even after adjustment for potential confounders.

Sixteen pathologists of the European Working Group for Breast Screening Pathology reviewed the core biopsies of breast cancers treated with NAC and recorded the clinico-pathological findings (histological type and grade; estrogen, progesterone receptors, and HER 2 status; Ki 67; mitotic count; tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; necrosis) and data regarding the pathological response in corresponding surgical resection specimens. Analyses were carried out in a cohort of 490 cases by comparing the groups of patients showing pathological complete response (pCR) and partial response (pPR) with the group of non-responders (pathological non-response: pNR). Among other parameters, the lobular histotype and the absence of inflammation were significantly more common in pNR (p < 0. 001). By ROC curve analyses, cut-off values of 9 mitosis/ 2 mm(2) and 18 % of Ki 67 -positive cells best discriminated the pNR and pCR + pPR <b>categories</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 018 and < 0. 001, respectively).

In the Luminal B/HER 2 - subgroup, a mitotic count < 9, although not statistically significant, showed an OR of 2. 7 of pNR. A lobular histotype and the absence of inflammation were independent predictors of pNR (p = 0. 024 and < 0. 001, respectively). Classical morphological parameters, such as lobular histotype and inflammation, confirmed their predictive value in response to NAC, particularly in the Luminal B/HER 2 - subgroup, which is a challenging breast cancer subtype from a therapeutic point of view.

Assuming {{well-known}} observations that relate the <b>categories</b> <b>P</b> and V {{on the one}} hand (see Chomsky 1970, 1981, Demirdache & Uribe-Etxebarria 2000, Hale & Keyser 2002, and Svenonius 2003, 2007, 2008, among others), and P and C on the other (see den Besten 1983, Emonds 1985, Kayne 2000, and van Riemsdijk 1978) I argue that some non-finite verbs —in particular, past participles and gerunds— incorporate a preposition {{as a result of the}} interaction between the categories C and T, which can manifest itself as a species of P in non-finte contexts (see Demirdache & Uribe- Etxebarria 2000, and Pesetsky & Torrego 2004). This approach not only explains different syntactic facts concerning non-finite clauses, but also sheds some light on their interpretive intricacies...|$|R
