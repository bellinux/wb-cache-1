Furthermore, the paper sheds light on the questions: to what extent and by what combination of host country, subsidiary-related and MNC structural and organizational factors do situations develop in which a subsidiary loses its charter.

40|$|A {{study of}} mean birth weight, small-for-gestational-age infants, and preterm birth was {{conducted}} at the US Marine Corps Base at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where drinking water was contaminated with volatile organic compounds. Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) was the predominant contaminant. The authors used multiple linear and logistic regression to analyze 1968 – 1985 data from 11, 798 birth certificates. Overall, at most weak associations were observed between PCE exposure and study outcomes. However, associations were found between PCE exposure and birth-weight outcomes for infants of older mothers and mothers with histories of fetal <b>loss.</b> <b>Adjusted</b> mean birth-weight differences between PCE-exposed and unexposed infants were – 130 g (90 % confidence interval (CI) : – 236, – 23) for mothers aged 35 years or older and – 104 g (90 % CI: – 174, – 34) for mothers with two or more previous fetal <b>losses.</b> <b>Adjusted</b> odds ratios for PCE exposure and small-for-gestational-age infants were 2. 1 (90 % CI: 0. 9, 4. 9) for older mothers and 2. 5 (90 % CI: 1. 5, 4. 3) for mothers with two or more prior fetal losses.
