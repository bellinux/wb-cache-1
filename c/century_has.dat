Although initial colonization of the province revolved mostly around homesteading, the last <b>century</b> <b>has</b> seen a shift towards urbanization; Manitoba is the only Canadian province with over fifty-five percent of its population located in a single city.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, the {{flexible}} fiberoptic bronchoscope {{had become an}} indispensable instrument within the pulmonology and anesthesia communities. The digital revolution of the 21st <b>century</b> <b>has</b> brought newer technology to the art and science of tracheal intubation. Several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as the CMOS active pixel sensor (CMOS APS) to generate {{a view of the}} glottis so that the trachea may be intubated.|$|E

Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied to metals that floated on water (lithium, sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Only recently, since the mid-20th <b>century,</b> <b>has</b> it been widely {{used to refer to}} elements with intermediate or borderline properties between metals and nonmetals.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th <b>century</b> <b>has</b> often been called the Heroic Age of polar exploration.

5|$|The {{spread of}} English from {{the latter half}} of the 20th <b>century</b> <b>has</b> been helped in part by the {{cultural}} and economic influence of the United States, itself originally formed from British colonies.

5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, {{a series of}} lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth <b>century</b> <b>has</b> led to a renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.|$|E
5|$|Canada is {{recognized}} as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations, and through the work of numerous federal institutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th <b>century</b> <b>has</b> {{played a major role}} in its global image. The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.|$|E
5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th <b>century</b> <b>has</b> reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth <b>century</b> <b>has</b> been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Filipino and English are the {{official}} languages of the country. Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog, spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English {{are used in}} government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides {{for the promotion of}} Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth <b>century,</b> <b>has</b> since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages.|$|E
5|$|Military {{camouflage}} was {{spurred by}} the increasing range and accuracy of firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with the rifle made personal concealment in battle a survival skill. In the 20th century, military camouflage developed rapidly, especially during the First World War. On land, artists such as André Mare designed camouflage schemes and observation posts disguised as trees. At sea, merchant ships and troop carriers were painted in dazzle patterns that were highly visible, but designed to confuse enemy submarines as to the target's speed, range, and heading. During and after the Second World War, a variety of camouflage schemes were used for aircraft and for ground vehicles in different theatres of war. The use of radar since the mid-20th <b>century</b> <b>has</b> largely made camouflage for fixed-wing military aircraft obsolete.|$|E
