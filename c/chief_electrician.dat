The captain attempted to beach her but was unsuccessful in reaching the island as the engines failed with the ship about three miles offshore. The attacks continued and survivors jumped overboard in an attempt to swim to the island, a process that took about ten hours. Those that reached the island arrived in scattered groups, assembled and began searching for others. They found four dead and that many were missing. In the mid-morning of 20 February H.M.A.S. Warrnambool, having rescued some of the missing crew, picked up the main body of survivors.
