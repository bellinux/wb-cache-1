40|$|Abstract. Carbon fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (CFRP), {{which are}} now used in some aerospace applications, is difficult to cut and drill holes in. Moreover, no reports have focused on selecting a suitable drilling method for each aerospace part. This paper discusses many methods of hole generation for CFRP composites, including methods using traditional drill tools and non-traditional methods such as abrasive water jet (AWJ), laser beam and abrasive blast. We look at traditional <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>material</b> tools, polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tools, diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated tools and ceramic tools. Then, comparing the experimental results of these methods from the viewpoints of characteristics, efficiency, cost, and hole quality, we investigate each problem to select the suitable drilling method. As a result, we propose a novel method to strategically obtain the best solutions to generate holes in aerospace parts...|$|E
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} hardness of the constitutive phases in WC-Co composites is {{investigated by}} combining experimental and statistical analysis nanoindentation techniques. It {{is done on}} the basis of considering the <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>material</b> as effectively heterogeneous at the microstructure scale, i. e. consisting of three phases defined by either different chemical nature (carbides and binder) or distinct carbide crystal orientation (i. e. with surface normal perpendicular to either basal or prismatic planes).

Besides the evidence of crystal anisotropy for the WC phase, they permit to identify and account the expected strengthening of the plastic-constrained metallic binder, a critical input parameter for hardness and toughness modelling as well as for microstructural design optimization of ceramic composites reinforced by ductile metallic ligaments.

The work {{is part of}} developing a new tribological wear test method for cemented carbide drill bit inserts. The test method has earlier been judged successful in mimicking the rotary-percussive rock drilling process because it gives the same wear mechanisms as have been observed for inserts used in rock drilling. During testing the cemented carbide drill bit insert is pressed against a moving rock surface while water and particles {{are added to the}} contact area.

Since tungsten is typical rare metal, establishment of recycle process of tungsten carbide tools and restore into <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>material</b> bring great impact to metal manufacturing industry. Recently, recycle process of tungsten carbide has been developed and established gradually. However, the demands for quality of cemented carbide tool are quite severe because hardness, toughness, anti-wear ability, heat resistance, fatigue strength and so on should be guaranteed for precision machining and tool life. Currently, {{it is hard to}} restore the recycled tungsten carbide powder entirely as raw material for new processed cemented carbide tool. In this study, to suggest positive use of recycled tungsten carbide powder, we have tried to fabricate a carbon based sintered steel which shows reinforced mechanical properties with recycled tungsten carbide powder. We have made set of newly designed sintered steels. Compression test of sintered specimen in density ratio of 0. 85 (which means 15 % porosity inside) has been conducted. As results, at least 1. 7 times higher in nominal strength in the amount of 7. 0 wt. % was shown in recycled WC powder. The strength reached to over 600 MPa for the Fe-WC-Co-Cu sintered alloy. Wear test has been conducted by using ball-on-disk type friction tester using 5 mm diameter ball with normal force of 2 N in the dry conditions. Wear amount after 1, 000 m running distance shows that about 1. 5 times longer life was shown in designed sintered alloy.

40|$|<b>Cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> are {{multiphase}} <b>materials</b> {{composed of}} refractory metal carbides e. g. WC, TiC {{embedded in a}} metallic binder (Co, Ni, Fe). Due to their high hardness and superior wear resistance, <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> {{are used in the}} production of tools for cutting, machining and milling. Because <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> are brittle and expensive materials, it can be favourable to join them to steel substrates, e. g. in case of saw blades for wood machining applications, where <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> are used as saw tooth tip. Welding of dissimilar materials such as steel and <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> (hardmetals, cermets) is particularly challenging because mismatches in their thermal expansion coefficients and thermal conductivities result in build-up of residual stress as well as the formation of brittle intermetallic phases (e. g.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis explores the structure, alloying and stability of the carbides in the Co-Cr-C system by using the CALPHAD approach supported by experimental measurements and ab initio calculations. WC-Co based <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>materials</b> consist of hard WC grains and a ductile Co-based binder. Cr is usually added to <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> {{for the purpose of}} reducing grain growth during sintering or to increase corrosion resistance. The Co-Cr-C system is highly relevant for Cr-containing <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides.</b> For example, it determines the allowable C-content interval in the quaternary W-Co-Cr-C system with respect to the formation of unwanted Cr-based carbides. The CALPHAD method is based on critical assessment of model parameters constituting phenomenological expressions of the Gibbs energy and its derivatives, e. g. enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity. A thermodynamic assessment based on the CALPHAD method relies heavily on the available experimental or ab initio calculated information. The crystal structures of Cr 23 C 6 and Cr 3 C 2 have previously been accurately determined. However, various authors reported different crystal structures for the Cr 7 C 3 carbide. A combined experimental and ab initio investigation of the crystal structure of Cr 7 C 3 and M 7 C 3 (M=Co,Cr) was thus performed. Furthermore, the stabilities of all end-member compounds of the mixed carbide at 0 K were determined by ab initio calculations. Available experimental information on phase equilibria with carbides in the Co-Cr-C system was found to be insufficient to describe all the features in the phase diagram. Therefore, the liquid + M 23 C 6 + M 7 C 3 and M 7 C 3 + M 3 C 2 + graphite equilibria (M=Co,Cr) were investigated experimentally with focus on the solubility of Co in the M 23 C 6, M 7 C 3 and M 3 C 2 carbides. Finally, a reassessment of the thermodynamic description of the Co-Cr-C system was performed, which resulted in a set of thermodynamic models and parameters that accurately describe all of the considered information. Applied experimental methods and theoretical models are explained throughout the thesis. Important examples from the appended papers are also given. QC 20140212 </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of microstructure on the ultraprecision grinding response {{of a series}} of <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> for spherical mirrors was characterized by means of optical and laser interferometry, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Xray diffraction. Surface roughness, form accuracy, grinding-induced residual stress and material removal behaviors were studied as a function of tungsten carbide (WC) grain size. In connection with the removal mechanisms in ultraprecision grinding, microindentations performed on each material showed similar deformation patterns, all in the plastic regime. The microstructure of WC-Co materials was found to have little influence on the nanometre surface roughness and submicron form accuracy. However, the X-ray stress measurements indicated that the microstructure of <b>carbide</b> <b>materials</b> had a significant influence on the grinding-induced residual stresses; i. e. an increase in grinding-induced residual compressive stress with an decrease in WC grain size. No grinding-induced cracks were observed in the ground <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> surfaces.

This thesis is a computational study of interfaces in WC [...] Co, WC [...] Fe, and WC [...] Ni <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides.</b> Density functional theory is used to calculate interface energies and the local chemistry of interfaces is varied by altering the termination of WC planes and by substitution of W and C atoms for binder phase atoms.

Nickel {{is one of the}} materials most commonly used as a binder alternative to cobalt in these metal-ceramic composites. However, knowledge on mechanical properties and particularly on fatigue behavior of Ni-base <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> is relatively scarce. In this study, the fatigue mechanics and mechanisms of a fine grained WC-Ni grade is assessed. In doing so, fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior and fatigue limit are determined, and the attained results are compared to corresponding fracture toughness and flexural strength. An analysis of the results within a fatigue mechanics framework permits to validate FCG threshold as the effective fracture toughness under cyclic loading. Experimentally determined data are then used to analyze the fatigue susceptibility of the studied material. It is found that the fatigue sensitivity of the WC-Ni hardmetal investigated is close to that previously reported for Co-base <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> with alike binder mean free path. Additionally, fracture modes under stable and unstable crack growth conditions are inspected. It is evidenced that stable crack growth under cyclic loading within the nickel binder exhibit faceted, crystallographic features.

The process of drilling of carbon fibre composites in aircraft manufacture is economically important since the extremely abrasive nature of the fibres limits drill life. The hole quality produced by drilling in terms of fibre pullout and matrix cracking affects the notch sensitivity of the hole. The present thesis describes an experimental and analytical study of drilling of the carbon fibre composites carried out {{with the support of}} British Aerospace (Military Aircraft Division). Full drill life testing was carried out using four low cost commercial <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> drills, three of which had brazed inserts, and drill life was determined by measuring the outer drill corner wear. Hole quality was measured in terms of diametrical tolerance using accurate plug gauges. Drill forces were measured using a two component Kistler dynamometer and attempts were made to measure residual stress in the workpiece using the birefringent photoelastic technique. The hole quality was related to drill wear, cutting forces and heat generated during drilling. Independent tasks were carried out to relate <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> physical and mechanical properties to wear using several standard sliding wear experiments. Three different <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> tool <b>materials</b> were investigated in terms of cobalt layer thickness, carbide distribution and physical properties including hardness and fracture toughness. Independent sliding wear tests were performed using a Pin-on-Disc machine, lathe and machining centre. These tests allowed the materials to be ranked in terms of wear resistance when rubbing against carbon fibre composite. The fracture toughness was measured using the techniques developed by Palmqvist. The wear resistance was correlated to the physical and mechanical properties of the tool materials. Hole quality was studied experimentally using scanning electron microscopy and fibre pullout shown to be primarily dependent on the fibre-matrix interface bond strength and the intrinsic strength of the fibres. The surface morphology of the fractured fibres in areas of fibre pullout showed inultimode damage due to anisotropy of the carbon fibre composite and the dynamics of drilling. The degree and pattern of damage developed in the drilled holes was found to be highly directionally dependent.

They are powdermetallurgically manufactured, where liquid-phase sintering {{is one of the}} main steps. The most common <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> consists of WC and Co and it is widely used for cutting tools. Two of the most important factors controlling the mechanical properties are the WC grain size and the grain size distribution and thus it is of great interest to understand the grain growth behavior. In this thesis the grain growth during sintering at 1430 °C is studied both experimentally and through computer simulations. The grain growth behavior in <b>cemented</b> <b>carbides</b> cannot be explained from the classical LSW-theory. The WC grains have a faceted shape necessitating growth by 2 -D nucleation of new atomic layers or surface defects. A new model based on 2 -D nucleation, long-range diffusion and interface friction is formulated. Three powders having different average sizes are studied and both experiments and simulations show that a fine-grained powder may grow past a coarse-grained powder, indicating that abnormal grain growth has taken place in the fine-grained powder. Fine-grained powders with various fractions of large grains are also studied and it is seen that a faster growth is obtained with increasing fraction of large grains and that an initially slightly bimodal powder can approach the logaritmic normal distribution after long sintering times. The grain size measurements are performed on 2 -D sections using image analysis on SEM images or EBSD analysis. Since the growth model is based on 3 -D size distributions the 2 -D size distributions have to be transformed to 3 -D, and a new method, Inverse Saltykov, is proposed. The 2 -D size distribution is first represented with kernel estimators and the 3 -D size distribution is optimized in an iterative manner. In this way both negative values in the 3 -D size distribution and modifications of the raw data are avoided. QC 2011042...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of welding WC-Co <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> to Cr 12 cold-working steel via microwave energy was investigated. <b>Cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> powders were directly consolidated on clean Cr 12 substrate surface and then heated at high temperatures in a multimode microwave furnace. The {{results show that}} under appropriate conditions such as 103 °C/min heating rate, 1000 - 1100 °C temperature and bellow 10 min soaking time, the <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> can effectively be welded on the Cr 12 substrate, and the whole processing cycle is approximately 20 min. SEM measurements reveal the formation of clean boundaries and the atomic diffusion from Cr 12 to WC-Co.
