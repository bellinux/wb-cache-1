5000|$|Hunt's {{contributions}} to sound recording have {{been compared to}} Sabine's {{contributions to}} room acoustics, in that both were initiated by a pragmatic short-term request from a President of Harvard. [...] Hunt was asked, in 1935, to record the tercentenary celebrations at Harvard. [...] He discovered that the relatively high mass (50g) of existing phonograph needles limited their ability to reproduce high frequencies. Using a relatively new recording medium (discs coated in <b>cellulose</b> <b>lacquer),</b> Hunt and his colleague J.A. Pierce developed recording needles of less than 5g mass, with substantially improved audio quality.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of different heat treatment and varnish application combinations on hardness, scratch resistance, and glossiness of wood materials sampled from limba (Terminalia superba), iroko (Chlorophora excelsa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), and Anatolian chestnut (Castenea sativa Mill.) species. The heat treatment was applied at two levels (150 and 180 oC) for both 3 and 6 hour periods. After the heat treatment, four types of varnish (<b>cellulose</b> <b>lacquer,</b> synthetic varnish, polyurethane varnish, and water based varnish) were applied, and hardness, scratch resistance, and glossiness of varnish film layers of the treated woods were measured. The effects of heat treatment and varnish combination applications on above mentioned variables were analyzed according to the study design (factorial design with 4 (species) x 2 (heat) x 2 (duration) x 4 (varnish) = 64 experimental units) with 10 samples for each combination of parameters. Glossiness increased on wood samples for all of the four wood species treated with <b>cellulose</b> <b>lacquer</b> and synthetic varnish and across all heating treatments. However, glossiness values were decreased for all the wood species depending on heating temperature and time. Values of hardness and scratch resistance were also decreased for all the four wood species across all the treatment combinations. The results were obtained from the upper surface of the application process and are thought to contribute to the national economy...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{developed}} various colored ethyl cellulose lacquers that compare favorably with standard nitrocellulose lacquers in physical tests. Ultra violet light caused rather pronounced darkening of the lighter colors such as white and light yellow, probably because {{of the use of}} high amounts of phenolic resin. Also {{because of the presence of}} relatively large amounts of phenolic resin, the cost was somewhat higher than a comparable nitrocellulose lacquer. Suggestions for further work and improvement are included. An ethyl <b>cellulose</b> <b>lacquer</b> has also been developed to be applied by spray or brush to ethyl cellulose plastics with a minimum amount of deleterious effects such as warping and decreasing of flexibility. Good color and gloss were obtained by use of proper resin combinations. With low ethyl cellulose content it was found necessary to clean the plastic surface mechanically because the remaining traces of die lubricant were apparently incompatible with the lacquer and caused subsequent flatting action and loss of gloss of the lacquer...|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve a}} {{reliable}} radiocarbon (14 C) date for an object, any contamination {{that may be}} of a different age must be removed prior to dating. Samples that have been conserved with treatments such as adhesives, varnishes or consolidants can pose a particular challenge to 14 C dating. At the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU), common examples of such substances encountered include shellac, the acrylic polymers Paraloid B- 67 and B- 72, and vinyl acetate-derived polymers (e. g. PVA). Here, a non-carbon-containing absorbent substrate called Chromosorb® was deliberately contaminated {{with a range of}} varieties or brands of these conservation treatments, as well as two <b>cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquers.</b> A selection of chemical pretreatments was tested for their efficiency at removing them. While the varieties of shellac and Paraloid tested were completely removed with some treatments (water/methanol and acetone/methanol/chloroform sequential washes, respectively), no method was found that was capable of completely removing any of the vinyl acetate-derived materials or the <b>cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquers.</b> While Chromosorb is not an exact analog of archaeological wood or bone, for example, this study suggests that {{it may be possible to}} remove aged shellac and Paraloid from archaeological specimens with standard organic solvent-acid-base-acid pretreatments, but it may be significantly more difficult to remove vinyl acetate-derived polymers and <b>cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquers</b> sufficiently to provide reliable 14 C dates. The four categories of conservation treatment studied demonstrate characteristic FTIR spectra, while highlighting subtle chemical and molecular differences between different varieties of shellac, Paraloid and <b>cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquers,</b> and significant differences between the vinyl acetate derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} non-inflammability and their strong solvent {{properties}} the chlor compounds of the petroleum series {{have a wide}} and increasing use as degreasers of metal, cleansers of textiles, dry cleansers, solvents for rubber, tar, and gums, thinners for <b>cellulose</b> <b>lacquers,</b> and in treatment of garbage, tankage, and bones. Other uses are the production of high-grade lubricating oils from inferior stock, the production of edible and non-edible vegetable oils, the purification of explosives, and for refrigeration. The chlor compounds may be divided into three groups, namely, the saturated (paraffin) group, methane, ethane, etc.; the olefins, unsaturated, ethylene, propylene, etc.; and the naphthalenes.

40|$|The diffuse {{leaching}} {{of plant}} nutrients from agricultural soils {{is part of}} the problem of the eutrophication of fresh water systems and coastal sea waters. Among the measures taken to reduce the leaching is keeping the soil with plant cover during autumn and winter. In areas with a predominance of annual crops this can be achieved by the undersowing of catch crops. In the current work it was investigated how the time of undersowing affected the barley (Hordeum distichon L.) crop and the catch crop biomass production. As catch crops Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne Lam.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) were used. The biomass of the catch crop was markedly reduced with delayed undersowing, but net biomass production in late autumn was generally not affected. On light soil the barley yield was only to a small extent affected by the undersown catch crop, and with delayed undersowing the yield was even less affected. On heavier soil the barley yield was only marginally affected regardless of time of catch crop undersowing. An alternative to the undersowing of catch crops would be relay cropping of two cereal crops, one spring crop and one winter crop. As their initial competitive capacities are similar there is a risk that the winter crop will affect the spring crop yield adversely. To be able to set the competitive relationship between the crops favourably for the relay cropping system to be effective, a means to delay the winter crop germination is needed. Delayed undersowing has the risk of damaging the spring crop by the drilling procedur itself, and this was also noticed in the catch crop field experiments. In a couple of experiments the technique of coating seeds with polymers to achieve delayed germination was explored. The materials used were <b>cellulose</b> <b>lacquer</b> (in one experiment with the addition of lanolin) or an acrylic plastic, a so called primer. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and oil seed rape (Brassica napus L.) were coated in house with several coating levels and germinated under controlled conditions in Petri dishes. In one experiment the coated seeds were germinated under three different temperature levels and three different moisture levels. It was found that delays could be achieved and that with increasing coating level the delays increased. It was also found that at low germination temperature (5. 5 °C) for plastic coated seeds there was almost no difference in temperature sum needed from sowing to germination regardless of coating level. At high germination temperature (13. 9 °C) there was a marked increase in temperature sum needed to germination and it increased with increasing coating level in comparison with uncoated seed. The resulting germination pattern was hypothetically explained by the dependence of water and oxygen uptake on temperature, in relation to the permeability of the coating materials. The permeability of the materials was probably rather constant over the temperature range. To gain the necessary control of the desired germination delay further investigations are needed, in collaboration with other scientific disciplines...|$|E

40|$|Varnished wooden {{surfaces}} got widespread in Europe in the 17 th century; their golden era lasted till the 1930 s, when the easier applicable nitrocellulose based lacquers gradually took {{their place in}} the furniture industry. Nowadays besides furniture restoration the natural surface treating materials are newly rediscovered, polished furniture is considered fashionable and prestigious. Lacquers based on synthetic resins are relatively well documented with regard to their behavior during service, whilst few results exist about polishes this regard. Since almost every workshop used different formula for their polishes, this study investigates and compares those with significantly different composition, {{in order to determine the}} difference – if there is any – between their gloss, color brightening effect and adhesion thus allowing a purposeful choice for the users. Most of the authors dealing with surface treatment of wood describe the different characteristics such adhesion of the lacquer layer, gloss of the surface etc. being strongly dependent from the wood species the layer was applied on, accordingly our measurements were performed on two wood species: walnut (Juglans regia L.) and cherry (Prunus subg. Cerasus). Four different polish formulas were applied: french polish and three types of english polish. Haze and gloss, pencil hardness, shock resistance, adhesion and resistance against chemical impacts was tested and evaluated in comparison with the performance of nitro <b>cellulose</b> <b>lacquers</b> too.

5000|$|Arthur Eichengrün (13 August 1867 - 23 December 1949) was a German Jewish chemist, {{materials}} scientist, and inventor. He {{is known}} for developing the highly successful anti-gonorrhea drug Protargol, the standard treatment for 50 years until the adoption of antibiotics, and for his pioneering contributions in plastics: co-developing (with Theodore Becker) the first soluble cellulose acetate materials in 1903, called [...] "Cellit", and creating processes for the manufacture of these materials which were influential {{in the development of}} injection moulding. During World War I his relatively non-inflammable synthetic <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>lacquers,</b> marketed under the name [...] "Cellon", were important in the aircraft industry. He also contributed to photochemistry by inventing the first process for the production and development of cellulose acetate film, which he patented with Becker.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} way of {{preserving}} radio broadcasts during radio’s golden age {{was through the}} use of 16-inch transcription discs (also called “Electrical Transcripts” … or, ET’s). They were of various types and sizes, but the most commonly found today are 16” diameter. They are usually aluminum-based coated with <b>cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquer,</b> a thick black compound similar to that used in automotive paint from the 1920s through the '50s. They were used to create instantaneous recordings, records which could be played directly after being recorded. A large record cutting machine (essentially a phonograph with a heavy and precisely regulated turntable) was used to cut a groove into the coating to create an audio recording of the program. ET’s were usually recorded at 33 1/3 RPM, although some were recorded at 78 RPM as well. (The original discs containing KWPC’s 1947 sign-on ceremony were donated to the Musser Museum by John and Darlene Schwandke.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In late 1934, a {{new type}} of {{instantaneous}} disc was commercially introduced. It consisted of an aluminum core disc coated with black <b>cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquer,</b> although for reasons which are unclear it soon came to be called an [...] "acetate" [...] disc by radio professionals. Later, during World War II, when aluminum was a critical war material, glass core discs were used. A recording lathe and chisel-like cutting stylus like those used to record in wax would be used to engrave the groove into this lacquer surface instead. Given a top-quality blank disc, cutting stylus, lathe, electronics and recording engineer, the result was a virtually noiseless broadcast-quality recording which could be played several times before the effects of wear started to become apparent. The new medium was soon applied to a number of purposes by local stations, but not by the networks, which had a policy against broadcasting prerecorded material and mainly used the discs for archiving [...] "reference recordings" [...] of their broadcasts.|$|R

50|$|In 1903, Eichengrün co-developed {{the first}} soluble form of {{cellulose}} acetate with Theodore Becker. He went on to develop processes for the manufacture {{of cellulose acetate}} materials and devoted {{the rest of his}} life to the technical and economic development of plastics, lacquers, enamels, and artificial fibers based on cellulose acetate. During World War I his relatively non-inflammable synthetic <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>lacquers</b> were important in the aircraft industry. He also pioneered the influential technique of injection moulding. In 1904, He created and patented the first safety film with Becker, (cellulose diacetate) from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. It was used to manufacture cellulose diacetate cinematographic film, which Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres began to use in 1909. Cellulose acetate film became the standard in the 1950s, preferred over the highly flammable and unstable nitrate film (better known as celluloid).|$|R
40|$|Cellulose acetate and {{cellulose}} nitrate are the important constituents of airplane dopes in {{use at the}} present time, but planes were treated with other materials in the experimental stages of flying. The above compounds belong to the class of colloids and are of value because they produce a shrinking action on the fabric when drying out of solution, rendering it drum tight. Other colloids possessing the same property have been proposed and tried. In the first stages {{of the development of}} dope, however, shrinkage was not considered. The fabric was treated merely to render it waterproof. The first airplanes constructed were covered with cotton fabric stretched as tightly as possible over the winds, fuselage, etc., and flying was possible only in fine weather. The necessity of an airplane which would fly under all weather conditions at once became apparent. Then followed experiments with rubberized fabrics, fabrics treated with glue rendered insoluble by formaldehyde or bichromate, fabrics treated with drying and nondrying oils, shellac, casein, etc. It was found that fabrics treated as above lost their tension in damp weather, and the oil from the motor penetrated the proofing material and weakened the fabric. For the most part the film of material lacked durability. <b>Cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquers,</b> however were found to be more satisfactory under varying weather conditions, added less weight to the planes, and were easily applied. On the other hand, they were highly inflammable, and oil from the motor penetrated the film of {{cellulose nitrate}}, causing the tension of the fabric to be relaxed...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the early}} 1950s, when radio {{networks}} and local stations wanted {{to preserve a}} live broadcast, they did so by means of special phonograph records known as [...] "electrical transcriptions" [...] (ETs), made by cutting a sound-modulated groove into a blank disc. At first, in the early 1930s, the blanks varied in both size and composition, but most often they were simply bare aluminum and the groove was indented rather than cut. Typically, these very early recordings were not made by the network or radio station, but by a private recording service contracted by the broadcast sponsor {{or one of the}} performers. The bare aluminum discs were typically 10 or 12 inches in diameter and recorded at the then-standard speed of 78 rpm, which meant that several disc sides were required to accommodate even a 15-minute program. By about 1936, 16-inch aluminum-based discs coated with <b>cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquer,</b> commonly known as acetates and recorded at a speed of 33 rpm, had been adopted by the networks and individual radio stations as the standard medium for recording broadcasts. The making of such recordings, at least for some purposes, then became routine. Some discs were recorded using a [...] "hill and dale" [...] vertically modulated groove, rather than the [...] "lateral" [...] side-to-side modulation found on the records being made for home use at that time. The large slow-speed discs could easily contain fifteen minutes on each side, allowing an hour-long program to be recorded on only two discs. The lacquer was softer than shellac or vinyl and wore more rapidly, allowing only a few playbacks with the heavy pickups and steel needles then in use before deterioration became audible.|$|R
40|$|Preserving {{silver and}} bronze alloy {{cultural}} heritage objects is a monumental challenge for museums as they house thousands {{of objects that}} are sensitive to atmospheric corrosion. Metal alloy objects are currently preserved by applying <b>cellulose</b> nitrate <b>lacquers,</b> however, these coatings are limited by short lifetimes, non-uniform application, and appearance changes. This thesis describes investigations of a new method for preserving silver and bronze alloy art and cultural heritage objects using atomic layer deposition (ALD) diffusion barriers. My research focused on determining the potential of ALD films to protect cultural heritage objects while adhering to the strict requirements of art conservation, which require the coatings to minimally change object appearance, have a long effective lifetime, and be completely reversible without significant substrate alteration. ALD coatings were structurally engineered to minimize color changes on silver, silver alloys and bronze patinas by modeling the simulated reflectance spectrum of single and multilayer ALD film stacks. Optimal ALD film structures for minimal appearance change depend on the substrate, requiring different films for silver alloys and bronze. ALD films protected silver at least 15 times longer than cellulose nitrate films, for an expected lifetime of more than 100 years. ALD film porosity decreases with increasing film thickness with no correlation to “dirty” surface treatment, indicating a thick ALD film could effectively protect a non-ideal surface or real cultural heritage object. Al 2 O 3 ALD films were removed with weak solutions of NaOH, however, more Cu than Ag was removed. XPS depth profiling on combinatorial Ag-Cu alloy libraries showed Cu removal {{was limited to the}} top 2 - 3 nm of the alloy surface. ALD films can be deposited on bronze alloys and patinas with and without wax protective layers to prevent changes due to environmental exposure. Bronze patinas have a more complicate surface roughness and chemistry that causes difficulty in achieving a uniform, high quality ALD film. Plasma cleaning is an effective method to ensure high-quality ALD coatings on complex surfaces with tortuous paths, chemical heterogeneity, and topography. ALD films are promising as cultural heritage diffusion barriers as they are reversible with negligible effect on substrate composition...|$|R
