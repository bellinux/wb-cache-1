40|$|Restricting the {{cytotoxicity}} of anticancer agents by targeting receptors exclusively expressed on {{tumor cells}} is critical when treating infiltrative brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBMs express an IL- 13 receptor (IL 13 Rα 2) that {{differs from the}} physiological IL 4 R/IL 13 R receptor. We developed a regulatable adenoviral vector (Ad. mhIL- 4. TRE. mhIL- 13 -PE) encoding a mutated human IL- 13 fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin (mhIL- 13 -PE) that specifically binds to IL 13 Rα 2 to provide sustained expression, effective anti-GBM cytotoxicity, and minimal neurotoxicity. The therapeutic Ad also encodes mutated human IL- 4 that binds to the physiological IL 4 R/IL 13 R without interacting with IL 13 Rα 2, thus inhibiting potential binding of mhIL- 13 -PE to normal brain cells. Using intracranial GBM xenografts and syngeneic mouse models, we tested the Ad. mhIL- 4. TRE. mhIL- 13 -PE and two protein formulations, hIL- 13 -PE used in clinical trials (<b>Cintredekin</b> <b>Besudotox)</b> and a second-generation mhIL- 13 -PE. <b>Cintredekin</b> <b>Besudotox</b> doubled median survival without eliciting long-term survival and caused severe neurotoxicity; mhIL- 13 -PE led to ∼ 40 % long-term survival, eliciting severe neurological toxicity at the high dose tested. In contrast, Ad-mediated delivery of mhIL- 13 -PE led to tumor regression and long-term survival in over 70 % of the animals, without causing apparent neurotoxicity. Although <b>Cintredekin</b> <b>Besudotox</b> was originally developed to target GBM, when tested in a phase III trial it failed to achieve clinical endpoints and revealed neurotoxicity. Limitations of <b>Cintredekin</b> <b>Besudotox</b> include its short half-life, which demanded frequent or continued administration, and binding to IL 4 R/IL 13 R, present in normal brain cells. These shortcomings were overcome by our therapeutic Ad, thus representing a significant advance {{in the development of}} targeted therapeutics for GBM...|$|E
40|$|Convection-enhanced {{delivery}} (CED) {{is a novel}} {{drug delivery}} technique that uses positive infusion pressure to deliver therapeutic agents directly into the interstitial spaces of the brain.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} and aggressive malignant glioma (MG), with a median survival time of 12 – 15 months, despite current best treatment based on surgery, radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy. Many potentially active therapeutic agents are not effective by systemic administration, because {{they are unable to}} cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). As intracerebral administration bypasses the BBB, it increases the number of drugs that can be successfully delivered to the brain, with the possibility of minor systemic toxicity and better effectiveness. This review summarizes the results of the extensive clinical research conducted on intracerebral therapy. Biodegradable drug carriers, implantable subcutaneous reservoirs and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) represent the main techniques for intracerebral delivery, while conventional chemotherapy agents, radiolabeled antibodies and receptor-targeted toxins are the main classes of drugs for intracerebral therapy. At the present time, biodegradable carmustine wafers, commercialized as Gliadel®, are the only FDAapproved treatment for intracerebral chemotherapy of MG, but intracavitary delivery of mitoxantrone and radiolabeled antitenascin antibodies via implantable reservoirs has yielded promising results in uncontrolled trials. The pressure-driven flow generated by CED can potentially distribute convected drugs over large volumes of the brain, independently on their intrinsic diffusivity. Nevertheless, prominent technical problems, like backflow, are yet to be properly addressed and contributed to the disappointing results of two phase III trials that investigated CED of <b>cintredekin</b> <b>besudotox</b> and TransMidTM in patients with recurrent GBM...|$|E
40|$|Convection-enhanced {{delivery}} (CED) of <b>cintredekin</b> <b>besudotox</b> (CB) {{was compared}} with Gliadel wafers (GW) in adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) at first recurrence. Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive CB or GW. CB (0. 5 µg/mL; {{total flow rate}} 0. 75 mL/h) was administered over 96 hours via 2 – 4 intraparenchymal catheters placed after tumor resection. GW (3. 85 %/ 7. 7 mg carmustine per wafer; maximum 8 wafers) were placed immediately after tumor resection. The primary endpoint was overall survival {{from the time of}} randomization. Prestated interim analyses were built into the study design. Secondary and tertiary endpoints were safety and health-related quality-of-life assessments. From March 2004 to December 2005, 296 patients were enrolled at 52 centers. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment arms. Median survival was 36. 4 weeks (9. 1 months) for CB and 35. 3 weeks (8. 8 months) for GW (P =. 476). For the efficacy evaluable population, the median survival was 45. 3 weeks (11. 3 months) for CB and 39. 8 weeks (10 months) for GW (P =. 310). The adverse-events profile was similar in both arms, except that pulmonary embolism was higher in the CB arm (8 % vs 1 %, P =. 014). This is the first randomized phase III evaluation of an agent administered via CED and the first with an active comparator in GBM patients. There was no survival difference between CB administered via CED and GW. Drug distribution was not assessed and may be crucial for evaluating future CED-based therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{a devastating}} brain tumor {{with a median}} {{survival}} of 6 months after recurrence. <b>Cintredekin</b> <b>besudotox</b> (CB) is a recombinant protein consisting of interleukin- 13 (IL- 13) and a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE 38 QQR). Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a locoregional-administration method leading to high-tissue concentrations with large volume of distributions. We assessed the use of intracerebral CED to deliver CB in patients with recurrent malignant glioma (MG). Patients and Methods Three phase I clinical studies evaluated intracerebral CED of CB along with tumor resection. The main objectives were to assess the tolerability of various concentrations and infusion durations; tissue distribution; and methods for optimizing delivery. All patients underwent tumor resection followed by a single intraparenchymal infusion (in addition to the intraparenchymal one following resection), with a portion of patients who had a preresection intratumoral infusion. Results A total of 51 patients with MG were treated including 46 patients with GBM. The maximum tolerated intraparenchymal concentration was 0. 5 g/mL and tumor necrosis was observed at this concentration. Infusion durations of up to 6 days were well tolerated. Postoperative catheter placement appears to be important for optimal drug distribution. CB- and procedure-related adverse events were primarily limited to the CNS. Overall median survival for GBM patients is 42. 7 weeks and 55. 6 weeks for patients with optimally positioned catheters with patient follow-up extending beyond 5 years. Conclusion CB {{appears to have a}} favorable risk-benefit profile. CED is a complex delivery method requiring catheter placement via a second procedure to achieve accurate catheter positioning, better drug distribution, and better outcome.

The spatial distribution of 123 I-HSA was then compared to a drug distribution simulation provided by the software algorithm. The algorithm had a high sensitivity (71. 4 %) and specificity (100 %) for identifying the high proportion (7 of 14) of catheter trajectories that failed to deliver drug into the desired anatomical region (p = 0. 021). This usually occurred when catheter trajectories crossed deep sulci, resulting in leak of the infusate into the subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid space. The mean concordance of the volume of distribution at the 50 % isodose level between the actual 123 I-HSA distribution and simulation was 65. 75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 52. 0 %– 79. 5 %), and the mean maximal in-plane deviation was less than 8. 5 mm (95 % CI, 4. 0 – 13. 0 mm). The use of this simulation algorithm was considered clinically useful in 84. 6 % of catheters. Routine use of this algorithm, and its further developments, should improve prospective selection of catheter trajectories, and thereby improve the efficacy of drugs delivered by this promising technique...|$|E
