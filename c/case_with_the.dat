5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|As is the <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, {{there is some}} variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} curative effects of phacoemulsification aspiration and intraocular lens implantation {{for the treatment}} of high myopia with cataract. METHODS: From January, 2011 to December, 2012, 110 patients with high myopia cataract were selected as the research objects in our hospital. They were randomly divided into observation group(emulsification aspiration and intraocular lens implantation group, n = 56) and control group(conventional surgery group, n = 54), the visual recovery and postoperative complications were observed in two groups and a comprehensive analysis were made. RESULTS: This study showed: in observation group, 30 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> visual recovery back to above 0. 5, 24 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vision of 0. 3 - 0. 5, 2 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vision of less than 0. 3; In control group, 20 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> visual recovery back to above 0. 5, 22 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vision of 0. 3 - 0. 5, 12 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vision of less than 0. 3; The values were better than the control group, there was statistical significant differences(P P ± 0. 50 D in 10 cases(17. 9 %), <b>the</b> control group <b>with</b> postoperative refractive deviation ± 0. 50 D in 16 cases(29. 6 %), compared to the observation group and the control group, the difference was statistically significant(P CONCLUSION: The curative effects of phacoemulsification aspiration and intraocular lens implantation {{for the treatment of}} high myopia with cataract is effective, and it has the advantages of small incision, less intraocular tissue injury and short postoperative visual function recovery time. Therefore, it is an effective and safe treatment for high myopia with cataract, and it is recommended in clinical application...|$|R

5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the setbacks at the Defile, Marj Ardabil and other similar disasters, the need to reinforce the buckling frontiers stretched the military and financial resources of the Caliphate.

Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's next project, Throne of Blood, an {{adaptation}} of William Shakespeare's Macbeth—set, like Seven Samurai, in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress, Isuzu Yamada, to regard the work {{as if it were}} a cinematic version of a Japanese rather than a European literary classic. Given Kurosawa's appreciation of traditional Japanese stage acting, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the Noh theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> director's previous film. Abroad, Throne of Blood, regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not the <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the northern crested newt. Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E
5|$|Several tombs of antipopes were desecrated and destroyed, {{often by}} their rival claimants, shortly after their creation.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to do a side-by-side comparison of 10 different antibodies commonly used in the clinical laboratory altering only the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate. The automated Leica BOND-MAX platform was used to study serial sections from 203 tissues including controls compared in a blinded fashion using the HRP conjugates from Leica (Refine HRP), Ventana Medical Systems (Ultraview HRP), and Enzo Life Sciences (Polyview HRP). False-positive results, defined as signal from cases known to not contain the target, were noted in 23 (13 %) of 171 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Leica HRP, 62 (36 %) of 171 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ventana HRP, and no <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Enzo HRP.
