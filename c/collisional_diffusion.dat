40|$|Extending {{previous}} studies of nonthermal electron transport in solar flares which include the effects of <b>collisional</b> energy <b>diffusion</b> and thermalization of fast electrons, we present an analytic method to infer more accurate estimates of the accelerated electron spectrum in solar flares from observations of the hard X-ray spectrum. Unlike for the standard cold-target model, the spatial characteristics of the flaring region, especially the necessity to consider a finite volume of hot plasma in the source, {{need to be taken}} into account in order to correctly obtain the injected electron spectrum from the source-integrated electron flux spectrum (a quantity straightforwardly obtained from hard X-ray observations). We show that the effect of electron thermalization can be significant enough to nullify the need to introduce an ad hoc low-energy cutoff to the injected electron spectrum in order to keep the injected power in non-thermal electrons at a reasonable value. Rather the suppression of the inferred low-energy end of the injected spectrum compared to that deduced from a cold-target analysis allows the inference from hard X-ray observations of a more realistic energy in injected non-thermal electrons in solar flares.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the plasma {{diffusion}} processes relevant to the physical nature of the Io plasma torus at Jupiter. A knowledge of the diffusion processes involved in the Io plasma torus is essential {{to an understanding of the}} spatial structure and energetics of the torus. The only published theory of Io torus plasma diffusion, centrifugally driven flux tube interchange instability, is based on turbulent plasma interchange instability. We have examined physical properties that lead us to conclude that flux tube interchange diffusion is not a valid mechanism in the plasma torus. The collisional nature of the hot torus plasma is seen through its observed EUV emissions which dominate the energy loss from the system. Further, the torus plasma parameters fall in the range of values satisfying the criteria for the use of collisional transport theory to derive a <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient. The collisional nature of the torus plasma is characterized in the long mean free path regime where classical transport theory breaks down. We study the Chapman-Enskog method of calculating the plasma diffusion coefficient from a solution of the Boltzmann equation. Simplifying approximations of a fully ionized plasma dominated by Coulomb elastic charged particle collisions are made to derive an ad hoc non-classical diffusion coefficient which results in slow differential diffusion rates for the various sulfur and oxygen ions in the plasma torus. The radial spatial structure and energetics of the plasma torus is modeled by employing the <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient in a computer model calculation of collisional ionization-diffusive equilibrium and energy branching. The computer model employs the known significant plasma reactions involving the torus sulfur and oxygen species, utilizing the most recently available atomic parameters. In view of the failure of Neutral Cloud Theory to adequately power the copious amounts of UV radiation emitted by the Io plasma torus, we employed the radial plasma model to investigate this "energy crisis.

To explore both the dynamic and steady behaviors of the model, the simulation starts with the abrupt onset of photoelectron excitation, and is followed to steady state conditions. The results illustrate several features of the interaction of photoelectrons with typical magnetospheric plasmas and fields, including <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> of photoelectrons in pitch angle with flux tube filling, diurnal intensity and pitch angle asymmetries introduced by directional sunlight, and energization of the photoelectron distribution in the evening sector.

40|$|Transport {{processes}} of fast ions in axisymmetric low-aspect-ratio spherical torus (ST) plasmas are investigated, which are {{induced by the}} non-conservation of the magnetic moment {mu}. The reason for non-conservation of {mu} of fast ions in ST's is the relatively large adiabaticity parameter epsilon typically exceeding the value 0. 1 (epsilon = ratio of ion gyroradius to the gradient scale length of the magnetic field). Both analytical and numerical evaluations {{of the magnitude of}} nonadiabatic variations of {mu} are performed. Nonadiabaticity effects are shown to be most significant for fast ions for which the bounce oscillations are in resonance with the gyromotion, i. e., for ions with omega(subscript) B - lomega(subscript) b = 0, where omega(subscript) B and omega(subscript) b represent the bounce-averaged gyrofrequency and the bounce frequency, respectively, and l is an integer. The critical threshold of the adiabaticity parameter, epsilon(subscript) cr, to be exceeded for the transition to stochastic behavior of fast ions in axisymmetric ST's is inspected. Nonadiabatic variations of {mu} are shown to lead to collisionless transformation of trapped orbits into circulating ones and vice versa. For the case of strong nonadiabaticity, epsilon > epsilon(subscript) cr, we assess the transport coefficients describing intense collisionless pitch-angle diffusion, whereas, in the case of weak nonadiabaticity, epsilon > epsilon(subscript) cr, the more substantial coefficients of enhanced <b>collisional</b> radial <b>diffusion</b> and convection of fast ions gyrating resonantly with the bounce oscillations are estimated...|$|R

To this end, {{we have developed}} a theoretical framework able to accurately describe, both in the spatial and temporal domains, the molecular <b>collisional</b> and <b>diffusion</b> processes characterizing the operation of this class of lasers. The effect on the main lasing features of the spatial variation of the electric field intensity and the ohmic losses associated to each cavity mode are also included in our analysis. Our simulations show that, for the exemplary case of methyl fluoride gas confined in a cylindrical copper cavity, the region of maximum population inversion is located near the cavity walls. Based on this fact, our calculations show that the lowest lasing threshold intensity corresponds to the cavity mode that, while maximizing the spatial overlap between the corresponding population inversion and electric-field intensity distributions, simultaneously minimizes the absorption losses occurring at the cavity walls. The dependence of the lasing threshold intensity on both the gas pressure and the cavity radius is also analyzed and compared with experiment. We find that as the cavity size is varied, the interplay between the overall gain {{of the system and}} the corresponding ohmic losses allows for the existence of an optimal cavity radius which minimizes the intensity threshold for a large range of gas pressures. The theoretical analysis presented in this work expands the current understanding of lasing action in optically-pumped far-infrared lasers and, thus, could {{contribute to the development of}} a new class of compact far-infrared and terahertz sources able to operate efficiently at room temperature.

In a tokamak configuration, neoclassical radial heat flux and the force balance relation, which relates the parallel mean flow with radial electric field and temperature gradient, are compared between these two codes, and their results are also compared with the local neoclassical transport theory. It is found that the simulation results of the two codes coincide very well in a wide rage of plasma collisionality parameter nu = 0. 01 ~ 10 and also agree with the theoretical estimations. The time evolution of radial electric field and particle flux, and the radial profile of the geodesic acoustic mode frequency also coincide very well.

40|$|The {{achievement}} of sustained nuclear fusion in magnetically confined plasma relies on efficient confinement of high-energy ions {{produced by the}} fusion reaction. Such particles can excite Alfven Eigenmodes (AEs), which significantly degrade their confinement and threatens the vacuum vessel of future reactors. To develop diagnostics and control schemes, {{a better understanding of}} linear and nonlinear features of resonant interactions between plasma waves and high-energy particles, is required. In the case of an isolated single resonance, the problem is homothetic to the so-called Berk-Breizman (BB) problem, which is an extension of the classic bump-on-tail electrostatic problem, including external damping to a thermal plasma, and collisions. A semi-Lagrangian simulation code, COBBLES, is developed to solve the initial-value BB problem. The nonlinear behavior of instabilities in experimentally-relevant conditions is categorized into steady-state, periodic, chaotic, and frequency-sweeping (chirping) regimes. The chaotic regime is shown to extend into a linearly stable region, and a mechanism for such subcritical instabilities is proposed. Analytic and semi-empirical laws for nonlinear chirping characteristics, such as sweeping-rate, lifetime, and asymmetry, are developed and validated. Long-time simulations demonstrate the existence of a quasi-periodic chirping regime. <b>Collisional</b> drag and <b>diffusion</b> are shown to be essential to reproduce the alternation between major chirping events and quiescent phases, which is observed in experiments. Based on these findings, a fitting procedure between COBBLES simulations and chirping AE experiments is developped.

40|$|The laser {{has long}} been {{established}} as the best possible optical source for fundamental studies and applications requiring high field intensity, single mode operation, {{a high degree of}} coherence, a narrow linewidth and short pulses. There are many applications that require lasers of varying frequencies, powers, and far-field properties. In science, the laser is a useful source in spectroscopy and microscopy, for investigating nonlinear optics phenomena and nuclear fusion. More commonly, we find them in barcode readers, laser pointers, and printers. They are also widely used for military, medical, and industrial applications. This thesis is focused on achieving new understanding of the principles and phenomena involved in the interaction of light with a variety of material systems, which will in turn guide the designs of compact lasers with feedback structures having features at the subwavelength-scale. The thesis begins by describing the interaction of light with an arbitrary complex material system, and implementing them into the electromagnetic model using two different theoretical techniques suitable for analyzing microstructured lasers: exact finite-difference time-domain calculations and a semi-analytic coupled-mode formalism. These methods are first applied to analyze lasing action in the photonic crystal (PhC) slabs. This class of lasers, commonly referred to as the photonic crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs), can be integrated on-chip and is essentially the two-dimensional (2 D) versions of the second-order distributed feedback lasers, where the higher quality factor lasing mode (dark Fano resonance) is selected through the symmetry mismatch to the free-space modes. The PCSELs have not only achieved the highest surface-emitting single-mode power but also the ability to control the shapes, polarizations and directions of their far-fields. However, as in all laser cavities, the lasing areas of PCSELs are limited by two fundamental constraints; a large area tends to promote both multi-mode and multi-area lasing. We propose to overcome both constraints to achieve single-mode PCSELs of larger areas, and thus higher output powers, by tuning the regular lasing bandedges of quadratic dispersions in typical PCSELs to form a single accidental Dirac cone of linear dispersion at the Brillouin zone center. Moreover, an additional frequency-locking phenomenon at the accidental point, with potentially high density of states, is analyzed. We demonstrate and distinguish experimentally the existence of the dark Fano resonances in a macroscopic 2 D silicon nitride PhC slab consisting of a square array of holes. We characterize the passive PhC slab in terms of its resonant frequencies and radiation behaviors using temporal coupled-mode theory and symmetry considerations. We also realize lasing at a dark Fano resonance with diluted solutions of R 6 G molecules as the gain medium. Next, we turn our attention to the organic dye lasers whose high tunability in the visible wavelengths has attracted interests for many years due to their low-cost processing, flexible choice of substrates, and large emission cross sections that can cover the spectral region from ultraviolet to the near infrared. We investigate the laser dynamics in systems of sub-wavelength photonic structures consisting of organic dye molecules, including their photobleaching effects. Our analysis considers both the chemical properties of the dyes and optical properties of the cavities. We also systematically studied the feasibility of lasing under continuous-wave excitations in optically pumped monolithic organic dye lasers. This study suggests routes to realize an organic laser that can potentially lase with a threshold of only a few W/cm² Lastly, we investigate far-infrared (FIR) (~ 0. 2 - 2 THz) laser emission from optically-pumped rotationally excited molecular gases confined in a metallic cavity. Terahertz radiation has already been used in packaging inspection for quality control, chemical composition analysis, and security screening. Submillimeter spatial resolution imaging and incredibly specific molecular recognition are other compelling uses for terahertz radiation. To apply terahertz radiation beyond laboratory or close range (100 mW) and efficient sources are required to see through highly attenuating obscurants (including the atmosphere). The fundamental limitations in the performances of FIR molecular gas lasers reside in the molecular gas physics due to the so-called vibrational bottleneck. We seek to overcome the resulting challenges through novel optical designs of the feedback structures. To undertake this task, we generalize previous works to allow for a realistic description of the spatio-temporal dynamics characterizing the molecular <b>collisional</b> and <b>diffusion</b> processes. This work expands the current understanding of lasing action in FIR gas lasers and, thus, could {{contribute to the development of}} a new class of terahertz sources able to operate efficiently at room temperature.

40|$|X-ray {{observations}} are a direct diagnostic of fast electrons produced in solar flares, energized during the energy release process and directed towards the Sun. Since {{the properties of}} accelerated electrons can be substantially changed during their transport and interaction with the background plasma, a model must ultimately be applied to X-ray observations {{in order to understand}} the mechanism responsible for their acceleration. A cold thick target model is ubiquitously used for this task, since it provides a simple analytic relationship between the accelerated electron spectrum and the emitting electron spectrum in the X-ray source, with the latter quantity readily obtained from X-ray observations. However, such a model is inappropriate for the majority of solar flares in which the electrons propagate in a hot megaKelvin plasma, because it does not take into account the physics of thermalization of fast electrons. The use of a more realistic model, properly accounting for the properties of the background plasma, and the <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> and thermalization of electrons, can alleviate or even remove many of the traditional problems associated with the cold thick target model and the deduction of the accelerated electron spectrum from X-ray spectroscopy, such as the number problem and the need to impose an ad hoc low energy cut-off.

40|$|Radial {{convection}} {{of isolated}} filamentary structures due to interchange motions in magnetized plasmas is investigated. Following a basic discussion of vorticity generation, ballooning, {{and the role}} of sheaths, a two-field interchange model is studied by means of numerical simulations on a biperiodic domain perpendicular to the magnetic field. It is demonstrated that a blob-like plasma structure develops dipolar vorticity and electrostatic potential fields, resulting in rapid radial acceleration and formation of a steep front and a trailing wake. While the dynamical evolution strongly depends on the amount of <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> and viscosity, the structure travels a radial distance many times its initial size in all parameter regimes in the absence of sheath dissipation. In the ideal limit, there is an inertial scaling for the maximum radial velocity of isolated filaments. This velocity scales as the acoustic speed times the square root of the structure size relative to the length scale of the magnetic field. The plasma filament eventually decelerates due to mixing and collisional dissipation. Finally, the role of sheath dissipation is investigated. When included in the simulations, it significantly reduces the radial velocity of isolated filaments. The results are discussed in the context of convective transport in scrape-off layer plasmas, comprising both blob-like structures in low confinement modes and edge localized mode filaments in unstable high confinement regimes...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the capture of planetesimals in Trojan orbits by a growing proto-Jupiter by {{integrating}} numerically the equations of motion of planetesimals in a four-body problem Sun-Jupiter-Saturn-planetesimal. The masses of Jupiter and Saturn increase exponentially with time. Nebular gas drag on small planetesimals is taken into account. We show that {{a fraction of the}} planetesimals near Jupiter's orbit and almost all planetesimals originally in horseshoe orbits are trapped into stable Trojan orbits. This mechanism was probably an important factor together with <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion,</b> for delivering a large amount of planetesimals into Trojan orbits during the final growth of Jupiter by gas in-fall. We find also that the libration amplitude of trapped Trojans is damped by the increase of Jupiter's mass reinforcing the stability of the resonance lock. For planetesimals small enough to be perturbed by nebular gas drag, we find an asymmetry between the trapping rate in L 5 compared to L 4. Peale (1993, Icarus 106, 308 - 322) noted also that the stability of the L 4 resonant region is reduced in presence of an intense frictional drag. We present here a simple semi-analytical explanation for the trapping asymmetry based on the evolution of the angular difference between the planetesimal's and proto-Jupiter's longitude of perihelion. The asymmetry between L 4 and L 5 could have led to the capture of a larger number of small planetesimals in L 5. This may have favored a higher degree of collisional activity in L 5 and might explain an alleged asymmetry in the size distribution of the two swarms...|$|E
40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} at {{the origin}} of profile consistency in models of electrostatic turbulence in magnetized plasmas are considered. One involves turbulent diffusion in collisionless plasmas and the subsequent turbulent equipartition of Lagrangian invariants. By {{the very nature of}} its definition, this state can only be reached in the absence of imposed fluxes of the transported quantities. As such, the concept of turbulent equipartition cannot be used to interpret profiles in numerical simulations of interchange modes, as it has nevertheless been done in the past. It is shown in this article that for interchange modes, profile consistency is in fact due to mixing by persistent large-scale convective cells. This mechanism is not a turbulent diffusion, cannot occur in collisionless systems, and is the analog of the well-known laminar “magnetic flux expulsion” in magnetohydrodynamics. This expulsion process involves a “pinch” across closed streamlines and further results in the formation of pressure fingers along the separatrix of the convective cells. By nature, these coherent structures are dissipative because the mixing process that leads to their formation relies on a finite amount of <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion.</b> Numerical simulations of two-dimensional interchange modes confirm the role of laminar expulsion by convective cells for profile consistency and structure formation. They also show that the fingerlike pressure structures ultimately control the rate of heat transport across the plasma layer and thus the transport scaling at large Rayleigh numbers. This contradicts mixing-length arguments which do not account for collisional processes. For interchange modes, the problem of coherent structure formation, profile consistency, and transport scaling are thus intimately linked...|$|E

A total of 8 trails {{have been associated with}} known short-period comets (Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Encke, Gunn, Kopff, Pons-Winnecke, Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, Tempel 1, and Tempel 2), and a few faint trails have been detected which are not associated with any known comet. It is inferred that all short-period comets may have trails, and that the trails detected were seen as a consequence of observational selection effects. Were IRAS launched today, it would likely observe a largely different set of trails. The Tempel 2 trail exhibits a small but significant excess in color temperature relative to a blackbody at the same heliocentric distance. This excess {{may be due to the}} presence of a population of small, low-beta particles deriving from large particles within the trail, or a temperature gradient over the surface of large trail particles. Trails represent the very first stage in the formation and evolution of a meteor stream, and may also be the primary mechanism by which comets contribute to the interplanetary dust complex. A mathematical model of the spatial distribution of orbitally evolved collisional debris was developed which reproduces the zodiacal dust band phenomena and was used in the analysis of dust band observations made by IRAS. This has resulted in the principal zodiacal dust bands being firmly related to the principal Hirayama asteroid families. In addition, evidence for the <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> of the orbital elements of the dust particles has been found in the case of dust generated in the Eos asteroid family...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} systems where {{interaction}} among the elementary building blocks-no {{matter how well}} understood-does not even give {{a glimpse of the}} behavior of the global system itself. Characteristic for these systems is the ability to display structure without any external organizing principle being applied. They self-organize as a consequence of synthesis and collective phenomena and the behavior cannot be understood in terms of the systems' constitutive elements alone. A simple example is flowing granular materials, i. e., systems composed of particles or grains. How the grains interact with each other is reasonably well understood; as to how particles move, the governing law is Newton's second law. There are no surprises at this level. However, when the particles are many and the material is vibrated or tumbled, surprising behavior emerges. Systems self-organize in complex patterns that cannot be deduced from the behavior of the particles alone. Self-organization is often the result of competing effects; flowing granular matter displays both mixing and segregation. Small differences in either size or density lead to flow-induced segregation and order; similar to fluids, noncohesive granular materials can display chaotic mixing and disorder. Competition gives rise to a wealth of experimental outcomes. Equilibrium structures, obtained experimentally in quasi-two-dimensional systems, display organization in the presence of disorder, and are captured by a continuum flow model incorporating <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> and density-driven segregation. Several open issues remain to be addressed. These include analysis of segregating chaotic systems from a dynamical systems viewpoint, and understanding three-dimensional systems and wet granular systems (slurries). General aspects of the competition between chaos-enhanced mixing and properties-induced de-mixing go beyond granular materials and may offer a paradigm for other kinds of physical systems.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{accretion}} in the Trojan 1 : 1 resonance {{is akin to}} the standard problem of planet formation, transplanted from a star-centered disk to a disk centered on the Lagrange point. The newly discovered class of Neptune Trojans promises to test theories of planet formation by coagulation. Neptune Trojans resembling the prototype 2001 QR 322 (``QR'') [...] whose radius of ~ 100 km is {{comparable to that of}} the largest Jupiter Trojan [...] may outnumber their Jovian counterparts by a factor of ~ 10. We discover that seeding the 1 : 1 resonance with debris from planetesimal collisions and having the seed particles accrete in situ naturally reproduces the inferred number of QR-sized Trojans. We analyze accretion in the Trojan sub-disk by applying the two-groups method, accounting for kinematics specific to the resonance. We find that a Trojan sub-disk comprising decimeter-sized seed particles and having a surface density 1 e- 3 that of the local minimum-mass disk produces ~ 10 QR-sized objects in ~ 1 Gyr, in accord with observation. Further growth is halted by <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> of seed particles out of resonance. In our picture, the number and sizes of the largest Neptune Trojans represent the unadulterated outcome of dispersion-dominated, oligarchic accretion. Large Neptune Trojans, perhaps the most newly accreted objects in our Solar System, may today have a dispersion in orbital inclination of less than ~ 10 degrees, despite the existence of niches of stability at higher inclinations. Such a vertically thin disk, born of a dynamically cold environment necessary for accretion, and raised in minimal contact with external perturbations, contrasts with the thick disks of other minor body belts.

40|$|Results of {{injected}} impurity transport {{studies on}} the Alcator A tokamak are presented. We find that injected silicon diffuses throughout. the plasma and is then observed, contrary to the predictions of neoclassical theory, to leave the discharge, having confinement times much shorter than the discharge length. There is no observed build-up of silicon on the axis of the device. The impurity confinement is found to increase with plasma current and background ion mass. Scalings with electron density and toroidal field are also discussed. Ipuri'ties can profoundly influence tokamak plasmas through radiation and its contribution to power balance, 1 - 4 enhanced resistivity and the resulting changes in power input, 5 and dilution of the working gas. A review of impurity transport studies {{can be found in}} Ref. (6). Investigations utilizing intrinsic impurities are plagued by unknown source functions. Experiments with pulsed gas injection of impurities ' 8 are influenced by recycling, leading again to unknown source functions. Injection of non-recycling 9, 10 metallic impurities overcomes this source problem, but in none of these previous experiments have the highest ionization states, which exist in the hot core of the plasma, been followed spectroscopically. In addition, the majority of such studies have been carried out in relatively dirty plasmas, where comparisons with <b>collisional</b> <b>diffusion</b> theories are difficult. With Z eff> 2 (typically due to light impurities such as 0 and C), the transport, as predicted by theory, is dominated by collisions among impurity species and not by collisions with the working gas ions. 1 1 Since the light impurities are fully stripped over much of the plasma cross section, it is extremely difficult to measure their density profiles. These profiles are crucial for any comparison with theory of the transport of artificially introduced trace impurities. We report the results of silicon transport studies in the clean Z eff< 1. 2) 12 high field Alcator Atokamak. 1 3 Figure shows the time history of a typical deuterium plasma into which Si has been injected.
