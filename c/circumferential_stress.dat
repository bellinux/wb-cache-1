25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered <b>circumferential</b> <b>stress.</b> Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E

In this work, we model the tumor mass as a growing hyperelastic material. We enforce a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient to study the role of anisotropic tumor growth on the evolution and spatial distribution of stresses. Specifically, we exploit radial symmetry and analyze the response of <b>circumferential</b> and radial <b>stresses</b> to (a) degree of anisotropy, (b) geometry of the tumor mass (cylindrical versus spherical shape), and (c) different tumor types (in terms of mechanical properties). According to our results, both radial and <b>circumferential</b> <b>stresses</b> are compressive in the tumor inner regions, whereas <b>circumferential</b> <b>stresses</b> are tensile at the periphery. Furthermore, we show that the growth rate is inversely correlated with the stresses’ magnitudes. These qualitative trends are consistent with experimental results.

40|$|The ﬂow ﬁeld in a {{multistage}} turbomachine is very complex. It is 3 D, unsteady and turbulent. Even if modern simulation tools {{can describe}} {{most of the}} ﬂow features, the computation time needed and the extraction of useful information remain severe drawbacks to systematic use of URANS codes in a design procedure. In this context the throughﬂow simulation {{proved to be more}} convenient. Nevertheless the need for empiricism limits the potential of throughﬂow solvers. As an alternative, Admaczyck (1984) proposed three averaging operators (ensemble, time and passage) that lead to the average-passage model, linking the unsteady turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld to a steady ﬂow ﬁeld in a typical blade passage. This model involves additional terms that respectively bring back the mean effect of turbulence, deterministic unsteadiness and aperiodicity on the mean periodic ﬂow. These terms need to be modelled; it is the closure problem. Harmonic closure, which consists in solving a linearized perturbation system in the frequency domain, revealed to be an efficient method to approximate deterministic stresses (He and Ning, 1998, Stridh, 2005, Vilmin, 2006). A fourth averaging can be performed, a circumferential averaging, giving rise to the throughﬂow model. Additional terms appear: the so-called <b>circumferential</b> <b>stresses.</b> It has been proven that these terms {{play an important role in}} the description of the ﬂow (Jennions, 1986, Perrin, 1995), being at least as considerable as deterministic stresses.

5000|$|To achieve optimal loading in a {{straight}} rubber hose the fibres must be positioned under an angle of approximately 54.7 angular degrees, {{also referred to as}} the magic angle. The magic angle of 54.7 exactly balances the internal-pressure-induced longitudinal stress and the hoop (<b>circumferential)</b> <b>stress,</b> as observed in most biological pressurized fiber-wound cylinders, like arteries. If the fiber angle is initially above or below 54.7, it will change under increased internal pressure until it rises to the magic angle where hoop stresses and longitudinal stresses equalize, with concomitant accommodations in hose diameter and hose length. A hose with an initially low fiber angle will rise under pressure to 54.7, inducing a hose diameter increase and a length decrease, whereas a hose with an initially high fiber angle will drop to 54.7, inducing a hose diameter decrease and a length increase. The equilibrium state is a fiber angle of 54.7. In this situation the fibres tend to be loaded purely in tension, so ~100% of their strength resists the forces acting on the hose due to the internal pressure. (The magic angle for cylindrical shapes of 54.7 angular degrees is based on calculations in which the influence of the matrix material is neglected. Therefore, depending on the stiffness of the rubber material used, the actual equilibrium angle can vary a few tenths of degrees from the magic angle.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} environment influences vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) functions {{related to the}} vascular remodeling. However, the relationships are not appropriately addressed by most mechanical models of arteries assuming homogeneity. Accounting {{for the effects of}} heterogeneity is expected to be important to our understanding of VSMC functions. We hypothesized that local stresses computed using a heterogeneous mechanical model of arteries positively correlate to the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 2 and - 9 in situ. We developed a mathematical model of an arterial wall accounting for nonlinearity, residual strain, anisotropy, and structural heterogeneity. The distributions of elastin and collagen fibers, quantified using their optical properties, showed significant structural heterogeneity. Anisotropy was represented by the direction of collagen fibers, which was measured by the helical angle of VSMC nuclei. The recruiting points of collagen fibers were computed assuming a uniform strain of collagen fibers under physiological loading conditions; an assumption motivated by the morphology. This was supported by observed uniform length and orientation of VSMC nuclei under physiological loading. The distributions of <b>circumferential</b> <b>stresses</b> computed using both heterogeneous and corresponding homogeneous models were correlated to the distributions of expression and activation of MMP- 2 and - 9 in porcine common carotid arteries, which were incubated in an ex vivo perfusion organ culture system under either normotensive or hypertensive conditions for 48 hours. While strains computed using incompressibility were identical in both models, the heterogeneous model, unlike the homogeneous model, predicted higher <b>circumferential</b> <b>stresses</b> in the outer layer. The tissue levels of MMP- 2 and - 9 were positively correlated to <b>circumferential</b> <b>stresses</b> computed using the heterogeneous model, which implies that areas of high stress are expected to be sites of localized remodeling and agrees with results from cell culture studies. The results support the role of mechanical stress in vascular remodeling and suggest the importance of structural heterogeneity in studying mechanobiological responses. Ph. D.

In this study, we combined pre-operative MRI data and measured mechanical properties of excised tissue to create a patient-specific three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of a dilated ascending aorta.

The influence of mechanics on cell and tissue function is becoming apparent, raising the question: how does the airway tree co-exist within its mechanical environment to maintain normal cell function throughout its branching structure of diminishing dimensions? We introduce a new mechanical design principle for the conducting airway tree in which mechanotransduc-tion {{at the level of}} cells is driven to orchestrate airway wall structural changes that can best maintain a preferred mechanical microenvironment. To support this principle, we report in vitro radius-transmural pressure relations for a range of airway radii obtained from healthy bovine lungs and model the data using a strain energy function together with a thick-walled cylinder description. From this framework, we estimate <b>circumferential</b> <b>stresses</b> and incremental Young’s moduli throughout the airway tree.
