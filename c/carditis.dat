5000|$|The {{molecular}} mimicry hypothesis is a proposed mechanism for PANDAS: {{this hypothesis is}} that antigens on the cell wall of the streptococcal bacteria are similar {{in some way to}} the proteins of the heart valve, joints, or brain. Because the antibodies set off an immune reaction which damages those tissues, the child with rheumatic fever can get heart disease (especially mitral valve regurgitation), arthritis, and/or abnormal movements known as Sydenham's chorea or [...] "St. Vitus' Dance". [...] In a typical bacterial infection, the body produces antibodies against the invading bacteria, and the antibodies help eliminate the bacteria from the body. In some rheumatic fever patients, autoantibodies may attack heart tissue, leading to <b>carditis,</b> or cross-react with joints, leading to arthritis. [...] In PANDAS, it is believed that tics and OCD are produced in a similar manner. One part of the brain that may be affected in PANDAS is the basal ganglia, which is believed to be responsible for movement and behavior. It is thought that similar to Sydenham's chorea, the antibodies cross-react with neuronal brain tissue in the basal ganglia to cause the tics and OCD that characterize PANDAS. Studies neither disprove nor support this hypothesis: the strongest supportive evidence comes from a controlled study of 144 children (Mell et al, 2005), but prospective longitudinal studies have not produced conclusive results.|$|E
30|$|Mitral {{regurgitation}} is {{the most}} common finding on Doppler color imaging in patients with the rheumatic <b>carditis.</b> In patients clinically manifesting only polyarthritis and/or chorea, we should exclude the subclinical <b>carditis</b> that can be easily detected by echocardiography. The presence of subclinical <b>carditis</b> should be accepted as an evidence of <b>carditis.</b>|$|E
30|$|The major {{complication}} of {{acute rheumatic fever}} (ARF) is the appearance of <b>carditis</b> and subsequent development of a chronic valvular heart disease [2, 7 – 11]. Accurate detection of <b>carditis</b> is important because the chronic valvular disease rarely develops in patients without <b>carditis</b> [7, 9, 12]. Echocardiography has {{a leading role in}} diagnosis of rheumatic <b>carditis</b> and RHD [7, 13 – 19]. The diagnosis of <b>carditis</b> in an ARF traditionally depends on characteristic auscultatory findings [20]. Using color and pulsed Doppler echocardiography minor degrees of pathological regurgitation without the characteristic clinical findings can be detected [14]. With the availability of echocardiogram as an investigative tool, a new subset of <b>carditis</b> is being recognized, namely subclinical <b>carditis</b> [21 – 23]. The only physical finding which can be considered as being essential for diagnostic of rheumatic <b>carditis</b> is the presence of mitral or aortic valve regurgitation in an acute attack of RF [24 – 26]. If a murmur of mitral or aortic valve regurgitation is not made out clinically, the patient is labeled as not having <b>carditis</b> [20, 27, 29]. Utilizing echocardiographic evaluation, a very sensitive investigation, presence of mitral valve disease not audible clinically, that is, subclinical <b>carditis</b> has been recognized [28 – 30].|$|E

40|$|There is a {{great need}} forECHOcriteria for {{accurate}} diagnosis of <b>carditis</b> in acute rheumatic fever. To propose and test the efficacy ofECHOcriteria for accurate diagnosis of <b>carditis</b> 333 cases underwent detailed clinical examination, laboratory tests and meticulous Echocardiographic study. Vijay’s criteria for the diagnosis of <b>carditis</b> / subclinical valvulitis was used. 220 (66. 06 %) cases were both Jones’positive andECHOpositive [True +ve], 52 cases (15. 61 %), probably had subclinical <b>carditis</b> asmurmurwas not heard (Jones’-ve) but was positive [False- ve].

30|$|A rheumatic {{heart disease}} {{develops}} only in patients with <b>carditis</b> so that those patients with subclinical <b>carditis</b> {{should be considered as}} candidates for developing chronic valvular heart disease. Patients with subclinical rheumatic <b>carditis</b> need a more stronger treatment option and longer secondary antibiotic prophylaxis to avoid a recurrent attack and development of a severe {{rheumatic heart disease}}. Echocardiography is more sensitive than clinical assessment for detection of the <b>carditis</b> in the acute rheumatic fever.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: It is {{important}} to diagnose subclinical <b>carditis</b> in acute rheumatic fever (ARF) since it has a bearing on prognosis and duration of prophylaxis. Plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) {{has been used as}} both diagnostic and prognostic tools, and it was hypothesized that it may prove useful in ARF without overt <b>carditis.</b> The study was undertaken to measure the plasma levels of NT pro-BNP in patients of ARF who did not have overt clinical <b>carditis</b> and to correlate the same with echocardiographic (ECHO) parameters of subclinical myocardial involvement. Materials and Methods: A total of 27 ARF patients without overt clinical <b>carditis</b> were enrolled in this prospective follow-up study. Plasma NT pro-BNP levels of these patients were assessed on day 1 of presentation and then after 6 weeks. ECHO was performed and patients were divided into two groups: group I, patients with subclinical <b>carditis</b> (n = 18) and group II, patients without subclinical <b>carditis</b> (n = 9). Results: The mean plasma NT pro-BNP levels were significantly higher in patients with subclinical <b>carditis</b> (509. 16 ± 282. 9 pg/ml) compared to those without subclinical <b>carditis</b> (109. 33 ± 82. 95 pg/ml) (P < 0. 001). A cutoff value of 134 pg/ml of NT pro-BNP had a sensitivity of 94. 4 % and specificity of 88. 9 % for detecting subclinical rheumatic <b>carditis</b> in ARF. Conclusions: The present study suggests that elevated levels of NT pro-BNP may be used to diagnose subclinical myocardial involvement in patients of ARF without overt clinical <b>carditis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Murine Lyme borreliosis, {{caused by}} {{infection}} with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, results in acute arthritis and <b>carditis</b> that regress {{as a result}} of B. burgdorferi-specific immune responses. B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies can attenuate arthritis in mice deficient in both B cells and T cells but have no effect on <b>carditis.</b> Because macrophages comprise the principal immune cell in <b>carditis,</b> T-cell responses that augment cell-mediated immunity may be important for <b>carditis</b> regression. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the course of Lyme <b>carditis</b> in mice selectively deficient in B cells or αβ T cells. Our results show that <b>carditis</b> regresses in B-cell-deficient B 10. Ak mice but not in αβ T-cell-deficient mice, independently of the mouse strain background. Despite prominent macrophage infiltrates, hearts from B. burgdorferi-infected αβ T-cell-deficient mice had less mRNA for tumor necrosis factor alpha as measured by reverse transcription-PCR compared to infected control mice. Anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels were equivalent. Adoptive transfer of gamma interferon-secreting CD 4 + T cells into infected αβ T-cell-deficient mice promoted <b>carditis</b> resolution.
