500|$|The last {{of these}} seminal papers {{addressed}} the general-relativistic {{treatment of the}} mechanics of <b>continuous</b> <b>media.</b> However useful {{the notion of a}} point mass may be in classical physics; in general relativity, such an idealized mass concentration into a single point of space is not even well-defined. That is why relativistic hydrodynamics, that is, the study of <b>continuous</b> <b>media,</b> {{is an essential part of}} model-building in general relativity. The paper systematically describes the basic concepts and models in what the editor of the journal General Relativity and Gravitation, on the occasion of publishing an English translation 32 years after the original publication date, called [...] "one of the best reviews in this area".|$|E
40|$|FDTD) {{scheme is}} {{introduced}} {{to model the}} scattering from objects in <b>continuous</b> random <b>media.</b> FDTD techniques have been previously applied to scattering from random rough surfaces and randomly placed objects in a homogeneous background, but little {{has been done to}} simulate <b>continuous</b> random <b>media</b> with embedded objects where volumetric scattering effects are important. In this work, Monte Carlo analysis is used in conjunction with FDTD to study the scattering from perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) objects embedded in <b>continuous</b> random <b>media.</b> The random medium models under consideration are chosen to be inhomogeneous soils with a spatially fluctuating random permittivities and prescribed correlation functions. The ability of frequency averaging techniques to discriminate objects in this scenarion is also briefly investigated. The simulation scheme described in this work can be adapted and used to help in interpreting the scattered field data from targets in random environments such as geophysical media, biological media, or atmospheric turbulence.

500|$|Politically, as Bangladeshi {{historian}} Farida Majid would note, the [...] "warmth, {{care and}} goodwill" [...] of the August 1971 concerts [...] "echoed {{all over the}} world", inspiring volunteers to approach UNICEF and offer their assistance, as well as eliciting private donations to the Bangladesh disaster fund. Although the altruistic spirit would soon wane once more, the Concert for Bangladesh is invariably seen as the inspiration and model for subsequent rock charity benefits, from 1985's Live Aid and Farm Aid to the Concert for New York City and Live 8 in the twenty-first century. Unlike those later concerts, which benefitted from <b>continuous</b> <b>media</b> coverage of the causes they supported, the Harrison–Shankar project was responsible for identifying the problem and establishing Bangladesh's plight {{in the minds of}} mainstream Western society. According to Gary Tillery: [...] "Because of its positioning as a humanitarian effort, all descriptions of the show included a summary of the catastrophe in South Asia. Overnight, because of their fascination with rock stars, masses of people became educated about geopolitical events they had not even been aware of the week before. The tragedy in Bangladesh moved to the fore as an international issue." [...] One of these revelations was that America was supplying weaponry and financial aid to the Pakistani army, led by General Yahya Khan.|$|E

[...] "It's a phenomenal video: really powerful, really impactful. She's such a strong, {{committed}} artist. Her loyalty to me is something I will be forever grateful for. We're spiritually connected. We need each other ... and 'Judas' is ultimately a representation of our true bond," [...] she added. With The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem. The shock value in the video was purposefully added, but ultimately the story was about oppression; and about following one's heart and the glory of being free. With NME magazine Gaga revealed that the video involved motorbikes and a death sequence. She also described the portrayal of her character as being [...] "beyond repentance", which evolved from the <b>continuous</b> <b>media</b> accusations towards her that [...] " [...] trashy. or pretentious or this and that. [...] is my way of saying 'I've crossed the line, I won't even try to repent. Nor should I'." [...] Forgiveness and destiny also played a part in the video, and Gaga wanted to portray a Federico Fellini-esque story with apostles being revolutionaries in a modern-day Jerusalem. They are led to Jesus, by Gaga as Magdalene. Although initially reported to be premiered during an episode of the tenth season of American Idol, the music video premiered on May 5, 2011, on E!
