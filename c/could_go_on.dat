5|$|The {{withdrawal}} plan formulated by General Phạm Văn Phú and his General Staff {{was made with}} the belief that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would stop and consolidate their territorial gains before they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the attack again. However, during the spring offensive of 1975, North Vietnamese commanders were more than willing to maneuver their units away from newly captured territories, in order to pursue retreating South Vietnamese units.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} in January 2005; the judge, Mr Justice Mackay, warned that it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> for a year. On 14 July, the judge {{instructed}} {{the jury to}} acquit all defendants on charges of manslaughter. A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on {{the health and safety}} charges and, on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined £3.5 million while Balfour Beatty were fined £10 million. All of the manslaughter charges against the executives were dismissed by the judge.|$|E

However Alexander (73) received useful support from the tail, and when West Indies were all out for 321 Australia needed 258 to win. Yet again, Davidson was the outstanding Australian bowler. McDonald was out just before the close, when Australia were 57-1, with Simpson on 44.|$|E

25|$|In 1945, {{as the war}} ended, Daley (then a state senator) {{introduced}} four bills {{calling for}} a university in Chicago. Following World War II, the University of Illinois increased its presence in Chicago by creating a temporary, two-year branch campus, the Chicago Undergraduate Division (CUD). Housed on Navy Pier, the campus accommodated primarily student veterans on the G.I. Bill. The campus was not a junior college, but rather had a curriculum based on Urbana's courses, and students who successfully completed the first two years' requirements <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to Urbana and finish their degree.|$|E

25|$|West Indies were 252-8 {{at the end}} of {{the first}} day, after Australia won the toss and asked them to bat. Though all of the {{dismissed}} batsmen reached double figures, none <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to make a substantial score. The best partnership was between Sobers and Lashley, who took the score from 107-4 to 200-5, after which three more wickets fell fairly quickly. When Benaud put West Indies in, he may have hoped that the heavy atmosphere would help Davidson, but for once he was not that effective and the spinners did much of the damage.|$|E
25|$|The EU {{airlines}} {{went to the}} European Courts, as {{they claimed}} {{that the development of}} Milan Malpensa and the closure of Milan Linate would provide an anti-competitive situation in favour of Alitalia. They claimed that Alitalia <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> feeding its Fiumicino hub from Linate but they could not. Furthermore, they claimed that Malpensa was too far (40km) and lacked the infrastructure to/from the city (the rail link would open a year after the opening of the hub). After many court disputes the EU decided to leave 33% of the flights at Linate until the rail link opened.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{recorded}} rituals we know of is Niiname-sai, the ceremony in which the Emperor offers newly harvested rice to the kami to secure their blessing for a bountiful harvest. A yearly festival, Niiname-sai is also performed when a new Emperor comes to power, in which case it is called Onamesai. In the ceremony the Emperor offers crops from the new harvest to the kami, including rice, fish, fruits, soup, and stew. The Emperor first feasts with the deities, then the guests. The feast <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> for some time; for example, the Showa Emperor's feast spanned two days.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Olympic wrestling, oil wrestling matches may be won by {{achieving}} {{an effective}} {{hold of the}} kisbet. Thus, the pehalvan aims to control his opponent by putting his arm through the latter's kisbet. To win by this move is called paça kazık. Originally, matches had no set duration and <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> {{for one or two}} days, until one man was able to establish superiority, but in 1975 the duration was capped at 40 minutes for the baspehlivan and 30 minutes for the pehlivan category. If no winner is determined, another 15 minutes—10 minutes for the pehlivan category—of wrestling ensues, wherein scores are kept to determine the victor.|$|E

At their inaugural tapings on February 9, 6-Pac had a ten-man {{hardcore}} battle royal ladder match, which {{both he and}} Vampiro won by climbing the ladder to retrieve WSX contracts. 6-Pac lost a WSX Championship title match to Vampiro the following week. He challenged Vampiro in episode four, as a ruse to introduce Ricky Banderas, who attacked Vampiro from behind. He later defeated Human Tornado and Scorpio Sky in singles matches, and teased an affair with Lizzy Valentine (the valet and girlfriend of Matt Sydal), though WSX folded before the angle <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> any further.|$|E

The scenes with the heftier Jake LaMotta—which include announcing his retirement from boxing and LaMotta ending up in a Florida cell—were completed while approaching Christmas 1979 within seven to eight weeks so as not to aggravate the health issues which were already affecting De Niro's posture, breathing, and talking.|$|E
