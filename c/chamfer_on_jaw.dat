40|$|Taking an Italian {{cable-stayed}} bridge as an engineering example, the aerostatic characteristics of closed-box deck section are investigated using both {{wind tunnel test}} and CFD numerical simulation. Based on the open source code OpenFOAM, the aerostatic coefficients and pressure coefficients distribution of square section and bridge deck section under different attack angles are numerically simulated. The simulation results are compared with the experimental data from the wind tunnel test. The effects of bottom surface <b>chamfers</b> <b>on</b> the aerostatic characteristics are also studied.

40|$|In this paper, an Ultra Wideband (UWB) antenna is presented. The antenna {{radiating}} patch is circular {{in shape}} with coplanar waveguide (CPW) feeding technique. The proposed chamfering {{to the outer}} edges of the ground plane successfully widens the - 10 dB impedance bandwidth of the antenna to cover from 1. 92 GHz up to 15. 16 GHz (correspond to 155 % fractional bandwidth). The antenna gain varies from 2 to 5 dB over the operating band. Parametrical {{studies have been conducted}} for four different conditions of the ground plane; without <b>chamfering,</b> <b>chamfering</b> <b>on</b> the inner edges, <b>chamfering</b> <b>on</b> the outer edges and both chamfering of inner and outer edges.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a detailed study of mechanical fasteners which were designed to facilitate robotic assembly of structures. Design requirements for robotic structural assembly were developed, taking into account structural properties and overall system design, and four candidate fasteners were designed to meet them. These fasteners were built and evaluated in the laboratory, and the Hammer-Head joint was chosen as superior overall. It had a high reliability of fastening under misalignments of 2. 54 mm (0. 1 in) and 3 deg, the highest end fixity (2. 18), the simplest end effector, an integral capture guide, good visual verification, and the lightest weight (782 g, 1. 72 lb). The study found that a good design should incorporate <b>chamfers</b> sliding <b>on</b> <b>chamfers,</b> cylinders sliding <b>on</b> <b>chamfers,</b> and hard surface finishes on sliding surfaces.

40|$|The chamfer {{enhances the}} {{performance}} of the tool by strengthening the edge and reducing the possibility of tool wear and breakage. The strength of the chamfered tool can be investigated by analysis of process variables. This research investigates the effects of chamfer width and <b>chamfer</b> angle <b>on</b> process variables (force, stress, tool temperature and tool stress) in machining of a mild carbon low alloy steel by a cemented carbide tool using finite element method. The simulations show that the dead metal zone created under the tool acts as the effective cutting edge of the tool and increases the cutting forces. The predicted results show that the effect of chamfer width and angle is more pronounced on the thrust force than the cutting force. It also investigates the effect of <b>chamfer</b> <b>on</b> the effective shear angle and chip thickness, and comparison with available experimental results is presented. Tool temperatures are also predicted which suggests the presence of an optimum chamfer angle from the viewpoint of maximum tool temperature...|$|R

50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension pin or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. Spring pins have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a <b>chamfer</b> <b>on</b> either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining fastener. Spring pins are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R
