An example of a bilateral swap occurred when the U.S. Government, under the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, forgave a portion of Jamaica's official debt obligations and allowed the payments on the balance to go into national funds that finance environmental conservation. These funds established the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica in 1993. Multilateral debt-for-nature swaps are similar to bilateral swaps but involve international transactions of more than two national governments. Recorded bilateral and multilateral debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$900 million in total conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} collateral constraints in the international transmission of crises, and in the uneven pace of recoveries across countries. In the presence of collateral constraints, depressed asset prices caused by a negative shock in a large <b>creditor</b> <b>country</b> generate feedback cycles in a smaller debtor country, in which the decline in borrowing capacity and the collapses of investment and output reinforce each other. As a consequence, a negative shock in a <b>creditor</b> <b>country</b> can have disproportionately large and persistent impacts on investment and output of another debtor country. The debtor country’s recovery can also be sluggish, particularly if the country is highly leveraged, since the collateral constraint prevents it from quickly borrowing and accumulating capital.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{creditors}} to impose trade sanctions {{has been one}} of the workhorse arguments to explain why governments repay foreign creditors. Although sovereign defaults are associated with declines in the defaulting country trade, the absence of explicit trade sanctions following defaults in recent decades is troublesome. One way in which the trade sanctions argument is reconciled with this evidence is to argue that <b>creditor</b> <b>countries</b> are punishing defaulting countries through sub rosa actions that disrupt their trade. Is this the case? Are trade sanctions (understood in a broad sense) causing the declines in trade? Using a gravity model framework we devise an empirical strategy to evaluate this issue. It is based on the idea that if trade sanctions are causing the declines, bilateral trade with <b>creditor</b> <b>countries</b> should fall more than trade with other countries. We find that sovereign defaults are associated with a decline in overall trade for the defaulting country. However, in the aftermath of defaults, there seems to be no evidence of a larger decline in bilateral trade with <b>creditor</b> <b>countries</b> affected by the default. This would imply that the declines are not due to punishments imposed by these <b>creditor</b> <b>countries.</b> The analysis does not yield evidence of broader punishment strategies including a league of major creditors (not just those affected by the default) either. These results would contradict the predictions of the trade sanctions theory of sovereign borrowing...|$|R

40|$|This {{report shows}} empirically that {{international}} differences in withholding tax rates are indeed largely reflected in bank credit terms.

He concludes that tax treatment in the <b>creditor</b> <b>country</b> of interest income from foreign sources probably still has an important effect on credit terms. In particular, limits on tax credits for foreign-interest withholding taxes, as effectively introduced by the 1986 U. S. tax reform, will probably lead to less favorable credit terms.

The author analyzes possible distortions arising in renegotiations between private creditors and sovereign borrowers. He argues that legal privileges accorded to existing creditors {{in their home}} jurisdictions can distort the flow of resources for capital formation abroad. Seniority privileges for old lenders convey to them some of the social returns from new lending, reducing the potential rewards for those who might provide the new funds. Hence the author urges investigation of official alienation of these privileges, regulatory reform, and introduction of alternative financial instruments that embody opportunities for creditor commitment.
