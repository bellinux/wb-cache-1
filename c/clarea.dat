The ornamental elements include zoomorphic/animal, floral, interlace, and curvilinear motifs and designs. The color palette employed by the artist/illuminator consisted of pigments of gold, purple, blues, red, red/brown, yellow, green, white, and black. The pigment binding medium was clarified egg white or <b>clarea.</b>|$|E
30|$|Paint {{references}} {{were prepared}} using arabic-gum and glair. Glair was prepared as {{described on the}} 11 th-century De <b>clarea</b> treatise [37] and gum arabic, from Kremer Pigmente, was prepared according to De arte illuminandi as a 10 % solution [38]. For the glair, the egg white was beaten and the liquid that formed at the bottom was used; for the gum arabic, the pieces were ground and then added to pure water. The lake pigments were first ground in an agate mortar with pure water and then ground with the binder. The paints were applied on filter paper and parchment with a paintbrush and allowed to dry. Spectroscopic or equivalent grade solvents and Millipore filtered water were used for all the spectroscopic studies {{as well as for}} the extraction of the dyes and preparation of the lake pigments.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTropilaelaps koenigerum {{was first}} {{reported}} in Thailand. Species-diagnostic markers of bee mites, T. <b>clareae</b> and T. koenigerum were examined by sequencing of ITS and RAPD analysis. A lack of intraspecific polymorphism within T. <b>clareae</b> and T. koenigerum ITS was observed. At an interspecific level, 19 substitutions were found. Sequence divergence between ITS of these bee mites was 3. 82 %. A 5 bp (TTCTC) insertion {{was found in}} T. koenigerum. Based on ITS sequences, identification of these mites was simplified to restriction analysis of the amplified ITS with Mse I and/or Sau 3 A I. RAPD analysis using primers OPA 07, OPA 11 and OPA 12 revealed 16 and 20 species-specific markers of T. <b>clareae</b> and T. koenigerum, respectively. A UPGMA phenogram based on genetic distance between pairs of geographic samples indicated clear differentiation between T. <b>clareae</b> and T. koenigerum genetically. Partial differentiation of T. <b>clareae</b> from different host species was observed...|$|R
40|$|Honeybee colonies heavily {{infested with}} Tropilaelaps <b>clareae</b> {{were found in}} some apiaries in Afghanistan. Only colonies moved for winter to warmer areas where {{interruption}} of brood rearing did not occcur, were invaded, while those overwintered in colder areas were free of mites. From 2 to 54 % of brood cells were infested in particular colonies, but only 1. 5 % of adult bees were invaded. T. <b>clareae</b> mites on combs with eggs or on adult bees can survive for 1 - 2 days only. Adult mites are unable to feed on hemolymph of adult bees. Three methods are described to combat Tropilaelaps. Invasion of Apis mellifera by T. <b>clareae</b> in temperate zones where winter interruption of brood rearing occurs is not expected. But T. <b>clareae</b> can create real problems for beekeeping in tropical zones of all continents. INTRODUC 1 ’ION The major difficulty encountered after the introduction of Apis mellifera into tropical Asia {{was caused by the}} ectoparasitic bee mite Varroa jacobsoni, which naturally parasitizes Apis cerana, and Tropilaelaps <b>clareae,</b> which parasitizes Apis dorsata (CRANE, 1968; KEVAN et al., 1984). Invasion of A. mellifera colonies by T. <b>clareae</b> appears to be more destructive than that by V. jacobsoni and some believe that T. <b>clareae</b> could become a more serious pest of honeybees worldwide than V. jacobsoni (BuarETT et al., 1983). The major question regarding T. <b>clareae</b> concerns its potential escape from tropical Asia and whether it could become established on A. mellifera in tem-perate regions (BuacETT et al., 1983; BURGETT and KRANTZ, 1984). Adult T. <b>clareae</b> can survive without food for two days (AKRATANAUL, 1984). Depriving colonies of brood by destroying it or by caging the queen for 21 days decreases the mite population. The life span of T. clar-eae on adult bees has not yet been recorded. This was the main question studied in the present investigation. I have also tested a method to combat the mite without the use of drugs. Some of these investigations should be repeated and some results verified. However, due to the urgency of this problem I wish to present some preliminary results...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the debris}} of five Apis dorsata colonies at a single site in Sabah, Borneo we found the mites Tropilaelaps <b>clareae,</b> Tropilaelaps koenigerum, Varroa rindereri, Varroa jacobsoni and Euvarroa wongsirii. Most were T. <b>clareae,</b> but T. koenigerum were also quite common. The V. rindereri {{specimens}} belonged to the same haplotype as described previously from A. koschevnikovi from Borneo. However, the V. jacobsoni belonged to a new haplotype, which we named the 'Borneo 2 haplotype of V. jacobsoni'. Of the mites detected in the debris, 84...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{aspects of the}} two known brood parasites of honey bees from Asia, namely the {{tropical}} bee mites Tropilaelaps <b>clareae</b> Delfinado et Baker and Tropilaelaps koenigerum Delfinado-Baker et Baker. These species of Tropilaelaps belong to the family Laelapidae (Mesostigmata). They feed on bee larvae and pupae causing brood malformation {{and the death of}} bees. T. <b>clareae</b> occurs on 5 species of bee- Apis cerana, A. dorsata, A. florea, A. laboriosa and A. mellifera. T. <b>clareae</b> is known to have a wide disribution in Asia extending eastwards from Iran to Papua New Guinea. T. koenigerum on the other hand and as far as is known at present, has a more restricted distribution. Because of the great interest in Varroa {{and to a lesser extent}} Acarapis woodi Rennie, the importance of Tropilaelaps mites has not been sufficiently recognised. There is some concern that Tropilaelaps may become established on A. mellifera in temperate climates. Tropilaelaps mites therefore are an important potential threat to beekeeping in parts of the world other than South-East Asia...|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to other}} honeybees, Apis dorsata is {{regularly}} attacked by parasitic mites. The parasitic mite known to attack Apis dorsata is Tropilaelaps <b>clareae.</b> Tropilaelaps <b>clareae</b> needs brood {{in order to}} reproduce and are found in adult brood males of the colony. Apis dorsata {{is thought to be}} the original host of this parasite. If Apis dorsata engages in brood-less migration, then the entire colony can reduce infestation by this parasitic mite. Although quite rare, some experimental evidence has shown that Apis dorsata exhibits a specialized grooming behavior as a defense mechanism to remove parasites. The grooming behavior involves intense shaking of the body and auto-grooming with the legs.|$|R

40|$|International audienceTropilaelaps mite {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 72 locations in 25 provinces throughout China. The mitochondrial DNA cox 1 and ribosomal ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 fragments of Tropilaelaps mites were surveyed for sequence variation or {{the presence or absence}} of specific restriction sites that differentiate four species of Tropilaelaps mite (Tropilaelaps <b>clareae,</b> Tropilaelaps mercedesae, Tropilaelaps koenigerum, and Tropilaelaps thaii). Based on these identified diagnostic characters, all samples in this study corresponded to T. mercedesae, which has been mistaken for T. <b>clareae</b> until now. None of the other Tropilaelaps species were found infesting Apis mellifera in China. A total of 73 cox 1 haplotypes and 104 ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 haplotypes were discovered in this study. Haplotype analysis revealed that there is no association between geographic distance and genetic distance among populations. The results of the present study clarified the taxonomic status and biogeography of Tropilaelaps mites in China, and should have implications for the control and bee quarantine efforts in China...|$|R

40|$|Scientific note. A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in Hawaii to determine the presence of three mite pests of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) : Acarapis woodi (Rennie), Tropilaelaps <b>clareae</b> Delfinado & Baker, and Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman. A total of 837 random samples were taken from managed and feral bee colonies on the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii. No mites were found {{in any of the}} samples. Data were analyzed employing the binomial distribution as a likelihood function. Results showed that there was a 99 % probability that the unknown prevalence of mite infestation within the Hawaii honey bee population would be no greater than 0. 55 %. Thus, Hawaii can be considered to be free of parasitic honey bee mites at the present time...|$|R
40|$|The {{colonies of}} the giant {{honeybee}} (Apis dorsata) immigrate in the semiarid environment of Northwest India in October-November {{with the onset of}} flowering on pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) /toria (Brassica campestris var. toria), stay here during the rich pollen and nectar flow period from December to mid-May, and emigrate in late May/early June when floral dearth is witnessed. This honeybee was free from any conspicuous viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases and also did not have any serious predators and enemies. However, about 20 percent of the old colonies were infested with Tropilaelaps <b>clareae</b> and 100 percent of the old colonies with Galleria mellonella; none of the swarm colonies had these pests. While the migration schedule of this honeybee remained similar year after year, the number of colonies immigrating in this region declined markedly over the years; the number in 2012 was even less than half of that recorded in 1984. During its stay in this region, this honeybee acted as an important pollinator of more than 30 crop plants of this region. The causes of seasonal migration and {{decline in the number of}} colonies of this honeybee and its importance in crop pollination have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Asian {{continent}} is {{blessed with}} eight indigenous and one exotic honeybee species. Among these, five species are nesting in cavities and construct multiple parallel combs. In contrast, remaining four are open-nesting species which build single exposed combs. Asian honeybees exhibit a rich biodiversity {{in respect of}} distribution, nesting behavior, sex pheromone communication, defensive behavior etc. Honeybees have got an immense value for their various products and also for meticulous services they render in cross pollination of varieties of crops. Thai sac brood, a major viral disease is primarily responsible for mortality of millions of Apis cerana colonies. Frequent incidence and infestation of brood mites, Varroa destructor and Tropilaelaps <b>clareae,</b> predation by various species of ants, wasps and birds render a greater hindrance in establishment of Apis mellifera {{in most parts of}} Asia. Similarly, traditional methods of honey harvesting, habitat destruction, deforestation and pesticide poisoning are apparently threatening open-nesting and hive honeybee species. There is a greater scope to safeguard honeybees from pests, predators, parasites and diseases through economically viable and environmentally sustainable bee-friendly scientific methods. Obviously, creating awareness on anthropogenic impact on these bee fauna would play a tremendous role in conservation of honeybees in Asia. Â© 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc...|$|R
40|$|A tiny mite, called Tropilaelaps, is {{threatening}} bee colonies {{on the island}} of Irian Jaya and in Papua New Guinea. The only way to rid the island of the pest is to eradicate all bee colonies. This drastic action is being recommended by entomologists from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Tropilaelaps <b>clareae</b> was first identified in 1961. It has spread from the island of Java where it infested the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) to Irian Jaya in the early 1980 's. Now it is gradually spreading eastwards into Papua New Guinea in feral colonies of the European bee altrough, as yet, it has not reached the primary beekeeping areas. For the moment the Asian bee (Apis cerana) remains free of infestation. The CSIRO entomologists have been studying the pest {{for the last four years}} and have found it to be very destructive to the European honey bee. In Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea it does not appear to have an alternative host. This means that all the feral colonies of the European honey bee will be killed by the mite in time. Entomologists argue that the most effective strategy to rid the islands of the pest is to destroy all the European honey bee colonies and then after a period of two years new, clean colonies can be introduced to restock.
