40|$|The {{literary}} part of {{the thesis}} describes biology, economic importance and methods of chemical protection against pollen beetle, cabbage seed weevil and <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle.</b> The resistance of these pests against zoocides in the Czech republic and {{in some parts of}} neighbour European countries is decribed and principles of antiresistance strategies are outlined. Each group of insecticides is describd and their active components are rated in the practical {{part of the}} thesis. Findings about pest resistance are summarized - resistance types and mechanisms in particular. Then monitoring of resistent populations of plant pests are described. New findings concerning the resistance of three oilseed rape pests were acquired using biological methods. For cabage seed weevil six areas were evaluated, for pollen beetle seven and for <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> two areas were evaluated. All the evaluated areas are in the Czech republic. The adult-vial test number 11, nr. 25, nr. 27 accordinng to IRAC methodology and topical aplication test were used to rate the resistance. The efficiency of five pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, tau-fluvalinate, cypermethrin), one organophosphate (chlorpyrifos - <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> only) and one oxadiazin (indoxacarb) in different concentrations were rated. The mortality of the pests was rated 24 hours after active component functioning for pollen beetle and cabbage seed weevil and after 48 hours for cabage stem flea beetle. Then lethal concentration LC 50 and LC 95 values were assessed. For ppollen beetle, the resistance against pyrethroids was confirmed with the exception, the effect of neonicotinoids was variable, acetamiprid and thiacloprid showed reduced efficiency in populations of some areas. Assessed populations of cabbage seed weevil and <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> were very sensitive to pyrethroids, but neonicotinoids showed insufficient efficiency. The indoxacarb sensitivity of pollen beetle and <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> was high...|$|E
40|$|Many organic farmers {{hesitate}} to grow winter oilseed rape (WOSR), despite its usefulness for crop rotations and animal fodder, {{because it is}} attacked by many insects, which are difficult to control without chemical treatments. In a geographically broad network of farmer’s fields, we analysed the effect of various crop management factors and of the surrounding field environment on a large range of insects known to damage WOSR: root maggot (Delia radicum L.), <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (Psylliodes chrysocephala L.), rape stem weevil (Ceuthorhynchus napi Gyl) and pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.). Our results confirm the effect of sowing date, plant density and soil tillage regime on root maggot attacks and <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> larva infestation. Early sowing tended to increase root maggot damage whereas it {{was associated with a}} lower level of attack of <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle.</b> High plant density tended to decrease the damage or the attack of all insects. We show that nitrogen availability in the soil affect <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> stem weevil levels and pollen beetle damage: the negative effect of soil nitrogen content on pollen beetle damage {{may be related to the}} significant effect of nitrogen on plant vigour and, therefore, to the compensation of pollen beetle damage on new racemes. If all insects were considered together, the proportion of land under WOSR in the region and the surrounding environment had a significant effect on pest occurrence. In regions with a high proportion of land under WOSR, the proportion of plants attacked by root maggot and pollen beetle tended to increase. Conversely, regions with high proportions of land under WOSR tended to have a smaller proportion of plants with <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae or damage, whatever the environment surrounding the field. For almost all the pests considered, the fields displaying the most severe pest attacks in regions with more than 1. 2 % WOSR were bounded by trees, hedges and bushes. Conversely, in regions with a lower percentage of land under WOSR, woodland around the field reduced the occurrence of pest attack...|$|E
40|$|European Union (EU) {{has banned}} {{the use of}} three pesticides: clothianidin, {{thiamethoxam}} and imidacloprid in bee attractive crops. These pesticides all belong to a pesticide group called neonicotinoids, and they {{are believed to be}} a contributing factor in the declining bee population. The ban was enforced in EU the 1 st of December 2013. Neonicotinoids (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) {{are an important part of}} the control of pests in oilseed rape production in Danish agriculture. The neonicotinoids are generally used as a seed treatment in oilseed rape. The coatings of the rape seeds prevent young plants from pest attack. The seed treatment of oilseed rape helps controlling <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (Psylliodes chrysocephala). The lack of seed treatment in oilseed rape could result in extra treatments with pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, Gamma cyhalothrin and Cypermethrin). 	 This project aims to identify if the banning of the three neonicotinoids (clothianidin, thamethoxam and imidacloprid), seems to result in a farming practice that puts more or less pressure on the Danish environment, with special emphasis on honey bees. In Denmark there has not been reported poisoning of honey bees from either pyrethroids or neonicotinoids. Pesticides are among the Danish apiculturist not seen as a major concern, which indicates little identified negative effect of the neonicotinoids on honey bees. When treatment with neonicotinoids in oilseed rape is substituted with a treatment with pyrethroids, the time of application should pose no threat to honey bees, as the crop are not flowering and the application period will be in the autumn, where few flowers are present in the Danish environment. 	The change in oilseed farming practice does not necessarily increase the load on the Danish environment (based on calculation of Area Load). If the Danish farmers substitute the neonicotinoids seed treatment with an extra treatment of the pyrethroid with the least Area Load (Karate WG (Lambda-cyhalothrin)). If Danish farmers based on the higher taxation, in the future solely will use Karate WG in oilseed rape, the Area Load can actually decrease compared to before the ban of neonicotinoids even with three applications. Findings of resistance in <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> in Germany towards pyrethroids makes a plausible scenario being breakdown of control of this pest in oilseed rape. Previously the control of <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> has been based on neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, which have different modes of action in <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle.</b> Resistance among <b>Cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> towards pyrethroids would result in the need of stronger doses and more applications, which would give rise to higher load on the environment including bees (increase in AL).

In the second trial a seed mixture of 95 % oilseed rape and 5 % turnip rape was sown and was compared to oilseed rape in pure crop. In both experiments the turnip rape trap crop was more attractive to <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (Psylliodes chrysocephala) and pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus) than the oilseed rape.

40|$|Three <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> species (Aphthona spp.), first {{introduced}} into North America in 1988, {{have come to}} be regarded as effective biological control organisms for leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). The black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> (Aphthona lacertosa and A. czwalinae) in particular have been shown to cause reductions in leafy spurge stem counts in the northern Great Plains, while the brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (A. nigriscutis) has persisted and spread, but has not been found to be as effective at controlling leafy spurge. The ability of black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> to control leafy spurge in any given year, however, has been found to vary. To better understand the long-term effects of <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> herbivory on leafy spurge, we monitored stem counts of leafy spurge and numbers of black and brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> at three sites on two National Wildlife Refuges in east-central North Dakota, USA, from 1998 to 2006. Brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> numbers were observed to be negligible on these sites. Over the 9 years of the study, black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> were seen to spread over the three study sites and leafy spurge stem counts declined substantially on two of the three sites. Even at low densities of spurge, black <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> populations persisted, a necessary prerequisite for long-term control. We used structural equation models (SEM) to assess the yearly effects of black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles,</b> soil texture, and refuge site on leafy spurge stem counts over this time period. We then used equations developed from the SEM analysis to explore flea beetle–leafy spurge dynamics over time, after controlling for soil texture and refuge. Yearly effect strength of black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> on leafy spurge was found to be modest, largely owing to substantial spatial variability in control.

40|$|The <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (Psylliodeschrysocephala (L.) is an {{important}} pest of winter oilseed rape in Serbia. Beetles colonize oilseed rape in early October and are active in the field until first frost and wintertime. In autumn, adults can be seen laying eggs in the soil around plants. Larvae of P. chrysocephala developed intensively on leaf petioles in November, reaching their highest numbers {{at the end of}} the month. No infested plants were found in a conventional field, while 14. 5 % of all dissected leaf petioles were infested on an integrated field. On unprotected plants in an organic field, 76. 0 % of the plants were infested with larvae at the growth-stage BBCH 18 - 19, with 31. 1 % infested leaves on average.

40|$|Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an {{important}} combinable break crop in the UK, which is largely protected from arthropod pests by insecticidal chemicals. Despite ongoing debate {{regarding the use of}} neonicotinoids, the dominant seed treatment ingredients used for this crop, there is little publicly available data comparing the efficacy of insecticides in controlling key arthropod pests or comparing the impacts on non-target species and the wider environment. To provide an insight into these matters, a UK-wide expert survey targeting agronomists and entomologists was conducted from March to June 2015. Based on the opinions of 90 respondents, an average of 20 % yield loss caused by the key arthropod pests was expected to have occurred in the absence of insecticide treatments. Relatively older chemical groups were perceived to have lower efficacy for target pests than newer ones, partly due to the development of insecticide resistance. Without neonicotinoid seed treatments, a lack of good control for <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> was perceived. Wide spectrum foliar insecticide sprays were perceived to have significantly greater negative impacts than seed treatments on users' health, natural enemies, pollinators, soil and water, and many foliar active ingredients have had potential risks for non-target arthropod species in UK oilseed rape fields for the past 25 years. Overall, 72 % of respondents opposed the neonicotinoid restriction, while 10 % supported it. Opposition and support of the restriction were largely based on concerns for pollinators and the wider environment, highlighting the uncertainty over the side effects of neonicotinoid use. More people from the government and research institutes leaned towards neutrality over the issue, compared to those directly involved in growing the crop. Neonicotinoid restriction was expected to result in greater effort and expenditure on pest control and lower production (0 - 1 t/ha less).

40|$|Winter oilseed rape, Brassica napus L., {{has become}} {{a vital part of}} cereal-based crop {{rotations}} in Europe. It is attacked by numerous insect pests and their control relies on the intensive use of insecticides (compared to other broad acre crops). The exclusive and continuous use of pyrethroid insecticides for almost twenty years led to an enormous selection pressure and facilitated the development of resistance in oilseed rape pests in Europe. Unsurprising three out of the five major pests of the order Coleoptera are reported to be pyrethroid resistant at present: the pollen beetle, Meligethes aeneus F.; the <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> Psylliodes chrysocephala L. and the cabbage seed weevil, Ceutorhynchus assimilis PAYK [...] An adult vial bioassay, which is based on insecticide coated glass vials, was used to monitor the spread and strength of pyrethroid resistance and to determine cross-resistance pattern in pollen beetle and <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle.</b> Furthermore, baseline susceptibility towards lambda-cyhalothrin (a widely used pyrethroid) was also established for the cabbage seed weevil. The vial bioassay methodology was adapted to thiacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, to determine baseline susceptibility and to provide a methodology to allow long-term susceptibility monitoring of pollen beetle and cabbage seed weevil. Thiacloprid monitoring revealed that pollen beetle and cabbage seed weevil populations collected across Europe in 2009 - 2012 and 2012 respectively were highly susceptible to this insecticide class. Metabolism studies using native microsomal preparations as the enzyme source and deltamethrin as substrate revealed metabolism of deltamethrin with 4 -OH-deltamethrin being the major metabolite. Metabolite formation in vitro was correlated with the observed pyrethroid resistance level in vivo and was suppressible by PBO. A degenerate PCR approach was used to identify partial P 450 gene sequences from pollen beetle. qRT-PCR screening covering a range of pollen beetle populations differing in levels of pyrethroid resistance identified a single P 450, CYP 6 BQ 23, as significantly and highly overexpressed (up to ~ 900 -fold) in resistant strains compared to susceptible strains. The expression of CYP 6 BQ 23 was significantly correlated with both the level of resistance and with the rate of deltamethrin metabolism in microsomal preparations of these populations. Recombinant expression of this P 450 in an insect cell line demonstrated that it is capable of hydroxylating deltamethrin and tau-fluvalinate. The turnover of these pyrethroids by CYP 6 BQ 23 is in line with the observed moderate cross-resistant phenotype. Molecular modeling suggested a better fit of deltamethrin into the active site of CYP 6 BQ 23 compared to tau-fluvalinate also supporting the biochemical results. The occurrence of target-site resistance was investigated by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the para-locus encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) in insects. To achieve this goal a partial fragment (domain IIS 4 - 6) encoding an important region of the pyrethroid binding site was PCR amplified and screened for non-synonymous SNPs. One SNP was identified causing a leucine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid residue number 1014 (Musca domestica L. numbering), well known as knock down resistance (kdr) conferring an absolute cross-resistance to pyrethroids and DDT in various insect species. Sequencing of the very same gene region in the <b>cabbage</b> <b>stem</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> also revealed the presence of the L 1014 F kdr mutation in pyrethroid resistant flea beetle populations, thus explaining the strong cross-resistance pattern observed in vitro. Most mechanistic studies of resistance have focused on elucidating the contribution of particular genes/gene families to pyrethroid resistance. To generate a comprehensive sequence resource and to elucidate global changes in gene regulation related to insecticide resistance in pollen beetle a de novo transcriptome was assembled from sequence pools generated by next-generation sequencing. RNA-sequencing of three pyrethroid resistant and one highly susceptible reference population allowed a global gene expression analysis by short read mapping against the generated transcriptome, as well as a SNP analysis. The implications of these results for resistance management in coleopteran pests in winter oilseed rape and opportunities for future work are discussed. Der Winterraps, Brassica napus L., hat sich in Europa zu einem festen Bestandteil der maßgeblich von Getreide dominierten Fruchtfolgen entwickelt. Winterraps wird von einer Vielzahl an Schädlingen befallen welche in der Praxis fast ausschließlich durch den Einsatz von chemischen Insektiziden (maßgeblich Pyrethroide) bekämpft werden. Der seit mehr als 20 Jahren wiederkehrende Einsatz von Pyrethroiden zur Kontrolle von Rapsschädlingen in Europa resultierte in einem enormen Selektionsdruck. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass drei Schädlinge der Ordnung Coleoptera gegenwärtig eine Resistenz gegen Pyrethroide aufweisen. Bei den drei coleopteren Vertretern handelt es sich um den Rapsglanzkäfer, Meligethes aeneus F., den Rapserdfloh, Psylliodes chrysocephala L. und den Kohlschotenrüssler, Ceutorhynchus assimilis PAYK [...] Mittels einem auf insektizidbeschichteten Glasröhrchen beruhenden Biotestsystem (adult vial tests) wurde die Ausprägung (Stärke und Kreuzresistenzmuster) sowie die geographische Verteilung der Pyrethroidresistenz bei Rapsglanzkäfern und Rapserdflöhen untersucht. Unter Verwendung des identischen Testsystems wurde die Baseline Susceptibility (Ausgangsempfindlichkeit) von Kohlschotenrüsseler gegen lambda-Cyhalothrin erfasst. Unter Verwendung von Thiacloprid, ein Wirkstoff der chemischen Klasse der Neonikotinoide, im Glasröhrchen Testsystem wurde die Baseline Susceptibility vom Rapsglanzkäfer und Kohlschotenrüssler erfasst. Der Metabolismus von Deltamethrin durch native mikrosomale Membranpräparationen des Rapsglanzkäfers wurde untersucht. Die Metabolismusrate von Deltamethrin zu 4 -OH-Deltamethrin in vitro war mit der erfassten Pyrethroidresistenz in vivo positiv korreliert und konnte mit PBO inhibiert werden. Mit einer PCR Strategie basierend auf degenerierten Oligonukleotiden wurden Genfragmente der P 450 Genfamilie aus Rapsglanzkäfern isoliert und deren Expression mittels qRT-PCR in Populationen mit verschiedenen Resistenzausprägungen quantifiziert. CYP 6 BQ 23 war in resistenten Populationen signifikant hochreguliert. Die Überexpression war signifikant korreliert mit der Resistenzausprägung in vivo und der Umsetzung von Deltamethrin in vitro. CYP 6 BQ 23 wurde in einer Insektenzellkultur rekombinant funktionell exprimiert und der CYP 6 BQ 23 abhängige Deltamethrinmetabolismus bewiesen. Darüber hinaus wurde gezeigt, dass CYP 6 BQ 23 auch tau-Fluvalinat umsetzt. Mithilfe eines Computermodels von CYP 6 BQ 23 wurde die Substratbindung simuliert und eine bessere Bindung für Deltamethrin im Vergleich zu tau-Fluvalinat prognostiziert. Der Einfluss von wirkortspezifischer Resistenz (target-site resistance) wurde ebenfalls untersucht. Vom para-locus, welcher den spannungsabhängigen Natriumkanal im zentralen Nervensystem der Insekten kodiert, wurde ein Genfragment (Domäne IIS 4 - 6) PCR-amplifiziert, sequenziert und auf Einzelnukleotidpolimorphismen (SNPs) untersucht. Ein SNP wurde identifiziert der in einem Aminosäureaustausch von Leucin zu Phenylalanin an Positon 1014 (Musca domestica L. Nummerierung) resultiert. Diese Mutation ist in einer Vielzahl von Insekten als knock down resistance (kdr) beschrieben und vermittelt eine Kreuzresistenz gegenüber Pyrethroiden und DDT. Im Rapserdfloh wurde die gleiche Region im orthologen Locus untersucht mit dem identischen Befund. Die L 1014 F kdr Mutation im Rapserdfloh ist korreliert mit Bekämpfungsproblemen von Rapserdflöhen beim Einsatz von Pyrethroiden. In den meisten Studien zur Aufklärung von Resistenzmechnismen wurde der Fokus auf eine spezielle Enzym-/Genfamilie gelegt. Um einen holistischeren Weg zu gehen wurde eine Transkriptomstudie beim Rapsglanzkäfer durchgeführt. Ziel war das Assemblieren des de novo Transkriptoms, die Isolierung von Genen die insektizide Wirkorte kodieren und deren Analyse auf SNPs sowie eine komparative Analyse der Genregulierung zwischen pyrethroidresistenten und sensitiven Populationen. Die Konsequenzen der Ergebnisse für ein nachhaltiges Resistenzmanagement in coleopteren Schädlingen in Winterraps and die Möglichkeiten für weiterführende Studien werden diskutiert...|$|E

This is because the transmission and survival of Pantoea stewartii, the causative organism, occurs by this vector. Management for Stewart’s disease focuses on reducing feeding by the corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> thereby reducing transmission of the bacterium. Although there are management protocols currently in place that use visual counts for corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> to help make management decisions (i. e., insecticide spraying), it may be more practical to assess the number of corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> using yellow sticky cards. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the optimum height and orientation for placing yellow sticky cards to sample for corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Leaf beetles {{belong to}} most diverse groups of insects {{and the biggest}} {{diversity}} inside this group is among <b>flea</b> <b>beetles.</b> This work summarizes existing hypotheses about their relationships with other groups of leaf beetles (especially galerucines) and compares various hypotheses about their phylogenetic position and suprageneric systematics. I also rewiev known fossils of flea beeltes and discuss their systematic position and evolutionary or biogeographic significance. The success of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> is likely caused among others by their specific characters, (e. g. their jumping ability), and also their ability to reach dozens of various strategies and ecological adaptations.

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Vegetables IPM Fact SheetFlea beetles {{are common}} pests and {{frequently}} do serious damage to vegetable crops. Excessive feeding damage by <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> can stress and kill young plants. On maturing crops, feeding may scar leaves or fruit, resulting in cosmetic damage and reduced crop value at harvest. Some species are important vectors of crop disease. <b>Flea</b> <b>beetles</b> rapidly colonize crops {{at the onset}} of warm spring weather and serious damage can occur quickly. Species occurring in the northeastern United States include the corn, potato, crucifer, eggplant, striped, horseradish, palestriped, and tobacco <b>flea</b> <b>beetle.</b> Some of these are consistent pests, whereas others only occasionally cause serious damage. As the names imply, there is a certain degree of crop specificity associated with the various species of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles,</b> although many feed on several crops and numerous weeds. On occasion, other species of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> may be present and cause damage to vegetables...|$|R
