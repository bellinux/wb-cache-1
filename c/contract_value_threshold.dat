Using data from 82 major league position players during the 2013 and 2014 seasons, our results indicate that the current and lagged values of WAR have a significant, positive effect on <b>contract</b> <b>value.</b> Among the control variables, the contract length has a significant, positive effect on the <b>contract</b> <b>value.</b> The model is used to predict free agent <b>contract</b> <b>values</b> set during the 2015 off-season.

40|$|In {{supply chain}} management, it is {{prevalent}} to design contract for coordination or proper risk-sharing {{in the supply}} chain. However, when a supply chain contract is developed based {{on the concept of}} expectation (e. g., expected profit), there is uncertainty risk with respect to the <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> which arises from various uncertainties inherent in the supply chain, such as demand uncertainty, price uncertainty, etc. We call such uncertainty risk associated with the <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> risk since it relates to the true <b>value</b> of the <b>contract.</b> <b>Value</b> risk is obviously an important factor in the design and analysis of a supply chain contract. In addition, individual supply chain agents with different risk preferences will have different risk attitudes towards the <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> risk, which affects their decisions under the contract. Motivated by the above, we conduct in this paper a mean-risk analysis for the commonly adopted wholesale price contracts with a supplier-retailer supply chain facing a stochastic price-dependent downward-sloping demand curve, taking into account <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> risk and the retailer's degree of risk-aversion. Formulating the problem under study as a supplier-led Stackelberg game, we characterize the wholesale price contract model analytically in terms of only the retailer's risk preference structure, and derive all the results in closed-form. This study makes the first attempt to assess the efficiency of wholesale price <b>contracts</b> incorporating <b>contract</b> <b>value</b> risk, and thereby some interesting managerial and academic insights are obtained. Our research provides a new perspective of looking at the performance of a supply chain contract. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

30|$|Figure 5 a {{shows the}} {{classification}} outcome. The average classification accuracy was plotted {{along with the}} empirical chance level around 54 % [53] by varying the p <b>value</b> <b>threshold</b> from 0.001 to 0.05. We started with the p value smaller than a predefined threshold 0.001 and then selected the p <b>value</b> <b>threshold</b> of interval of 0.005 till the features with their p value smaller than 0.05. Here, we empirically determined a suitable threshold for selecting the features. Figure  5 b shows that by increasing p <b>value</b> <b>threshold</b> of the t test the number of selected features increased and the classification accuracy tends to saturate (Fig.  5 a). With a stricter threshold (for lower p values), the number of selected features decreased, but {{this might not be}} sufficient to discriminate between the two classes, as represented by the low classification accuracy. Hence, the p value was gradually increased to find the optimal threshold beyond which the classification accuracy did not show much improvement.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel handoff {{decision}} algorithm for the mobile subsystem of tactical communications systems is introduced. In this algorithm, handoff decision metrics are: received signal strength measurements from the access points, {{the ratio of}} the used capacity to the total capacity for the access points, and relative directions and speeds of the mobiles to the access points. We use a fuzzy inference system to process these metrics. We also introduce a “ membership value ” to represent the degree of membership of a mobile to an access point and “membership <b>value</b> <b>threshold</b> ” to represent the minimum membership value before a mobile considers handing off to another access point. We compare our algorithm with the received signal strength based handoff decision algorithms. Our tests have shown that the proposed scheme, with the lowest membership <b>value</b> <b>threshold,</b> achieves the minimum number of handoffs, and the proposed scheme with the highest membership <b>value</b> <b>threshold</b> achieves the minimum call blocking rate.
