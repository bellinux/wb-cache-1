5|$|Considerable non-printed {{material}} in the Deseret alphabet was made, including a replica headstone in Cedar City, Utah, some coinage, letters, diaries, and meeting minutes. One of the more curious items found in the Deseret alphabet is an English-Hopi dictionary prepared by two Mormon missionaries. It sat unappreciated in handwritten form at the LDS Church Archives until 2014, when Kenneth R. Beesley, a writing system researcher and <b>computer</b> <b>scientist,</b> noticed its significance and transcribed it into standard written English.|$|E

5|$|VERA is a {{light water}} reactor {{simulation}} written at the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) on Jaguar. VERA allows engineers to monitor the performance and status of any part of a reactor core throughout the lifetime of the reactor to identify points of interest. Although {{not one of the}} first six projects, VERA was planned to run on Titan after optimization with assistance from CAAR and testing on TitanDev. <b>Computer</b> <b>scientist</b> Tom Evans found that the adaption to Titan's hybrid architecture was more difficult than to previous CPU-based supercomputers. He aimed to simulate an entire reactor fuel cycle, an eighteen to thirty-six month-long process, in one week on Titan.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English <b>computer</b> <b>scientist</b> Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The present {{research}} examines undergraduates’ stereotypes {{of the people}} in computer science, and whether changing these stereotypes using the media can influence women’s interest in computer science. In Study 1, college students at two U. S. West Coast universities (N= 293) provided descriptions of computer science majors. Coding these descriptions revealed that <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> were perceived as having traits that are incompatible with the female gender role, such as lacking interpersonal skills and being singularly focused on computers. In Study 2, college students at two U. S. West Coast universities (N= 54) read fabricated newspaper articles about <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> that either described them as fitting the current stereotypes or no longer fitting these stereotypes. Women who read that <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> no longer fit the stereotypes expressed more interest in computer science than those who read that <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> fit the stereotypes. In contrast, men’s interest in computer science did not differ across articles. Taken together, these studies suggest that stereotypes of academic fields influence who chooses to participate in these fields, and that recruiting efforts to draw more women into computer science would benefit from media efforts that alter how <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> are depicted...|$|R

The work presented in this writing introduces a new way for <b>computer</b> <b>scientists</b> to think about providing privacy protection within link analysis and introduces the notion of “privacy-enhanced linking ” as algorithms that perform link analysis with guarantees of privacy protection modeled after the Fair Information Practices. In this approach, privacy protection is realized by assessing the validity and interpretation of link analysis results such that inappropriate harm to individuals is provably minimized...|$|R
