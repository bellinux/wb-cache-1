5|$|After {{the first}} publication, the Cantiones {{appeared}} {{as part of}} a complete edition of the composer's works by Breitkopf & Härtel, begun by Philipp Spitta, who published a first volume in 1885, and completed by Arnold Schering and Heinrich Spitta in 1927. This edition was faithful to keys and <b>clefs,</b> a problem for modern performers. In 1960, Gottfried Grote published the collection in the Neue Ausgabe, transposing and with modern meter signs. A critical edition was published in 2004 by Bärenreiter, edited by Heide Volckmar-Waschk, who uses modern <b>clefs,</b> but shows the original <b>clefs</b> and retains the keys and note values.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{the rules}} of notating rhythm in Mensural {{notation}} were in many ways different from the modern system, the notation of pitch already followed much the same principles. Notes were written on staves of five (sometimes six) lines, prefixed with <b>clefs,</b> and could be altered by accidentals.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{music from}} the mensural period is {{normally}} transcribed into modern notation for performance or study, using a modern score layout, bar lines and often a modernized choice of <b>clefs.</b> A number of special editorial conventions for such transcriptions are common, especially in scholarly editions, where it is desirable that the basic characteristics of the original notation should be recoverable from the modern text.|$|E
50|$|When {{music for}} bass <b>clef</b> instruments, {{such as the}} cello or trombone, goes several ledger lines above the bass <b>clef,</b> the tenor <b>clef</b> is used; {{if it were to}} go even higher than {{practical}} in tenor <b>clef,</b> the notes may be notated in treble <b>clef,</b> {{or in the case of}} trombone, alto <b>clef.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{accomplished}} performer {{today is}} expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass <b>clef,</b> tenor <b>clef,</b> alto <b>clef,</b> and (more rarely) treble <b>clef</b> in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble <b>clef</b> in B as well.|$|R
2500|$|Trombone {{parts are}} {{typically}} notated in bass <b>clef,</b> though sometimes also written in tenor <b>clef</b> or alto <b>clef.</b> The use of alto <b>clef</b> is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, {{with the second}} trombone part written in tenor <b>clef</b> and the third (bass) part in bass <b>clef.</b> As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass <b>clef.</b> Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto <b>clef</b> staff (the German Robert Schumann {{was the first to}} do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts may contain both bass and tenor <b>clef</b> or bass and alto <b>clef</b> sections. [...] Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass <b>clef.</b> [...] The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.|$|R
25|$|The bassoon is a woodwind {{instrument}} {{in the double}} reed family that typically plays music written in the bass and tenor <b>clefs,</b> and occasionally the treble. Appearing in its modern form in the 19th century, the bassoon figures prominently in orchestral, concert band, and chamber music literature. The bassoon is a non-transposing instrument known for its distinctive tone colour, wide range, variety of character and agility. Listeners often compare its warm, dark, reedy timbre {{to that of a}} male baritone voice. Someone who plays the bassoon is called a bassoonist.|$|E
25|$|On 16 January 2009, several sources, {{including}} Hunter's own website, {{announced that}} Mott the Hoople would reunite for two concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, on 2 and 3 October 2009. These two dates sold out, and three additional dates were added. In the end, Mott the Hoople played 2 warm up gigs in Monmouth, 5 {{nights at the}} Hammersmith Apollo, and made a final appearance at the Tartan <b>Clefs</b> Charity night at the Kelvin Hall that November. A further British tour in 2013, taking in Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Manchester (which was released on CD and DVD), culminated in a last night at The O2 arena on the 18 November 2013.|$|E

In an interview with Greg Kelton of The Advertiser, Loughnan outlined the band's future: [...] "If Beyond doesn't make it {{for us in the}} States we might as well forget all about Ayers Rock." [...] From May to July they toured the US again, [...] "only achiev limited success overseas."

500|$|Schmittou invited fans {{to submit}} {{suggestions}} for the team's name {{which would be}} voted on by a group that included local sports writers and county musicians. Among the finalists were [...] "Stars", [...] "Notes", [...] "Hits", [...] "Strings", [...] "Kats", [...] "Pickers", and [...] "Vols". The chosen name, [...] "Sounds", is a play on the term [...] "Nashville sound", a subgenre of American country music that traces its roots to {{the area in the}} late-1950s. The team's wordmark and color scheme were lifted from the Memphis Sounds of the American Basketball Association (ABA), who used them from 1974 to 1975. When the ABA merged with the National Basketball Association in 1976, some of the copyrights were allowed to lapse, and Nashville's baseball team adopted the abandoned scheme. The color blue was added to Memphis' red and white palette. Nashville's original logo, which was used from 1978 into 1998, and was initially sketched by Schmittou, reflected the city's association with the country music industry. It depicted a mustachioed old-time baseball player, nicknamed [...] "Slugger," [...] swinging at a baseball with a guitar, a staple of country music, in place of a bat. Further illustrating the city's musical ties was the typeface, with letters resembling musical notes and treble <b>clefs,</b> used to display the team name.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (<b>CLEF)</b> is {{to develop}} and {{maintain}} an infrastructure {{for the evaluation of}} information retrieval systems operating on European languages in both monolingual and cross-language contexts, and to create testsuites of reusable data that can be employed by system developers for benchmarking purposes. Two <b>CLEF</b> evaluation campaigns have been held so far (<b>CLEF</b> 2000 and <b>CLEF</b> 2001); <b>CLEF</b> 2002 is now under way.

2500|$|Mensural {{notation}} generally uses C and F <b>clefs,</b> {{on various}} lines. G-clefs, while used infrequently throughout the period, [...] {{did not come}} into completely routine use until the later 16th century. <b>Clefs</b> were generally chosen to match the vocal range of a given voice, {{so as to avoid}} the need of ledger lines. Since middle C lies within that range for most voices, the C-clef is the one most frequently used. For mixed voices, a typical combination of <b>clefs</b> would have the bass clef (F on the fourth staff line) in the lowest voice, and tenor clef, alto clef and soprano clef (middle C on the fourth, third, and first staff line respectively) in the remaining voices. An alternative arrangement, known as chiavette, had the range of each voice shifted one third up, leading to a combination of F3, C3, C2 and G2 <b>clefs.</b>|$|E

2500|$|To {{account for}} these {{editorial}} changes, scholarly editions often print a brief notation fragment {{in the original}} form {{in front of each}} staff {{at the beginning of a}} piece, called an [...] "incipit", including the original <b>clefs,</b> mensuration signs, accidentals, and often the first few notes. Alternatively, an annotation defining the mapping scheme may be provided over the staff, e.g., [...] "=".|$|E
50|$|Music can be {{transposed}} {{at sight}} if a different <b>clef</b> is mentally substituted for the written one. For example, {{to play an}} A-clarinet part, a B-clarinet player may mentally substitute tenor <b>clef</b> for the written treble <b>clef.</b> Concert-pitch music in bass <b>clef</b> can be read on an E instrument {{as if it were}} in treble <b>clef.</b> (Notes will not always sound in the correct octave.) The written key signature must always be adjusted to the proper key for the instrument being played.|$|R
50|$|Music that {{is written}} for the viola {{differs from that of}} most other instruments, in that it {{primarily}} uses the alto <b>clef,</b> which is otherwise rarely used. The trombone occasionally uses the alto <b>clef,</b> but not primarily. (The comparatively rare alto trombone primarily uses the alto <b>clef.)</b> Viola music employs the treble <b>clef</b> when there are substantial sections of music written in a higher register. In the alto <b>clef,</b> the note A4 is the space above the top line of the <b>clef,</b> D4 is in the second space down, G3 is in the space {{at the bottom of the}} staff, and C3 is two spaces under the staff. In treble <b>clef,</b> the note A4 is the second space, D4 is one space under the staff, and so on.|$|R
50|$|Where the G-clef {{is placed}} on the second line of the stave, it is called the treble <b>clef.</b> This is the most common <b>clef</b> used today, and the only G-clef still in use. For this reason, the terms G-clef and treble <b>clef</b> are often seen as synonymous. The treble <b>clef</b> was {{historically}} used to mark a treble, or pre-pubescent, voice part.|$|R

The exercises are divided into three groups: one for polyrhythm, one for polytonality and one that included exercises written on four staves and so required knowledge of the alto and tenor <b>clefs.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Neumes {{are written}} on a four-line staff on the lines and spaces, unlike modern music notation, which uses five lines.

The clef bracketing a line indicates the location [...] "ut" [...] {{in the case of}} the C clef, or [...] "fa" [...] {{in the case of the}} F clef as shown: ...|$|E
50|$|The F <b>clef</b> {{can also}} be notated with an octave marker. The F <b>clef</b> notated to sound an octave lower is used for {{contrabass}} instruments such as the double bass and contrabassoon. The F <b>clef</b> notated to sound an octave higher {{is used for the}} bass recorder. However, both of these are extremely rare (and, in fact, the countertenor <b>clef</b> is largely intended to be humorous as with the works of P.D.Q. Bach). In Italian scores up to Gioachino Rossini's Overture to William Tell, the cor anglais was written in bass <b>clef</b> an octave lower than sounding. The unmodified bass <b>clef</b> is so common that performers of instruments and voice parts whose ranges lie below the stave simply learn the number of ledger lines for each note through common use, and if a line's true notes lie significantly above the bass <b>clef</b> the composer or publisher will often simply write the part in either the treble <b>clef</b> or notated an octave down under an 8va bracket.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{most often}} found in tenor parts in SATB settings, in which a treble <b>clef</b> is written with the numeral eight below it, {{indicating}} that the pitches sound an octave below the written value. As the true tenor <b>clef</b> has fallen into disuse in vocal writings, this [...] "octave-dropped" [...] treble <b>clef</b> is often called the tenor <b>clef.</b> The same <b>clef</b> is sometimes used for the octave mandolin. In some scores, the same concept is construed by using a double clef—two G-clefs overlapping one another.|$|R
50|$|Tenor = treble <b>clef</b> with an 8 below or {{a double}} treble <b>clef.</b> Many pieces, {{particularly}} those {{from before the}} 21st century, use an unaltered treble <b>clef,</b> with the expectation the tenors will still sing an octave lower than notated.|$|R
2500|$|In November 1252 William II died at Domène. Rudolf {{immediately}} {{acted to}} expand his shrunken county of Geneva. By arms he forced Simon de Joinville, the lord of Gex, to do him homage. He seized the castle at Charousse and expelled a creditor of “the Little Charlemagne”, who was holding it as security on a loan. For this castle he steadfastly refused to do homage to any Savoyard. When his aunt, Margaret, the dowager countess of Savoy, died in 1258, Rudolf took over the lands at Cornillon and the Val des <b>Clefs</b> that formed her dowry.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cover of}} Fats Domino's version of [...] "Blueberry Hill" [...] was issued in December on a four-track {{extended}} play, Blueberry Hill, which reached number11 on the Go-Set singles chart.

After some personal crises, Clyne left {{and moved to}} Sydney; he was replaced by Treva Richards (ex Delta Set) on piano and organ in September. [...] After leaving The Loved Ones, Clyne played in The Black Pearls, The Ram Jam Big Band, Excalibur, Levi Smith's <b>Clefs</b> and Chain; he was in Aunty Jack's backing group The Gong in the mid-1970s.|$|E
2500|$|A {{simplified}} system for plainsong was provided. The twelve notes are the twelve {{characters of the}} upper half of the cell (the first and fifth decades) which do not have dashes. By themselves (1st decade), they indicate half notes. Quarter notes are 2nd decade, dotted quarter notes 3rd, and eighth notes 4th. Dotted half notes are indicated by a dash below (6th decade), whole notes by a dash above (7th decade), and dotted whole notes by a mid dash (8th decade). The alto, bass, treble, and tenor <b>clefs</b> were indicated by the 5th–8th characters of the fifth decade. [...] is the sharp-note prefix, [...] the bass-note prefix, and the equivalent with a dash the natural prefix. [...] are the repetition sign and 'star'.|$|E
50|$|In {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, a special <b>clef</b> was used for violin music, {{particularly}} that published in France. For this reason it is known as the French <b>clef</b> or French violin <b>clef</b> although it was more commonly used for flute music. The G-clef is placed on the first line of the stave and is identical to the bass <b>clef</b> transposed up two octaves.|$|R
40|$|After {{ten years}} of {{increasingly}} successful evaluation campaigns, the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (<b>CLEF)</b> {{has come to an}} appropriate moment to assess what has been achieved in this decade and also to consider future directions and how to renew and complement it. This paper will provide a brief summary of the most significant results achieved by <b>CLEF</b> in the past ten years, it will describe the new format and organization for <b>CLEF</b> which is being experimented {{for the first time in}} <b>CLEF</b> 2010, and it will discuss some future perspective for <b>CLEF,</b> beyond 2010...|$|R
50|$|This <b>clef</b> is {{used for}} the upper ranges of the bassoon, cello, euphonium, double bass, and trombone. These {{instruments}} use bass <b>clef</b> for their low- to mid-ranges; treble <b>clef</b> is also used for their upper extremes. Where used for the double bass, the sound is an octave lower than the written pitch. The tenor violin parts were also drafted in this <b>clef</b> (see e.g. Giovanni Battista Vitali's Op. 11). Formerly, it was used by the tenor part in vocal music but its use has been largely supplanted either with an octave version of the treble <b>clef</b> where written alone or the bass <b>clef</b> where combined on one stave with the bass part.|$|R
