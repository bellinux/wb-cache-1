The reports themselves were relatively brief and conventional, but in the early years they were accompanied by lengthy appendixes comprising detailed descriptions of the archival collections that had been inspected, in a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>lists,</b> calendars and transcripts of selected documents. The first such report was published, as a folio volume, in 1870: the appendix included reports on the manuscript collections of 44 corporate bodies and 36 private owners in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and one located overseas (English manuscripts at Heidelberg University). Eight further reports, with increasingly detailed appendixes, were issued over the following years, the ninth and last in folio format appearing in 1883-4. Although the contents of many of the appendixes have been superseded by more comprehensive publications and finding aids, this is not invariably the case, and a number of the early reports continue to be used by researchers.|$|E

40|$|The ranking {{aggregation}} {{problem is}} that to establishing a new aggregate ranking given a set of rankings of a finite set of items. This problem is met in various applications, such as the combination of user preferences, the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>lists</b> of documents retrieved by search engines and the combination of ranked gene lists. In the literature, the ranking aggregation problem has been solved as an optimization of some distance between the rankings overlooking {{the existence of a}} true ranking. In this thesis we address the ranking aggregation problem assuming the existence of a true ranking on the set of items: the goal is to estimate an unknown, true ranking given a set of input rankings provided by experts with different approximation quality. We propose a novel solution called Belief Ranking Estimator (BRE) that takes into account two aspects still unexplored in ranking combination: the approximation quality of the experts {{and for the first time}} the uncertainty related to each item position in the ranking. BRE estimates in an unsupervised way the true ranking given a set of rankings that are diverse quality estimations of the unknown true ranking. The uncertainty on the items's position in each ranking is modeled within the Belief Function Theory framework, that allows for the combination of subjective knowledge in a non Bayesian way. This innovative application of belief functions to rankings, allows us to encode different sources of a priori knowledge about the correctness of the ranking positions and also to weigh the reliability of the experts involved in the combination. We assessed the performance of our solution on synthetic and real data against state-of-the-art methods. The tests comprise the aggregation of total and partial rankings in different empirical settings aimed at representing the different quality of the input rankings with respect to the true ranking. The results show that BRE provides an effective solution when the input rankings are heterogeneous in terms of approximation quality with respect to the unknown true ranking...|$|E

40|$|A tree growing {{technique}} is used here together with classical scheduling algorithms {{in order to}} improve the test concurrency having assigned power dissipation limits. First of all, the problem of unequal-length block-test scheduling under power dissipation constraints is modeled as a tree growing problem. Then a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>list</b> and force-directed scheduling algorithms is adapted to tackle it. The goal of this approach is to achieve rapidly a test scheduling solution with a near-optimal test application time. This is initially achieved with the list approach. Then the power dissipation distribution of this solution is balanced by using a force-directed global priority function. The force-directed priority function is a distribution-graph based global priority function. A constant additive model is employed for power dissipation analysis and estimation. Based on test scheduling examples, the efficiency of this approach is discussed as compared to the other approaches...|$|R

40|$|Microblogs are an {{opportunity}} for scavenging critical information such as sentiments. This information {{can be used to}} detect rapidly the sentiment of the crowd towards crises or disasters. It can be used as an effective tool to inform humanitarian efforts, and improve the ways in which informative messages are crafted for the crowd regarding an event. Unique characteristics of microblogs (lack of context, use of jargon etc) in Tweets expressed by a message-sharing social network during a disaster response require special handling to identify sentiment. We present a systematic evaluation of approaches to accurately and precisely identify sentiment in these Tweets. This paper describes sentiment detection expressed in 3698 Tweets, collected during the September 2010, San Bruno, California gas explosion and resulting fires. The data collected was manually coded to benchmark our techniques. We start by using a library of words with annotated sentiment, SentiWordNet 3. 0, to detect the basic sentiment of each Tweet. We complemented that technique by adding a comprehensive <b>list</b> <b>of</b> emoticons, a sentiment based dictionary and a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> out-of-vocabulary words that are popular in brief, online text communications such as lol, wow, etc. Our technique performed 27 % better than Bayesian Networks alone, and the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> Bayesian networks with annotated lists provided marginal improvements in sentiment detection than various <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>lists...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} email spam is to {{advertise}} to sell, phishing attacks, DDOS attacks and many more. Many solutions {{of various kinds}} such as blacklisting, whitelisting, grey-listing, content filtering have been proposed at the sender and receiver levels. There has been some level of success but the email spam still hits the inbox and more so the problem is false positives and false negatives. The current filtering solutions used are mostly a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> few of the available techniques, the most common being a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>listing</b> and content filtering techniques. Apart from any attacks, email spam causes a great loss in resources and productivity of the user.

The filters at the mail servers are trained with spam and ham training data that is generic in nature. Hence, there is need to address this problem. This paper aims to address all of the above i. e. an email that hits a particular users inbox by escaping the mail server spam filtering solutions.
