40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{agree that}} the best employee publications offer job and company-related information in an honest and timely manner. The challenge of balancing {{the mission of the}} organization and providing objective analysis of issues and events on campus also falls in the editor of university internal publications. The objectives of this study were to analyze the content of thirteen university employee publications and determine what type of content their employees were receiving and whether those non-profit organizations provide content that is similar to findings in previous research on for-profit organizations. The current research was a content analysis of employee publications at thirteen Mid-American Conference universities during the year 2000. Each publication was analyzed using two methods. First, each story or piece of content was categorized according to Click's (1967) established categories for employee publication content. Next, the researcher placed each content piece into one of two categories: issue-oriented or event-oriented content, based on research by Ryan and Owen (1976). Publications produced by the Mid-American Conference Universities provided significantly more employee content, 58 percent, than company/university content, 27 percent, supporting the first hypothesis. Findings from the current research were similar to the original research by Click (1967) in many ways. Results showed that the ranks of <b>corporate</b> <b>publication</b> content and university publication content are similar. Publications used for this study produced significantly more event-oriented content, 91. 5 percent, than issue-oriented content, 8. 5 percent, which supported the second hypothesis.

40|$|<b>Corporate</b> {{scientific}} <b>publications</b> {{are often}} {{presented as a}} strategic means for firms to create prior art with the objective to prevent others from patenting related inventions.

This paper analyses for the first time whether the presumed mechanism behind <b>corporate</b> <b>publications</b> as a means to preempt patents works. With a focus on the semiconductor technology, our results show that scientific publications by corporations challenge the novelty of patent applications at the European Patent Office (EPO) significantly more than other pieces of prior art. Detailed information from the EPO patent examination procedure allows us to show that <b>corporate</b> <b>publications</b> threaten the novelty of patent applications if combined with other pieces of prior art like patents rather than as standalone documents. This supports the claim that corporate scientific publishing can be an effective means for firms to protect their freedom to operate if used as a complementary part of a firm’s overall IP protection strategy...|$|R

Through research in non-governmental agency reports, government statistics, academic journals, interviews, and <b>corporate</b> <b>publications,</b> I am investigating {{the extent to which the}} revenue generated from foreign direct investment in Burma supports and finances the military regime’s repression of Burmese citizens through further militarization of the state. Specifically, this paper highlights two case studies, the Yadana and Yetagun projects, as examples of the increased militarization and human rights abuses in the pipeline region. The country’s rich natural resource endowment and its strategic location between India and China and the Indian Ocean make Burma a strong target for continued foreign investment. Therefore, as it is unlikely that foreign investment in the natural gas and oil sectors in Burma will cease in the near future, I seek to draw attention to the flow of capital from these sectors within the country. Understanding the relationship between energy revenue and forced labor, relocation, portering and other human rights abuses is critical in evaluating the prospects for human security and stability in Myanmar...|$|R

40|$|Years of research, <b>corporate</b> <b>publications,</b> {{patents and}} {{trademarks}} {{have led to}} a greatly improved and cost efficient erosion control technology. Development of new polyacrylamide (PAM) blends and delivery methodologies has resulted in a whole new class of in-situ erosion control and water clarification tools. Multi-disciplinary environmental industry projects for mining, construction, water treatment and biological research have proven this class of Best Management Practices (BMPs). Practical, efficient and cost effective methodologies have been developed that utilize water-soluble, PAM chemistry to routinely reduce erosion and runoff turbidity by over 95 %. These methodologies significantly improve the performance derived by agriculture technologies currently in use within many countries. This performance advancement derives from the precise correlation between polymer selection and target soil lithology characterization. Resultant soil particles are flocculated, agglomerated and chelated in-situ, with significantly reduced suspended solids, metals, TMDLs and NTU values of runoff waters entering riparian water bodies. This presentation provides to attendees the principles that enable realization of the desired performance, including: 1) basic polymer-soil chemistry fundamentals, 2) application technologies, and 3) economic & environmental considerations. The information provided will allow erosion control professionals to determine if this technology is suitable for the various mining reclamation, forestry or construction site applications, and, if so, how to economically achieve storm water quality that facilitates compliance and meets regulation...|$|R
