5|$|A {{conspiracy}} trial presents complicated {{questions of}} {{strategy for the}} defense.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{focuses on}} <b>counselling</b> <b>for</b> {{survivors}} in the Czech Republic. The {{aim is to}} outline the form of <b>counselling</b> <b>for</b> survivors in the CR and to clarify the meaning {{and the role of}} <b>counselling</b> services <b>for</b> survivors from the perspective of hospice facilities and <b>counselling</b> <b>for</b> survivors. The first part of thesis is the fundamental concept of death, mourning, counseling for survivors and itÂ´s process. This part is followed by the operationalization chapter that explains the research questions. The research was conducted with employees in hospice facilities and counseling offices. The research results shed light on the form, meaning and role of counseling for survivors in the process of coping with grief. The thesis also deals with the institutionalization and professionalization of <b>counselling</b> <b>for</b> survivors and highlights the lack of systematic education in this area...|$|R

5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as <b>counsel</b> <b>for</b> Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E
