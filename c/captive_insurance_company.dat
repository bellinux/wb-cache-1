50|$|A {{stumbling}} block to settlements {{was the fact}} that many of the World Trade Center victims were highly compensated financial professionals. Families of these victims felt the compensation offers were too low, and, had a court considered their case on an individual basis, they would have been awarded much higher amounts. This concern had to be balanced against the time, complications, and risks of pursuing an individual case, and the real possibility that the airlines and their insurers could be bankrupted before being able to pay the claim.

5000|$|The term [...] "captive" [...] {{was coined}} by the [...] "father of captive insurance", Frederic M. Reiss, {{while he was}} {{bringing}} his concept into practice for his first client, the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company, in Ohio in the 1950s. The company {{had a series of}} mining operations, and its management referred to the mines whose output was put solely to the corporation's use as captive mines. When Reiss helped the company incorporate its own insurance subsidiaries, they were called captive insurance companies because they wrote insurance exclusively for the captive mines. Reiss continued to use the term: the policyholder owns the insurance company i.e. the insurer is captive to the policyholder. If the captive insures its own parent and affiliates, it is called a pure captive. If it insures just one type of industry (e.g. energy industries), it is called a homogeneous captive. A <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> can also insure a group of diverse companies; this is called a heterogeneous captive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two recent Department of Labor (DOL) {{decisions}} have {{cleared the way}} for captive insurance subsidiaries to insure the employee benefits of their parent firms. This paper examines whether using captives for this purpose is beneficial for employ-ees and whether employee benefit premiums should be tax deductible in this case. We conclude that under the DOL’s conditions, the practice is advantageous for employees. Furthermore, we conclude that unless outside risk and outside premiums are added to the pooling arrangement, there’s no basis for permitting premiums to be tax deductible. The analysis suggests the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of employ-ee benefit risk as “outside risk ” when insured by the parent company’s captive insurer is incorrect.

The <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> (which has become the most prominent in Bermuda) and the asset protection trust (pioneered in the Cook Islands) have become important instruments through which the wealthy increase their own security and reduce the compensation that they pay for misfor-tunes that befall the general population.

40|$|We {{examine how}} a Japanese firm can derive the most value from a <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company.</b> We use actual data on losses, captive {{operating}} costs, {{interest rates and}} foreign exchange rates to simulate cash flows from a hypothetical pure captive. We examine three domiciles popular with Japanese firms: Bermuda, Hawaii and Guernsey. We find a high likelihood that the captive generates economic value for its Japanese parent firm especially when it operated over multiple years. We find that when the captive reinsures its entire book of business thus acting as a pass-through vehicle to the global reinsurance market, it normally delivers economic value but near to break-even. We also find that the captive can generate high levels of economic value but only by taking on higher levels of operating risk. We find that the value-maximizing strategy is for a Japanese corporation to establish its captive in Bermuda while the risk-minimizing strategy is to establish its captive in Guernsey. We also find that Bermuda {{would be a better}} choice than Hawaii for Japanese captives from the viewpoint of risk-return tradeoff. ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Captive</b> <b>insurance</b> is an {{alternative}} to self-insurance in which a parent group or groups create a licensed <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> to provide coverage for itself. The main purpose of doing so is to avoid using traditional commercial <b>insurance</b> <b>companies,</b> which have volatile pricing, and may not meet {{the specific needs of}} the company. By creating their own <b>insurance</b> <b>company,</b> the parent company can reduce their costs, insure difficult risks, have direct access to reinsurance markets, and increase cash flow. When a company creates a captive they are indirectly able to evaluate the risks of subsidiaries, write policies, set premiums and ultimately either return unused funds in the form of profits, or invest them for future claim payouts. <b>Captive</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> sometimes insure the risks of the group's customers. This is {{an alternative}} form of risk management that is becoming a more practical and popular means through which companies can protect themselves financially while having more control over how they are insured.|$|R
40|$|UMHS) has fully {{disclosed}} {{and offered}} compensation to patients for medical errors. Objective: To compare liability claims and costs {{before and after}} implementation of the UMHS disclosure-with-offer program. Design: Retrospective before–after analysis from 1995 to 2007. Setting: Public academic medical center and health system. Patients: Inpatients and outpatients involved in claims made to UMHS. Measurements: Number of new claims for compensation, number of claims compensated, time to claim resolution, and claims-related costs. Results: After full implementation of a disclosure-with-offer pro-gram, the average monthly rate of new claims decreased from 7. 03 to 4. 52 per 100 000 patient encounters (rate ratio [RR], 0. 64 [95 % CI, 0. 44 to 0. 95]). The average monthly rate of lawsuits de-creased from 2. 13 to 0. 75 per 100 000 patient encounters (RR, 0. 35 [CI, 0. 22 to 0. 58]). Median time from claim report-ing to resolution decreased from 1. 36 to 0. 95 years. Average monthly cost rates decreased for total liability (RR, 0. 41 [CI, 0. 26 to 0. 66]), patient compensation (RR, 0. 41 [CI, 0. 26 to 0. 67]), and non – compensation-related legal costs (RR, 0. 39 [CI, 0. 22 to 0. 67]). Limitations: The study design cannot establish causality. Malprac-tice claims generally declined in Michigan during {{the latter part of}} the study period. The findings might not apply to other health systems, given that UMHS has a closed staff model covered by a <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company</b> and often assumes legal responsibility. Conclusion: The UMHS implemented a program of full disclosure of medical errors with offers of compensation without increasing its total claims and liability costs...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{seeks to}} {{demonstrate}} that tax havens are used {{for a number of}} purposes that provide planning which is not contrary to the domestic laws of Australia and the United States as indicative regimes. The thesis will primarily utilise doctrinal research in reviewing and applying the legislative methods adopted to make the use of tax havens ineffective. Theoretical research will be conducted in a number of chapters where an in depth analysis of the legal principles involved in the methodologies and structures will be undertaken. In the final chapter reform-oriented research will be utilised. Part A of the thesis will review a number of situations which it is submitted are legitimate and beyond the scope of the laws of OECD countries to prevent. The thesis will demonstrate that operations with substance established in tax havens to undertake the following types of activities will be effective to reduce the incidence of taxation on a corporate group – operation of a regional headquarters, treasury function or <b>captive</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company.</b> The thesis will also demonstrate that basing operations in a tax haven to facilitate the use of an international agreement would also be effective in many cases. A review of the use of tax havens for asset protection will demonstrate that a number of tax havens provide extensive mechanisms which are established for purposes other than taxation. As these were found to be legally effective they are legitimate {{in the context of this}} thesis. Part B of the thesis will consider a number of structures which have as one of their key design elements the non-application of the attribution regimes of Australia and the United States. The thesis will show that non charitable purpose trusts, star trusts, protected cell companies, foundations, companies limited by guarantee and insurance arrangements are effective to circumvent the attribution regimes of Australia and the United States. The thesis will however show that blind trusts are ineffective to circumvent the attribution regimes. The thesis will also address the weaknesses in the attribution regimes and provide recommendations to overcome these weaknesses...|$|E
