Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E

5|$|Research in {{the early}} 2000s {{combining}} the use of phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences and more traditional morphology-based characters {{has resulted in a}} reshuffling of the species concept in Gomphus; as a result, G.clavatus is considered the only Gomphus species in North America. <b>Comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DNA sequences of species Gomphus brevipes and Gomphus truncatus has shown them to be genetically identical to G.clavatus, and they may be treated as synonyms.|$|E
5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from a <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Stoa was {{destroyed}} by the Roman army during the sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Its site on the Temple Mount esplanade is currently inaccessible to archaeologists. However, artifacts from the Stoa have been recovered both from excavations {{at the foot of}} the platform and in secondary use in later constructions. This evidence has confirmed details given in the accounts of the historian Josephus, and has also allowed <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Stoa's decoration with that used in other, contemporaneous monumental buildings.|$|E

He sent the <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two photos to both McNall and Sotheby's, but never received a response back. Some memorabilia collectors have dismissed Ray's claims, saying that the photo hardly proves any doctoring was ever done on the card.|$|E
