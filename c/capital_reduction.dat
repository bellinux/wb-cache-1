5000|$|... 1992Two capital {{reductions}} within J.E. Ekornes AS {{were carried}} out during 1992. At the Annual General Meeting on June 29 the share capital of NOK 72,073,880 was written down to NOK 0. This <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> was used to cover losses {{which could not be}} covered in any other way. The <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> was achieved by redeeming the shares. The Ekornes family's subordinated loan of NOK 2,700,000 was converted into shares. After this, the new share capital amounts to NOK 2,052,000. At the company's Annual General Meeting on October 5, 1992 it was agreed to write down the share capital of NOK 2,052,000 as well. This <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> was also achieved by redeeming the shares. At the same time as this latest <b>capital</b> <b>reduction,</b> 1,026,000 new shares were issued in the company, each with a nominal value of NOK 1. These shares constituted the company's share capital as of December 31, 1992. The Ekornes Group showed a profit {{for the first time since}} 1984.

40|$|The process {{intensification}} technologies, reactive distillation, dividing wall column distillation (DWC) and reverse flow reactors (RFR) {{have been implemented}} at commercial scale in the petrochemical industry each more than 100 times. These technologies have been analysed with four drivers for innovation in the chemical process industry: feedstock cost <b>reduction,</b> <b>capital</b> expenditure <b>reduction,</b> energy reduction and safety risk reduction and with four hurdles for innovation: risk of failure by combining novel aspects, scale-up knowledge uncertainty, equipment unreliability and higher Safety, Health, Environmental risks compared to conventional technologies. The analysis shows that reactive distillation, DWC and RFR all have significant <b>capital</b> cost <b>reduction</b> over conventional technologies and the first two also have energy reductions, while all hurdles for innovation are low. The preliminary conclusion is that {{process intensification}} technologies will probably be rapidly implemented in commercial scale operation when {{at least one of}} the mentioned drivers is existent and when all mentioned hurdles are low. ...|$|R

Additionally, two independent referees have analyzed and rated {{a subset of the}} sample of managers' (N = 97) comments over an electronic discussion group about their job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, and deviant behavior. Analyses of both sets of data show that job insecurity is negatively related to satisfaction and that job insecurity has both direct and indirect effects on work behaviors and emotions.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the Securities Regulation Code on Takeovers and Mergers ("the Code") was to achieve neutrality of treatment of minority shareholders in takeover situations irrespective of the method employed to effect the takeover.

Asset takeovers are also excluded from the ambit of the Code. It is suggested that <b>capital</b> <b>reductions</b> and security conversions be prohibited to effect a takeover unless the Code is applicable to the transaction. The scheme of arrangement procedure, with certain suggested amendments, should be retained as a takeover method. It is further suggested that section 228 of the Companies Act be amended to ensure greater minority shareholder protection but that asset takeovers not be included within the ambit of the Code at this stage.

At the end of 1931 the chairman reported a small loss for S T D Motors but having, for the first time, synchronised reporting for the nine trading subsidiaries no one was quite clear about the year's real profits or losses of the group but they did at least now have a proper grip of the extent of the group's assets and liabliilites.

40|$|Under the Basel II standards, the Operational Risk (OpRisk) {{advanced}} measurement approach {{allows a}} provision for reduction of capital {{as a result}} of insurance mitigation of up to 20 %. This paper studies different insurance policies in the context of <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> for a range of extreme loss models and insurance policy scenarios in a multi-period, multiple risk setting. A Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) for modeling of the annual loss process, involving homogeneous compound Poisson processes for the annual losses, with heavy-tailed severity models comprised of [alpha]-stable severities is considered. There has been little analysis of such models to date and it is believed insurance models will play more of a role in OpRisk mitigation and <b>capital</b> <b>reduction</b> in future. The first question of interest is when would it be equitable for a bank or financial institution to purchase insurance for heavy-tailed OpRisk losses under different insurance policy scenarios? The second question pertains to Solvency II and addresses quantification of insurer capital for such operational risk scenarios. Considering fundamental insurance policies available, in several two risk scenarios, we can provide both analytic results and extensive simulation studies of insurance mitigation for important basic policies, the intention being to address questions related to VaR reduction under Basel II, SCR under Solvency II and fair insurance premiums in OpRisk for different extreme loss scenarios. In the process we provide closed-form solutions for the distribution of loss processes and claims processes in an LDA structure as well as closed-form analytic solutions for the Expected Shortfall, SCR and MCR under Basel II and Solvency II. We also provide closed-form analytic solutions for the annual loss distribution of multiple risks including insurance mitigation.
