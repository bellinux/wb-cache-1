The aerodynamic characteristics of new configurations are investigated, {{with an emphasis on}} estimating the accuracy of computational methods. Aeromechanical stability boundaries of advanced rotorcraft and rotor-fuselage interactions are explored. The acoustic characteristics of most of the full-scale vehicles are also determined, as well as acoustic research aimed at discovering and reducing aerodynamic sources of noise. In addition to the normal data gathering methods (e.g., balance system, pressure measuring transducers, and temperature sensing thermocouples), state-of-the-art non-intrusive instrumentation (e.g., laser velocimeters and shadowgraphs) are available to help determine flow direction and velocity in and around the lifting surfaces of models or aircraft undergoing investigation.

40|$|The {{international}} {{reactor safety}} project Phebus FP {{is devoted to}} the study of core meltdown {{in the case of a}} severe accident scenario. Its main objective is to study the fuel degradation, the release and transport of fission products and structure material in the reactor coolant system (RCS) and containment building, with special attention to iodine radiochemistry. The test sequence of those experiments included an irradiation phase, a fuel bundle degradation phase and a long-term phase dedicated to the analysis of aerosol and iodine radiochemistry in the containment vessel. The FPT- 2 test was performed using a bundle configuration in a steam poor environment and with injection of boric acid. On-line measurements and post-test analyses indicate that releases of noble gases (Xe, Kr) from the fuel bundle are very high (up to 80 % of initial bundle inventory); other elements can be classified as high-volatile with releases higher than 50 % of bundle initial inventory (FPs: Cs, I, Te, Mo), as semi-volatile with releases comprised between 10 and 50 % (FPs: Rb and control rod material: Cd) and low-volatile with releases lower than 10 % (FPs: Ru, Ba and control rod material: Ag, In). Important material deposition was observed in the circuit, so that material inventory reaching the containment is significantly lower than the fractions released from the degraded bundle. The release and transport kinetics of material could be determined and seems strongly correlated with bundle degradation events (first fuel Zircaloy cladding oxidation phase, late oxidation phase and fuel liquefaction and displacement). In the circuit, specific instrumentation devoted to iodine speciation revealed that iodine exists mainly in a vapour form in the hot leg (700 °C), most probably as vapour of metal iodide. Between the <b>circuit</b> hot <b>leg</b> and the cold leg (150 °C), condensation of those species both on the circuit surface and on transported aerosols is quite extensive. Therefore, iodine transiting through the <b>circuit</b> cold <b>leg</b> before arriving in the containment vessel was found mainly to be in an aerosol form.

40|$|Background: Although {{recent studies}} {{point to the}} {{involvement}} of the primary motor cortex in postural control, it is unknown if age-related deterioration of postural control is associated with changes in motor cortical circuits. We examined the interaction between age and sensory condition in the excitability of intracortical motor pathways as indexed by short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) during standing. Methods: We used magnetic brain stimulation to evoke SICI and ICE in 11 young (range 21 25 years) and 12 healthy old adults (range 60 - 74 years) while they stood on a rigid platform or foam, with the eyes open or closed. Results: There was an overall age-related 43 % reduction in SICI (p = 0. 001). SICI lessened when standing on foam in old (31 %) but not in young (1 %) adults (condition x group interaction, p = 0. 049). This reduction was associated with increases in center of pressure velocity (r = 0. 648, p = 0. 043). Age (p = 0. 527) and sensory conditions (p = 0. 325) did not affect ICF. Conclusion: Motor cortical <b>circuits</b> controlling <b>leg</b> muscles are modulated differently in healthy old vs. young adults during upright posture.

40|$|Studies {{devoted to}} {{understanding}} locomotor control have mainly addressed {{the functioning of}} the neural <b>circuits</b> controlling <b>leg</b> movements and relatively little is known of the operation of networks that activate trunk muscles in coordination with limb movements. The aim of the present work was (1) to identify the exogenous neurotransmitter cocktail that most strongly activates postural thoracic circuitry; (2) to investigate how the biogenic amines serotonin (5 -HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) modulate the coordination between limb and axial motor networks. Experiments were carried out on in vitro isolated spinal cord preparations from newborn rats. We recorded from ventral roots to monitor hindlimb locomotor and axial postural network activity. Each combination of the three amines with excitatory amino acids (EAAs) elicited coordinated rhythmic motor activity at all segmental levels with specific characteristics. The variability in cycle period was similar with 5 -HT and DA while it was significantly higher with NA. DA elicited motor bursts of smaller amplitude in thoracic segments compared to 5 -HT and NA, while both DA and NA elicited motor bursts of higher amplitude than 5 -HT in the lumbar and sacral segments. The amines modulated the phase relationships of bursts in various segments with respect to the reference lumbar segment. At the thoracic level there was a phase lag between all recorded segments in the presence of 5 -HT, while DA and NA elicited synchronous bursting. At the sacral level, 5 -HT and DA induced an intersegmental phase shift while relationships became phase-locked with NA. Various combinations of EAAs with two or even all three amines elicited rhythmic motor output that was more variable than with one amine alone. Our results provide new data on the coordinating processes between spinal cord networks, demonstrating that each amine has a characteristic signature regarding its specific effect on intersegmental phase relationships...|$|R
2500|$|The central pattern {{generators}} {{responsible for}} locomotion in vertebrates reside as half-center modules in the cervical and lumbar {{region of the}} spinal cord. [...] Each CPG generates a basic motor output pattern {{that is responsible for}} the rhythmic contractions of flexor-extensor muscles that correspond to the forelimbs and hindlimbs. [...] There exist neural substrates that control bilateral limb coordination, particularly in the lumbar spinal circuits controlling the hindlimbs of quadruped mammals. Rhythmogenic potential is highest {{in the center of the}} spinal cord and decreases in a mediolateral direction. [...] The ability to generate fast and regular rhythmic activity decreases in the caudal direction, but the rhythm-generating networks extends from the lumbar region into the caudal thoracic region of the spinal cord.

40|$|In {{the next}} future, hybrid {{electric}} vehicles and electric vehicles {{will be more}} and more hybridized using different electrical storage devices. Traditionally in a vehicle having many energy storage systems, several independent power electronic converters were utilized. Due to their reduced part count, control simplicity and better efficiency, multi-input dc-dc converters seem to be a promising choice in hybridizing energy systems, therefore in literature many solutions have been proposed. In the paper, a new bidirectional soft-switching multi-input dc-dc converter for automotive applications is proposed.

40|$|The {{growth in}} the use of power {{electronics}} has caused a greater awareness of power quality. Voltage sags, swells, harmonics can cause equipment to fail, mis-operate or shut down, as well as create huge current imbalances which could blow fuses or trip breakers. These effects can be very expensive for the customer, ranging from minor quality variations to production downtime and equipment damage. The Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is fast, flexible and efficient solution to voltage sag/swell problem. In this work Z-Source Inverter (ZSI) based DVR will be proposed. The ZSI uses an LC impedance grid to couple power source to inverter circuit and prepares the possibility of voltage buck and boost by short <b>circuiting</b> the inverter <b>legs.</b> ZSI based DVR is controlled by PI controller. PI control scheme suffers from fixed gains, i. e., it cannot adapt itself to the varying parameter and conditions of system. To overcome this drawback this work proposes a fuzzy controller.

40|$|A fault {{tolerant}} adjustable speed drive (ASD) topology is introduced in this work. A conventional ASD topology {{is modified to}} address: a) drive vulnerability to semiconductor device faults b) input voltage sags c) motor vulnerability to effects of long leads and d) achieve active minimization of common mode (CM) voltage applied to the motor terminals. These objectives are attained by inclusion of an auxiliary IGBT inverter leg, three auxiliary diodes, and isolation - reconfiguration circuit. The design and operation of the proposed topology modifications are described for different modes; (A) Fault mode, (B) Auxiliary Sag Compensation (ASC) mode and (C) Active Common Mode Suppression mode. In case of fault and sag, the isolation and hardware reconfiguration are performed {{in a controlled manner}} using triacs/anti-parallel thyristors/solid state relays. In normal operation, the auxiliary leg is controlled to actively suppress common mode voltage. For inverter IGBT failures (short circuit and open <b>circuit),</b> the auxiliary <b>leg</b> is used as a redundant leg. During voltage sags, the auxiliary leg along with auxiliary diodes is operated as a boost converter. A current shaping control strategy is proposed for the ASC mode.

40|$|Peripheral sensory afferents in {{the hand}} {{activate}} both excitatory and inhibitory intracortical circuits to potentially facilitate and prune descending motor commands. In this study, we characterized how afferent inputs modulate the excitability of cortical <b>circuits</b> in the <b>leg</b> area of the primary motor cortex by examining how stimulation of the tibial nerve (TN) at the ankle alters motor evoked potentials (MEPs) activated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Resting MEPs in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle were facilitated in response to heteronymous activation of the TN 45 – 50 ms earlier, whereas MEPs were inhibited at interstimulus intervals of 32. 5 – 37. 5 ms. Similar time-dependent modulation occurred in the soleus (SOL) muscle with stimulation of the homonymous posterior tibial nerve (PTN) at the knee. To determine the site of this afferent-evoked facilitation and inhibition (spinal or cortical), we compared the effects of afferent stimulation to responses evoked at subcortical sites. At interstimulus intervals where MEP facilitation was observed (near 50 ms), spinal H-reflexes and responses evoked from corticospinal tract stimulation at the brainstem were predominantly depressed by the sensory stimulus suggesting that the observed MEP facilitation was cortical in origin. At interstimulus intervals where MEP depression was observed (near 35 ms), brainstem evoked responses were depressed to a similar degree and, {{in contrast to the}} hand, this suggests that spinal rather than cortical circuits mediate short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) of leg MEPs. When the MEP was facilitated by afferent inputs, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was reduced and intracortical facilitation (ICF) was increased, but long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) at a 100 ms interval was unchanged. In addition, sensory excitation increased the recruitment of early, middle and late descending corticospinal volleys as evidenced from increases in MEP facilitation at the corresponding I-wave periodicity. We propose that sensory activation from the leg has a diffuse and predominantly facilitatory effect on the leg primary motor cortex...|$|R
60|$|During {{my second}} visit to Baltimore I {{went over to}} Washington {{for a day or}} two, and found the capital still under the empire of King Mud. How the elite of a nation--for the {{inhabitants}} of Washington consider themselves to be the elite--can consent to live in such a state of thraldom, a foreigner cannot understand. Were I {{to say that it was}} intended to be typical of the condition of the government, I might be considered cynical; but undoubtedly the sloughs of despond which were deepest in their despondency were to be found in localities which gave an appearance of truth to such a surmise. The Secretary of State's office, in which Mr. Seward was still reigning, though with diminished glory, was divided from the headquarters of the commander-in-chief, which are immediately opposite to it, by an opaque river which admitted of no transit. These buildings stand at the corner of President Square, and it had been long understood that any close intercourse between them had not been considered desirable by the occupants of the military side of the causeway. But the Secretary of State's office was altogether unapproachable without a long <b>circuit</b> and begrimed <b>legs.</b> The Secretary of War's department was, if possible, in a worse condition. This is situated on the other side of the President's house, and the mud lay, if possible, thicker in this quarter than it did round Mr. Seward's chambers. The passage over Pennsylvania Avenue, immediately in front of the War Office, was a thing not to be attempted in those days. Mr. Cameron, it is true, had gone, and Mr. Stanton was installed; but the labor of cleansing the interior of that establishment had hitherto allowed no time for a glance at the exterior dirt, and Mr. Stanton should, perhaps, be held as excused. That the Navy Office should be buried in mud, and quite debarred from approach, was to be expected. The space immediately in front of Mr. Lincoln's own residence was still kept fairly clean, and I am happy to be able to give testimony to this effect. Long may it remain so. I could not, however, but think that an energetic and careful President would have seen to the removal of the dirt from his own immediate neighborhood. It was something that his own shoes should remain unpolluted; but the foul mud always clinging to the boots and leggings of those by whom he was daily surrounded must, I should think, have been offensive to him. The entrance to the Treasury was difficult to achieve by those who had not learned by practice the ways of the place; but I must confess that a tolerably clear passage was maintained on that side which led immediately down to the halls of Congress. Up at the Capitol the mud was again triumphant in the front of the building; this however was not of great importance, as the legislative chambers of the States are always reached by the back doors. I, on this occasion, attempted to leave the building by the grand entrance, but I soon became entangled among rivers of mud and mazes of shifting sand. With difficulty I recovered my steps, and finding my way back to the building was forced to content myself by an exit among the crowd of Senators and Representatives who were thronging down the back stairs.|$|R
