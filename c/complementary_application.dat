40|$|Abstract: Grid {{computing}} is {{a promising}} {{new technology that}} is growing in importance and applications that use the grid to federate scarce or expensive computing resources are increasingly being developed by academic and commercial organizations. However, {{one of the major}} inhibitions to its widespread adoption is the lack of an effective access mechanism that permits aggregation of the output from these grid applications as well as related content and <b>complementary</b> <b>applications</b> at the same time. While aggregating distrib-uted computing resources for grid applications, the aggregation of the application output for users is often neglected. Similarly, the aggregation of other related data and <b>complementary</b> <b>applications</b> to enable collaboration are also ignored. As a result, the output is often disjointed and relates mostly to technical, scientific or engineering specialists with computing background. This in turn limits other potential users and consumers of other non-scientific related grid applications. This paper discusses the current state of Grid portals in industry. It focuses on a proposed user-friendly portal based dashboard that will aggregate grid computing applications in a collaborative environment. It describes how a portal dashboard can provide a more user-friendly face to the number of grid applica-tions, the architecture and design of such a dashboard.
