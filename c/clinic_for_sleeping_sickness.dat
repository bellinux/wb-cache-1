40|$|Abstract: <b>Sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> {{continues}} to be a significant public health burden in southeastern Uganda. Continued spread of the disease into new areas of Uganda highlights our inability to understand and predict the distribution of infection. Multiple factors influence the distribution of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> including climate, land cover, cattle movements, prevention and control activities, and social conflict. We draw on a systems approach to conceptualize and characterize the multiple interacting forces and processes that influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> in Uganda. This synthesis reveals a complex system of interactions among human and biophysical systems, feedback, and scale dependence.

40|$|Background: Screening tests <b>for</b> gambiense <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> {{such as the}} CATT/T. b. gambiense and a {{recently}} developed lateral flow tests, are hitherto based on native variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs), namely LiTat 1. 3 and LiTat 1. 5, purified from highly virulent trypanosome strains grown in rodents. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have expressed SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) fusion proteins of the immunogenic N-terminal part of these antigens in the yeast Pichia pastoris.

40|$|Trypanosoma brucei {{and related}} parasites are causative agents of severe {{diseases}} that affect global health and economy. T. brucei is responsible <b>for</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> in humans (African trypanosomiasis) and a wasting disease in livestock. More than 100 years after T. brucei {{was identified as}} the etiological agent <b>for</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> available treatments remain inadequate, complicated by toxicity, lengthy and expensive administration regiments, and drug-resistance. There is clear need {{for the development of}} a new antitrypanosomal drugs. Due to the unique evolutionary position of these early diverging eukaryotes, trypanosomes posses a number of biological properties unparalleled in other organisms, including humans, which could prove valuable for new drug targets. One of the most distinctive properties of trypanosomes is their mitochondrial DNA, called kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). kDNA is composed of over five thousand circular DNA molecules (minicircles and maxicircles) catenated into a topologically complex network. Replication of kDNA requires an elaborate topoisomerase-mediated release and reattachment mechanism for minicircle theta structure replication and at least five DNA polymerases. Three of these (POLIB, POLIC, and POLID) are related to bacterial DNA polymerase I and are required for kDNA maintenance and growth. Each polymerase appears to make a specialized contribution to kDNA replication. ^ The research described in this dissertation is a significant contribution to the field of kDNA replication and the advancement of kDNA replication proteins as putative drug targets <b>for</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> Functional characterization of POLIB indicated that it participates in minicircle replication but is likely not the only polymerase contributing to this process. Gene silencing of POLIB partially blocked minicircle replication and led to the production of a previously unidentified free minicircle species, fraction U. Characterization of fraction U confirmed its identity as a population of dimeric minicircles with non-uniform linking numbers. Fraction U was not produced in response to silencing numerous other previously studied kDNA replication proteins but, as we demonstrated here, is also produced in response to POLID silencing. This common phenotype led us to hypothesize that POLIB and POLID both participate in minicircle replication. Simultaneously silencing both polymerases completely blocked minicircle replication, supporting a model of minicircle replication requiring both POLIB and POLID. Finally, we demonstrate that disease-causing trypanosomes require kDNA and the kDNA replication proteins POLIB, POLIC, and POLID. These data provide novel insights into the fascinating mechanism of kDNA replication and support the pursuit of kDNA replication proteins as novel drug targets for combating African trypanosomiasis. ...|$|R

Loos islands constitute a small archipelago 5  km apart from the capital, Conakry. Medical, animal, and entomological surveys were implemented in these islands in Oct-Nov 2006. No pathogenic trypanosomes were found in these surveys.

40|$|<b>Sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> is {{a lethal}} African disease caused by parasites of the Trypanosoma brucei subspecies, which is {{transmitted}} by tsetse flies. Occasionally, patients are reported outside Africa. Diagnosis of such imported cases can be problematic when the infection {{is due to}} Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the chronic form of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> found in west and central Africa. The low number of trypanosomes in the blood and the non-specific, variable symptoms make the diagnosis difficult, particularly when the index of suspicion is low. When the trypanosomes have penetrated into the central nervous system, neuropathological signs become apparent but even at this stage, misdiagnosis is frequent.

40|$|Over {{the last}} five years, a new avenue seems to have opened up to {{researchers}} working on the fight against trypanosomiasis: trypanotolerant cattle. Trypanosomiasis is the scientific name <b>for</b> <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> which is transmitted by the tsetse fly. It was generally thought that only certain breeds of cattle, goats and sheep in West Africa were trypanotolerant, meaning {{that they were able}} to tolerate the effects of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> However, it has now been discovered that some oxen in East Africa have the same characteristics. In order to evaluate the productivity of trypanotolerant animals under different conditions, the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) located in Ethiopia has launched a joint programme with the International Laboratory for Veterinary Research (ILVR) whose head office is in Kenya. A research and experimentation network has thus been established and is currently operating in eleven African countries (Gabon, Ivory Coast, Zaire, Nigeria, Togo, Senegal, Gambia, Benin, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia). Trypanotolerant animals are generally of a smaller size and occasionally even dwarf. One must therefore determine if this kind of livestock is more productive than non-tolerant cattle treated with drugs to prevent the disease. What makes an animal trypanotolerant? It seems to be linked to an internal capacity to limit the number of parasites in the blood as well as a reduced sensitivity not only to the disease but also to its side-effects. Immunological and physiological factors thus increase resistance to this problem. It seems that the hide of an animal plays an important role: skin lesions caused by tsetse bites are smaller and less numerous with trypanotolerant animals. A new international research centre has been created in Zambia to try to discover the secret of trypanotolerance in order to develop genetic improvement programmes.
