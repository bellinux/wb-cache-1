30|$|Worldwide {{demand for}} {{drinking}} water is increasing rapidly. The world’s population tripled {{in the twentieth}} century and is expected to increase by another 40 – 50 % by 2050. Hence, improving the performance of water purification technology is necessary to compensate for our fresh water demands (Kang and Cao 2012). Reverse osmosis (RO) has become a critical technology in purification of non-traditional water sources such as brackish, sea, and wastewater and it is the most efficient technique for seawater desalination purposes (Matin et al. 2011). Around 20 % of the world’s population lacks safe drinking water. It is expected that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will find difficulties in getting clean water or will live in areas where water is scarce. Consequently, ensuring high performance of RO plants is important and this is possible by adjusting parameters like feed pressure, permeability, system temperature, flow rates, feed salinity, and controlling biofouling issues. Selecting the accurate operating conditions will allow us to determine the necessary membrane area and therefore reaching the optimum values for permeate water flux and salt rejection. For instance, applying a high pressure (∆P) that is larger than the osmotic pressure (∆π) across the membrane, results in an increase in water flux and salt rejection (Qureshi et al. 2013). The most commercially available RO membrane is the asymmetric cellulose type (<b>cellulose</b> acetate, <b>triacetate,</b> <b>cellulose</b> diacetate or their blend) and thin-film composite (TFC) type. TFC aromatic polyamide membrane exhibits superior water flux and salt rejection (Kang and Cao 2012).|$|R

50|$|The {{motion picture}} {{industry}} {{continued to use}} cellulose nitrate supports until the introduction of <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> in 1948, which met the rigorous safety and performance standards set by the cinematographic industry.

5000|$|All plastic {{is subject}} to {{deterioration}} through physical or chemical means, and thus, motion picture film {{is subject to}} the same deterioration. Films deteriorate over time, which can damage individual frames or even lead to the entire film being destroyed. Cellulose nitrate, <b>cellulose</b> diacetate and <b>triacetate</b> are known to be unstable mediums: improperly preserved film can deteriorate in a period of time much faster than many photographs or other visual presentations. Cellulose nitrate, because of its unstable chemistry, eventually breaks down, releasing nitric acid, further catalyzing the decomposition. In the final stages of celluloid decomposition, the film turns into a rust-like powder. Likewise, tri-acetate stock is also vulnerable to deterioration. Because of the small gauge of the film, owners of home-made films often find that their film can become shrunken and brittle {{to the point where the}} film is unwatchable in the space of a few years. In general, decaying acetate film breaks down into acetic acid, and similar to celluloid decomposition, leads to an auto-catylictic breakdown of the base that cannot be reversed. The result of the acetic acid released is a strong odor of vinegar, which is why the decay process in the archival community is known as [...] "vinegar syndrome". Modern polyester-based stocks are far more stable by comparison and are rated to last hundreds of years if stored properly.|$|R
50|$|The first {{instance}} of <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> degradation {{was reported to}} the Eastman Kodak Company within a decade of its introduction in 1948. The first report came from the Government of India, whose film was stored in hot, humid conditions. It was followed by further reports of degradation from collections stored in similar conditions. These observations resulted in continuing studies in the Kodak laboratories during the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrate {{dominated}} {{the market for}} professional-use 35 mm motion picture film from the industry's origins to the early 1950s. While cellulose acetate-based so-called [...] "safety film", notably cellulose diacetate and cellulose acetate propionate, was produced in the gauge for small-scale use in niche applications (e.g., printing advertisements and other short films {{to enable them to}} be sent through the mails without the need for fire safety precautions), the early generations of safety film base had two major disadvantages relative to nitrate: it was much more expensive to manufacture, and considerably less durable in repeated projection. The cost of the safety precautions {{associated with the use of}} nitrate was significantly lower than the cost of using any of the safety bases available before 1948. These drawbacks were eventually overcome with the launch of <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> base film by Eastman Kodak in 1948. [...] <b>Cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> superseded nitrate as the film industry's mainstay base very quickly. While Kodak had discontinued some nitrate film stocks earlier, they stopped producing various nitrate roll films in 1950 and ceased production of nitrate 35mm motion picture film in 1951.|$|E
5000|$|Cellulose acetate and <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> are mistakenly {{referred}} to as the same fiber; although they are similar, their chemical compositions and formulae differ. Triacetate is known as a generic description or primary acetate containing no hydroxyl group. Acetate fiber is known as modified or secondary acetate having two or more hydroxyl groups. Triacetate fibers, although no longer produced in the United States, contain a higher ratio of acetate-to-cellulose than do acetate fibers.1 ...|$|E
5000|$|The crucial {{advantage}} <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> {{had over}} nitrate {{was that it}} was no more of a fire risk than paper (the stock is often erroneously referred to as [...] "non-flam": this is not true—it is combustible, but not in as volatile or as dangerous a way as nitrate), while it almost matched the cost and durability of nitrate. It remained in almost exclusive use in all film gauges until the 1980s, when polyester/PET film began to supersede it for intermediate and release printing.|$|E
50|$|A {{film base}} is a {{transparent}} substrate which {{acts as a}} support medium for the photosensitive emulsion that lies atop it. Despite the numerous layers and coatings associated with the emulsion layer, the base generally accounts {{for the vast majority}} of the thickness of any given film stock. Historically there have been three major types of film base in use: nitrocellulose (cellulose nitrate), cellulose acetate (<b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate,</b> cellulose diacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose acetate butyrate), and polyester (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Kodak trade-name: ESTAR)).|$|E
5000|$|... 1889: Film NegativesCellulose {{nitrate film}} was {{developed}} by Eastman Kodak in 1889 and refined in 1903. It is made of silver gelatin on a cellulose nitrate base. The negatives are flammable and therefore can be dangerous. Nitrate sheet film was used widely though the 1930s, while nitrate roll film was used through the 1950s. The nitrate base was replaced with cellulose acetate in 1923. By 1937, Cellulose diacetate {{was used as the}} base, and beginning in 1947 <b>Cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> was used.

50|$|The <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> {{membrane}} {{is prone}} to rotting unless protected by chlorinated water, while the thin film composite membrane {{is prone to}} breaking down {{under the influence of}} chlorine. A thin film composite (TFC) membrane is made of synthetic material, and requires chlorine to be removed before the water enters the membrane. To protect the TFC membrane elements from chlorine damage, carbon filters are used as pre-treatment in all residential reverse osmosis systems. TFC membranes have a higher rejection rate of 95-98% and a longer life than CTA membranes.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic {{enclosures}} include uncoated polyester film, uncoated <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate,</b> polyethylene, and polypropylene. Plastic enclosures are transparent.

However, plastic enclosures can trap moisture and cause ferrotyping (sticking, with a resultant glossy area). [...] Plastic is not suitable for prints with surface damage, glass or metal-based photographs, nor for film-based negatives and transparencies from the 1950s, unless the latter are in cold storage.

5000|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>triacetate,</b> {{also known}} simply as triacetate, CTA and TAC, is a {{chemical}} compound manufactured from cellulose {{and a source of}} acetate esters, typically acetic anhydride. Triacetate is typically used for the creation of fibres and film base.It is similar chemically to cellulose acetate, with the distinguishing characteristics being that in triacetate, according to the Federal Trade Commission definition, at least [...] "92 percent of the hydroxyl groups are acetylated." [...] During the manufacture of triacetate the cellulose is completely acetylated whereas in regular cellulose acetate or cellulose diacetate, it is only partially acetylated. Triacetate is significantly more heat resistant than cellulose acetate.|$|E

Kodak discontinued the manufacture of nitrate base in 1951, and the industry transitioned entirely to safety film in 1951 in the United States and by 1955 internationally.

In some cases, a dyeing temperature of 130 °C is required, and a pressurised dyebath is used. The very fine particle size gives a large surface area that aids dissolution to allow uptake by the fiber. The dyeing rate can be significantly influenced by the choice of dispersing agent used during the grinding.|$|E
50|$|Dissolving pulp, {{also called}} {{dissolving}} cellulose, is bleached wood pulp or cotton linters {{that has a}} high cellulose content (> 90%). It has special properties including {{a high level of}} brightness and uniform molecular-weight distribution. This pulp is manufactured for uses that require a high chemical purity, and particularly low hemicellulose content, since the chemically similar hemicellulose can interfere with subsequent processes. Dissolving pulp is so named because it is not made into paper, but dissolved either in a solvent or by derivatization into a homogeneous solution, which makes it completely chemically accessible and removes any remaining fibrous structure. Once dissolved, it can be spun into textile fibers (viscose or Lyocell), or chemically reacted to produce derivatized celluloses, such <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate,</b> a plastic-like material formed into fibers or films, or cellulose ethers such as methyl cellulose, used as a thickener.|$|E
50|$|Cellulose diacetate {{film was}} first {{created by the}} German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker, who {{patented}} it under the name Cellit, from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. A cellulose diacetate film more readily dissolved in acetone {{was developed by the}} American chemist George Miles in 1904. Mile's process (partially hydrolysing the polymer) was employed commercially for photographic film in 1909 by Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres. Starting with cellulose diacetate, this innovation continued with cellulose acetate propionate and cellulose acetate butyrate in the 1930s, and finally in the late 1940s, <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> was introduced, alongside polyester bases. These less flammable substitutes for nitrate film were called safety film.|$|E
5000|$|Birt Acres was {{the first}} to attempt an amateur format, {{creating}} Birtac in 1898 by slitting the film into 17.5 mm widths. By the early 1920s, several formats had successfully split the amateur home movies market away from 35 mm: 28 mm (1.1 in) (1912), 9.5 mm (0.37 in) (1922), 16 mm (0.63 in) (1923), and Pathe Rural, a 17.5 mm format designed for safety film (1926). Eastman Kodak's 16 mm format won the amateur market and is still widely in use today, mainly in the Super 16 variation, which remains popular with professional filmmakers. The 16 mm size was specifically chosen to prevent third-party slitting, as it was easy to create 17.5 mm stock from slitting 35 mm stock in two. It also {{was the first}} major format to be released with only fireproof cellulose diacetate (and later <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate)</b> [...] "safety film" [...] base. This amateur market would be further diversified by the introduction of 8 mm film (0.31 in) in 1932, intended for amateur filmmaking and [...] "home movies". By law, 16 mm and 8 mm gauge stock (and 35 mm films intended for non-theatrical use) had to be manufactured on safety stock. The effect of these gauges was to essentially make the 35 mm gauge almost the exclusive province of professional filmmakers, a divide which mostly remains to this day.|$|E
50|$|Many {{governments have}} sanctioned stiff {{penalties}} for littering of cigarette filters; for example Washington state imposes a penalty of $1,025 for littering cigarette filters. Another option is developing better biodegradable filters, {{much of this}} work lies heavily on the research in the secondary mechanism for photodegradation as stated above. The next option is using cigarette packs with a compartment to discard cigarette butts in, implementing monetary deposits on filters, increasing the availability of butt receptacles, and expanding public education. It may even be possible to ban the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether {{on the basis of}} their adverse environmental impact. Recent research has been put into finding ways to utilizes the filter waste, to develop a desired product. One research group in South Korea have developed a simple one-step process that converts the cellulose acetate in discarded cigarette filters into a high-performing material that could be integrated into computers, handheld devices, electrical vehicle and wind turbines to store energy. These materials have demonstrated superior performance as compared to commercially available carbon, graphene and carbon nano tubes. The product is showing high promise as a green alternative for the waste problem. Another group of researchers has proposed adding tablets of food grade acid inside the filters. Once wet enough the tablets will release acid that accelerates degradation to around two weeks (instead of using <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> and besides of cigarette smoke being quite acidic).|$|E
5000|$|The {{technology}} of cinema projection, {{and with it}} the role of the projectionist, changed fundamentally over an extended period between the early 1950s and late 1960s. Nitrate film was superseded by <b>cellulose</b> <b>triacetate</b> for release printing in the US and Europe over about a five-year period following the stock's commercial launch in October 1948 (though older nitrate prints remained in circulation {{for quite a long time}} afterwards and still showing in licensed cinemas as late as the 1990s for special screenings). With nitrate went the restrictions on reel lengths previously necessitated by the fire risk, with the result that systems were developed to enable the projection of a complete feature film using a single projector and unattended. Two essential technologies were needed to enable this: the long-play device, a.k.a. platter, i.e. a turntable 4-6 feet in diameter or (in the case of Sword Systems and Sabre Systems by EPRAD) an extremely large film reel 3-5 feet in diameter either of which enabled the reels of a feature presentation to be joined together into a single roll, in some cases up to 30,000 feet (approx. six hours at 24fps) in length; and the xenon arc lamp, which can burn continuously and unattended for as long as is needed (most carbon arc lamphouses will run for a maximum of 40-50 minutes before the carbon rod needs replacing, and require regular adjustment by the projectionist during that time). Automation systems were also introduced, which could be programmed in advance of each screening to perform functions such as operating auditorium lighting, adjusting volume levels and changing audio formats. Some would argue that these technologies reduced the skill level or downgraded the showmanship element of the projectionist's job (for example, by eliminating the need for changeovers and nitrate handling precautions). Others would argue that more advanced skills were needed in other areas. With the introduction of widescreen in the early 1950s, projectionists had to cope with the additional lenses, aperture plates and masking systems needed for different aspect ratios for the first time. [...] Multiple channel audio systems using magnetic sound and 70mm film prints were also introduced in the 1950s, and these required specialist projection skills to handle. Like nitrate film prints, xenon arc bulbs require special safety precautions: if handled incorrectly they can explode, causing serious injury to the projectionist. Staffing levels in projection booths decreased rapidly during this period. In the classical [...] "movie palace", the labour-intensive nature of changeovers, carbon arc lamps and nitrate handling required large workforces of projectionists, with up to six or seven working in a single booth and a rigid management hierarchy within the profession being common. In contrast, the multiplexes of the 1980s and '90s were designed in such a way that a single projectionist can operate simultaneous screenings in 10-20 auditoria, and it is unusual for these venues to have a total projectionist workforce of more than three or four.|$|E

By acetylating cellulose, using various acetylation mixtures including zinc chloride as catalyst and ether as a non-solvent, the acetylation and degradetion mechanism for cellulose was postulated.
