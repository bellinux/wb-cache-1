5|$|The North West Development Agency used a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> to {{take control}} of the main site in 2003. This allowed the Heritage Lottery Fund to give a £7.164M grant towards the {{restoration}} of the complex. Together with an additional grant from the North West Development Agency, a £10M regeneration project took place between 2004 and 2006. The project included repair and strengthening of the structure, the restoration of the canal basin, a new roof and windows, and the reinstatement of two missing floors from the Murray Street block.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was {{the headquarters of}} the Manchester Fire Brigade until the brigade was replaced by the Greater Manchester Fire Service in 1974. The fire station closed in 1986, since when it has been largely unused despite several redevelopment proposals. It was placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010 Manchester City Council served a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> on the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels. Britannia announced in 2015 their intention to sell the building opening up the possibility of redevelopment after nearly 30 years of dereliction.|$|E
5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E

2500|$|The IOC {{noted that}} future {{negotiations}} {{were necessary to}} ensure {{the use of the}} Old Trafford and Villa Park football stadiums. The need for <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> was also highlighted as a possible problem for the Olympic Park, but IOC did not expect this to cause any [...] "undue delay to construction schedules".|$|R
50|$|Hatfield retains New Town characteristics, {{including}} much modernist {{architecture of}} the 1950s and the trees and open spaces that were outlined in the original design. The redevelopment of the town centre is being planned, involving the construction of 275 flats and retail units. Planning permission has been granted and <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> have been approved.|$|R
5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, {{plans for}} the {{acquisition}} of Stephenson Tower through a <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> were discussed by the Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|The full {{decision}} {{rejecting the}} Planning Application and the <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> was issued on the 31 July 2008 and the 6 August 2008.|$|E
50|$|A {{plan of the}} {{new housing}} estate was {{produced}} {{at the end of}} 1945 and <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> were issued in 1946. Building of the estate started in the late 1940s and was added to in stages producing some variety in the housing. As usual, communal facilities lagged behind the building of the housing. Nine tower blocks were constructed in the ward.|$|R
50|$|A {{concern was}} the fact that the {{legislation}} would give the Roșia Montană Gold Corporation the right to give <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> to the residents of Roșia Montană who refused to sell their houses and lands. The draft law also sets time limits for the state authorities to grant all permits, regardless of potential infringements of national legislation or of court rulings.|$|R
50|$|These local {{authorities}} were given wide-ranging powers {{in addition to}} approval of planning proposals; they could carry out redevelopment of land themselves, or use <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> to buy land and lease it to private developers. They were also given powers to control outdoor advertising, and to preserve woodland or buildings of architectural or historic interest - the latter {{the beginning of the}} modern listed building system.|$|R
25|$|In January 2011, the Summer Row {{project was}} officially {{declared}} dead {{as the government}} permission for the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> expiry date rolled round without the council having found the necessary financial backing for the project.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the {{development}} plans had been revised {{several times during}} a lengthy delay because of a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order.</b> A <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> was eventually issued in July 2014 giving approval for the new stadium scheme to proceed but was subject to an unsuccessful legal challenge by a business located within the proposed site in February 2015. On 8 July 2015, Tottenham announced brand new revised plans, including a larger 61,000 capacity, making it the biggest club stadium in London. The revised stadium design also includes a 17,000 seat single tier stand, the biggest {{of its kind in}} the UK. The new plan also comprises a combination of 579 new homes (increased from the 285 in previous plan), a 180-room hotel, an extreme sports building, a community health centre, enhanced public spaces and 'The Tottenham Experience' - an interactive museum and club shop complex incorporating the listed Warmington House. The anticipated stadium opening date is currently scheduled for the start of the 2018/19 season.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the grounds}} of Kings Weston House, in Bristol, were briefly considered— which then, and until 1969, {{accommodated}} the College's School of Architecture and Building Engineering— the City of Bristol was unable to offer the expanding college an appropriately sized single site. Following discussions between the College Principal and the Director of Education in Bath, an agreement was reached to provide the college with {{a new home in}} Claverton Down, Bath, on a greenfield site, purchased through a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> from the Candy family of Norwood Farm, overlooking the city.|$|E
50|$|The Act {{introduced}} a new definition of a house in multiple occupation (HMO) and provided for registers and orders applying a management code. Powers were given to local authorities to close an HMO (or part of it) {{if it was not}} possible to provide a fire escape. It introduced the possibility of control orders to be followed by <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders.</b> Directions were made to avoid or reduce overcrowding.|$|R
50|$|The Olympic Stadium {{itself was}} costed at £100 million, {{and would have}} seated 80,000 spectators. AMEC plc would have been tasked with organising the {{construction}} of the stadium had it been built from designs by architects including Arup Group Limited and Norman Foster. Some forty businesses were issued with <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> in order to free up the space to build the stadium, in the area around Eastlands towards the east of Manchester.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} acquire the land in Balaídos, around two {{thousand}} small plots had to be bought using <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders.</b> However, {{at that time the}} Consortium only had a state grant of one and a half million pesetas, insufficient {{to cover the cost of}} the purchases. In the end, a loan of thirteen million pesetas from Caja de Ahorros de Vigo (the local savings bank) allowed the Free Trade Zone to start its operations.|$|R
25|$|In 1975 {{the local}} {{authority}} bought the properties in Commercial Road under a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order,</b> in return providing a site with temporary buildings on Whitechapel Road {{next to the}} Fieldgate Street Great Synagogue. The local community set about raising funds to erect a purpose-built mosque on the site. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia donated £1.1 million of the £2 million fund, and the governments of Kuwait and Britain also donated to the fund. Seven years later, {{the building of the}} new mosque commenced, with foundations laid in 1982 and construction completed in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The London Borough of Croydon {{actively}} supported {{an alternative}} proposal, developed {{in partnership with}} property company Arrowcroft, which would involve {{the construction of a}} 12,500-seat indoor arena, named the Croydon Arena, as well as 59,234 m² of offices and 874 homes—including affordable housing. Unlike the Stanhope scheme, this proposal received the full backing from Croydon Council, then went to a public inquiry after being 'called in' by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. It also required compulsory purchase of the site. The Council made a <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> to assemble the land required and the objections to which were considered at the same public inquiry. The public inquiry took place between September and November 2007. The Secretary of State rejected the CPO and Planning Permission in July 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Heritage Railway Association {{supported}} {{a bid to}} secure the railway, overseen by Julian Birley of the North Norfolk Railway. Swale Borough Council were also reported as backing the scheme. At a full meeting of Swale Borough Council on 17 September, General Manager Tony James's speech resulted in the council unanimously voting to support the railway in its fight to survive. Mr James accredited the Heritage Railway Association as influencing {{the decision of the}} council by their actions in giving the award. On 21 September, the railway was visited by Baron Faulkner, chairman of the Railway Heritage Committee, a statutory body which oversees the preservation of railway artefacts in the United Kingdom. Lord Faulkner has asked that the railway write to the Secretary of State for Transport in a bid for powers to gain a <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> which will enable the railway to buy the trackbed.|$|E
50|$|When the Eurostar was {{announced}} in the 1980s a wave of speculative property acquisition started, based on developers assumptions that Lower Marsh would be swallowed up by <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> {{to make way for}} hotels and car parks. As the Eurostar development was limited to the north of Waterloo station this left many freeholds in the hands of developers who had little interest in enhancing the properties that they had purchased, leading to stagnation of renovation projects in the street.|$|R
50|$|The {{mayor is}} {{responsible}} {{for the creation of a}} county wide spatial development strategy with adoption subject to unanimous approval of the Members of the GMCA. The mayor is able to make <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> and establish a Mayoral Development Corporation for an area subject to the agreement of the members whose district(s) the order/corporation covers. The mayor has not been granted the ability to call in local planning application decisions judged to be of strategic importance unlike some other combined authority mayors.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} leading to World War II, {{maintenance}} of the area declined. World War II also saw Hillfields being heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. The Town and Country Planning Act 1944 allowed local authorities to declare Areas of Comprehensive Development, and Hillfields was declared one of three in Coventry in 1951. It was declared that 53% of the houses were unfit to live in {{within the next five}} years, and this gave the local authorities the right to use <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Orders</b> on the properties.|$|R
25|$|In 1936 {{the long}} {{wait for a}} victory in a final ended at last, with the club lifting the West Of Scotland Cup after a replay against Vale of Clyde. The club was also forced to move home in 1936 when the Glasgow Corporation {{exercised}} a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> on Barrowfield Park in order to construct a new housing scheme (also called Barrowfield) on the land. Waverley identified a new site at Westthorn on the boundary of Parkhead, Dalmarnock and Braidfauld adjacent to Belvidere Hospital. This ground was named New Barrowfield, meaning there were three different football venues known by that name, albeit the others no longer existed. The move brought the club into even closer proximity with Strathclyde (whose Springfield Park ground {{was on the other}} side of the hospital) and Parkhead (whose Helenslea Park was just yards away across London Road). Parkhead Stadium railway station was nearby.|$|E
500|$|The villas erected by the Colbatch {{family were}} {{demolished}} after the Second World War. [...] The family, which still owned {{the buildings and}} the land, drew up plans to replace the four villas and the gatekeepers' cottages with flats. [...] These were intended for private ownership; but council housing was so scarce in Brighton at the time (1945) that Brighton Borough Council bought the land using a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> and redeveloped it with council flats based on the family's designs. The new flats, built in the early 1950s, were large and well-built, and the old gardens were retained. [...] At first, no young children were allowed to live there, and only higher earning council tenants could apply.|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, Argent, {{developers}} proposed leasing {{the building}} from Britannia Hotels to {{transform it into}} a music and arts venue. Manchester City Council backed the plans and refused to rule out a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> (CPO) if the owner did not act to redevelop the building. Britannia Hotels branded Argent's plans [...] "unworkable" [...] and proposed turning the building into a company headquarters, 200-bed hotel, and fire station museum. A planning application was promised by March 2006, but by May none had been made. Work {{was carried out by}} February 2007 to make the building watertight and in autumn 2007 a proposal was made by Britannia to convert the building into a hotel.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s new {{buildings}} for the medicine and engineering departments were provided on St Michael’s Hill. The geography department were able {{take over the}} old. A new chemistry building was also planned {{on the slopes of}} St Michael’s Hill but the project ran into difficulty when Bristol City Council’s <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> displaced some local residents. New buildings to be built in Berkeley Square caused similar complaints. These would become home of the Department of Education as it was clear that Royal Fort house would prove too small.|$|R
50|$|A {{decision}} {{was announced in}} July 2007, with the planning inspector noting that the requirements of both local and national planning needs would not be served by the granting of planning permission for the bridge. He recommended {{that there should be}} no bridge, side street changes, or <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders.</b> However Hazel Blears, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, requested that the inquiry be re-opened to examine the evidence further as to whether the bridge would lead to regeneration and to investigate the potential impact on pollution.|$|R
50|$|He entered {{government}} service in 1929, being appointed an Engineering Inspector for the Ministry of Health. McNaughton worked under the Chief Engineering Inspector, Sir Roger Gaskell Hetherington, and {{was responsible for}} conducting public enquiries for into water supplies, sewerage schemes, buildings, sea defences, river improvements {{and the use of}} <b>Compulsory</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Orders.</b> He was also involved in grant schemes to deprived areas, rural water supplies and air raid protection of essential engineering services. In 1938 he became a full member of the ICE and was {{also a member of the}} Institution of Mechanical Engineers.|$|R
500|$|In September 2016 Lewisham Council {{approved}} a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> (CPO) of land surrounding The Den rented by Millwall, {{as part of}} a major redevelopment of the [...] "New Bermondsey" [...] area. The plans were controversial because the developer, Renewal, is controlled by offshore companies with unclear ownership, and is seen by the club and local community to be profiteering by demolishing existing homes and businesses as well as Millwall's car-park and the Millwall Community Trust facility to build up to 2,400 new private homes, with no social housing. The club contemplated the possibility of having to relocate to Kent. Millwall had submitted their own plans for regeneration centred around the club itself, but the council voted in favour of Renewal's plans.|$|E
500|$|However, in 2012, Sleaford Town Council {{refused to}} grant {{permission}} for a link road connecting Boston Road {{to the site}} because of [...] "concerns about closing a level crossing {{and the loss of}} trees" [...] at the Boston Road Recreation Ground. After a lengthy stalemate, the District Council served a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> on the site in 2014, but Tesco announced early the following year that it would no longer be investing in the maltings complex following a series of financial setbacks to the company. Although Gladedale (by then known as Avant Homes) announced its commitment to converting parts of the site to residential use, the leader of North Kesteven District Council, Marion Brighton, stated that the plans were [...] "effectively on hold" [...] following the withdrawal of Tesco.|$|E
500|$|Following the 2006 public consultation, {{the scheme}} for a single-carriageway link to Thornton was given high {{priority}} and accepted in July 2006 by the then-Secretary of State for Transport, Douglas Alexander. Funding {{was approved by}} the Department for Transport in February 2011 when Sefton Council accepted the terms and conditions that has been proposed. After two objections were raised regarding the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> needed to acquire the land on which the road was to be built, a public inquiry was held in October 2012. [...] Subsequent to this, the government inspector approved the plans. Following Sefton Council giving their final approval in September 2013, construction was proposed to begin by early November 2013 for a period of around 12 months, with the financial benefits estimated to be in the region of £140200 million over the 60 years post-construction.|$|E
50|$|The Conservatives {{campaigned on}} their record of {{controlling}} the council for the previous 10 years, pointing to keeping council tax increases low and plans to regenerate local towns. However Labour pledged to appoint people as area managers who would be a contact point for people to bring any problems and planned to use <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> to bring empty properties into use. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats targeted seats in Belper and Duffield campaigning on regeneration, recycling and litter, while the British National Party hoped to increase on the 2 seats they held in Heanor.|$|R
25|$|Comprehensive Development Areas (CDAs), a {{designation}} {{under the}} Town and Country Planning Act of 1947, allowed local authorities to acquire {{property in the}} designated areas using powers of <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> in <b>order</b> to re-plan and develop urban areas suffering from urban blight or war damage.|$|R
25|$|The Roșia Montană Project, {{a mining}} project aimed {{to bring to}} the surface 350 tonnes of gold and 1,500 tonnes of silver, met a {{significant}} resistance from environmental groups in Romania and neighbouring countries. Among the dissatisfactions of environmentalists are the pollution by cyanidation and the extremely low percentage of which Romania will benefit from this exploitation. A concern {{was the fact that the}} legislation would give the Roșia Montană Gold Corporation the right to give <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> to the residents of Roșia Montană who refused to sell their houses and lands. The draft law also sets time limits for the state authorities to grant all permits, regardless of potential infringements of national legislation or of court rulings.|$|R
