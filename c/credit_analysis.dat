40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} least squares {{support vector machine}} classifier, called the C-variable least squares support vector machine (C-VLSSVM) classifier, is proposed for <b>credit</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> The main idea of the proposed classifier {{is based on the}} prior knowledge that different classes may have different importance for modeling and more weight should be given to classes having more importance. The C-VLSSVM classifier can be obtained by a simple modification of the regularization parameter, based on the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) classifier, whereby more weight is given to errors in classification of important classes, than to errors in classification of unimportant classes, while keeping the regularized terms in their original form. For illustration purpose, two real-world credit data sets are used to verify the effectiveness of the C-VLSSVM classifier. Experimental results obtained reveal that the proposed C-VLSSVM classifier can produce promising classification results in <b>credit</b> risk <b>analysis,</b> relative to other classifiers listed in this study.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Credit</b> risk <b>analysis</b> is an {{important}} topic in the financial risk management. Due to recent financial crises and regulatory concern of Basel II, <b>credit</b> risk <b>analysis</b> has been the major focus of financial and banking industry. An accurate estimation of credit risk could {{be transformed into a}} more efficient use of economic capital. In this study, we try to use a triple-phase neural network ensemble technique to design a credit risk evaluation system to discriminate good creditors from bad ones. In this model, many diverse neural network models are first created. Then an uncorrelation maximization algorithm is used to select the appropriate ensemble members. Finally, a reliability-based method is used for neural network ensemble. For further illustration, a publicly credit dataset is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed neural ensemble model. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{conventional}} bank {{risk management}} practices {{is well documented}} in the literature there is limited research devoted at comparing the risk management practices of Islamic and conventional banks and how the recent financial crisis affected the approach taken in each banking model to manage the risks. In this paper we use self-administered questionnaire to collect data from 150 bank senior managers and risk specialists from Pakistani conventional and Islamic banks to identify the main contributing factors to their risk management practices after the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis. The study results reveal that risk identification, risk assessment and <b>analysis,</b> <b>credit</b> risk <b>analysis</b> and risk governance are the most efficient and influential variables in explaining the risk management practices of Islamic banks. Whilst understanding risk management, <b>credit</b> risk <b>analysis,</b> and risk governance are the most significant and contributing variables in the risk management practices of conventional banks. Differences are also observed between Islamic and conventional banks in their liquidity risk analysis and risk governance.

40|$|The main aims of {{this paper}} are, firstly, to {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} Yemen’s banks, in particular its Islamic banks, are applying Risk Management Practices (RMPs) and related techniques to deal with various types of risk, and secondly, to compare and distinguish between the RMPs used in Islamic, national and foreign banks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify the current RMPs in Yemen. The main research instrument was a questionnaire, divided into two sections. The first section covered the following five aspects: understanding risk and risk management, risk identification and analysis, risk monitoring, RMPs, and <b>credit</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> The second section consisted of four aspects: methods of risk identification, risk management, credit risk management, and types of risk. Multinomial regressions and other statistical tools were applied to determine whether there are differences between Islamic banks and other banks in Yemen. Our results revealed that there are significant differences between Islamic and national banks in terms of their understanding of risk and risk management, risk identification and <b>analysis</b> and <b>credit</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> However, there are no major differences found between national and Islamic banks in terms of risk management and RMPs.
