5|$|During the 2010 {{election}} campaign, Gillard {{also said}} that no <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> would be introduced under a government she led. In the first hung parliament result in 70 years, the Gillard Government, {{with the support of}} the Australian Greens and some cross bench independents, negotiated the implementation of a <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> (the preferred policy of the Australian Greens), by which a fixed-price <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plans. The government proposed the Clean Energy Bill in February 2011, which the opposition claimed to be a broken election promise.|$|E

5|$|The {{impacts of}} the various options were {{estimated}} as the differences between a <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> and a reference ‘business as usual’ scenario assuming New Zealand had not signed the Kyoto Protocol. The variables changed in the model runs were the NZ carbon price ($0, $10, $25 or $100), the world carbon price, the duration (short term to 2012, long term to 2025), the level of free allocation and whether the Government assumed all Kyoto liabilities. The results of each model run was reported as the percent difference from the 'no-Kyoto' ‘business as usual’ scenario in 2012 or 2025.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> offer a {{potentially}} cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. From an economic perspective, <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> are {{a type of}} Pigovian tax. They help {{to address the problem}} of emitters of greenhouse gases not facing the full social cost of their actions. <b>Carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> can be a regressive tax, in that they may directly or indirectly affect low-income groups disproportionately. The regressive impact of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> could be addressed by using tax revenues to favour low-income groups.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} simple formulas for {{adjusting the}} costs of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> and tradable <b>carbon</b> permits to account for interactions with preexisting tax distortions {{in the labor market}}. Both policies reduce labor supply as they increase product prices and reduce real household wages; the resulting efficiency losses in the labor market can be substantial relative to partial equilibrium abatement costs. However, much of this added cost can be offset—and perhaps more than offset when additional distortions from the tax system are considered—if revenues from <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> or auctioned permits are used to reduce distortionary taxes. Consequently, there can be a strong case on efficiency grounds for using <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> or auctioned permits over grandfathered <b>carbon</b> permits. <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes,</b> <b>carbon</b> permits; fiscal interactions; revenue recycling...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} economist’s claims, climate policy {{instruments}} such as <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> are rarely implemented. This paper analyzes the drivers of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> acceptability in the semi-direct democratic context of Geneva, Switzerland. Based on {{a sample of}} more than 300 individuals, we assess the effect on acceptability of socioeconomic characteristics, environmental attitudes, social norms as well as individual's perceptions of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> advantages and disadvantages. We also show that policy design matters for acceptability, in particular earmarking for environmental purposes, and find evidence of an effect of labeling, “climate contribution” leading under some circumstances to larger acceptability than “carbon tax”. We infer that proper policy design coupled with effective communication {{on the effects of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> may lead to a substantial improvement in acceptability...|$|R
5|$|While many of {{the costs}} of fossil fuels are well known, others (pollution related health problems, {{environmental}} degradation, the impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources) are indirect and difficult to calculate. These are traditionally external to the pricing system, and are thus often referred to as externalities. A corrective pricing mechanism, such as a <b>carbon</b> <b>tax,</b> could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy.|$|E

They were generally in favour of lower taxes but with more spending on senior services and education. In the 2009 provincial election they campaigned against the <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> which the governing BC Liberal Party had implemented the previous year.|$|E

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> {{have been}} {{frequently}} advocated as a cost-effective instrument for reducing emissions. However, {{in the practice}} of environmental policies, only six countries have implemented taxes based on the carbon content of the energy products. In this paper, we evaluate <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> with regard to their competitiveness, distributional and environmental impacts. The evidence shows that <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> may be an interesting policy option and that their main negative impacts may be compensated through the design of the tax {{and the use of the}} generated fiscal revenues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the drivers of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> acceptability with survey data and a randomized labeling treatment. Based on {{a sample of}} more than 300 individuals, it assesses the effect on acceptability of specific policy designs and individuals’ perceptions of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> advantages and disadvantages. We find {{that the lack of}} perception of primary and ancillary benefits {{is one of the main}} barriers to the acceptability of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes.</b> In addition, policy design matters for acceptability and in particular earmarking fiscal revenues for environmental purposes can lead to larger support. We also find an effect of labeling, comparing the wording “climate contribution” with “carbon tax”. We argue that proper policy design coupled with effective communication on the effects of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> may lead to a substantial improvement in acceptability...|$|R

25|$|From 2002, {{the policy}} of the Labour-led Clark Government was to {{implement}} a <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> in 2007. The proposed <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> would have applied to the whole economy, except for emissions of agricultural methane and nitrous oxide. The tax would have been $15 per tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent, based on approximating the international price of emissions. It would have been capped at $25 per tonne. The <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> policy was intended to be a precursor to emissions trading when it became internationally established.|$|E
25|$|A uniform <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> {{would not}} be Pareto {{efficient}} unless lump sum transfers were made between countries. Pareto efficiency requires that the <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> would not make any countries worse off {{than they would be}} without the tax (Chichilnisky and Heal, 1994, p.445; Tol, 2001, p.72). Also, at least one country would need to be better off.|$|E

40|$|Market-based {{climate change}} policy instruments, such as energy and <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes,</b> have {{frequently}} been proposed as efficient means to stimulate industrial energy efficiency improvements {{and to reduce}} carbon emissions. This paper presents {{an assessment of the}} impacts that energy and <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> may have on energy use and emissions profiles of the US pulp and paper industry. Time series data and engineering information are combined to endgenously specify changes in technologies and fuel mix within a dynamic computer model. The results of the model indicate under a wide range of assumptions that revenue-neutral energy or <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> will increase <b>carbon</b> emissions when compared to the absence of those <b>taxes,</b> and that <b>carbon</b> emissions are higher under <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> than under comparable energy taxes. Those seemingly counter-intuitive results have significant policy implications which are discussed in this paper...|$|R

GreenMod is a modelling platform for regional and sectoral analysis for energy and environmental issues. The current version is a recursively dynamic CGE model with imperfect competition, increasing returns to scale, and a detailed disaggregation level of the households, the firms, and the government. We decide that <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> alone are not sufficient in achieving the Kyoto targets at both regional and federal levels.

25|$|The {{urgent need}} to address climate change {{was one of the}} primary factors {{motivating}} Lessig to run for president. He supports a <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> on companies that are not able to clean the pollution that they have created. He also supports the other policies Democratic presidential candidates have proposed, but he argues that a <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> would render most of them unnecessary. He also argues that enacting the Citizen Equality Act is essential to make addressing climate change possible because fossil fuel interests are currently using their unequal influence to block it.|$|E
50|$|Opposition to {{increased}} environmental regulation such as <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> often centers on concerns that firms might relocate and/or people might lose their jobs. It has been argued, however, that <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> are {{more efficient than}} direct regulation and may even lead to higher employment (see footnotes). Many large users of carbon resources in electricity generation, such as the United States, Russia, and China, are resisting carbon taxation.|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{response}} to a potential productivity shock which becomes more imminent with global warming is to have <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> to curb {{the risk of a}} calamity and to accumulate precautionary capital to facilitate smoothing of consumption. This paper investigates how differences between regions in terms of their vulnerability to climate change and their stage of development affect the cooperative and non-cooperative responses to this aspect of climate change. It is shown that the cooperative {{response to}} these stochastic tipping points requires converging <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> for developing and developed regions. The non-cooperative response leads to a bit more precautionary saving and diverging <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes.</b> We illustrate the various outcomes with a simple stylized North-South model of the global economy...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to {{discusses}} theoretical issues regarding the use of <b>carbon</b> <b>taxes</b> in climate policy.
