Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April for a more thorough replenishment period and Illustrious transferred aircraft, spares, stores, and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May.

Despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid 96-point season, it was only good enough for eighth place in a Western Conference where seven teams <b>cracked</b> <b>the</b> 100-point barrier. In the playoffs, Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Red Wings in the first round. During the series, the Flames were fined by the NHL for several stick-related penalties in the fifth game.

Franzen would score the series clinching goal in the Game 6 defeat in Double Overtime.|$|E
5|$|For nine days, the British {{soldiers}} and sailors of the expeditionary force constructed gun batteries and trenches around the fort, bringing ashore large quantities of supplies and equipment in readiness for a lengthy siege. At 16:30 on 19 February the preparations were complete and the bombardment began, 14 heavy cannon and 28 mortars beginning a continuous attack on the fort which lasted {{for the next four}} days. French casualties in the overcrowded fort were severe, with 200 men killed or wounded. British casualties were minimal, with five killed and 11 wounded, principally in an explosion in an ammunition tent manned by sailors from HMS Amaranthe. At 12:00 on 23 February, Villaret de Joyeuse's trumpeter was sent to the British camp with a message proposing surrender terms. These were unacceptable to Beckwith and the bombardment resumed at 22:00, continuing until 09:00 the following morning when three white flags were raised over the fort and the French admiral surrendered unconditionally. The bombardment had <b>cracked</b> <b>the</b> roof of the fort's magazine, and there were fears that further shelling might have ignited the gunpowder and destroyed the building completely.|$|E

40|$|The plastic {{deformation}} processes around a crack tip at an atomic scale level under cyclic loading are examined using a molecular dynamics simulation. In this study, {{we deal with}} not only a specimen including both a crack and grain boundaries but also a specimen including only a <b>crack.</b> For <b>the</b> specimen including both <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> and <b>the</b> grain boundaries, we can observe the emission of edge dislocations in order to relax stress concentration around <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip during loading. The dislocations emitted from <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip return to <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip because of interaction between dislocations during unloading. <b>The</b> <b>crack</b> propagates due to coalescence of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip and <b>the</b> vacancies caused by the repeat of the dislocation emission and absorption at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip. For <b>the</b> specimen including only <b>the</b> <b>crack,</b> <b>the</b> emission of edge dislocations from <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip is observed during the first loading.

40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} for an elliptical cylinder cavity or a crack inside an infinite piezoelectric medium under combined mechanical-electrical loadings are formulated via the Stroh formalism and well confirmed by finite element analysis. The {{results show that}} the stress and electric fields in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip are, in general, determined by a complex vector of intensity factors. The complex vector of intensity factors may reduce to be real under certain circumstances. For a vacuum <b>crack,</b> <b>the</b> electric field inside <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> in <b>the</b> direction perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> magnifies <b>the</b> corresponding applied electric field by more than 1000 times. In this case, the electric field strength in the material has a finite value at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip, but <b>the</b> electric displacement approaches infinity at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip due to the piezoelectricity. The self-consistent analysis is developed to determine <b>the</b> deformed <b>crack</b> profile. <b>The</b> energy release rate for the cavity propagation is formulated under the condition that the ratio of the minor semi-axis to the major semi-axis of the ellipse remains unchanged. For an insulating <b>crack,</b> <b>the</b> applied electric field contributes nothing to the energy release rate when <b>the</b> undeformed <b>crack</b> profile is used, while the electric field resists <b>crack</b> propagation when <b>the</b> deformed <b>crack</b> profile is used. For a conducting slit <b>crack,</b> <b>the</b> energy release rate is independent of the applied electric field perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>crack,</b> and is enhanced by the applied electric field parallel to <b>the</b> <b>crack.</b> (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
