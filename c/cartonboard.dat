50|$|The {{paperboard}} {{sector is}} mainly {{looked at in}} conjunction with the paper industry. The Paper & Paperboard market size (2007) had a value of 630.9 billion USD and a volume of 320.3 million metric tons. Of that market 40.1% is European. About 50% of all produced paper is used for packaging, followed by printing and writing. According to ProCarton, the consumption of paper and paperboard seem to correlate with economic trends (GDP). Sales of carton in Europe sum up to around 8 billion Euros worth. Over 1,100 printers produce 5.4 million tonnes of <b>cartonboard</b> yearly. Cartons make up one third of paper and board packaging and 15% of all packaging. A bit more than half (54%) of the European carton is produced using recovered fibre or waste paper.The paper and paperboard industry is quite energy and capital intensive. Just a coated board machine itself can cost around 90 - 120 million Euros(about 125 - 166 million USD in 11/2011). Economies of scale apply, because of which a few large players often dominate the market place. E.g. in North America the top 5 producers have a market share of 85%.|$|E

5000|$|In 1985, {{the company}} made its entry into Europe with the {{acquisition}} of a boxboard plant in La Rochette, France. This new expansion took shape in 1986 {{with the creation of}} Cascades S.A. and the acquisition of another French boxboard mill in Blendecques. From 1987 to 1989, other mills located in Sweden and Belgium became part of the Cascades Group as well: Djupafors AB in Sweden and Kartonfabriek van Duffel NV in Belgium. The Belgian mill was renamed Cascades Duffel NV but ceased its production in 1993 after heavy losses and then was immediately transformed into a cutting center for the other European mills of the group. Declared definitively closed in the accounts of 1997, it was reconverted in 2002 by the ex-President of the Board of Cascades, Laurent Lemaire, to a so-called internal commercial agency, under the name with slightly modified orthography of Cascade Duffel NV, and having only one unit of establishment called Korton Fabrick van Ouffel, located at the exact address of the old mill Kartonfabriek van Duffel which was resold by Cascades to another company in 1998. This so-called agency (before different fiscal controles ...), without collaborator working in Belgium, was implied at the time of exports of <b>cartonboard</b> out of Europe, in particular those in transit by the port of Antwerp (according to Boards of directors of Cascades SA of June 28, 2002 and Nov 3, 2003).

40|$|Creasing and folding {{are vital}} {{processes}} in manufacturing of liquid and <b>cartonboard</b> packages. The {{quality of the}} crease and the subsequent folding is essential for good runnability and aesthetic appearance. The out-of-plane mechanical properties of <b>cartonboard</b> are particularly import in these processes. In this paper, recent advances in analysis of creasing and folding, using numerical simulations {{by means of the}} finite element method and the through-thickness shear strength profile of <b>cartonboard,</b> are presented. Existing methods to determine the out-of-plane shear strength of paper materials only give the strength in the weakest layer. In order to capture the through-thickness variation in shear strength the laminated notched shear test was introduced. In the simulations, the <b>cartonboard</b> was represented by a combination of continuum and cohesive models in order to capture the bulk and delamination properties, respectively. The continuum model was calibrated for each ply by testing individual plies that were isolated by grinding, and the cohesive model was calibrated using shear strength data from laminated notched shear tests. Results from the simulations are compared with creasing and folding experiments and the agreement is excellent considering the relative simplicity of the analysis. Finally, practical implications for trouble-shooting creasing and folding problems will be discussed. QC 2012060...|$|E
40|$|A <b>cartonboard</b> {{package is}} often sealed and closed with an {{adhesive}} – either a hot-melt adhesive (adhesives that are applied in a molten {{state on the}} <b>cartonboard)</b> or a dispersion adhesive (adhesives that are applied as water-based dispersions). This thesis focuses {{on the process of}} hot-melt gluing, and how material properties and process conditions affect the performance of the adhesive joint. Requirements vary depending on how the package is to be used. A package that is only supposed to protect the product during transport differs from one that is supposed to attract consumers and facilitate their use of the product. If a package has been opened, due to external or internal forces that cause a fracture in the adhesive joint, the consumer may choose another package instead. A fracture of the adhesive joint may occur in several different ways; for example, a cohesive fracture in the adhesive, an interfacial fracture between the adhesive and one of the <b>cartonboard</b> surfaces, and a cohesive fracture in the <b>cartonboard.</b> The traditional way of testing the adhesive joint is to subjectively evaluate the fibre tear after manually tearing the joint apart. The primary interest of this study has been to find an objective method that can characterise the adhesive joint – that is, its strength and joint characteristics. The work has principally concentrated on physical experiments where the Y-peel method has been evaluated and further developed, including the construction of a laboratory adhesive applicator. Adhesive joint failure is analysed and correlated to the force-elongation curve during Y-peel testing in order to explore various mechanisms of the failure. The force versus elongation curves are transformed into a force versus inelastic deformation curve for the adhesive joint. The inelastic deformation of the adhesive joint is defined as the inelastic opening of the adhesive joint perpendicular to the <b>cartonboard</b> surface. The dissipative descending energy has been used to characterise the adhesive joint. High descending dissipative energy showed high resistance against final failure of the joint. This correlates very well with the manual fibre-tear test. Characteristic force-elongation curves in Y-peel testing – that is, the shape of the curve – have been analysed, and four main failure modes have been identified. The finite element method has been used to predict mechanical behaviour in the ascending part of the force-elongation curve. When it comes to local behaviour, a high stiffness adhesive results in bending behaviour while a low results in shearing, but on a global scale, no big difference was detected on the ascending part of the force-elongation curve. The new laboratory adhesive applicator and finite element method can be used to objectively design the interaction between the adhesive and the <b>cartonboard</b> for a specific application. This can be achieved by modifying the <b>cartonboard,</b> the adhesive or the process parameters...|$|E
40|$|BillerudKorsnäs is a {{manufacturer}} of fiber-based <b>cartonboard</b> and liquid packaging board. Microbial growth occurs at several steps in <b>cartonboard</b> production due to favourable environment and the good access to nutrients from the raw material, and additives such as starch. Vegetative bacteria are usually not harmful in the production and die in the hot drying end of the <b>cartonboard</b> machine. The most abundant microflora at paper- and <b>cartonboard</b> factories consists largely of sporeforming microorganisms from the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus. The endospores are highly resistant and {{can stay in the}} final end product, which is undesirable. Levels of endospores from these species at BillerudKorsnäs production unit KM 5 are usually low, but an occational increase can be seen when a new <b>cartonboard</b> product, KW 1 is produced. Today, the method used for controlling the microbiology is by adding biocides to broke towers. This has shown to be both expensive and non-effective at KM 5. A new method is needed for controlling the microbiology at KM 5 that is more effective, costbeneficial and environmental friendly. The aim of this project was to test a hypothesis for spore formation at a paper board factory in lab-scale experiments. A suggestion of a technical change in the process would be made that could minimize spore formation and the use of biocides at KM 5. A model organism Bacillus licheniformis (E- 022052) was used to study effects of environmental conditions on spore formation. Experiments were also performed in controlled bioreactor trials, where methods to minimize spore formation were tested. The experiments showed that nutrient deficiency of a primary carbon source was the major reason for spore formation and should be avoided at KM 5. Further, the experiments showed that oxygen limitation significantly decreases the endospore formation. The conclusion reached, was that spore formation could be minimized by a feed addition of glucose to Broke tower 1 during the few days production of KW 1. A second alternative includes using a feed of concentrated pulp {{that could be used to}} minimize spore formation without the use of biocides and without the need for rebuilding of the mill...|$|E
40|$|Studies of the {{migration}} of benzophenone from inks and of model ink components incorporated deliberately into <b>cartonboard</b> {{have been carried out}} at low temperature and during microwave heating. Benzophenone was found in the packaging of four of seven frozen foods examined and this was attributed to its use as a photoinitiator for UV-cured ink. Benzophenone was found to migrate to the packaged food even from polyethylene-coated board, and this was attributed in part to the fact that polyethylene is rather permeable to low molecular weight substances and is not a good barrier to migration. Additional studies were conducted with two other frozen foods by incorporating model ink components into their <b>cartonboard</b> packaging. The substances were benzophenone, benzylbutyl phthalate, butyl benzoate, chlorodecane and dimethyl phthalate. Migration was readily detected after storing the food at - 20 °C for 1 week in the impregnated <b>cartonboard.</b> Migration levels in the food increased only slowly thereafter, up to 1 year, except for the most volatile substances used. Subsequent heating of the frozen food using a microwave oven decreased the concentration of some migrants by volatilization, but increased the concentration of other, less volatile substances by heat-accelerated migration. It is concluded that for inks used to print food contact materials, if the content of low molecular weight volatiles is controlled and if transfer of higher molecular weight components via set-off is controlled also, then migration levels could be kept low in these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{approach}} {{used in this}} project was to study migration into foods packaged in plastics films and in <b>cartonboard,</b> that had been supplemented with model substances. Seven substances were selected to act as model migrants and they were incorporated into inks used to print <b>cartonboard,</b> polyethylene and polypropylene films. The substances were toluene, xylene, limonene, acetophenone, cyclohexylbenzene, dimethylphthalate and benzophenone. Toluene and xylene were lost almost completely when the ink was dried and so these two substances could not be monitored in the subsequent migration studies. The remaining 5 substances covered the molecular weight range 120 to 194 and the boiling point range (at STP) 176 to 305 °C. For the plastic films the model substances were incorporated through flexographic printing with a white ink applied at ca. 2 g/m 2, containing each substance at 0. 5 % in the liquid ink.

40|$|A company, in this report, {{referred}} to as Global Forest is a leading supplier of <b>cartonboard</b> that recently initiated operations of a new <b>cartonboard</b> mill in China. The new machine will produce a mix of five products and will drastically increase the company’s supply of board products in the Chinese market. One of the five products is called Eucalyptus, this product {{is the focus of}} the master’s thesis. The Chinese market for the product group of Eucalyptus is small and inexperienced compared to other markets globally. The main reason for the lack of market adoption of Eucalyptus is believed to be caused by a unique feature of the product’s appearance. The recently increased supply of Eucalyptus and the low market adoption has resulted in a supply and demand gap. The total <b>cartonboard</b> market is characterized by a general oversupply which further increases the supply and demand gap of Eucalyptus. Due to operational constraints of the mill the supply of the product is assumed to be constant for the coming years. Efforts to bridge the supply and demand gap can thus mainly be performed on the demand side, why the market strategy for demand creation needs to be assessed. In order to increase the demand for the product the current market situation needs to be understood. This was performed in the study by conducting a market opportunity analysis. Based on the outcome of the analysis a business model was designed where target segments, value propositions, channels and customer relationships were outlined. It is believed that large growth can be generated by entering new application areas in the market. A driver for value creation lies in a natural trend observed in their market. The share of direct business needs to be increased in order to reduce dependency on merchants and to ensure visibility and control in the value chain of Eucalyptus. Furthermore the company should focus on establishing relationships with brand owners as this offers Global Forest insights in consumer preferences and market feedback. The process of growing demand is challenging for many companies and the structured approach presented in the case of Global Forest {{can be used as a}} reference case for other companies facing similar challenges...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} retail samples was {{conducted}} in two phases with 50 general paper and board food contact materials and articles analysed in 1992, and 121 samples, specifically of printed <b>cartonboard,</b> analysed in 1995. Packaging samples were extracted with ethanol containing 0. 4 % triethylamine. The extracts were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) {{and the presence of}} 4, 4 '-bis(dimethylamino) benzophenone (Michler's ketone, MK) and 4, 4 '-bis(diethylamino) benzophenone (DEAB) confirmed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The limits of detection for MK and DEAB in packaging were 0. 05 mg/kg and 0. 1 - 0. 2 mg/kg respectively. In the first phase, MK was detected in 24 % of the 50 samples at concentrations of 0. 06 - 3. 9 mg/kg paper. DEAB was detected in 12 % of samples (0. 1 - 0. 2 mg/kg). In the second phase, 26 % of the 121 <b>cartonboard</b> samples contained detectable MK (0. 1 - 1. 6 mg/kg) and 4 % contained DEAB (0. 2 - 0. 7 mg/kg). Residues of the monoamine 4 -(dimethylamino) benzophenone (DMAB) were found in 10 % of the 1992 samples (0. 1 - 0. 6 mg/kg). DMAB was not surveyed in 1995. These levels are too low to indicate the use of these cure agents for printing the packages. Rather, the most likely origin is from the use of recycled fibres. For three samples where the highest concentration of MK was detected, the food was analysed by GC-MS after extraction and clean-up. There was no measurable migration of MK at a detection limit of 2 μg/kg food. It is concluded, therefore, that the concentrations of MK present in the packaging samples analysed are unlikely to pose a risk to human health...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{prevention}} {{is the top}} priority of the European waste management strategy. In fact, as indicated in the latest Waste Framework Directive, the best option to deal with waste is not to generate it at all. In this framework, the distribution of loose dry food products through self-dispensing systems (so-called “loose distribution”) is being considered worldwide as a practice to reduce the generation of packaging waste. This life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluates the environmental convenience of the loose distribution of dry pasta, breakfast cereals, and rice, {{in comparison with the}} traditional method of distribution. For each product, several baseline scenarios based on single-use packaging were compared with different waste prevention scenarios in which the product is distributed loose. The comparison addressed waste generation, 13 impact categories on the environment and human health, and the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) indicator. The results are significantly different for the 3 products. The loose distribution of pasta allows a 50 % waste reduction and a decrease in the potential impacts only when compared with single-use <b>cartonboard</b> boxes. Conversely, when the comparison is made with single-use polypropylene bags, the loose distribution can even cause an increase in waste generation (up to 15 %) and in the potential life cycle impacts. For breakfast cereals, the loose distribution allows a significant reduction in both the amount of waste (up to 84 %) and the potential impacts, compared to the sale of traditional single-use bag-in-box packages. Finally, the loose distribution of rice permits a reduction in both waste generation (up to 86 %) and most of the potential impacts. In particular, the impact reduction is higher when the reference single-use packaging that is replaced includes a <b>cartonboard</b> box.

40|$|M. A. This {{research}} was conducted {{in the form of}} a single pre-post type of case study. The main reason why this type of study has been selected lies in the fact that no other cases were available to replicate or to compare the learning process in the Mondi <b>Cartonboard,</b> to determine if the company achieve its objective to develop a learning culture within. This situation limited the researcher to a single case design, and that is why the researcher was called upon to work with a pre-post situation that present it self at the time the study was conducted. A pre-situation were presented in Chapter one under the background discussion and the post situation was presented in the current situation as discussed in Chapter Three. The comparison and analysis between the two situations were conducted with the assistance of the Multi-Facet Model as developed by Lipshitz et al. In order to achieve the desire results five subproblems in support of this model were developed. Within each sub-problem, eight questions on the Likert rating scale was developed and specifically related to the five facets of learning as describe by the Multi-Facet Model. These questions were distributed between two response groups namely the non-supervisory/managerial respondent group and the managerial respondent group. In the findings and analysis of the questionnaires in Chapter Five, seven main problems in the five sub-problems has been identified.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a grey-box {{model for the}} dimensionalstability properties (i. e. curl and twist) of the carton boardproduced at AssiDomän Frövi paper mill in Sweden. AssiDomän Frövi AB is one of Sweden major <b>cartonboard</b> manufacturer, and produces some 350000 ton of board peryear. Curl {{is defined as the}} departure from a at form, and it mayseriously affect the processing of the paper. For this reason,customers impose quite restrictive limits on the allowedcurvatures of the board. So, it is becoming more and moreimportant to be able to produce a carton board with a curlwithin certain limits. Due to the economic significance of thecurl problem, much research has been performed to find sheetdesign and processing strategies to eliminate or reducecurl. The approach we used to tackle this problem is based ongrey-box modelling. The reasons for such an approach is thatthe physical process is very complex and nonlinear. The inuenceof some inputs is not entirely understood, and besides itdepends on a number of unknown parameters andunmodelled/unmesurable disturbances. One of {{the main part of the}} model is based on classicallaminate theory which is used to model the dimensionalstability of multi-ply board. The main assumption is that eachlayer is considered as an homogeneous elastic medium. The model is then complemented with a sub-model forunmodelled/umeasurable disturbances which are described asstates of a dynamical system, and estimated by means of anextended Kalman filter. The simulated curvatures show a general agreement with themeasurements. However, the prediction errors are too large forthe model to be used in an effective way, and a bigger efforthas to be carried out in order to improve the physicalsub-models.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} technique to expose spots of invisible set-off of inks and lacquers on the food-contact surface of food-packaging materials. Set-off is the unintentional transfer of components of printing inks from the outer printed surface onto the food-contact surfaces. The target sensitivity was 20 μg cm- 2 and the technique should be capable of examining large areas of printed substrate for no more than 4 % coverage by set-off. These requirements equate to an ability to detect a worst-case migration potential of less than 50 μg kg- 1. Other objectives were the industrial requirements that the equipment should be inexpensive, should be easy to use by existing personnel and should preferably be non-destructive with a clear criterion for pass or fail. The approaches investigated included chemical analysis of solvent extracts, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and microbeam analytical techniques, but these were found to be cumbersome and had only limited success. The objectives were achieved using an optical approach to excite and observe luminescence from invisible set-off. In model experiments, resins were applied to different substrates (plastic, paper and <b>cartonboard).</b> For a given resin on a given material, the key to success was to maximize the discrimination between the luminescence from the resin and that from the substrate by selecting the optimal combination of exciting wavelength and viewing goggles with selective wavelength filters. The required level of detection (20 μg cm- 2) was achieved or exceeded for all ten resins tested on three different plastics. It was also achieved for two different papers and in all but four cases of the resins on three different cartonboards. Quantitation was achieved by the use of a calibration palette prepared using different quantities of resin spotted onto the relevant blank packaging material. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of energy, food, {{and materials}} by the growing population {{in the world is}} leading to the situation where alternative solutions from renewable carbon resources are sought after. The growing use of plastics depends on the raw-oil production while oil refining are politically governed and required for the polymer manufacturing is not sustainable in terms of carbon footprint. The amount of packaging is also increasing. Packaging is not only utilising cardboard and paper, but also plastics. The synthetic petroleum-derived plastics and inner-coatings in food packaging can be substituted with polymeric material from the renewable resources. The trees in Finnish forests constitute a huge resource, which ought to be utilised more effectively than it is today. One underutilised component of the forests is the wood-derived hemicelluloses, although Spruce Oacetyl-galactoglucomannans (GGMs) have previously shown high potential for material applications and can be recovered in large scale. Hemicelluloses are hydrophilic in their native state, which restrains the use of them for food packaging as non-dry item. To cope with this challenge, we intended to make GGMs more hydrophobic or amphiphilic by chemical grafting and consequently with the focus of using them for barrier applications. Methods of esterification with anhydrides and cationic etherification with a trimethyl ammonium moiety were established. A method of controlled synthesis to obtain the desired properties by the means of altering temperature, reaction time, the quantity of the reagent, and even the solvent for purification of the products was developed. Numerous analytical tools, such as NMR, FTIR, SEC-MALLS/RI, MALDI-TOF-MS, RP-HPLC and polyelectrolyte titration were used to evaluate the products from different perspectives and to acquire parallel proofs of their chemical structure. Modified GGMs with different degree of substitution and the correlating level of hydrophobicity was applied as coatings on <b>cartonboard</b> and on nanofibrillated cellulose-GGM films to exhibit barrier functionality. The water dispersibility in processing was maintained with GGM esters with low DS. The use of chemically functionalised GGM was evaluated for the use as barriers against water, oxygen and grease for the food packaging purposes. The results show undoubtedly that GGM derivatives exhibit high potential to function as a barrier material in food packaging...|$|E
40|$|Recovered {{paper is}} the most {{important}} raw material in the world for the production of paper and paperboard (Hoke, 2009). The availability of recycled fibre is coming under pressure from competition for biomass for different uses, such as construction materials, biorefinery applications and the production of energy (Hoke, 2009). As the demand for secondary fibre increases, paper made with wet strength resins are becoming a more important source of fibre. Currently, wet strength paper entering traditional recycled paper mills ends up in the waste stream (Hoke, 2009). So not only is this a lost opportunity, but also a significant processing cost for its removal and disposal. Therefore it will become increasingly necessary to ensure that wet strength products are firstly removed from comingled recycling streams, and then secondly utilised in an economical manner. This investigation used a wet strength product, Coated Carrier Board (CCB) from Amcor <b>Cartonboard</b> Petrie Mill to investigate variables including chemical type, chemical concentration, temperature and pulping time with the aim of studying the process economics using conventional equipment and chemicals. Pulp tests include Canadian Standard Freeness, visual assessment and rejects %wt. Experimentation was completed in three stages, Scoping Laboratory Trials to investigate chemical types, Laboratory Trials to investigate the effects of variables and finally Industrial Pilot Scale Trials to observe real world effects. This study has presented an experimental methodology, investigated the effect of variables, and then considered their economic outcome. Finally, and most importantly it has been demonstrated that {{there is more than one}} way to achieve a desired rejects level. By observing the line of fit for the lowest cost for reject level, these optimum combinations can be selected on their merit on the basis of other operational aspects. Anecdotal evidence of the usable nature of the pulp was gained in industrial pilot scale trials. Use of chemical aids was found to be necessary for repulping CCB to achieve satisfactory rejects levels. Hydrogen peroxide was ineffective at repulping, expensive and hazardous. Hypo produced successful repulping results in tap water, however did not in mill white water, these were therefore eliminated as candidates. Potassium Persulphate used in conjunction with Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda) exhibited a small but positive effect in laboratory trials, however failed to provide a positive effect in industrial pilot scale trials, therefore suggesting it is not an effective additive for CCB repulping. Of the chemical combinations trialled, it was therefore concluded that Caustic Soda was most effective and economical. The experimentation undertaken successfully observed the effects of the selected variables on rejects level. It was observed that time had the greatest and most consistent effect on reducing reject content. In Laboratory trials from 10 mins to 20 mins pulping caused an approximate 75 percent reduction in rejects and this was repeated in Industrial Pilot Scale Trials with thirty to ninety minute trials exhibiting approximately the same reduction. The repulping process was determined to follow first order kinetics with respect to rejects %wt. It was also established that even though the addition of chemicals and increased temperature contributes to increased cost per Accepts Tonne, when aiming for low rejects level these costs are necessary. Increasing pulping time, therefore energy, was found to have the greatest effect and paid for itself up to approximately 550 kWh/Tonne. The variable of second greatest effect was temperature, where an approximately 50 percent reduction of rejects was observed from 45 °C to 75 °C. In the social, economic and environmental climate requiring increasing use of recycled feedstock, it is an important result that repulping wet strength paper is feasible with existing paper mill recycling equipment and commercially available chemicals, and can likely be done below the cost of traditional wastepaper...|$|E
