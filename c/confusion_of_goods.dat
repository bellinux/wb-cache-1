5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{confusing}} similarity namely, <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and confusion of business or origin. Determination of <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> necessitates the application of either the dominancy or the holistic test. The tests involved in determining likelihood of confusion of origin are separate and distinct from the tests in determining <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1813, {{the village}} of Sing Sing was incorporated. Sing Prison, now known as Sing Sing Correctional Facility, which is a maximum-security prison, opened in 1826. The prison was opened to replace the Newgate Prison that was located in New York City. In 1845, the New York State Legislature created a new town out of the {{northern}} part of what had been the Town of Mount Pleasant. A local Indian authority suggested the town be named Ossinsing, a different form of the name Sing Sing. One year later the last [...] "s" [...] was removed for ease in pronunciation. In 1881, the town considered changing its name to [...] "Garfield Plains" [...] to honor the recently assassinated President of the United States, James Garfield, but dropped the idea after the much larger city of White Plains in southern Westchester County objected. In 1901, to prevent <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> made in the village with Sing Sing prison-made items, local officials had the village name changed to Ossining as well.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the history}} of {{trademark}} cases in the Philippines, particularly in ascertaining whether one trademark is confusingly similar to or is a colorable imitation of another, no set rules can be deduced. Each case must be decided on its own merits. Furthermore, the question at issue in cases of trademark infringement is “whether {{the use of the}} marks involved would be likely to cause confusion or mistakes {{in the mind of the}} public or deceive purchasers”, regardless of whether the dominancy or the holistic test is applied. The universal test has been said to be whether the public is likely to be deceived. [...] In the case of Converse Rubber v. Universal Rubber Products, the Supreme Court had occasion to preempt the trademark registration applied for the trademark “Universal Converse and Device” by the respondent. The Court held that there is confusing similarity between respondent’s mark and petitioner’s “Converse Chuck Taylor” and “All Star Device” due to the same dominant word, “Converse”. In this case, the Director of Patents dismissed petitioner’s opposition to respondent’s application for registration, because of his negative finding of confusing similarity in the “partial” appropriation of petitioner’s trademark. Indeed, to allow respondent’s registration will lead not only to <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> but also of origin since petitioner has already established its goodwill and reputation here despite its lack of license to engage in business locally.|$|E
60|$|It {{was that}} effect of resentment which is lighter even than a touch, the waft of the arrow's feather; {{but it could}} wound a guilty heart, and Mrs. Brinkley sat down where she was, {{realising}} with a pang that the time when {{she might have been}} everything to this unhappy girl had just passed for ever, and henceforth she could be nothing. She remained musing sadly upon the contradictions she had felt in the girl's character, the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and evil, the potentialities of misery and harm, the potentialities of bliss and good; and she felt less and less satisfied with herself. She had really presumed to interfere with Fate; perhaps she had interfered with Providence. She would have given anything to recall her act; and then with a flash she realised that it was quite possible to recall it. She could telegraph Mavering to come; and she rose, humbly and gratefully, as if from an answered prayer, to go and do so.|$|R

Unfortunately, at the highest flourish of her feet, some vagabond zephyr obtruded his services, and a display of the graces took place, at which all the ladies present were thrown into great consternation; several grave country members were not a little moved, and the good Peter Stuyvesant himself was grievously scandalized.|$|R
50|$|Establishing {{trademark}} infringement requires three elements. The trademark owner must {{prove that the}} (1) mark is valid and legally protectable; (2) plaintiff owns the mark; and (3) defendant's use of the mark to identify goods or services results in a likelihood <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> concerning origins <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> or services. The gravamen of {{trademark infringement}} is likelihood <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> Thus, malice or intent to deceive is not required.|$|R

40|$|An {{exchange}} of gunfire in Bissau city between soldiers loyal to President and mutinous troops supporting the recently dismissed {{army chief of}} staff Brigadier Ansumane Mané in the early morning of 7 June 1998 heralded the start of 11 months of civil conflict. ‘It was not a huge war’, the Economist noted, ‘but for the 1 m people…of Guinea-Bissau, it was devastating…Hundreds of people were killed, the city was destroyed and hundreds of thousands fled into the countryside’. The primary reason for the fighting - irrevocable splits within the government and leading Partido Africano da Independencia da Guiné-Bissau e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) - sat amidst a web of geopolitical machinations and posturing. Guinea-Bissau became the locus for mediation based, for a large part, on political opportunism. These efforts resulted in a peace operation with ostensible humanitarian motives which, nonetheless, was also marked by strong political impulses. As William Zartman has remarked, ‘Africa does not lack mediators’. In the case of the war in Bissau the gamut of potential intermediaries – regional, African and extra-African – offered assistance. This <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> offices led to rival mediation efforts whose polarisation mirrored that on the battlefield. </p...|$|R
40|$|Confusion is {{a common}} cause of acute admissions, {{encompassing}} dementia, delirium and depression (Bostwick, 2000). Because of this diagnostic challenge, acute confusion is often misdiagnosed and undertreated; one study found {{this to be the}} case in 94 % of older people in hospitals (Ski and O'Connell, 2006). For a foundation doctor {{it can be difficult to}} know where to start with such a patient and yet this type of admission is extremely common. This article raises awareness of the appropriate management of a patient with <b>confusion</b> as part <b>of</b> <b>good</b> medical practice and thus improve the quality of care for patients with dementia and delirium in hospitals...|$|R

2500|$|Critics {{were often}} divided in their reviews for Wah Wah, but were mostly positive. The Independent said that [...] "a little bit <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> is <b>good</b> for us all" [...] whilst the NME called it [...] "one {{of the few}} {{genuinely}} engaging dance albums around." [...] Nonetheless, fans were more divided by the album, with the album's experimental bent meaning {{there was little to}} appeal to the more casual James fan. Retrospective assessment has been more positive, with Record Collector calling it a [...] "landmark" [...] album, whilst Allmusic noted that it was [...] "one of the more uncommercial albums any band of its stature and its accompanying major label has had a hand in releasing." [...] Select magazine named it the 45th best album of 1994 in their year-end critics poll. Wah Wah was remastered and re-released on clear heavyweight double vinyl in March 2015, alongside a remastered CD version in an expanded box set also containing a remastered edition of Laid, Laid & Wah Wah.|$|R
