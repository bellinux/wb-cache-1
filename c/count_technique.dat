40|$|The item <b>count</b> <b>technique</b> is {{a survey}} {{methodology}} {{that is designed}} to elicit respondents ’ truthful answers to sensitive questions such as racial prejudice and drug use. The method is also known as the list experiment or the unmatched <b>count</b> <b>technique</b> and is an alternative to the commonly used randomized response method. In this article, I propose new nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood estimators for efficient multivariate regression analysis with the item <b>count</b> <b>technique.</b> The two-step estimation procedure and the Expectation Maximization algorithm are developed to facilitate the computation. Enabling multivariate regression analysis is essential because researchers are typically interested in knowing how the probability of answering the sensitive question affirmatively varies as a function of respondents’ characteristics. As an empirical illustration, the proposed methodology is applied to the 1991 National Race and Politics survey where the investigators used the item <b>count</b> <b>technique</b> to measure the degree of racial hatred in the United States. Small-scale simulation studies suggest that the maximum likelihood estimator can be substantially more efficient than alternative estimators.

40|$|Surveys usually yield {{rates of}} voting in {{elections}} that {{are higher than}} official turnout figures, a phenomenon often attributed to intentional misrepresentation by respondents who did not vote and would be embarrassed to admit that. The experiments reported here tested the social desirability response bias hypothesis directly by implementing a technique that allowed respondents to report secretly whether they voted: the “item <b>count</b> <b>technique.</b> ” The item <b>count</b> <b>technique</b> significantly reduced turnout reports in a national telephone survey relative to direct self-reports, suggesting that social desirability response bias influenced direct self-reports in that survey.

40|$|International audienceBacterial {{screening}} is {{very important}} in water environmental monitoring, because the presence of dangerous pathogens can seriously endanger human health. Microbial concentration detection is performed by standard plate <b>count</b> <b>technique,</b> which is reliable but is characterized by long response time and is not suitable to be implemented in automatic form.

Water samples from different sources (such as rivers, wastewaters, watercourses) are tested using the presented system. Enriched medium is added to the sample to favor bacterial growth.

40|$|Antihistaminics {{are widely}} used for various {{indications}} during microbial infection. Hence, this paper investigates the antimicrobial activities of 10 antihistaminics belonging to both old and new generations using multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. The bacteriostatic activity of antihistaminics was investigated by determining their MIC both by broth and agar dilution techniques against 29 bacterial strains. Azelastine, cyproheptadine, mequitazine and promethazine were the most active among the tested drugs. Diphenhydramine and cetirizine possessed weaker activity whereas doxylamine, fexofenadine and loratadine were inactive even at the highest tested concentration (1 mg/ml). The MIC of meclozine could not be determined as it precipitated with the used culture media. The MBC values of antihistaminics were almost identical to the corresponding MIC values. The bactericidal activity of antihistaminics was also studied by the viable <b>count</b> <b>technique</b> in sterile saline solution.

The metabolites produced by F. graminearum and F. moniliforme were Isobutyl-acetate, 3 -Methyl- 1 -butanol and, only at 8 days, 3 -Octanone.

40|$|The {{presence}} of pan-resistant bacteria worldwide possesses {{a threat to}} global health. It is difficult to evaluate the extent of carriage of resistant bacteria in the population. Sewage sampling is a possible way to monitor populations. We evaluated the {{presence of}} pan-resistant bacteria in Israeli sewage collected from all over Israel, by modifying the pour plate method for heterotrophic plate <b>count</b> <b>technique</b> using commercial selective agar plates. This method enables convenient and fast sewage sampling and detection. We found that sewage in Israel contains multiple pan-resistant bacteria including carbapenemase resistant Enterobacteriacae carrying blaKPC and blaNDM- 1, MRSA and VRE. blaKPC carrying Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae were the most common Enterobacteriacae drug resistant bacteria found in the sewage locations we sampled. Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. were the 4 main CRE isolated from Israeli sewage and also from clinical samples in our clinical microbiology laboratory. Hospitals and Community sewage had similar percentage of positive samplings for blaKPC and blaNDM- 1.

40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} sensitivities of two nested PCR assays for the {{detection}} of Legionella pneumophila {{to each other and to}} the plate <b>counting</b> <b>technique</b> (ISO 11731) in a wide range of aquatic samples. Methods and Results: The nested PCR assay with the primer set LEG 225 -LEG 858 revealed 56 % of the 46 analysed aquatic samples as being positive for Legionella spp., while the primer set JFP-JRP yielded 98 % positive samples. The detection was confirmed by sequencing the PCR products. These results are considerably higher than the result obtained with the plate <b>counting</b> <b>technique</b> (41 %), indicating the higher sensitivity of PCR-based diagnostic methods. As the PCR assay with the LEG 225 -LEG 858 primer set resulted in a lower number of positive samples, it is considered not sensitive enough for aquatic samples. Similar results for the respective primer sets were obtained {{for the detection}} of the species L. pneumophila, responsible for 90 % of all human Legionella infections, in the aquatic samples analysed. Both microbial community analysis by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the analysis of biotic and abiotic water quality parameters revealed no relation between L. pneumophila-positive and -negative samples and the physico-chemical and bacteriological characteristics of the aquatic samples. Conclusions: The results show the additional value of the PCR assay with the JFP-JRP primer set compared with the plate <b>counting</b> <b>technique,</b> as well as its applicability in a wide range of aquatic samples.
