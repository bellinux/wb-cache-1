5000|$|In 1895, {{following}} a donation from Thomas Fortune Ryan, the Visitation order built a Romanesque revival style brick chapel and service {{building to the}} east of the original Taylor House. In 1900 they enclosed the buildings and gardens with a high brick wall. In 1923 a three-story brick dormitory with Colonial Revival details was built between the house and chapel. Some smaller buildings on the property, and the old Adams mansion, were demolished circa 1929. A bequest from the Mother Superior in 1927 allowed the Visitation nuns to close the school and concentrate on their <b>contemplative</b> <b>activities,</b> so the sisters renovated the dormitories into individual cells. The nuns also produced the sacramental bread for local parishes, and even the Atlantic Fleet during the Second World War. In 1952 a print shop was added in a cinder block wing that replaced a small porch on the building's west side. [...] In 1955 they removed the cupola, fearing a lightning strike similar to that at Trinity United Methodist Church. Although the order renovated the chapel consistent with the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the nuns were aging and the order needed to further consolidate its properties. In 1985, the sisters decided the sell the property and build a monastery in rural Rockville, Hanover County.|$|E

In the last decade, there are studies which focus on mental (e.g., Braun-LaTour et al. 2007; Hallowell 2005) and physical health parameters (e.g., Chan and Huang 2013), showing information overload’s negative effects on emotions (e.g., Swar et al. 2017) and on perceived health (e.g., Hallowell 2005; Misra and Stokols 2012).

40|$|Studies {{conducted}} in Western nations suggest hypotheses regarding {{the relationship between}} leisure activity and well-being among older adults.

This study attempts to verify these relationships among a sample of 4, 049 Taiwanese elders (age 60 +). Analyses show that men participate in most leisure activities with greater frequency than women; physical activity has the strongest positive influence on emotional well-being; <b>contemplative</b> <b>activity,</b> the only pursuit in which women out-participate men, displays a negative effect for women, and; the impact of different activity types vary by gender.

40|$|I {{would like}} to begin by telling you how I see Wittgenstein in {{relationship}} to philosophy. For me, philosophy is a <b>contemplative</b> <b>activity</b> that restraints itself by considering {{the very act of}} falling into oneself conceptually. In order to become a human being, no matter how old one is, no matter when one does it, all of us must fall into ourselves some day. But not all human beings make the falling into oneself their own conceptual object; no, only those who have dedicated their time to that which {{came to be known as}} philosophy. Even though falling into oneself is something that people do take in consideration in the arts (in the sciences, this is done more indirectly), it is not restricted to the concept. In arts and in poetry the concept is not only taken in consideration but it is also realized and produced, and because of this it becomes immediately subsumed in its very expression. In philosophy, this conceptual consideration is likely to become an expression as well, and therefore, as we well know, it has turned into a literary genre...|$|R

40|$|Between the two {{extremes}} of boredom and anxiety, we find space for flow: a calmer state of enjoyment in immersive, <b>contemplative</b> <b>activities,</b> which creates {{a loss of}} self-awareness (Csikszentmihalyi 1975). This paper draws on the research findings of two qualitative research projects about skydivers and performance artists to examine the phenomenological experience of flow. In particular, we focus on transitions {{in and out of}} flow, and examine their dramaturgical management in social interaction. The question of flow disruption is a marginal theme in Csikszentmihalyi’s work. This paper aims to develop this idea by exploring how and why the state of flow can be disrupted by critical self-awareness. Building on the existing research literature, we argue that flow is a harmonious yet fragile state of mind, which remains prone to restriction and disruption. Drawing on empirical data from our own research projects, we discuss the disturbances that occur when self-reflection returns during flow-generating activities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present Data Souvenirs, book-like {{electronic}} {{objects that}} display {{various forms of}} information {{with the goal of}} supporting reflection and reminiscence. Data Souvenirs draw on the ability of electronic data streams to provide new perspectives on data in and around the home while taking on a less distracting, more reflective form than existing domestic technologies. Several authors highlight the importance of self reflection in technology design [6, 9]. Sengers et al. [9] define reflection as “bringing unconscious aspects of experience to conscious awareness, [...] . making them available for conscious choice. ” They argue that “critical reflection is crucial to individual freedom and our quality of life in society as a whole, since without it, we unthinkingly adopt attitudes, practices, values, and identities we might not consciously espouse. ” We agree with this argument; we further argue that many technologies for the home offer poor support for <b>contemplative</b> <b>activities</b> like reflection, and in fact often serve as a distraction from such activities.

30|$|Students and {{teachers}} of meditation are already {{believers in the}} reality and importance of these practices for physical health and psychological well-being and they are justified in this belief from an ever-growing body of evidence-based studies. What they lack, however, in many instances is an awareness and appreciation of the anatomy and physiology that underlies what is (or in some cases may be) taking place during meditative practice and I strongly believe they can benefit from having their questions addressed {{in terms of the}} actual physiological mechanisms at work during meditation. My students often express what can only be called astonishment and a true sense of wonder when taught about how their bodies and those of other animals actually work. Since some of what I teach them about breathing, metabolism, heart beat, body temperature, and other physiological systems is often counterintuitive and {{flies in the face of}} what they have always believed, the impact of this new knowledge is dramatic. I cannot say with assurance that a sophisticated understanding of physiology necessarily improves one's ability to enter contemplative states and practice meditation. However, if the meditator's goal is increased self-knowledge and deeper self-awareness, then a more precise and analytical appreciation of what is physically going on inside the body can provide another pathway into the kind of personal exploration that underlies all <b>contemplative</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the research question: how do software developers in distributed projects continually develop their practical knowledge through dealing with changing circumstances in daily work practice? The {{purpose is to}} complement previous research on knowledge-related issues in distributed software development settings by assuming a practice-based perspective on knowledge and studying knowing as seen in software developers actual everyday activities. This work builds on extensive field studies of a team in a multinational organisation and of an open source community called PyPy. The primary methods utilized were participant observation and grounded theory coding. The thesis provides thick descriptions of the two cases, coupled with vignettes that illustrate how issues of evolving technology, enculturation and socialisation of new members, and emerging project purposes and goals manifested in the settings under study. What is being argued is that the software developers in the studies dealt with changing circumstances through the purposeful adaptation of practice. Evidence is presented that shows how this is an ongoing process of practices adopted to allow for change and change stimulating adjustment of practice. When the software developers do this, {{there are at least}} two important concerns: anticipating changing circumstances and alignment of activities. This empirical study thus unveils underlying dynamics of knowledge development that matter for how sharing actually happens in these settings. The temporal dimension of knowledge is emphasised and attention is shifted towards supporting software developers <b>contemplative</b> <b>activities.</b> The findings also opens up for an alternative understanding of what situated means in distributed software development, showing that, as well as locale-specific practices, it may also be understood in terms of professional context and shared enterprise. Further light is also shed on the complexities of distributed software development practice. Distribution is shown as a mundane issue, as something that is dealt with as a collaborative challenge alongside many other issues. With the focus on changing circumstances, a previously unexplored aspect of work in these settings is characterised...|$|E
3000|$|It is also {{important}} to note that students themselves have urged us to develop contemplative methods in the classroom. Any teacher can observe that today’s university students feel over-committed, over-worked, and overwhelmed. Thus, when first given the opportunity to meditate, many often think of such a practice as just one more daily task to complete. Yet many of us have seen that once students actually engage in meditation or other <b>contemplative</b> <b>activity,</b> they realize both how the exercises bring greater self-understanding and how useful they can be to their everyday life by reducing stress, improving mood, and bringing rest, 23 which sometimes leads to hunger for more. 24 As Fran Grace has discussed (See Grace 2011; Barbazat and Bush 2014), various empirical studies have begun to show that contemplative pedagogy provides an antidote to the anxiety, distraction, and academic pressure so many students feel, and there are measureable improvements in variables for mental, physical and emotional well-being. This, as well as academic improvement, is discussed in a very interesting study of the spiritual life of college students, Cultivating the Spirit: How College Can Enhance Students’ Inner Lives (Astin et al. 2011). Here, the authors point out that while “knowing thyself” is understood to be central to liberal arts education, developing answers to meaning and purpose questions or discovering students’ own beliefs and values gets little attention, especially when they are nervous about their future and finances in a difficult economy. In a seven-year (2003 – 10) study, the authors found that over their college careers, students became more personally spiritual and less formally religious, more caring, tolerant, and globally aware, and these qualities enhanced other “traditional” college outcomes: improved academics/GPA, leadership skills, psychological well-being and life satisfaction. One significant factor assisting this growth is meditation/reflection or any “inner work” that increased self-awareness. Indeed, the authors write that contemplative practices “are among the most powerful tools at our disposal for enhancing students’ spiritual development (148).” [...]...|$|R
40|$|In Aristotle’s thought, {{economic}} activity {{refers to a}} kind of praxis consisting in allocating the human and material means that constitute the oikos –the domestic community- to fulfil its natural ends: ensure both life and the means of life. By means of natural chrematistics -acquisitive art- families acquire the necessary means for this, which come from production and exchange. Families group together in the political community (polis) whose end is living well, according to virtues, among which justice is highlighted as the ‘complete virtue’. For its part, the Christian êthos regards every human act, internal and external, of this complete system (polis, oikos and chrematistics) as tending towards its ultimate purpose (beatitudo). In St. Thomas’s view, eternal law harmonizes necessity of irrational beings, loving God’s action (divine law), natural law, and the contingency of ‘human things’ where the economy is included. Trading activity is lawful if it is at the service of the oikos or polis and according to how is exercised, by following commutative justice. The family, political and religious character of human nature establishes what the natural-necessary consists of, embracing, apart from bodily goods, others derived from considering social status and the life chosen (civil, religious, active or <b>contemplative).</b> Economic <b>activity</b> based on this anthropological root has a specific place as a part of an ordered natural-legal totality that provides the economy with meaning and sufficient moral guidance...|$|R
40|$|This practice-led PhD {{research}} {{explores the}} nature of embodied knowledge acquired and practised through the rhythms and patterns of hand-stitching processes, such as embroidery, plain sewing and patchwork quilting, undertaken by individuals alone and in dedicated groups as recreational craft, artistic expression and social life. The scale and pace of hand-stitching match those of the body, grounding cognitive and emotional experience in a tangible process. The hand-eye-mind coordination required cultivates a distinctive form {{of attention to the}} self, which has renewed importance {{in the context of the}} anti- haptic experiences of screen technologies that infiltrate our daily routines in the home and the workplace. Working with the premise that skilled hand-stitching concerns more than technical ability, I examine how these activities articulate dimensions of subjective experience. In turn, I explore ways in which the relationship between an individual and a group is constructed through their crafting skills. My previous experiences of textile crafting as a social activity drew me to this question, and my interest as a practitioner and teacher in the contemporary and future relevance of skilful work motivates me to better understand what it is that I, and many other stitch practitioners, do. With the tacit knowledge of a practitioner I know how to stitch, and from my investigations into the history and theory of textile art, craft and material culture I know about stitch. However, my view is that when absorbed in the process of making other more immediate and personal sensations take over. An exploration of haptic sensations relative to these processes underpins the investigation, and I focus instead on the dynamic relationship between practical skill, the body and its proximity to tools, materials and other people during actual experiences of making – the repeated gestures, coordinated hand movements and the skilled precision of tool use and fingertip manipulation – to provide a new context for the study of embodied knowledge known in and through hand-stitching. In order to explore this I have used a combination of ethnographic, auto-ethnographic and creative research methods including interviews, observation, video recording of a patchwork quilting group, participation in practical stitching sessions with a village embroidery group, undertaking workshops with students, and my own reflective stitching practice. It has emerged from the research that patterns of hand-stitching processes share characteristics with certain modes of social interaction sought by participants in order to experience sensations of participation, belonging or interdependence. Similarly to other oral traditions, an embodied knowledge of the practice includes patterns of interaction and particular attitudes and behaviours that are inseparable from the practical skills. However, people also stitch on their own; as a private, <b>contemplative</b> <b>activity,</b> hand-stitching allows a person to carve out time and space for introspective reflection. Whilst this could be thought of as a different kind of experience altogether, I suggest that mastery of these skills enables control over when and how to use them, which, I have found, allows a practitioner to adjust the type of experience sought: participation in a shared conversation or activity can be exchanged for isolated contemplation and a sense of self-reliance. I conclude that hand-stitching surpasses its technical or artistic attributes when considered as a material practice that offers particular metaphors for other processes of joining, collaboration, integrity – or even separation and isolation. Practising these skills is possibly the only way to acquire this embodied knowledge, which needs to be understood as a mode of interaction if it is not merely trivialised as quaint, as domestic labour or archived as ethnographic curiosity or as art object...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} primary sites of collecting and display commissioned by Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (r. 1564 - 87). These sites ─ Francesco's studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio {{and the nearby}} Uffizi Gallery ─ established precedents for the physical layout of newly emerging museums in early modern Europe, as scholars have suggested. But, as this dissertation asserts, Francesco's communication of authority through these sites significantly contributed to the changing expectations in the 16 th century of a ruler's proper engagement with culture. Displaying objects connoting knowledge, taste, and wealth, these sites demonstrated Francesco's privileged access to such objects and his mastery over the scientific processes involved in their creation. Emphasizing the prince's knowledge, this approach contrasted with earlier rulers' reliance on images of direct military power and {{laid the groundwork for}} the merging of personal and private space that would come to characterize the full expression of absolutism across Europe. 	Chapter One examines the multi-faceted assertions of authority in Francesco's portraits, a strategy reflecting his embrace of images and spaces to communicate personal and political identity. Chapter Two addresses his private studiolo, which represented Francesco's participation in scientific, <b>contemplative,</b> and collecting <b>activities</b> among ruling elites. Chapter Three examines the subtle but profound shift in the meaning of the collection when, in 1583, Francesco created the Galleria degli Uffizi, a significant contribution in the history of European museums. Established independent of the prince's residence, the new museum represented Francesco's most powerful expression of cultural politics, as dignitaries visited the impressively decorated gallery and experienced first-hand its political assertions. 	The dissertation concludes by examining the impact of Francesco's museological precedents on other Italian rulers. Sites in Florence and Mantua demonstrate the continued attractiveness of Francesco's cultural expressions of authority to 17 th-century rulers, as new expectations of a ruler's engagement with the arts emerge. Princely galleries become an increasingly common demonstration of authority, with many examples emulating the Uffizi's design. The conclusion affirms Francesco's legacy in binding the demonstration of artistic and scientific knowledge to political authority in the early Seicento...|$|R
