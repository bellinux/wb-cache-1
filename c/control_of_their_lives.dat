5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{argue that}} {{overpopulation}} {{and lack of}} access to birth control leads to population increase to exceed food production and other resources. Better education for both men and women, and more <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> reduces population growth due to family planning. According to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), by giving better education to men and women, they can earn money for their lives and can help them to strengthen economic security.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility {{for health}} care has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament since it was {{established}} in 1999. The Scottish government has enacted health policies which {{are different from those}} in England, such as abolishing charges for prescriptions and elderly personal care. NHS Scotland has been operationally independent of the NHS {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom since the formation of the NHS in 1948. Supporters of independence argue that independence is needed because possible reductions in the NHS budget in England would result in reduced funding for Scotland, which would make it difficult to maintain the existing service. Harry Burns, a former chief medical officer for Scotland, said in July 2014 that he thought independence could be beneficial for public health because it may give people greater <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E

500|$|In fall 2011, a {{permanent}} exhibit was opened by the National Park Service to commemorate {{those who lived}} in the swamp during pre-Civil War times. Sayers summarizes: [...] "These groups are very inspirational.

500|$|They {{believed}} in empowering children by {{practices such as}} greeting their audience members with [...] "Hello, everyone", instead of [...] "Hello, boys and girls" [...] because as Paul Field has explained, the second greeting [...] "unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension". Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to [...] "Wake Up Jeff" [...] when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was [...] "very much {{in keeping with the}} way they work with children". [...] Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> [...] Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that [...] "it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything". [...] Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles' audience felt [...] "great excitement" [...] and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. [...] Anthony Field, who called it [...] "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done {{since the start of the}} group", claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. [...] The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because [...] "it was a perfect fit". [...] When Fatt retired, Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{has been}} honored with several awards {{as a result}} of Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, {{including}} the PEN Center West Award for best fiction, the Lannan Foundation Literary Award, the Quality Paperback Book Club New Voices Award, and, in 1993, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. [...] K. Prescott states that once the book was published, Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories was well-received because women of many cultures could relate to the stories: [...] "Cisneros surveys woman's condition—a condition that is both precisely Latina and general to women everywhere. Her characters include preadolescent girls, disappointed brides, religious women, consoling partners and deeply cynical women who enjoy devouring men. They are without exception strong girls, strong women." [...] Marcia Tager comments again on the characters, saying that Cisneros [...] "writes with humour and love about people she knows intimately". [...] For critic Ilan Stavans, the stories are not just words, but [...] "a mosaic of voices of Mexican-Americans who joke, love, hate and comment on fame and sexuality... They are verbal photographs, memorabilia, reminiscences of growing up in a Hispanic milieu." [...] The American Library Journal and The New York Times honoured Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories as a noteworthy book of the year. [...] The New York Times reviewer Bebe Moore Campbell wrote in 1991 that [...] " [...] stories about women struggling to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> traverse geographical, historical and emotional borders and invite us into the souls of characters as unforgettable as the first kiss". Apart from much praise, one criticism is that Cisneros stereotypes Hispanic men and women in her stories. Stavans argues that the males [...] "are always abusive, alcoholic and egotistical", while the women are [...] "naïve [...] doll-like".|$|E

50|$|Bandura {{showed that}} {{difference}} in self-efficacy correlates to fundamentally different world views.

2500|$|The {{term has}} also {{been used in the}} {{different}} sense of [...] feminism as it applies to mothers. Dr. Andrea O’Reilly of York University in Toronto said at a 2011 Women’s Worlds conference in Ottawa, Canada that feminist mothering must focus on things that are denied to women by patriarchal motherhood.

2500|$|The goddess {{emerged in}} her {{works in the}} late 1970s, {{representing}} women's power to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives.</b> She used an image of herself to create new, powerful, real or fictitious characters. In 1975 she created Goddess Head, one of her photomontages. The National Museum of Women in the Arts' biography of her states: [...] "Her site-specific performances or 'rituals' which kept investing {{both private and public}} spheres strove to create a new feminine spirituality with its own values and iconography." [...] To memorialize [...] "9,000,000 Women Burned as Witches in the Christian Era," [...] and empower the visiting women, she used fire ladders and fire circle rituals at the A.I.R. Gallery. She used these rituals in other galleries in New York.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Josephine's concealing Wyatt's past relationship with Blaylock, modern researchers think she {{may also have}} been trying to conceal her own past as a [...] "sporting lady" [...] or prostitute. While prostitutes were ostracized by [...] "respectable" [...] women, many madams and prostitutes had more <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> and greater independence than other women. Josephine always sought excitement in her life. In the book I Married Wyatt Earp (1967), based on a manuscript which she purportedly wrote, author Glenn Boyer quotes her as saying, [...] "I liked the traveling sort of man... better than the kind that sat back in one town all his life and wrote down little rows of figures all day or hustled dry goods or groceries and that sort of thing... My blood demanded excitement, variety and change." [...] The type of work available to most women in that era was as laundresses, seamstresses, or other dull work which Josephine avoided.|$|E

The right information helps them maintain that control.
