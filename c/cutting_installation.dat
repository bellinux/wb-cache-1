40|$|Science {{offers more}} than just the yearly <b>cutting</b> edge <b>installation</b> in a phone series or the next {{technological}} interest such as augmented reality headsets. It also offers a whole new perspective on how to view the world, from understanding how everyday things work through to the intrigue of space and the very small dimensions of the Universe. Making science more central to society can enrich every level of it from giving children the curiosity bug to creating tomorrow’s next world changing idea. Such a society could have better informed national discussions. Science can make Malta a global leader. N/...|$|R

50|$|Another {{application}} of interior protection is construction wall barriers. They {{are used to}} separate a construction project that produces dust, debris, and/or odor {{from the rest of}} business operations. This includes scarifying and re-flooring project, concrete <b>cutting,</b> remodeling, <b>installation</b> of new equipment, tenant improvements, restoration, and reparation. Temporary Construction wall barriers involve installing the poly engineered film floor to ceiling creating a frameless wall - a protective envelope separating the workplace from the work zone. Construction wall barriers can also be specifically customized to meet your project requirements, including doorways, tunnels, person-doors, and air filters. While not only preventing dust and debris from spreading, a vertical wall or temporary construction partition also confines contractors to their area, keeps employees safe, and prevents spread of unwanted odors.|$|R

40|$|Crank case as the {{foundation}} for almost all engine parts are mounted her machine. Such as transmission gear shaft, crank shaft, shaft coupling, bushing and various other components. All of components are related to each other, if components are not installed with precision, the machine rejected. Manufacturing of the crank case begins with the die casting process, face milling, drilling, boring, reaming, spot facing and tapping. The most important process is the face milling. Face milling is done {{on both sides of the}} crank case R & L, which will both be united. Therefore, it takes surface roughness 12. 5 μm, flat and level, because if there are scratches on the crank case surface after combined oil seepage will occur. It is already a reject. It required an analysis of the failure of face milling process by considering several things, namely machining parameters are used, the condition of the <b>cutting</b> tool,the <b>installation</b> of the crank case on the jig and the coolant used. Analyzing the four factors above, it is hoped will be able to optimize the face milling process as well as reduced product reject. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The powder {{particles}} {{using the}} tool grinder {{is composed of}} two types. One is mounted on the rotating shaft of the machine tool. This tool is generally single <b>cutting</b> edge. The <b>installation</b> tool is a bolt shank fixed to the rotary shaft of the positioning groove. When you need to replace the tool mechanical enclosure open, loosen all bolts to remove the tool to replace the new tool. With no cutting edge tools can extend tool life. Reduce the number of replacement tools. The second tool is mounted on the housing of the machine tool. Single cutting edge of the tool mounting clearance is small, difficult to adjust the gap. Multi-blade cutter working gap can be formed when using the wedge mounting the inlet and outlet ports of the difference. Move the material in the resulting gap wedge and promote the formation of shear extrusion processing. Quick change fixed tool so that the tool sharp edge retention, reduce heat generation. Quick tool change involves cooling structure, the tool fixed way, {{the position of the}} discharge port design and rapid tool change...|$|R

50|$|Carpentry is {{a skilled}} trade {{in which the}} primary work {{performed}} is the <b>cutting,</b> shaping and <b>installation</b> of building materials during the construction of buildings, ships, timber bridges, concrete formwork, etc. Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did the rougher work such as framing, but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry. Carpentry in the United States is almost always done by men. With 98.5% of carpenters being male, {{it was the fourth}} most male-dominated occupation in the country in 1999, and there were about 1.5 million positions in 2006. Carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave. Carpenters normally framed post-and-beam buildings {{until the end of the}} 19th century; now this old fashioned carpentry is called timber framing. Carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an apprenticeship training—normally 4 years—and qualify by successfully completing that country's competence test in places such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and South Africa. It is also common that the skill can be learned by gaining work experience other than a formal training program, which may be the case in many places.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of computerised condition monitoring {{systems for the}} detection <b>cutting</b> tools’ correct <b>installation</b> and fault diagnosis is of a high importance in modern manufacturing industries. The primary function of a condition monitoring system is to check {{the existence of the}} tool before starting any machining process and ensure its health during operation. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the detection of the existence of the tool in the spindle and its health (i. e. normal or broken) using infrared and vision systems as a non-contact methodology. The application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) combined with neural networks are investigated using both types of data in order to establish an effective and reliable novel software program for tool tracking and health recognition. Infrared and visual cameras are used to locate and track the cutting tool during the machining process using a suitable analysis and image processing algorithms. The capabilities of PCA and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) combined with neural networks are investigated in recognising the tool’s condition by comparing the characteristics of the tool to those of known conditions in the training set. The experimental results have shown high performance when using the infrared data in comparison to visual images for the selected image and signal processing algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The paper {{describes}} solutions of {{the problem}} raised during treating the turbine wheel of a turbocharger. The treatment of a complex surface with a hard grinding wheel {{requires a lot of}} time. This method does not provide the required quality because of the inaccessibility of some parts of the turbine blades. The problem is solved by polishing with loose abrasive grains. The abrasive medium is compressed with compressed air through a special device. Materials and Methods: The SolidWorks 2016 software was used to design the tool. The design of the part for determining actual loads and deflections was calculated taking into account the comparison of the operating parameters with the permissible values. Results: The main parameters of the part tratment are the pressure of the loose abrasive on the working surfaces of the blades and the speed of rotation of the part on the mandrel of the <b>installation</b> (<b>cutting</b> speed). During treating, the part experiences significant static and dynamic loads. The tension can lead to inadmissible deflection of the mandrel to secure the part, uneven treatment of its complex surfaces and defects. The performed calculations showed that in polishing the surfaces of parts of a complex, load profile and deflections on the workpiece and the mandrel are within the permissible values. Discussion and Conclusions: The presented method provides stable qualitative and productive treatment of the complex surfaces. The findings from this study contribute to the current technology of metal processing...|$|R
500|$|Many {{other changes}} were made to Dunderberg while she was under {{construction}} and significantly contributed to her delays in completion. The {{most important of these}} was the eventual elimination of her turrets which began in October 1863 when Webb wrote to Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, saying that he concurred with the General Superintendent of Ironclads, Rear Admiral Francis Gregory's suggestion that the [...] "turrets be dispensed with and the casemate lengthened to accommodate an additional number of guns" [...] Welles did not approve the change until September 1864 when he authorized an armament of four 15-inch and twelve 11-inch guns in the casemate. This was extended by [...] to an approximate overall length of [...] so that it now covered the aft magazine and shell room. It was provided with a total of 22 gun ports, six on each broadside, two on each corner and one each facing the bow and stern. The design of the gun ports was another issue that took years to resolve. They were originally sized for the 11-inch Dahlgren gun with a height of , but this was inadequate to allow the guns to fully elevate as experience with [...] proved. The mounting of the much larger 15-inch Dahlgren gun in the casemate further complicated the design of the gun ports, especially since the design for their carriages was not even finished until May 1866. The design of the gunport itself was revised {{in the second half of}} 1865 to reduce the chance of projectiles entering them; the new design was roughly hourglass shaped and narrower in the middle of the casemate than on either the inside or the outside of the gun port. All of these changes to the gun ports delayed the completion of the casemate's woodwork as well as the <b>cutting</b> and <b>installation</b> of the casemate armor. The angle of the casemate was also changed from the original very shallow 35° from the horizontal to an angle of 60° after Rear Admiral Joseph Smith, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, noted that it would be very difficult to work the guns at such an angle. The deletion of the turrets also required a redesign of the conning tower as Webb had intended to mount it on top of the fore turret. A copy of that used by the [...] monitors was installed between the funnel and the foremast during August 1866.|$|R
