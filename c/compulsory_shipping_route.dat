40|$|A {{systematic}} {{design for a}} liner shipping network was addressed. Many practical features in real-world operations, including multiple types of containers, container transshipment operations, empty container repositioning, origin-to-destination transit time constraints, consistent services with the current network, and joint services with other liner shipping companies, were considered. Given a set of candidate <b>ship</b> <b>routes,</b> some of these routes had to be used, {{and the use of}} others was optional. A mixed-integer linear programming model was proposed for the selection of optional <b>ship</b> <b>routes.</b> The solution of this model provided the laden and empty container flow on the selected <b>ship</b> <b>routes.</b> On the basis of the results of this model, techniques were proposed for refining <b>ship</b> <b>routes</b> by changing existing routes, designing new routes, and removing some routes. A large-scale numerical test based on the global shipping network of a liner shipping company, consisting of 166 ports, was performed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new risk evaluation model for evaluating the navigation safety zone for an entire <b>ship</b> <b>route.</b> This model considers a new algorithm to determine the navigational safety zone in real-time, and also takes the navigation officers’ perception while navigating a ship into consideration. The risk quantification has been developed using a questionnaire and incorporated into the new model. A simulation was carried out for the Osaka bay area in order to verify {{the usefulness of the}} proposed model. A new approach was employed to monitor the level of navigation safety along a <b>ship</b> <b>route.</b> The entire <b>ship</b> <b>route</b> is divided into small sections as a gridded matrix. The level of navigation safety can be quantified by means of a safety index {{on the basis of the}} ship’s navigation data within a specified distance range. The results show that the comparison between risks identified for different sections across the entire <b>ship</b> <b>route</b> is easy, which helps determine the navigational safety zone quickly. This model is expected to be able to serve as a new tool for managing safety throughout an entire <b>ship</b> <b>route</b> area in real-time in order to support the port safety authority or vessel traffic service center...|$|R

50|$|Shipping {{accidents}} {{continue to}} be perceived as a threat, as several commercial <b>shipping</b> <b>routes</b> pass through the Great Barrier Reef. The GBRMPA estimates that about 6000 vessels greater than 50 metres (164 ft) in length use the Great Barrier Reef as a route. From 1985 to 2001, 11 collisions and 20 groundings occurred along the Great Barrier Reef <b>shipping</b> <b>route,</b> with human error identified as the leading cause of shipping accidents.|$|R

This <b>shipping</b> <b>route</b> is within the BIMP-EAGA agreement and expected to boost Indonesia-Philippines trade relations.|$|R
40|$|Ship {{structures}} {{will always}} be subjected to and suffer from fatigue damage and fracture. However, we can become better at utilising the materials and the structures and operating them more wisely, leading to less maintenance, extended service life, and enhanced safety. In this study, a fatigue model useful for <b>ship</b> <b>routeing</b> is presented. Similar to <b>ship</b> <b>routeing</b> design for ETA and fuel reduction, the objective here is to demonstrate the possibility and benefits of <b>ship</b> <b>route</b> planning leading to a reduction of fatigue damage accumulation. In the context of <b>ship</b> fatigue <b>route</b> planning, uncertainty analysis in fatigue assessments of container ships is discussed. The proposed ship routing fatigue model is employed by case studies on two container vessels to illustrate the possible benefits to the fatigue safety of ship structures. Sea environments in the application are obtained from hindcast wave data and a spatio-temporal wave model. The {{results show that the}} fatigue damage of the studied container ship structures can be decreased by more than 50 % if the awareness and knowledge of <b>ship</b> fatigue <b>route</b> planning is employed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies network {{design in}} {{container}} liner shipping {{by concentrating on}} four research questions: -	How were operational patterns deployed in route design? -	How was container shipping network developed? -	How efficient were fleet expansion and mega vessel deployment? -	How do operational factors influence on route design? Question 1 analyses characteristics of <b>shipping</b> <b>routes,</b> a basis component of shipping operation. Question 2 deals with shipping network, which {{is a combination of}} various <b>shipping</b> <b>routes.</b> Question 3 takes account of the deployment of vessel fleet on the shipping system. The first three questions are carried out by conducting empirical researches to investigate strategies of shipping lines in network design.
