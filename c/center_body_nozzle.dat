40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{a description of}} the configuration and operating characteristics of a porous <b>center</b> <b>body</b> plug <b>nozzle</b> jet noise suppressor that provides shock free flow over a wide range of nozzle pressure ratios. The elimination of the 'shock associated noise' and 'screeching' is accomplished by equalization of pressure along the jet axis. Because of the geometrical features of the porous plug nozzle, shear noise reductions are also observed at all subsonic and supersonic flow conditions tested. Additional benefits are the localization of the noise sources in the flow and the reduction of the spatial scale {{of the structure of the}} jet flow, which enhance the performance of an acoustic shield or baffle...|$|R

40|$|The ACES Program {{began the}} {{investigation}} of regeneratively cooled ramjet engines for propelling aircraft at Mach 6 to 8 flight regimes while collecting and processing air for later use as oxidizer in rocket propulsion into an orbit flight mode. The Marquardt Company had as its prime task the design and demonstration of a ramjet capable of steady state operating using hydrogen as the regenerative coolant and with fuel flow limited to a theta = 1. Marquardt progressed from shell type combustors to advanced tubular combustion chambers in direct connect test rigs. The first tests were made with water cooled <b>center</b> <b>bodies</b> and plug <b>nozzles</b> using a pebble bed air heater to simulate flight air temperature. Later tests were made on completely H 2 cooled flight weight V/G assemblies direct connected to a SUE burner heater. Design studies were also conducted on integrated systems for take-off capability using offset turbojets connected to 2 -D or axisymmetric inlets. An 18 inch hypersonic ramjet evaluation scale model was designed based on the hot test results using a fully V/G inlet and exit nozzle. This thruster would provide 25000 lbs. of thrust with an estimated weight of 250 lbs. A V/G inlet would also incorporate an inlet seal for possible take-off thrust by rocket operation. Hypersonic ramjet construction features and chamber thrust development are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional wedge nozzle {{performance}} characteristics were investigated {{in a series}} of wind-tunnel tests. An isolated single-engine/nozzle model was used to study the effects of internal expansion area ratio, aftbody cowl boattail angle, and wedge length. An integrated twin-engine/nozzle model, tested with and without empenage surfaces, included cruise, acceleration, thrust vectoring and thrust reversing nozzle operating modes. Results indicate that the thrust-minus-aftbody drag performance of the twin two-dimensional nozzle integration is significantly higher, for speeds greater than Mach 0. 8, than the performance achieved with twin axisymmetric nozzle installations. Significant jet-induced lift was obtained on an aft-mounted lifting surface using a cambered wedge <b>center</b> <b>body</b> to vector thrust.

40|$|A {{new concept}} for a {{scramjet}} engine design was presented. The inlet transformed a rectangular shaped capture stream into {{a cross section}} which was almost circular in shape at the inlet throat or combustor entrance. The inlet inner surface was designed by the method of streamline tracing. The {{high pressure and temperature}} regions of the combustor were almost circular in shape and thus the benefits of hoop stresses in relation to structural weight could be utilized to reduce combustor and engine weights. The engine had a <b>center</b> <b>body</b> consisting of a 20 deg included angle cone, followed by a constant diameter cylinder. Fuel injection struts were arranged in a radial array and were swept 54 deg from the <b>center</b> <b>body</b> to the inlet inner surface and had values of length to maximum average thickness between 5. 6 and 6. 6 which were felt to be structurally reasonable. Combustor wetted areas were shown to be less than those of the present fully rectangular engine concept...|$|R
40|$|In {{the primary}} {{experiment}} of the spin stabilized San Marco D/L spacecraft, the drag effects {{on a light}} spherical shell coupled to a relatively massive <b>center</b> <b>body</b> will be measured. To achieve the precise mass property control, the centroids of both the shell and the <b>center</b> <b>body</b> must coincide {{with each other and}} with the center of pressure of the shell. Precise spin balancing is needed for launch and orbital stability, and the deployable antennas need accurate alignment. Corrective measures, developed after the preliminary mass measurements showed flaws in the mass property control, are described in detail. Inertia booms and a yo-yo despin system were developed as add-on units, spin balance measurements about all three geometric axes were used to define weight minimized correction within the outer shell envelope, and boom tip mass differentials were optimized for the most favorable inertia ratio margin achievable within the mission weight constraints. The weight versus orbital lifetime trade-offs were also considered...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} for incorporating distributed aerodynamic normal forces and aeroelastic coupling effects into a stability analysis {{model of a}} launch vehicle is presented. The formulation augments the linear state-space launch vehicle plant dynamics that are compactly derived as a system of coupled linear differential equations representing small angular and translational perturbations of the rigid <b>body,</b> <b>nozzle,</b> and sloshing propellant coupled with normal vibration {{of a set of}} orthogonal modes. The interaction of generalized forces due to aeroelastic coupling and thrust can be expressed as a set of augmenting non-diagonal stiffness and damping matrices in modal coordinates with no penalty on system order. While the eigenvalues of the structural response in the presence of thrust and aeroelastic forcing can be predicted at a given flight condition independent of the remaining degrees of freedom, the coupled model provides confidence in closed-loop stability in the presence of rigid-body, slosh, and actuator dynamics. Simulation results are presented that characterize the coupled dynamic response of the Ares I launch vehicle and the impact of aeroelasticity on control system stability margins...|$|R
