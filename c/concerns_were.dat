40|$|In {{the field}} of {{advanced}} separation of concerns, most researches focus on programming levels. On the other hand, many analysis/design techniques utilize separation of <b>concerns,</b> as it <b>is</b> {{one of the common}} techniques in the software engineering field. Though the utilization of these <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> slightly different from that in programming level techniques dealing with advanced separation of <b>concerns,</b> it <b>is</b> important to recognize what kinds of <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> used in the analysis/design field, and to clarify the current issues. In this paper, we analyze the concerns in the analysis/design field, observe the current status of separation of concerns, and discuss issues and future research directions. 1. CONCERNS IN ANALYSIS/DESIGN TECHNIQUES Separation of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> one of the basic techniques in software engineering fields, and many analysis/design techniques apply the technique. Though their utilization of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> not as same as that of advanced separation of <b>concerns</b> [2][3], it <b>is</b> important to analyze the existing concerns and clarify the difference for further researches.

Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

There <b>were</b> three main <b>concerns</b> regarding HIV/AIDS within the transgender community at this time. The first <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> HIV/AIDS equating to stigmatization and shame. As one of the registrants said, the stigma that existed during this time made the participant feel “dirty… like...a lower minority than most minorities” (19). Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> that HIV/AIDS would interfere with individuals seeking sexreassignment surgery.

40|$|A {{software}} modification task often addresses several <b>concerns.</b> A <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> anything a stakeholder {{may want}} to consider as a conceptual unit, including features, nonfunctional requirements, and design idioms. In many cases, the source code implementing a <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> not encapsulated in a single programming language module, and is instead scattered and tangled throughout a system. Inadequate separation of concerns increases the difficulty of evolving software in a correct and costeffective manner. To make it easier to modify <b>concerns</b> that <b>are</b> not well modularized, we propose an approach in which the implementation of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> documented in artifacts, called concern graphs. <b>Concern</b> graphs <b>are</b> abstract models that describe which parts of the source code are relevant to different concerns. We present a formal model for concern graphs and the tool support we developed to enable software developers to create and use concern graphs during software evolution tasks. We report on five empirical studies, providing evidence that concern graphs support views and operations that facilitate the task of modifying the code implementing scattered <b>concerns,</b> <b>are</b> costeffectiv...|$|R

Toriyama explained that he had Goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes would be easier, even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. Torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during the series, with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not grow up.

40|$|Separation of <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> a {{fundamental}} principle of software engineering. Of course, <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> modeled {{in a variety}} of guises in contemporary software development, but the modeling approaches used typically depend on the development method, development stage, artifact formalism, and other project-specific factors. Concerns in various representations are also the focus of aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) techniques. However, <b>concerns</b> as such <b>are</b> still not modeled independently, and concernmodeling is still not a distinguished activity in software development. In this chapter we argue that <b>concerns</b> must <b>be</b> first-class entities and <b>concern</b> modeling must <b>be</b> a first-class activity in AOSD. That <b>is,</b> <b>concern</b> modeling should <b>be</b> an explicit and integral part of AOSD methods, and <b>concerns</b> should <b>be</b> modeled in their own appropriate formalisms, separately from their representations in requirements, design, code, and other software artifacts.
