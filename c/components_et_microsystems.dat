40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{new method}} for characterizing the newborn heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) is proposed. The central of the method is the newly proposed technique for instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation specifically designed for nonstationary multicomponent signals such as HRV. The new method attempts to characterize the newborn HRV using features extracted from the time–frequency (TF) domain of the signal. These features comprise the IF, the instantaneous bandwidth (IB) and instantaneous energy (IE) of the different TF components of the HRV. Applied to the HRV of both normal and seizure-suffering newborns, this method clearly reveals {{the locations of the}} spectral peaks and their time-varying nature. The total energy of HRV <b>components,</b> <b>ET</b> and ratio of energy concentrated in the low-frequency (LF) to that in high-frequency (HF) components {{have been shown to be}} significant features in identifying the HRV of newborn with seizures...|$|R

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} for estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) flux at small {{spatial and temporal}} scales. The method involves simultaneous measurement of soil moisture (SM) profiles and water table heads along transects flow paths. The method has been applied in a shallow water table field site in West-Central Florida for data collected from January 2002 through June 2004. Capacitance shift type moisture sensors were used for this research, placed at variable depth intervals starting at approximately 4 in. (10 cm) below land surface and extending well below the seasonal low water table depth of 59 in. (1. 5 m). Vegetation included grassland and wetland forested flatwoods. The approach includes the ability to resolve multiple <b>ET</b> <b>components</b> including shallow and deep vadose zone, surface interception capture and depression storage <b>ET.</b> Other <b>components</b> of the water budget including infiltration, total and saturation rainfall excess runoff, net runoff, changes in storage and lateral groundwater flows are also derived from the approach. One shortcoming of the method is the reliance on open pan or other potential ET estimation techniques when the water table is at or near land surface. Results are compared with values derived for the two vegetative covers from micrometeorological and Bowen ratio methods. Advantages of the SM method include resolving <b>component</b> <b>ET...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{immunohistochemical}} staining pattern of some mismatch repair (MMR) system proteins in endometriotic tissue (ET) and eutopic endometrium. Methods: This was a retrospective study {{conducted at the}} Pathology and Obstetrics and Gynecology Departments of the Udine University Hospital. We analyzed 528 samples obtained from 246 patients affected by endometriosis and 71 samples from 71 patients with normal endometrium. A tissue microarray model was {{used to analyze the}} immunohistochemical expression of MMR system proteins. Results: Significant loss of MMR proteins was found in the stromal <b>component</b> of <b>ETs.</b> We found MSH 2 to be expressed at a higher level than any other MMR system proteins in eutopic endometrium and ETs, to be significantly correlated to Ki- 67 expression in both stromal and glandular <b>components</b> of <b>ETs,</b> and to be expressed at a significantly higher level in ETs than in eutopic endometrium. When considering the subgroup of endometriosis with high recurrence rate and glandular cytoplasmic staining for aurora A kinase, we found MMR proteins expressed at a significantly higher level in these ETs than in other ETs and eutopic endometrium of unaffected women. Conclusions: We found significant loss of MMR proteins (known to be associated with microsatellite instability) in the stromal <b>component</b> of <b>ETs.</b> The group of ETs with glandular cytoplasmic staining for aurora A kinase had higher MMR protein expression, suggesting an increased activity of this system.
