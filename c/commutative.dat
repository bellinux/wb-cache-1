5|$|An abelian group, or <b>commutative</b> {{group is}} a group whose group {{operation}} is <b>commutative.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{far-reaching}} {{generalization of}} addition of natural numbers is {{the addition of}} ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition of natural numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal numbers is not <b>commutative.</b> Addition of cardinal numbers, however, is a <b>commutative</b> operation {{closely related to the}} disjoint union operation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{manner in}} which the proofs might be {{undermined}} is if 1−0.999... simply does not exist, because subtraction is not always possible. Mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include <b>commutative</b> semigroups, <b>commutative</b> monoids and semirings. Richman considers two such systems, designed so that 0.999... < 1.|$|E
5|$|<b>Commutative</b> algebra makes great use of {{rings of}} polynomials {{in one or}} several variables, {{introduced}} above. Their multiplication is both <b>commutative</b> and associative. These rings and their quotients {{form the basis of}} algebraic geometry, because they are rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|In a field both {{addition}} and multiplication are <b>commutative.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} epoch (1927–35), Noether focused on noncommutative algebra, linear transformations, and <b>commutative</b> number fields.|$|E
5|$|More such {{examples}} may {{be found}} in <b>Commutative</b> non-associative magmas.|$|E
5|$|Noether's paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains, 1921), is the {{foundation}} of general <b>commutative</b> ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a <b>commutative</b> ring. Before her paper, most results in <b>commutative</b> algebra were restricted to special examples of <b>commutative</b> rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, Noetherian ring, to describe this property. A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
5|$|Putting on socks {{resembles a}} <b>commutative</b> {{operation}} since which sock {{is put on}} first is unimportant. Either way, the result (having both socks on), is the same. In contrast, putting on underwear and trousers is not <b>commutative.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{integers}} form a <b>commutative</b> ring whose {{elements are}} the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers {{can be added}} or multiplied, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is <b>commutative,</b> i.e., for any elements a and b in the ring, a+b = b+a. The second operation, multiplication, also is <b>commutative,</b> but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that a combined with b might be different from b combined with a. Examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer a such that 3×a=1.|$|E
5|$|Familiar {{properties}} of numbers extend to these operations of matrices: for example, addition is <b>commutative,</b> that is, the matrix sum {{does not depend}} on the order of the summands: A+B=B+A.|$|E
5|$|Further {{examples}} of <b>commutative</b> binary operations include addition and multiplication of complex numbers, addition and scalar multiplication of vectors, and intersection and union of sets.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a ring R. Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M(n, R) of all square n-by-n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R-module R'n. If the ring R is <b>commutative,</b> that is, its multiplication is <b>commutative,</b> then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square matrices over a <b>commutative</b> ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a field F, where every nonzero element is invertible. Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E
5|$|This {{recursive}} {{formulation of}} addition {{was developed by}} Dedekind as early as 1854, and he would expand upon it in the following decades. He proved the associative and <b>commutative</b> properties, among others, through mathematical induction.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a <b>commutative</b> ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E
5|$|Lasker made {{contributions}} {{to the development of}} other games. He was a first-class contract bridge player and wrote about bridge and other games, including Go and his own invention, Lasca. His books about games presented a problem that is still considered notable in the mathematical analysis of card games. Lasker was also a research mathematician who was known for his {{contributions to}} <b>commutative</b> algebra, which included proving the primary decomposition of the ideals of polynomial rings. On the other hand, his philosophical works and a drama that he co-wrote received little attention.|$|E
5|$|The {{integers}} {{have additional}} properties {{which do not}} generalize to all <b>commutative</b> rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.|$|E
25|$|In ring theory, {{a branch}} of {{abstract}} algebra, a <b>commutative</b> ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation is <b>commutative.</b> The study of <b>commutative</b> rings is called <b>commutative</b> algebra. Complementarily, noncommutative algebra {{is the study of}} noncommutative rings where multiplication is not or is not required to be <b>commutative.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Commutative</b> algebra is {{the branch}} of algebra that studies <b>commutative</b> rings, their ideals, and modules over such rings. Both {{algebraic}} geometry and algebraic number theory build on <b>commutative</b> algebra. Prominent examples of <b>commutative</b> rings include polynomial rings, rings of algebraic integers, including the ordinary integers , and p-adic integers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Commutative</b> algebra, {{the study}} of <b>commutative</b> rings.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes both {{meanings}} {{exist for}} the same qualifier, as in the sentence: <b>Commutative</b> algebra {{is the study of}} <b>commutative</b> rings, which are <b>commutative</b> algebras over the integers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Commutative</b> {{rings are}} much better {{understood}} than noncommutative ones. Algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory, which provide many natural examples of <b>commutative</b> rings, have driven much {{of the development of}} <b>commutative</b> ring theory, which is now, under the name of <b>commutative</b> algebra, a major area of modern mathematics. Because these three fields (algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and <b>commutative</b> algebra) are so intimately connected it is usually difficult and meaningless to decide which field a particular result belongs to. For example, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is a theorem which is fundamental for algebraic geometry, and is stated and proved in terms of <b>commutative</b> algebra. Similarly, Fermat's last theorem is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, which is a part of <b>commutative</b> algebra, but its proof involves deep results of both algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.|$|E
25|$|The ring of {{matrices}} is not <b>commutative,</b> since matrix multiplication {{fails to}} be <b>commutative.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>commutative</b> rings, {{one does not have}} to {{distinguish}} between left, right and two-sided ideals: a <b>commutative</b> ring is local if and only if it has a unique maximal ideal.|$|E
25|$|A simplicial <b>commutative</b> ring is a simplicial {{object in}} the {{category}} of <b>commutative</b> rings. They are building blocks for (connective) derived algebraic geometry. A closely related but more general notion is that of E∞-ring.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{following}} notions also exist for not necessarily <b>commutative</b> rings, but the definitions and properties are usually more complicated. For example, all ideals in a <b>commutative</b> ring are automatically two-sided, which simplifies the situation considerably.|$|E
25|$|A {{field is}} a <b>commutative</b> ring where every non-zero element a is invertible; i.e., has a multiplicative inverse b such that a ⋅ b = 1. Therefore, by definition, any field is a <b>commutative</b> ring. The rational, real and complex numbers form fields.|$|E
25|$|Some number {{systems that}} are not {{included}} in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called hypercomplex numbers. They include the quaternions H, introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, in which multiplication is not <b>commutative,</b> the octonions, in which multiplication is not associative in addition to not being <b>commutative,</b> and the sedenions, in which multiplication is not alternative, neither associative nor <b>commutative.</b>|$|E
25|$|If R is a left-noetherian ring, {{then the}} {{category}} of finitely generated left modules over R is abelian. In particular, {{the category of}} finitely generated modules over a noetherian <b>commutative</b> ring is abelian; in this way, abelian categories show up in <b>commutative</b> algebra.|$|E
25|$|Two rings R, S {{are said}} to be Morita {{equivalent}} if the category of left modules over R is equivalent to the category of left modules over S. In fact, two <b>commutative</b> rings which are Morita equivalent must be isomorphic, so the notion does not add anything new to the category of <b>commutative</b> rings. However, <b>commutative</b> rings can be Morita equivalent to noncommutative rings, so Morita equivalence is coarser than isomorphism. Morita equivalence is especially important in algebraic topology and functional analysis.|$|E
