60|$|After that interlude, {{when the}} streets of the Advanced Vaudeville, which we know as New York, begin again and {{continue}} till the Chasers come in late May, there will be many other sorts of weather, but none so characteristic of her. There will be the sort of weather toward the end of January, when really it seems as if nothing else could console him for the intolerable freezing and thawing, the snow upon snow, the rain upon rain, the winds that soak him and the winds that shrivel him, and the suns that mock him from a subtropic sky through subarctic air. We foresee him then settling into his arm-chair, while the wind whistles as naturally as the wind in the theatre around the angles of his lofty flat, and drives the snow of the shredded paper through the air or beats it in soft clots against the pane. He turns our page, and as he catches our vague drift, before yielding himself wholly to its allure, he questions, as readers like to do, whether the writer is altogether right in his contention that the mid-autumnal moment is the most <b>characteristic</b> <b>moment</b> of the New York year. Is not the mid-winter moment yet more characteristic? He conjures up, in the rich content of his indoor remoteness, the vision of the vile street below his flat, banked high with the garnered heaps of filthy snow, which alternately freeze and thaw, which the rain does not wash nor the wind blow away, and which the shredded-paper flakes are now drifting higher. He sees the foot-passers struggling under their umbrellas toward the avenues where the reluctant trolleys pause jarringly for them, and the elevated trains roar along the trestle overhead; where the saloon winks a wicked eye on every corner; where the signs of the whiskeys and actresses flare through the thickened night; and the cab tilts and rocks across the trolley rails, and the crowds of hotel-sojourners seek the shelter of the theatres, and all is bleak and wet and squalid. In more respectful vision he beholds the darkened mansions of the richest and best, who have already fled the scene of their brief winter revel and are forcing the spring in their Floridas, their Egypts, their Rivieras. He himself remains midway between the last fall and the next spring; and perhaps he decides against the writer, as the perverse reader sometimes will, and holds that this hour of suspense and misgiving is the supreme, the duodecimal hour of the metropolitan dial. He may be right; who knows? New York's hours are all characteristic; and the hour whose mystical quality we have been trying to intimate is already past, and we must wait another year before we can put it to the test again; wait till the trees once more stand perfectly still: yellow, yellowish-green, crimson, russet, and the wind comes up and blows them bare, and yet another summer is dead, and the mourners, the ghosts, the revenants have once more returned to town.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a new class}} of processes, called LG processes, defined as linear combinations of independent gamma processes. Their distributional and path-wise properties are explored by following their relation to polynomial and Dirichlet (B-) splines. In particular, it is shown that the density of an LG process can be expressed in terms of Dirichlet (B-) splines, introduced independently by Ignatov and Kaishev (1987, 1988, 1989 a,b) and Karlin et al. (1986). We further show that the well known variance-gamma (VG) process, introduced by Madan and Seneta (1990), and the Bilateral Gamma (BG) process, recently considered by Kuchler and Tappe (2008) are special cases of an LG process. Following this LG interpretation, we derive new (alternative) expressions for the VG and BG densities and consider their numerical properties. The LG process has two sets of parameters, the B-spline knots and their multiplicities, and offers further flexibility in controlling the shape of the Levy density, compared to the VG and the BG processes. Such flexibility is often desirable in practice, which makes LG processes interesting for financial and insurance applications. Multivariate LG processes are also introduced and their relation to multivariate Dirichlet and simplex splines is established. Expressions for their joint density, the underlying LG-copula, the <b>characteristic,</b> <b>moment</b> and cumulant generating functions are given. A method for simulating LG sample paths is also proposed, based on the Dirichlet bridge sampling of Gamma processes, due to Kaishev and Dimitrova (2009). A method of moments for estimation of the LG parameters is also developed. Multivariate LG processes are shown to provide a competitive alternative in modelling dependence, compared to the various multivariate generalizations of the VG process, proposed in the literature. Application of multivariate LG processes in modelling the joint dynamics of multiple exchange rates is also considered...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{over three}} decades of active research, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I (HIV- 1) {{represents}} a pressing and ongoing challenge to our ability to understand complex pathogens that threaten human health at global scale. This stems {{in part from the}} highly dynamic and multi-scale lifecycle of the virus, which is reflected in the necessity for multi-drug cocktails to suppress viral replication. A fundamental aspect of the HIV lifecycle is the insertion or integration across a plethora of sites in the human genome. From these sites of integration, the viral promoter coordinates multiple inputs from the cellular signaling environment, the local genetic and epigenetic context, and a virally encoded feedback circuit. Through integration of these inputs via a poorly understood transfer function, the viral promoter regulates the temporal probability of the expression of viral genes and ultimately the kinetics of the viral lifecycle. The HIV promoter, the long terminal repeat (LTR), is composed of a core TATA promoter and a large cis acting enhancer. Furthermore, two well-positioned nucleosomes form the basic epigenetic regulatory structures that regulate LTR output. These features are highly similar to endogenous mammalian promoters. Therefore, studies of the LTR can reveal insights relevant to HIV biology as well as mammalian gene control. HIV represents a highly attractive model system to apply large-scale experimental and computational analysis to systematically study the role of promoter architecture and genomic context in transcriptional regulation. Previous work demonstrated that the LTR operates in a stochastic regime, which results in large cell-to-cell differences in gene expression within clonal populations. In HIV model systems and natural circuits, {{it has been shown that}} such heterogeneity or noise can have dramatic phenotypic consequences. However, how such noise is related to the features of promoters, the local genomic context, and their interaction with genetic circuits and cell biology, is poorly understood. Here using combined large-scale experimental and computational analysis we develop systems to isolate and study the effects of viral integration positions, promoter cis acting architecture, transcriptional feedback and post-transcriptional processes on viral gene expression noise. Specifically, by using systematic experimental analysis of single integration clones coupled with computational modeling and statistical inference, we are able to link LTR gene expression noise to dynamic nucleosome occupancy. Furthermore, we develop a method to generate highly diverse combinatoric promoters that will enable systematic study of the LTR structure-function relationship. Additionally, we develop quantitative strategies to cluster highly heterogeneous feedback distributions and reveal <b>characteristic</b> <b>moment</b> scaling relationships. Lastly, using simulations and analysis of mRNA localization using RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that slow mRNA export can function as a low-pass filter to buffer the cytoplasm from the effects of noisy transcription. Together, these efforts reveal molecular and cellular processes underlying noisy gene expression. Furthermore, we develop novel systems level approaches and tools for the study of complexity in eukaryotic gene control...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} further understand the LFE source process, the role LFEs play in generating slow slip, and {{the utility of}} using LFEs to examine plate interface structure. The work involves the creation and investigation of a 2 -year-long catalog of low-frequency earthquakes beneath the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. In the first chapter, we calculate the seismic moments for 34, 264 low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) beneath the Olympic Peninsula, WA. LFE moments range from 1. 4 × 1010 – 1. 9 × 1012 N-m (MW= 0. 7 - 2. 1). While regular earthquakes follow a power-law moment-frequency distribution with a b-value near 1 (the number of events increases {{by a factor of}} 10 for each unit increase in MW), we find that while for large LFEs the b-value is ~ 6, for small LFEs it is < 1. The magnitude-frequency distribution for all LFEs is best fit by an exponential distribution with a mean seismic moment (<b>characteristic</b> <b>moment)</b> of 2. 0 × 1011 N-m. The moment-frequency distributions for each of the 43 LFE families, or spots on the plate interface where LFEs repeat, can also be fit by exponential distributions. An exponential moment-frequency distribution implies a scale-limited source process. We consider two end-member models where LFE moment is limited by (1) the amount of slip or (2) slip area. We favor the area-limited model. Based on the observed exponential distribution of LFE moment and geodetically observed total slip we estimate that the total area that slips within an LFE family has a diameter of 300 m. Assuming an area-limited model, we estimate the slips, sub-patch diameters, stress drops, and slip rates for LFEs during ETS events. We allow for LFEs to rupture smaller sub-patches within the LFE family patch. Models with 1 - 10 sub-patches produce slips of 0. 1 - 1 mm, sub-patch diameters of 80 - 275 m, and stress drops of 30 - 1000 kPa. While one sub-patch is often assumed, we believe 3 - 10 sub-patches are more likely. In the second chapter, using high-resolution relative low-frequency earthquake (LFE) locations, we calculate the patch areas (Ap) of LFE families. During Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events, we define AT as the area that slips during LFEs and ST as the total amount of summed LFE slip. Using observed and calculated values for AP, AT and ST we evaluate two end- member models for LFE slip within an LFE family patch (models 2 and 3 from chapter 1). In the ductile matrix model (model 3), LFEs produce 100 % of the observed ETS slip (SETS) in distinct sub-patches (i. e., AT<<AP). In the connected patch model (model 2), AT=AP, but ST<<SETS. LFEs cluster into 45 LFE families. Spatial gaps (~ 10 - 20 km) between LFE family clusters and smaller gaps within LFE family clusters serve as evidence that LFE slip is heterogeneous on multiple spatial scales. We find that LFE slip only accounts for ~ 0. 2 % of the slip within the slow slip zone. There are downdip trends in the characteristic (mean) moment and in the number of LFEs during both ETS events (only) and the entire ETS cycle (Mc,ETS and NT,ETS and Mc,all and NT,all respectively). During ETS, Mc decreases with downdip distance but NT does not change. Over the entire ETS cycle, Mc decreases with downdip distance, but NT increases. These observations indicate that downdip LFE slip occurs through a larger number (800 - 1200) of small LFEs, while updip LFE slip occurs primarily during ETS events through a smaller number (200 - 600) of larger LFEs. This could indicate that the plate interface is stronger and has a higher stress threshold updip. In the third chapter, we use high-precision, relative low-frequency earthquake (LFE) locations for LFEs beneath the Olympic Peninsula, WA to constrain the depth, geometry, and thickness of the plate interface. LFE depths correspond most closely with the McCrory et al. (2012) plate model, but vary from that smooth model along strike. The latter observation indicates that the actual plate interface is notably rougher and more complex than smooth plate models. Our LFEs lie directly above low-velocity zone (LVZ) and approximately 5 km above intraslab earthquakes. This supports the proposal of Bostock (2013), that the LVZ comprises the upper oceanic crust and that fluids are responsible for the velocity contrast across the LVZ and likely play a large role in generating slow slip and LFEs. Within each of our LFE families, LFEs group into tight clusters around the family centroid. The width of these clusters in the depth direction, which is an indicator of the thickness of slow slip deformation on the plate interface, is 130 to 340 meters...|$|E
