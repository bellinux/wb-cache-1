5|$|L. decemlineata is {{an iconic}} species {{and has been}} used as an image on stamps because of its {{association}} with the recent history of both North America and Europe. For example, in 1956, Romania issued a set of four stamps <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> campaign against insect pests and it was featured on a 1967 stamp issued in Austria. The beetle also appeared on stamps issued in Benin, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, and Mozambique.|$|E

25|$|The cause {{has long}} been {{supported}} beyond the victim nations, and associations like Amnesty International are campaigning in countries where governments have yet to support the cause, like in Australia, or New Zealand. Support in the United States continues to grow, particularly after the United States House of Representatives House Resolution 121 was passed on July 30, 2007, asking the Japanese government to redress the situation and to incorporate internationally accepted actual historical facts about this program into their educational system. In July 2012, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a strong advocate of the cause, denounced {{the use of the}} euphemism 'comfort women' for what should be referred to as 'enforced sex slaves'. The Obama Administration also addressed the need for Japan to do more to address the issue.

25|$|Having {{lived in}} the steel town of Wheeling, West Virginia, Davis had {{first-hand}} experience with the controversies and hardships associated with industrialism. She utilizes the theme of industrialism in Life in the Iron Mills by <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dark and dismal setting of the iron mills. She not only provides vivid imagery of the dismal landscape, but imagery {{of the working class}} as well. By exploring the effects of the iron mills on its inhabitants, Davis is able to depict her own concerns and frustrations associated with the marginalization of the working class. Davis's depiction of the daily routines of the laboring class is a common theme throughout her writing, and most importantly serves the purpose of unveiling the maltreatment of such individuals. Her goal in relating the physical and mental starvation that plagues the inhabitants of these mills is to urge her audience to form spiritual solutions to these issues rather than social solutions.|$|E
25|$|Associated Press {{reported}} that {{in response to the}} costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking. Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations. The size of regulatory compliance teams has grown. The Heritage Foundation, <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new ability of borrowers to sue lenders for misjudging their ability to repay a loan, predicted that smaller lenders would be forced to exit the mortgage market due to increased risk. One study has shown that smaller banks have been hurt by the regulations of the Dodd–Frank Act. Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best but highly likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on small banks, even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions.|$|E

Mitchell would head {{an investigation into}} past steroid use by Major League Baseball players, including San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds. Mitchell was appointed by baseball commissioner Bud Selig {{in the wake of}} controversy over the book Game of Shadows, which chronicles alleged extensive use of performance-enhancing drugs, including several different types of steroids and human growth hormones Bonds allegedly had taken. Selig did not refer to Bonds by name in announcing the investigation, and many past and present players will be investigated. Mitchell took on a role similar to that of John Dowd, who investigated Pete Rose's alleged gambling in the late 1980s. However, Selig acknowledged that the book, by way of <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> issue, was in part responsible for the league's decision to commission an independent investigation. A report of the investigation released on December 13, 2007 named more than 80 former and current baseball players.|$|E
25|$|Himself arrested shortly afterward, Negoiţescu {{was made}} {{subject to a}} humiliating and violent interrogation, {{at the end of}} which he again {{contemplated}} suicide. He was also threatened with prosecution on grounds of breaking Article 200, a penal code section which criminalized homosexual relationships. The Securitate men were by then interested in the homosexual relationship between Negoiţescu and young poet Petru Romoşan, who was also taken into custody at the time, and whom various commentators of the incidents have since identified as the person secretly furnishing information on the critic's personal life. Several other men were detained as suspects, largely on charges of having had intercourse with Negoiţescu. The group, which Romoşan himself argues included some 30 people, notably included poet Marian Dopcea, at the time a student at the University of Bucharest. The implications of Negoiţescu's arrest also made him the target of interest in the Western world governments, representatives of which followed the case with concern. At the same time, the communist regime was forcefully expelling Goma and Ion Vianu, the latter of whom had joined the public protest by <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of involuntary commitment as a political weapon.|$|E
25|$|Two species {{similar to}} Bifrenaria, but {{that showed a}} highly salient claw {{at the base of}} the {{labellum}} and lateral lobes abruptly divided were then classified under this genus. In 1914, Rudolf Schlechter suggested they should be classified under the genus Lindleyella, with Lindley's Bifrenaria aurantiaca (which presented the mentioned differences) as the type. However this genus name was already occupied (It is a synonym of Lindleya, in the Rosaceae). Just thirty years later, in 1944, Frederico Carlos Hoehne, working on the first revision of genus Bifrenaria, corrected the suggestion of Schlechter. Hoehne initially proposed the genus Schlechterella for these species but, coincidentally, this name was also taken, this time by African Asclepiadaceae. Finally a genus with an available name in homage to Schlechter was erected in the very next issue of the journal, Rudolfiella, by which time the number of species had increased to seven. On this revision, besides Rudolfiella, Hoehne divided Bifrenaria into two genera, accepting Lindley's Stenocoryne but <b>calling</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existence of Rafinesque's Adipe, which should have nomenclatural priority, while also raising doubts about the identity of several described species. In 1990, Manfred Wolff formally resurrected the genus Adipe and transferred to it ten Bifrenaria species, besides the two already described by Rafinesque; his change was purely nomenclatural and he did not revisit the species.|$|E
