40|$|The Sunset {{semi-continuous}} carbon analyzer (SCCA) is {{an instrument}} widely used for carbonaceous aerosol measurement. Despite previous validation work, {{in this study}} we identified a new type of SCCA calculation discrepancy caused by the default multipoint baseline correction method. When exceeding a certain threshold carbon load, multipoint correction could cause significant total carbon (TC) underestimation. This calculation discrepancy was characterized for both sucrose and ambient samples, with two protocols based on IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments) (i. e., IMPshort and IMPlong) and one NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) -like protocol (rtNIOSH). For ambient samples, the IMPshort, IMPlong and rtNIOSH protocol underestimated 22, 36 and 12 % of TC, respectively, with the corresponding threshold being ~ 0, 20 and 25 μgC. For sucrose, however, such discrepancy was observed only with the IMPshort protocol, indicating the need of more refractory SCCA <b>calibration</b> <b>substance.</b> Although the calculation discrepancy could be largely reduced by the single-point baseline correction method, the instrumental blanks of single-point method were higher. The correction method proposed was to use multipoint-corrected data when below the determined threshold, and use single-point results when beyond that threshold. The effectiveness of this correction method was supported by correlation with optical data...|$|E

30|$|The other 16 {{substances}} were quantified with LC–MS/MS and {{samples were}} directly injected after gravitational phase separation. Since the LC system {{is equipped with}} a pre-column filter, remaining particles {{would not be able to}} enter the column and to produce false-positive results. For quantification, a calibration curve with nine different concentration levels from 0.025 to 10  µg L− 1 was generated. For analysis, an Agilent 1290 infinity LC coupled to an Agilent 6490 Triple Quadrupole was used. Separation was performed with an Agilent InfinityLab C 18 poroshell column (length 100  mm, 2.1  µm ID). For elution, water (with 0.1 % acetic acid and 0.01  mM ammonium acetate) and acetonitrile (ACN, with 0.1 % acetic acid) were used. The gradient elution looks as follows (with percentage of ACN): start with 2 %, stepwise increase to 80 % until 17  min, 100 % until 23  min, then again 2 % until 32  min. For the quantification of the samples from the batch experiments with either triclosan or diclofenac, two isocratic methods with 57 % ACN or 70 % ACN were used, respectively. For these measurements, specific calibration curves were generated, as well (concentration range from 0.5 to 250  µg L− 1 with seven <b>calibration</b> levels). <b>Substances</b> were ionized with an ESI source operated either in positive mode or negative mode.

40|$|Tylose gel is a {{commonly}} used test substance with thermophysical properties similar to meat. It {{is often used}} to test the accuracy of freezing or thawing time calculation methods or the performance of refrigeration equipment, and therefore an accurate knowledge of its thermal properties is essential. Use of inaccurate property data may invalidate any conclusion drawn from the tests. Thermal conductivity The following thermal conducivity data was measured by a guarded hot plate which has been corrected for the effect of edge errors and gap errors (Pham and Smith, 1986; Pham and Willix, 1989). This is a primary measurement method that does not depend on <b>calibration</b> against known <b>substance,</b> unlike, for example, the faster line source methods. These results were first reported by Pham and Willix (1990). In that paper it was pointed out that previous data by Bonacina and Comini (1971) probably led to erroneous conclusion on the accuracy of finite difference calculations by Cleland et al. (1982).

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the at least {{partially}} substitution of chrom tanning agents by production of leather. This will be achieved by extracting of natural tanning agents from the roots of local species of the Polygonaceae plant familiy. The research project has been conducted in cooperation with NIG GmbH Magdeburg (processing of raw material) and FILK gGmbH (testing the tanning agents on leather). The FH Anhalt cultivates the species Rheum, Reynoutria and Rumex and examines and describes the tanning substances in these plants using chemical-analytical methods. Results: a growth period {{of at least two}} years is necessary for plants to develop enough biomass and tanning agents. In Reynoutria the tanning substances are located in leaves which are easier to harvest. The leaves can be harvested several times in the year over a period of up to ten years. The tanning substances were studied using HPLC and DC. The concentration of the tanning substances in raw material determined by <b>calibration</b> with tanning <b>substances</b> from Quebracho was insufficient. The combination of HPLC with other separation techniques such as HPTLC will be more efficient in developing analytical method for the on-line observation of the raw material. Further investigations involving larger quantities of extracts are necessary in order to consolidate the results obtained so far. These investigations should be extended to include the species Reynoutria and Polygonum. Further investigations should concentrate on the production and utilisation of the different pigments found in the roots of Rheum and Rumex for use in heavy metal-free dyeing of leather and textiles.

40|$|Legg et al Discrepancies in the {{calibration}} {{of reaction}} rate analysers Many enzyme assays {{are linked to}} the formation or utilisation of NADH so that reaction rates can be monitored at 340 nm. The absorbance spectrum of naphthol green is sufficiently different from that of NADH to render <b>calibration</b> using this <b>substance</b> undesirable, and NADH or the particular chromophore used to monitor the reaction, e. g. p-nitrophenol, should be used. The new calibration procedure confirmed the extent of the disparity between the two instruments noted when performing enzyme analyses and supported the view that the problem was one of instrumentation, possibly electronic in origin. An electronic calibration procedure produced by the company was successful in bringing the instruments back into specification and cured the problem of the disparity between the 0. 05 and 0. 20 absorbance scales. Exactly what is accomplished when electronic calibration is carried out remains uncertain. Certainly such items as the ratio of the two absorbance scales and linearity across the recorder are correctly adjusted during this procedure, but {{the manner in which the}} photocell output is linked to true absorbance is not clear. In the light of the authors’ experience, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that electronic calibration merely succeeded in ensuring that both instruments investigated produced the same result. It may not ensure that the output from an instrument is linked to true absorbance. For this reason, a correction factor may still need to be applied to the results obtained after electronic and absorptiometric calibration has been carried out. It is suggested that results which are within + 5 % of the true absorbance need not be corrected, while instruments operating outside of these limits should have a correction factor applied until they can be serviced and the error corrected. This may well depend on the type of analysis being performed on the instrument. The calibration procedure outlined could be performed at intervals of about six months. It can be adapted to calibrate any other type of reaction rate analyser and has been " used successfully in calibrating both the AKES (MSE Scientifi...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to provide a}} better {{understanding}} of urea’s decomposition and byproduct formation in an SCR system on heavy trucks. In my experimental setup with TGA-DSC-FTIR (a combination of two thermal analysis methods and a method for gas phase detection), an FTIR method for urea in the gas phase was developed for the qualitative and quantitative determination of urea and its decomposition products.  Chemicals such as urea, biuret, cyanuric acid and melamine of p. a. quality were used in this method development. Beforehand, there was no FTIR method available to detect these substances; hence, the aim of this work was to develop an FTIR method to understand the degradation chain of urea.   The combination of TGA and DSC was used for analysis of different samples, where urea, biuret, cyanuric acid and melamine in varying amounts have been weighted in for various experiments in order to study the temperature at which a phase transition or reaction occurs, i. e. the temperature at which substances begin to melt, vaporize, decompose and react.  In combination with FTIR, information was obtained for the appearance of substances at various temperatures. With FTIR, {{we have been able to}} develop unique infrared spectra of substances and along with weight loss in TGA the <b>calibration</b> of different <b>substances</b> has been achieved. These calibrations have been combined together to develop an FTIR method, which has been used for detection of the substances in the ongoing study of the reaction pathways. In this study we also investigated the degradation chain of urea in the presence of metals.  Austenitic and ferritic silencer materials with different surface roughness were analyzed to study whether the metals have a catalytic function or effect on the byproduct formation. Those experiments have shown that a higher amount of urea was decomposed in contact with metal surface, i. e. a larger amount of NH 3 and HNCO was formed.  Biuret studies in the presence of metals appeared to give a higher formation of urea over the rougher surfaces (a larger amount of biuret was decomposed over the rougher surfaces), while experiments with cyanuric acid revealed a higher HNCO formation over ferrite than over austenite, i. e. a larger amount of cyanuric acid was decomposed. By the chosen method, used in FTIR in combination with TGA-DSC, the following important reactions have been demonstrated:  Biuret decomposed to urea and HNCO; Urea decomposed into HNCO and NH 3; formation of cyanuric acid from the decompositions of urea and biuret and finally decomposition of cyanuric acid into HNCO at a higher temperature...|$|R
