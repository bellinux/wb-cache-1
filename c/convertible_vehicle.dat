40|$|Abstract Background Particulate matter (PM) {{is assumed}} to exert a major burden on public health. Most studies that address levels of PM use {{stationary}} measure systems. By contrast, only few studies measure PM concentrations under mobile conditions to analyze individual exposure situations. Methods By combining spatial-temporal analysis with a novel vehicle-mounted sensor system, the present Mobile Air Quality Study (MAQS) aimed to analyse effects of different driving conditions in a <b>convertible</b> <b>vehicle.</b> PM 10 was continuously monitored in a convertible car, driven with roof open, roof closed, but windows open, or windows closed. Results PM 10 values inside the car were nearly always higher with open roof than with roof and windows closed, whereas no difference was seen with open or closed windows. During the day PM 10 values varied with high values before noon, and occasional high median values or standard deviation values due to individual factors. Vehicle speed in itself did not influence the mean value of PM 10; however, at traffic speed (10 – 50 km/h) the standard deviation was large. No systematic difference was seen between PM 10 values in stationary and mobile cars, nor was any PM 10 difference observed between driving within or outside an environmental (low emission) zone. Conclusions The present study has shown the feasibility of mobile PM analysis in vehicles. Individual exposure of the occupants varies depending on factors like time of day as well as ventilation of the car; other specific factors are clearly identifiably and may relate to specific PM 10 sources. This system {{may be used to}} monitor individual exposure ranges and provide recommendations for preventive measurements. Although differences in PM 10 levels were found under certain ventilation conditions, these differences are likely not of concern for the safety and health of passengers. </p...|$|E

50|$|In November 1936, the US Army's cavalry branch {{decided to}} {{modernize}} {{and needed a}} fully armored vehicle, capable of {{keeping up with the}} cavalry and of fulfilling regular combat duties. Prohibited from developing tanks by the National Defense Act of 1920, it could not develop a “tank” in the conventional sense, so opted for a smaller and lighter “car” class vehicle. It came up with the T7 Combat Car designed and built at the Rock Island Arsenal between 1937 and 1938, and was based on the M1 Combat Car but with an extended chassis and a convertible suspension - the ability to travel using wheels or tracks. The only prototype T7 Combat Car (No. W40223) was shipped to Aberdeen Proving Grounds in August 1938 for testing. While it showed good speed and performance, cavalry branch representatives were not significantly impressed. Tests were delayed until 1939, but they were reasonably successful.

40|$|Original paper can {{be found}} at : [URL] Copyright University of Western AustraliaThe {{designer}} of <b>convertible</b> <b>vehicles</b> needs to consider the acoustical properties, quality of the interior environment, fatigue life and the aesthetic integrity of the flexible roof. Each of these concerns is affected, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, by the interaction of the flexible roof material and its supporting structure with the aerodynamic loading on the material. For many convertibles, the roof quickly settles into a deformed shape for which the roof's internal forces are in equilibrium with the aerodynamic loading. The use of mathematical modelling can reduce the amount of time spent using experimental methods to assess a large number of design alternatives. A better understanding of the problem is obtained in the computational approach due to the increased amount of information which is gathered as part of the calculation. Also, the approach can be used at the concept stage of a product as the lengthy and costly build of a physical model is not required until later in the design cycle. The current research investigates the flow-induced deformation of the Jaguar XK 8 convertible roof using a numerical method. A computational methodology is developed that entails the coupling of a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code with a third-party structural solver. The computed flow-structure interaction yields stable solutions, the aerodynamically loaded flexible roof settling into static equilibrium. The flow-structure interaction is found to yield a static deformation to within 1 % difference in the displacement variable after three iterations between the fluid and structural codes. The methodology is also shown to be robust even under conditions beyond those likely to be encountered. The full methodology could be used as a design tool. However, the present work demonstrates that reasonably accurate predictions, to within 20 %, are possible using only a single iteration between the fluid and the structural codes...|$|R

Classical Lamination Theory is used to predict structural loads, while Blade Element Momentum Theory is employed to understand the aerodynamic benefits of adaptive proprotor as applied on Micro Air Vehicles. Tip mass is proposed to increase the stability and generate negative torsion for rotating blade.
