40|$|A <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> in {{the shape}} of a semicircular curved bar {{subjected}} to bending offers an excellent stress field for studying the open-mode delamination behavior of laminated composite materials. This is because the open-mode delamination nucleates at the midspan of the curved bar. The classical anisotropic elasticity theory was used to construct a 'multilayer' theory for the calculations of the stress and deformation fields induced in the multilayered composite semicircular curved bar subjected to end forces and end moments. The radial location and intensity of the open-mode delamination stress were calculated and were compared with the results obtained from the anisotropic continuum theory and from the finite element method. The multilayer theory gave more accurate predictions of the location and the intensity of the open-mode delamination stress than those calculated from the anisotropic continuum theory...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{finite element analysis}} of the end-notched flexure (ENF) test specimen for Mode II interlaminar fracture testing of composite materials. Virtual crack closure and compliance techniques employed to calculate strain energy release rates from linear elastic two-dimensional analysis indicate that the ENF specimen is a pure Mode II fracture test within the constraints of small deflection theory. Furthermore, the ENF fracture specimen is shown to be relatively insensitive to process-induced cracks, offset from the laminate midplane. Frictional effects are investigated by including the contact problem in the finite element model. A parametric study investigating the influence of delamination length, span, thickness, and material properties assessed the accuracy of beam theory expressions for compliance and strain energy release rate, GII. Finite element results indicate that data reduction schemes based upon beam theory underestimate GII by approximately 20 - 40 percent for typical unidirectional graphite fiber <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> geometries. Consequently, an improved data reduction scheme is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The mixed-mode {{bending test}} ha: been widely {{used to measure}} {{delamination}} toughness and was recently standardized by ASTM as Standard Test Method D 6671 - 01.

This test uses a unidirectional <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> with an artificial delamination subjected to bending loads to characterize when a delamination will extend. When the displacements become large, the linear theory used to analyze the results of the test yields errors in the calcu 1 ated toughness values.

A method of limiting the error that can be incurred in the calculated toughness values is needed. In this paper, nonlinear models of the MMB test are refined. One of the nonlinear models is then used to develop a simple criterion for prescribing conditions where thc nonlinear error will remain below 5 %...|$|E

This paper {{utilizes}} {{the micro}} computerized tomography (micro-CT) as the NDI technique {{to characterize the}} initial matrix delaminations locations and sizes in an aramid/glass fiber reinforced hybrid <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> after a low velocity impact tests. Further, to visualize the localized low velocity impact damage volumes; based on the specimen’s micro-CT results; image analysis, geometric modeling and meshing softwares CtAn and CtVox were used. Finally, interpretation of damage mechanisms occurred in aramid/glass fiber reinforced hybrid composite after low velocity impact loading presented with accurate 3 -D rendered models obtained {{from a series of}} micro-CT slices. 3 -D rendered models gained from impacted specimens help to quantify the internal microscopic damage modes of complex material system such as aramid/glass fiber reinforced hybrid composite. It is very important to predict or determine composite materials response to an impact loading since impacts occur during manufacture, normal operations, maintenance, etc. After low velocity impact loading tests, investigation of damage zone will provide a better composite manufacturing process. For example, it is acknowledged that up to 80 % of the cost of manufacture of a composite is fixed once the preliminary configuration had been finalised. Further detail changes afterwards can only make a small impact on the final cost of the manufacturing process...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of dynamic optical fiber sensor interrogation systems on the market it has become possible to perform vibration measurements at frequencies up to a few kHz. Nevertheless, {{the use of these}} sensors in vibration analysis has not become a standard practice yet. This is mainly caused by the fact that interrogators are stand-alone systems which focus on strain measurements while other types of signals are also required for vibration analysis (e. g., force signals). In this paper, we present a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogation system that enables accurate strain measurement simultaneously with other signals (e. g., excitation forces). The system is based on a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) and can easily be assembled with relatively low-cost off-the-shelf components. Dynamic measurements up to a few tens of kHz with a dynamic precision of around 3 nanostrain per square-root Hz can be performed. We evaluate the proposed system on two measurement examples: a steel beam with FBG sensors glued on top and a <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> with a fiber sensor integrated within the material. We show that in the latter case the results of the interrogation system are superior in quality compared to a state-of-the-art commercially available interrogation system...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study of the}} {{acoustic}} emission (AE) behavior of impact-damaged, spherical, <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> subjected to thermal cycling and biaxial mechanical loading are presented. Seven Kevlar{reg_sign}-epoxy, filament-wound, spherical <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were subjected to different levels of impact damage. The seven specimens were a subset of a group of 77 specimens made with simulated fabrication-induced flaws. The specimens were subjected to two or three cycles of elevated temperature and then hydraulically pressurized to failure. The pressurization regime consisted of two cycles to different intermediate levels with a hold at each peak pressure level; a final pressurization to failure followed. The thermal and pressurization cycles were carefully designed to stimulate AE production under defined conditions. Both impacted and nonimpacted specimens produced thermo-AE (the term given to emission stimulated by thermal loading), but impacted specimens produced significantly more. Thermo-AE was produced primarily by damaged composite material. Damaged material produced emission as a function of both rising and falling temperature, but the effect was not repeatable. More seriously damaged specimens produced very large quantities of emission. Emission recorded during the static portion of the hydraulic loading cycles varied with load, time, and degree of damage. Static load AE behavior was quantified using a newly developed concept, the event-rate moment, and various correlations with residual strength were attempted. Correlations between residual strength, long-duration events, and even-rate moments were developed with varying degrees of success...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} programme was to enable damage detection in glass fibre reinforced composites using the reinforcing fibres as the sensing element. In other words, E-glass fibres were used as light guides to detect the fracture of individual fibres, when loaded in tension. This was achieved by monitoring the transmitted light intensity through the reinforcing glass fibres. Two types of glass fibres and matrices were evaluated. In the case of glass fibres, E-glass and custom-made small-diameter (12 µm) optical fibre (SDOF) were used. Three types of low refractive index resin systems with specified failure strains were also used. The basic technology involved illuminating {{one end of the}} fibre bundle or composite with a white light or laser source and the opposite end was imaged using a high-speed CCD camera. Acoustic emission monitoring of fibre bundles revealed that there were two types of failures occurring in a bundle, a lower amplitude of the acoustic emission signal (AES) related to the inter-fibre friction and a high amplitude of the AES to fibre fractures. This characteristic was also confirmed by a Weibull statistical analysis where it was demonstrated that a two parameter distribution was present corresponding to two different flaw distributions. In the case of self-sensing composites, {{it was found that the}} specific failure modes in the composites (matrix failure, fibre fracture, debonding) generate their characteristic amplitudes of the AES and frequencies. These failure modes were recorded and correlated to the tensile test data. It was demonstrated that the attenuation of transmitted light can be related to the fracture of fibres in the bundle or a <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen.</b> It was found that the image analysis routines were capable of identifying and tracking the survival or fracture of each fibre in the bundle or composite.

A series of 24 carbon/epoxy rings were monitored with an acoustic emission (AE) system, while loading them up to failure. AE signals emitted due to different failure modes in tensile specimens were recorded. Amplitude, duration, energy, counts, etc., were the effective parameters to classify the different failure modes in composites, viz., matrix crazing, fiber cut, and delamination, with several subcategories such as matrix splitting, fiber/matrix debonding, fiber pullout, etc. A Multi-layer Back propagation neural network was generated to predict the failure load of tensile specimens.

40|$|Introduction The {{majority}} of experimental biomechanical studies {{relating to the}} proximal femur use synthetic <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> because of the advantages in terms of cost, availability and preservation. Studies report significantly (p < 0. 02) lower variability than cadaveric bone [1] with standard deviations of up to 16. 3 % for flexural rigidity, torsional rigidity and axial stiffness measurements [1 – 3]. In comparison, the variability is between 20 and 200 times greater for cadaveric bone [4]. These studies have considered variability in terms of global measures, however, to the authors’ knowledge, no data exists quantifying the variability in local properties. Variability in cortical thickness, for example, would influence strain predictions which are key to thorough validation of a model. The aim {{of the study was}} to quantify the variability in cortical thickness for commonly used composite femurs. The study also investigated the influence that these variations have in experimental testing and for validation purposes. Methods Fourth generation Sawbones® composite femurs (n= 4) instrumented with tri-axial strain gauges at four locations and CT-scanned (Siemens S 5 VB 40 B). The loading applied at the hip used the averaged peak joint reaction vector during walking [5] up to a maximum load of 500 N. Variations in cortical thickness were evaluated for the four specimens around the neck region at eight locations using the CT-scanned geometry. A generic and four specimen specific finite element models were created using manufacturers data and validated using experimentally measured strains. Results We found that there was considerable variability in the cortical thickness of the composite specimens (up to 48 % difference or 16. 1 % standard deviation of the mean). The study found that there was significantly (p < 0. 018) greater variability in experimentally measured strain around the femoral neck than around the shaft. We found that the generic model was not able to satisfactorily match the experimentally measured strains (average error of 135 %), however, the predictions of the four specimen specific models were within an average of 13. 8 % (range: 5. 9 % to 18. 3 %). A sensitivity study on alignment indicated that the variability in the predictions at the proximal strain gauges were most likely due to geometric variations between the specimens. Conclusions We want to highlight the fact that considerable variations in cortical thickness between fourth generation sawbones models exist. Future studies relying on such measurements need to account for this variability when using <b>composite</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens,</b> particularly if validation relies upon strain gauge readings made in the femoral neck region.

Properties such as high specific strength and stiffness, corrosion resistance and fatigue resistance that can be adjusted to specific requirements have made these materials {{as one of the}} main candidate considered during design process. The high energy absorbing capabilities of FRP composite materials {{is one of the main}} factors in their application in automotive and aerospace structures. They also provide other functional and economic benefits such as enhanced strength, durability, weight reduction and hence lower fuel consumption. The brittle nature of most composites accompanying other forms of energy absorption mechanisms such as fibre breakage, matrix cracking, deboning at the fibre-matrix interface and especially plies delaminations which play important roles on progressive failure mode and energy absorption capability of composite structures. Delamination which is known as principle mode of failure of layered composites due to separation along the interfaces of layers is one of the main concerns in designing of composite structures. This factor plays an important role on progressive failure mode and energy absorption capability of composite structures. Delamination can occur due to various reasons such as impact, imperfection in manufacturing, high stress concentration, environmental effects and post-processing. In this project an advanced manufacturing methods will be applied to stitch carbon-fibre <b>composite</b> <b>testing</b> <b>specimens</b> using sustainable natural flax fibres. The natural fibres running through the thickness of laminated composite structures will increase the resistance to crack propagation and consequently the energy absorption capability of composite absorbers.

This new method uses up to 83 percent less material than {{the most commonly used}} compression-after-impact technique (which calls for a 48 ply <b>test</b> <b>specimen)</b> and can also be performed on smaller loading frames since a much smaller force is needed to fail the specimen. The thickness of the <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> can be fabricated to exactly match production part thickness, thus yielding more meaningful results. CAI tests were performed on IM 6 / 3501 carbon/epoxy utilizing this new method. To verify the design, a series of tests were performed in which undamaged <b>specimens</b> were <b>tested</b> using the new fixture and ASTM D 3410 - 87 (Celanese compression test) and the results compared. The new fixture works well and will be a valuable asset to MSFC's damage tolerance program...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The use {{of natural}} fibres like {{borassus}} flabellifer fiber, flax, sisal, jute, kenaf, etc. as replacement to manmade fibres in fibre-reinforced composites have increased now a days due to advantages like low density, low cost and biodegradability. But the natural fibres have poor compatibility with the matrix and they have relatively high moisture sorption. In this research, the standard test method of ASTM D 638 M- 89 is used to prepare specimens as per the dimensions for testing tensile properties of fiber-resin <b>composites.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> has a constant cross section with tabs bonded at the ends. The specimens were incorporated with borassus flabellifer fiber. Five identical specimens were prepared for each weight by varying fiber content in grams i. e. 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5. Tensile strength of fabricated composites increases with increase in weight of fiber. The tensile properties of pure polyesters are also determined experimentally. The tensile strength of pure polyester is 35. 2 N/mm. The tensile strength of a fibered composite is 64. 51 N/mm 2 (for maximum loading fiber that is at 2. 5 grams) ...|$|R
40|$|Degradation of glass-fiber-reinforced {{polyester}} composite by hydrothermal shock cycles was studied experimentally. The interface-interphase {{in glass}} fiber composites {{is assumed to}} be a polymer film, thus, it may be susceptible to perish by environmental shock. Glass fibers of 55, 60 and 65 % weight percentages were used to fabricate polyester matrix polymer <b>composites.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were first treated at 50 °C temperature water bath for 30 minutes and then they immediately were immersed in another water bath at 100 °C temperature for the same time. The treatment was repeated for different cycles. The short beam shear (SBS) test was performed at room temperature on the conditioned samples for two different crosshead speeds (2 mm/min. and 50 mm/min.). The objective of the experiment is to assess the deterioration effect of hydrothermal shock on interfacial bonding of varied weight fraction constituents in the composite. The fiber-matrix interfacial damage is reflected in the 3 -point SBS test. The fall in shear values were observed to be 19 - 27 %, depending of volume fraction of constituents. The variation in loading speeds was taken into consideration for the assessment of interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of polycaprolactone (PCL) and polylactic acid (PLA) blend reinforced with palm press fibers from Dura and Tenera palm tree {{species have been}} comparatively studied. A twin screw extruder was used to melt blend the <b>composites</b> after which <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were produced using injection molding machine. Dicumyl peroxide (DCP) {{was used as a}} cross linker in the blends. The composites mechanical performance was tested using the universal tensile strength tester and impact strength testing machines. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) was used to study fiber/matrix adhesion. The flexural modulus of the composites increased by 98 % while impact strength increased by 52 % when treated fibers were used as reinforcement in the blend. FESEM micrographs of the blend showed two phase structure in the absence of DCP. The incorporation of DCP resulted in good interfacial adhesion as revealed by the micrographs and evidenced in the improved {{mechanical properties}}...|$|R

A number of <b>specimens</b> were <b>tested</b> at - 50 to 120 ºC temperature range and at 20, 30, and 45 J low velocity energy levels. Impact properties of the sandwich composites that were evaluated include maximum normal and shear stresses, maximum energy absorption, non-dimensional parameters (AEMP, PI, and RD), and compression after impact strength. <b>Composite</b> <b>specimens</b> <b>tested</b> have a urethane foam filled honeycomb center sandwiched between a variation of four layered Fiberglass and Kevlar/Fiberglass face sheets in a thermoset polymer epoxy matrix. Results showed that the impact performance of these sandwich composites changed over the range of temperature considered and {{with the addition of}} a Kevlar layer...|$|R
