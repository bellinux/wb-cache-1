It is not only been used in automotive but also {{in the construction of the}} building. Develop of the wind tunnel require specific parameters that need to be consider. Parameters such as <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> and diffuser angle plays an important role to obtain a good result to the model. To have a better understanding about thermo fluids, the development of low speed wind tunnel are required. From the subsonic wind tunnel, the study is to determine the best <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> of the flow quality of the air in the exit. The study is conducted by fabricate the low speed wind tunnel and by using Computational Fluids Dynamic (CFD) to obtain the data for different <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio.</b> The varying velocity and the boundary layer thickness between different <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> will be attempted.

The experiments are conducted on a 30 cm wide, 45 cm deep and 10. 5 m long laboratory flume. Different <b>contraction</b> <b>ratios</b> are considered. Different lengths of the contracted section are tested. Each particular model is tested under the same flow conditions to make the comparisons clear, consistent and logical. Flow characteristics such as discharge coefficient, heading up and energy loss are dealt in. The effects of the flow and contraction parameters on the flow characteristics are presented and discussed.

The results show that external sidewall compression induces strong separation and vortex structures in the external part which impair the starting behaviour and inhibit any gains of the compression ratio.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> and chamber {{pressure}} on the combustion performance of a gaseous-hydrogen-liquid-oxygen combustor was investigated analytically and experimentally. The experiment was conducted with a "two-dimensional" gaseous-hydrogen-liquid-oxygen engine of about 150 -pound thrust. The <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> was varied from 1. 5 to 6 by changing the nozzle throat area. This variation resulted in a chamber pressure variation of about 25 to 120 pounds per square inch. The experimental results were corrected for heat transfer to the engine walls and momentum pressure losses. The experimental performance, as evaluated in terms of characteristic exhaust velocity, was 98 percent of theoretical at contraction ratios greater than 3 but decreased very rapidly at smaller contraction ratios. The heat-transfer rate increased with increasing <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> and chamber pressure; it was about 1 Btu per square inch per second at a <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 5 and increased to about 3 at a <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> of 6. The combined effects of contraction-ratio and chamber-pressure changes on performance were investigated analytically with a mixing model and a vaporization model. The mixing model predicted very poor mixing at contraction ratios below 3 and almost perfect mixing at higher contraction ratios. The performance predicted by the vaporization model {{was very close to}} 100 percent for all contraction ratios. From these results, it was concluded that the performance was limited by poor mixing at low contraction ratios and chamber pressures...|$|E
40|$|Fluid flow {{occurring}} in a venturi tube was numerically simulated with the Fluent software, and several factors {{to affect the}} mass flux and an asymmetric flow were analyzed, including the <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio,</b> ratio of the throat section length to diameter, the diffusion angle and the inlet and outlet pressure difference. Results show that the minimum pressure point occurs at the intersection between the contraction and throat sections in the venturi tube. As the <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> increases, vacuum degree ascends, and mass flux rises. While both vacuum degree and mass flux reduces as the diffusion angle increases. In addition, an increment in the <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> shortens a fully developed section of velocity in the diffusion section. At the <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> less than 0. 2 or the diffusion angle less than 35 °, velocity in the diffusion section shows an asymmetric and skewed flow.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we obtain {{the rates of}} {{convergence}} of the algorithms given in [13] and [14] for an automatic computation of the centered Hausdorff and packing measures of a totally disconnected self-similar set. We evaluate these rates empirically through the numerical analysis of three standard classes of self-similar sets, namely, the families of Cantor type sets in the real line and the plane and the class of Sierpinski gaskets. For these three classes and for small <b>contraction</b> <b>ratios,</b> sharp bounds for the exact values of the corresponding measures are obtained and it is shown how these bounds automatically yield estimates of the corresponding measures, accurate {{in some cases to}} as many as 14 decimal places. In particular, the algorithms accurately recover the exact values of the measures in all cases in which these values are known by geometrical arguments. Positive results, which confirm some conjectural values given in [13] and [14] for the measures, are also obtained for an intermediate range of larger <b>contraction</b> <b>ratios.</b> We give an argument showing that, for this range of <b>contraction</b> <b>ratios,</b> the problem is inherently computational in the sense that any theoretical proof, such as those mentioned above, might be impossible, so that in these cases, our method is the only available approach. For <b>contraction</b> <b>ratios</b> close to those of the connected case our computational method becomes intractably time consuming, so the computation of the exact values of the packing and centered Hausdorff measures in the general case, with the open set condition, remains a challenging problem.

40|$|The {{turbulence}} downstream of a rapid contraction {{is calculated}} for the case when the turbulence scale can have the same magnitude as the mean-flow spatial scale. The approach used {{is based on the}} formulation of Goldstein (1978) for turbulence downstream of a contraction, with the added assumptions of a parallel mean flow at downstream infinity and turbulence calculated far enough downstream so that the nonuniformity of the mean flow field has decayed, and by treating the inverse <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> as a small parameter. Consideration is given to the large-contraction-ratio and classical rapid-distortion theory limits, and to results at an arbitrary <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio.</b> It is shown that the amplification effect of the contraction is reduced when the spatial scale of the turbulence increases, with the upstream turbulence actually suppressed for a <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> less than five and a turbulence spatial scale greater than three times the transverse dimensions of the downstream channel...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{distortion}} of small-scale turbulence by an axisymmetric internal contracting flow has been investigated.

The longitudinal and lateral velocity components are suppressed and amplified, respectively, with increasing <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio.</b> These effects are enhanced with increasing radial position. The numerical calculations also show that the correlation between the streamwise and radial velocity components increases monotonically with respect to both the radial location and the <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio.</b> The longitudinal and lateral one-dimensional spectra show a shift towards higher and lower wavenumbers, respectively, as the <b>contraction</b> <b>ratio</b> increases.

The objective of this work {{is to provide a}} set of reliable experimental results that confirms and extends existing datasets for experimental and numerical validation and design purposes. The Flow Process Research Centre of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology has built and commissioned a test rig to study flows of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids through sudden contractions of three diameter ratios beta = 0. 22, 0. 5 and 0. 85.

Our analysis depends on the cardinality of the group G_Φ generated by the orthogonal parts of the similarities in Φ. When |G_Φ|=∞ we show that any such self embedding must be a similarity, and so (by the results of Elekes, Keleti and Máthé) some power of its orthogonal part lies in G_Φ. When |G_Φ| < ∞ and Φ has a uniform contraction λ, we show that the linear part of any such embedding is diagonalizable, and the norm of each of its eigenvalues is a rational power of λ. We also study the existence and properties of affine maps g such that g(F) ⊆ E, where E {{is generated by}} an IFS Ψ. In this direction, we provide more evidence for a Conjecture of Feng, Huang and Rao, that such an embedding exists only if the <b>contraction</b> <b>ratios</b> of the maps in Φ are algebraically dependent on the <b>contraction</b> <b>ratios</b> of the maps in Ψ.
