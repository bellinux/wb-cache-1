It complements previous works {{focused on the}} development of a procedure called “T 2 C (Tensile Test for Corrosion). ” This procedure was previously applied on samples of 2024 alloy submitted to a continuous immersion test in 1 M NaCl solution. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if a modification in the way in which the samples are corroded impacts the ability to use this procedure. Therefore, the applicability of the T 2 <b>C</b> <b>procedure</b> to cyclic corrosion tests was evaluated. Intergranular corrosion defects developed during cyclic corrosion tests were characterized by using a statistical approach. The geometry of the tensile specimens was optimized to allow the T 2 <b>C</b> <b>procedure</b> to be applied in conditions expected as adequate. Results showed that, for cyclic corrosion tests, due to the branched morphology of the intergranular corrosion defects and the effects of hydrogen embrittlement, the T 2 <b>C</b> <b>procedure</b> cannot provide an estimation of the mean depth of the intergranular corrosion defects. However, depending on the cyclic corrosion tests, it allowed the maximal depth of the intergranular corrosion defects or the thickness of the corrosion-induced damage zone (defects+hydrogen affected zone) to be determined...|$|E

Both are fundamental primitives for implementing high-level parallel programming languages that support dynamic parallelism and dynamic data structures. A distinguishing {{feature of the}} developed multithreading system is that it tolerates {{a large number of}} threads in a single CPU while allowing direct reuse of existing sequential C compilers. In fact, it is able to turn any standard <b>C</b> <b>procedure</b> call into an asynchronous one. Having such a runtime system, the compiler of a high-level parallel programming language can fork a new thread simply by a <b>C</b> <b>procedure</b> call to a corresponding C function.

40|$|Connexins (Cxs) and endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS) {{contribute}} to the adaptation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to hemodynamic changes. To decipher the in vivo interplay between these proteins, we studied Cx 40 -null mice, a model of renin-dependent hypertension which displays an altered endothelium-dependent relaxation of the aorta because of reduced eNOS levels. These mice, which were either untreated or subjected to the 1 -kidney, 1 -clip (1 K 1 <b>C)</b> <b>procedure,</b> a model of volume-dependent hypertension, were compared with control mice submitted to either the 1 K 1 C or the 2 -kidney, 1 -clip (2 K 1 <b>C)</b> <b>procedure,</b> a model of renin-dependent hypertension. All operated mice became hypertensive and featured hypertrophy and altered Cx expression of the aorta. The combination of volume- and renin-dependent hypertension in Cx 40 -/- 1 K 1 C mice raised blood pressure and cardiac weight index. Under these conditions, all aortas showed increased levels of Cx 40 in endothelial cells and of both Cx 37 and Cx 45 in smooth muscle cells. In the wild-type 1 K 1 C mice, the interactions between Cx 40 and Cx 37 with eNOS were enhanced, resulting in increased NO release. The Cx 40 -eNOS interaction could not be observed in mice lacking Cx 40, which also featured decreased levels of eNOS. In these animals, the volume overload caused by the 1 K 1 <b>C</b> <b>procedure</b> resulted in increased phosphorylation of eNOS and in a higher NO release. The findings provide evidence that Cx 40 and Cx 37 play an in vivo role in the regulation of eNOS...|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to map the execution model of multithreading languages (languages which support fine-grain dynamic thread creation) onto the single stack execution model of C. Consequently, previous work on efficient multithreading uses elaborate frame formats and allocation strategy, with compilers customized for them. This paper presents an alternative cost-effective implementation strategy for multithreading languages which can maximally exploit current sequential C compilers. We identify a set of primitives whereby efficient dynamic thread creation and switch can be achieved and clarify implementation issues and solutions which work under the stack frame layout and calling conventions of current C compilers. The primitives are implemented as a C library and named StackThreads. In StackThreads, a thread creation is done just by a <b>C</b> <b>procedure</b> call, maximizing thread creation performance.

40|$|Gene {{regulation}} in higher eukaryotes frequently involves physical interactions between genomic sequence elements tens of kilobases apart {{on the same}} chromosome but can also entail interactions between different chromosomes. Chromosome Conformation Capture (3 C) is a powerful tool to identify such interactions. 3 C technology is based on formaldehyde crosslinking of chromatin, followed by restriction digestion and intramolecular ligation. Quantitative detection of ligation products by PCR (qPCR; not discussed in this protocol) provides insight into the interaction frequencies between chromosomal fragments and thereby the spatial organization of a genomic region. Detailed 3 C protocols have been published for yeast and mammals. However, these protocols cannot simply be transferred to plant tissues.

The erythroid-specific part of the assembly is removed by high salt extraction.
