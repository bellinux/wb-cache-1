5|$|On 30 December 1915, Natal {{was lying}} in the Cromarty Firth with her squadron, {{under the command of}} Captain Eric Back. The captain was hosting a film party aboard and had invited the wives and {{children}} of his officers, one civilian friend and his family, and nurses from the nearby hospital ship Drina to attend. A total of seven women, one civilian male, and three <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> attendance that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Because none of Gediminas' {{siblings}} {{had strong}} heirs, Gediminas and his <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a favorable position to assume and consolidate {{power in the}} Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of Moscow and Poland. The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{sectors of}} society were {{negatively}} affected too. By 2005, an estimated 80% of Zimbabwe's population were unemployed, and by 2008 only 20% of <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> schooling. The breakdown of water supplies and sewage systems resulted in a cholera outbreak in late 2008, with over 98,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe between August 2008 and mid-July 2009. The ruined economy also impacted the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country; by 2008 the HIV/AIDS rate for individuals aged between 15 and 49 was 15.3%. In 2007, the World Health Organisation declared the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe to be 34 for women and 36 for men, down from 63 and 54 respectively in 1997. The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated, {{and there was a}} rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem; he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.|$|E

25|$|Children on the Edge (COTE) is an {{organisation}} that Roddick {{founded in}} 1990, {{in response to}} her visits to Romanian orphanages.

25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the German forces, the largest {{employer}} had been the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey. Under the occupation, everything changed, and working-age people who remained still needed jobs to feed their families and themselves. Unemployment in Jersey at Christmas 1940 was 2,400 men. Many businesses closed or operated on reduced staffing levels, so many jobs vanished. The island governments tried to create suitable relief work. The island authorities introduced pay scales that were lower for single men or men whose wives and <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> England. They also cut the salaries of civil servants in half.|$|E

At the time of the assassinations, Madame Nhu was in Beverly Hills, California, traveling with her 18-year-old daughter, Ngô Đình Lệ Thủy. Her other <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Vietnam at the family retreat in Đà Lạt and she feared that they would meet the same fate as their father. The children were not harmed by the generals and were flown out of the country into exile in Rome, where they were placed in the custody of their uncle, Archbishop Thục.

25|$|Jha {{argues that}} local schools for pre-adolescent <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a flourishing state in {{thousands}} of villages of Bihar and Bengal until {{the early decades of}} the nineteenth century. They were village institutions, maintained by village elders with local funds, where their children (from all caste clusters and communities) could, if the father wished, receive useful skills. However, the British policies in respect of education and land control adversely affected both the village structure and the village institutions of secular education. The British legal system and the rise of caste consciousness since the second half of the nineteenth century made it worse. Gradually, village as the base of secular identity and solidarity became too weak to create and maintain its own institution by the end of the nineteenth century and the traditional system decayed.|$|E
25|$|Riding {{the wave}} of soaring rightist sympathies, in 1933 Chicharro {{was elected to the}} Madrid ayuntamiento from the Chamberí district. However, running on the Carlist ticket to the Cortes from Castellón he {{narrowly}} lost, though initially he was reported by the press as victorious and his fellow Traditionalist Juan Granell Pascual was indeed elected. At that time he was already seriously ill. Having been generally of rather poor health, as a chain-smoker Chicharro developed grave respiratory problems. Though as late as 1932 he was still hailed by the press as “ilustrado joven”, in August 1933 he was placed in the tuberculosis-treatment Real Sanatorio de Guadarrama, where he died early 1934. His funeral and related commemorative homage feasts staged across Spain helped to mobilize support and demonstrated growing dynamics of Carlism. As the widow and 13 half-orphaned <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> financial dire straits, Comunión Tradicionalista launched a public fund-raising campaign intended to assist them.|$|E

25|$|While {{the term}} Polish culture refers {{primarily}} to the Polish-language culture in Poland, the Second Polish Republic also had numerous vibrant national minorities, most notably Jewish, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian and German. It was a multicultural society whose ethno-cultural makeup was shaped {{over a period of}} centuries. In 1921 according to the first-ever national census, the Catholic Poles constituted 69.2% of the population, the Ukrainians 14.3%, the Jews 7.8%, the Belarusians 3.9% and the Germans 3.9%. The minorities amounted to 30.8% of the total. The rise of new intelligentsia resulted {{in the development of a}} record number of political parties, lobbies and societies. In a dozen or so years the newspaper readership doubled. In 1919, new universities opened in Poznań, Wilno, and Lublin. Universities in Kraków and Lwów were polonized already five years earlier. The Elementary School Teachers Union was formed in 1919. In the first ten years of Poland's redevelopment, the total number of schools increased by almost 10,000 thanks to the official decree on public education. By the time of the Nazi-Soviet invasion of 1939, some 90% of <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> schools across the country, the number limited only by the shortage of qualified staff and lack of adequate locales especially in the villages.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic Church in Poland {{provided}} many persecuted Jews {{with food}} and shelter during the war, even though monasteries gave no immunity to Polish priests and monks against the death penalty. Nearly every Catholic institution in Poland looked after a few Jews, usually children with forged Christian birth certificates and an assumed or vague identity. In particular, convents of Catholic nuns in Poland (see Sister Bertranda), {{played a major role}} in the effort to rescue and shelter Polish Jews, with the Franciscan Sisters credited with the largest number of Jewish children saved. Two thirds of all nunneries in Poland took part in the rescue, in all likelihood with the support and encouragement of the church hierarchy. These efforts were supported by local Polish bishops and the Vatican itself. The convent leaders never disclosed the exact number of children saved in their institutions, and for security reasons the rescued children were never registered. Jewish institutions have no statistics that could clarify the matter. Systematic recording of testimonies did not begin until the early 1970s. In the villages of Ożarów, Ignaców, Szymanów, and Grodzisko near Leżajsk, the Jewish children were cared for by Catholic convents and by the surrounding communities. In these villages, Christian parents did not remove their children from schools where Jewish <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> attendance.|$|E

Mrs. Chotiner had refused to accompany her husband to Washington, stating at trial that she remained because her <b>children</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> California schools.
