2500|$|A {{variety of}} pyrope from Macon County, North Carolina is a violet-red shade {{and has been}} called rhodolite, Greek for [...] "rose". In {{chemical}} composition it may be considered as essentially an isomorphous mixture of pyrope and almandine, {{in the proportion of}} two parts pyrope to one part almandine. Pyrope has tradenames some of which are misnomers; <b>Cape</b> <b>ruby,</b> Arizona ruby, California ruby, Rocky Mountain ruby, and Bohemian garnet from the Czech Republic. Another intriguing find is the blue color-changing garnets from Madagascar, a pyrope-spessartine mix. The color of these blue garnets is not like sapphire blue in subdued daylight but more reminiscent of the grayish blues and greenish blues sometimes seen in spinel. However, in white LED light, the color is equal to the best cornflower blue sapphire, or Dblock tanzanite; {{this is due to the}} blue garnet's ability to absorb the yellow component of the emitted light.|$|E

50|$|Darna {{made another}} cameo {{this time in}} a series of Toyota Tamaraw FX {{commercials}} in 1993, with Anjanette Abayari, Alma Concepcion, and Daisy Reyes portraying Darna. Daisy wore a stomach-bearing red long-sleeved leotard (it had a ruby encrusted star {{in the middle of the}} winged collar) with gold-trimmed red <b>cape,</b> <b>ruby</b> encrusted gold tiara, ruby encrusted gold bracelets, and gold-trimmed red boots. Anjanette and Alma wore the same outfit. The outfit consisted of a red bikini with gold stars, ruby encrusted four-winged medallion tiara, ruby encrusted gold medallion belt with dot spangled red loincloth, ruby encrusted gold bracelets, and red boots with ruby encrusted gold wing insignia.|$|E
50|$|The mineral pyrope is {{a member}} of the garnet group. Pyrope is the only member of the garnet family to always display red {{colouration}} in natural samples, and it is from this characteristic that it gets its name: from the Greek for fire and eye. Despite being less common than most garnets, it is a widely used gemstone with numerous alternative names, some of which are misnomers. Chrome pyrope, and Bohemian garnet are two alternative names, the usage of the latter being discouraged by the Gemological Institute of America. Misnomers include Colorado ruby, Arizona ruby, California ruby, Rocky Mountain ruby, Elie Ruby, Bohemian carbuncle, and <b>Cape</b> <b>ruby.</b>|$|E
