25|$|In 2015, the {{nuclease}} Cpf1 {{was discovered}} in the CRISPR/Cpf1 system of the bacterium Francisella novicida. Cpf1 showed several key differences from <b>Cas9</b> including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA {{as opposed to the}} 'blunt' cut produced by <b>Cas9,</b> relying on a 'T rich' PAM (providing alternate targeting sites to <b>Cas9)</b> and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast <b>Cas9</b> requires both crRNA and a transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA).|$|E
25|$|Methods {{to control}} genome editing with small {{molecules}} include an allosteric <b>Cas9,</b> with no detectable background editing, that will activate binding and cleavage upon {{the addition of}} 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), 4-HT responsive intein-linked Cas9s or a <b>Cas9</b> that is 4-HT responsive when fused to four ERT2 domains. Intein-inducible split-Cas9 allows dimerization of <b>Cas9</b> fragments and Rapamycin-inducible split-Cas9 system developed by fusing two constructs of split <b>Cas9</b> with FRB and FKBP fragments. Furthermore, other studies have shown to induce transcription of <b>Cas9</b> with a small molecule, doxycyline. Small molecules {{can also be used}} to improve Homology Directed Repair (HDR), often by inhibiting the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. These systems allow conditional control of CRISPR activity for improved precision, efficiency and spatiotemporal control.|$|E
25|$|The first plasmid {{used in the}} {{pioneering}} work of Reisch and Prather is composed of: the <b>cas9</b> gene {{under the control of}} the PTET promoter; the tetR gene, which codes for tetracycline repressor protein, under control of a constitutive promoter; and the cmr gene for chloramphenicol resistance. It was observed that leaky expression of <b>Cas9</b> occurred even without induction of the PTET promoter. Therefore, to avoid cell death, a transfer messenger RNA (ssrA) tag was included in the plasmid downstream of the <b>cas9</b> gene. In the event of leaky <b>Cas9</b> expression, the C-terminal ssrA tag would be recognized by ClpP protease and degrade <b>Cas9</b> to allow for better expressional control of the protein. Together, these components make up the pCas9cr4 plasmid and allow targeting of the host cell chromosome.|$|E
25|$|The no-SCAR {{technique}} uses a two-plasmid system; this {{is because}} co-transformation of both <b>cas9</b> containing plasmid and the sgRNA plasmid results in cell death. More specifically, the cell lethality {{is a consequence of}} <b>Cas9</b> cleaving the E. coli DNA that matches the sgRNA. In order to circumvent this issue, multiple plasmids are used in order to maintain expressional control of both <b>cas9</b> and sgRNA.|$|E
25|$|Reisch and Prather pioneered a {{technique}} that combines both the λ-red and CRISPR/Cas9 recombination systems to form a novel methodology called no-SCAR (Scarless <b>Cas9</b> Assisted Recombineering) for E. coli genome modifications. In this method, a plasmid containing the gene for <b>Cas9</b> expression (<b>cas9)</b> is first transformed into E. coli cells. After selecting for the transformants using antibiotic resistance, another plasmid containing the targeted gene {{of interest in the}} form of sgRNA and the λ-red operon is transfected. After induced expression of the λ-red recombineering system, linear DNA to be incorporated into the E. coli genome is transformed into the cells. The expression of <b>Cas9</b> and the sgRNA are then induced, which results in the <b>Cas9</b> locating the E. coli target DNA based on the sgRNA complement. <b>Cas9</b> is able to initiate a double strand break and the λ-red system is able to bring the linear DNA to E. coli genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific sgRNA and then the next plasmid containing the specific sgRNA target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.|$|E
25|$|Unenriched {{sequencing}} libraries {{often have}} abundant undesired sequences. <b>Cas9</b> can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage {{with up to}} 99% efficiency and without significant off-target effects as seen with restriction enzymes. Treatment with <b>Cas9</b> can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.|$|E
25|$|Once {{these have}} been {{assembled}} into a plasmid and transfected into cells the <b>Cas9</b> protein {{with the help of}} the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the <b>Cas9</b> variant – creates a single or double strand break in the DNA.|$|E
25|$|The PAM {{sequence}} on {{the host}} genome is recognized by <b>Cas9.</b> <b>Cas9</b> cannot be easily modified {{to recognize a}} different PAM sequence. However this is not too limiting {{as it is a}} short sequence and nonspecific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).|$|E
25|$|Type II systems rely on {{a single}} {{multifunctional}} protein, <b>Cas9,</b> for the interference step. <b>Cas9</b> requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).|$|E
25|$|Scarless <b>Cas9</b> Assisted Recombineering (no-SCAR) is an editing {{method that}} {{is able to}} {{manipulate}} the Escherichia coli (E. coli) genome. The system relies on recombineering whereby DNA sequences are combined and manipulated through homologous recombination. No-SCAR is able to manipulate the E. coli genome {{without the use of}} the chromosomal markers detailed in previous recombineering methods. Instead, in this method, the λ-Red recombination system facilitates donor DNA integration while <b>Cas9</b> cleaves double-stranded DNA to counter-select against wild-type cells. Although λ-Red and <b>Cas9</b> genome editing are widely used technologies, the no-SCAR method is novel in combining the two functions; this technique is able to establish point mutations, gene deletions, and short sequence insertions in several genomic loci with increased efficiency and time sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|The PTET {{promoter}} {{plays an}} integral {{role in the}} expression of both plasmids. It drives transcriptional expression of both the sgRNA of interest and <b>cas9</b> in the host cell upon induction with anhydrotetracycline (aTc). In {{the absence of the}} inducer, the PTET promoter is repressed by the constitutively expressed tetracycline repressor protein (TetR). Therefore, the presence of TetR in the host cell prior to the introduction of both sgRNA and <b>cas9</b> is a measure to avoid cell lethality.|$|E
25|$|CRISPR/Cas9 {{offers a}} high degree of {{fidelity}} and relatively simple construction. It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the PAM. The target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array. A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. <b>Cas9</b> proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA. The sequence {{is not part of the}} <b>Cas9</b> protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cas9</b> {{was used}} to carry {{synthetic}} transcription factors that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different locations on the gene's promoter.|$|E
25|$|Multiple crRNAs and the tracrRNA can be {{packaged}} {{together to}} form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). This sgRNA can be joined together with the <b>Cas9</b> gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{methods for}} {{harnessing}} this system {{for use in}} editing mutations or insertions of specific E. coli sequences were published. This method includes constructing a plasmid consisting of the <b>cas9</b> gene and CRISPR loci containing the matching target DNA, called single guide RNA (sgRNA). After expression is induced, <b>Cas9</b> is {{able to identify the}} target DNA sequence of the cellular genome by finding the sgRNA complement and initiate strand breaks in the E. coli genome. This allows a transfected, linear DNA sequence to be incorporated into the genome, relying on the cellular machinery to use the linear DNA flanked by homologous regions specific to the cleaved location as a template to rebuild using homology directed repair.|$|E
25|$|CRISPR/Cas9 {{genome editing}} {{is carried out}} with a Type II CRISPR system. When {{utilized}} for genome editing, this system includes <b>Cas9,</b> crRNA, tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} method for genome editing uses CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) {{sequences}} and the endonuclease <b>Cas9</b> (CRISPR-associated protein 9). These components {{are an integral}} part of the immune response for some bacteria. and have been repurposed for genome engineering. In this system, sequences matching foreign bacteriophage or plasmid DNA are incorporated as “spacer” sequences into the bacterial genome located between repeating CRISPR loci. Cas endonucleases are able to initiate double strand breaks within these foreign DNAs that are complement to the transcribed CRISPR RNAs (crRNA, or “protospacers”), thus degrading them. A conserved protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, sequence 5’-NGG-3’) located immediately downstream of the protospacer in the cellular genome is necessary for <b>Cas9</b> cleavage. Together, this system allows for adaptive immunity to the dynamic viral genetic material.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of CRISPR {{sequences}} revealed coevolution of {{host and}} viral genomes. <b>Cas9</b> proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation {{may contribute to}} the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen host response and promote virulence.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variants}} of CRISPR/Cas9 allow gene activation or genome editing with an external trigger such as light or small molecules. These include photoactivatable CRISPR systems developed by fusing light-responsive protein partners with an activator domain and a dCas9 for gene activation, or fusing similar light responsive domains with two constructs of split-Cas9, or by incorporating caged unnatural amino acids into <b>Cas9,</b> or by modifying the guide RNAs with photocleavable complements for genome editing.|$|E
25|$|CRISPR/Cas9 often {{employs a}} plasmid to {{transfect}} the target cells. The main components of this plasmid {{are displayed in}} the image and listed in the table. The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that <b>Cas9</b> uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template is designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences {{on either side of}} the cut and code for the insertion sequence.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} transformation efficiency, transformed cells are grown in super optimal broth to expedite the recovery process after transformation. In this method, two subsequent transformations must be performed in order to incorporate the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids necessary for recombination. This is because preliminary studies found that when both <b>Cas9</b> and sgRNA were expressed {{at the same time}} without the linear DNA to be incorporated into the genome, cell death was induced due to the disruption of the crucial gene. Therefore, the expression of the recombination machinery and sgRNA were kept under strict control and transformed stepwise to reduce cell lethality.|$|E
25|$|Properly spaced {{single strand}} {{breaks in the}} host DNA can trigger {{homology}} directed repair, which is less error prone than the non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the <b>Cas9</b> induced DNA break. The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence {{is now part of}} the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of {{the linear}} DNA {{to the target}} genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different sgRNA can subsequently be transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 plasmid lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a plasmid curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose sgRNA is complement to the pCas9cr4 plasmid. Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A origin of replication of the pCas9cr4 plasmid. After recombinants were selected for, expression of <b>Cas9</b> and sgRNA was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37oC, they observed no colony formation on the LB plates containing chloramphenicol indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 plasmid due to a Cas9-mediated double strand break in the plasmid. Additional plasmid mini-preps demonstrated that neither plasmid was retained in the cells, therefore indicating plasmid curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{studied a}} simpler CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes {{that relies on}} the protein <b>Cas9.</b> The <b>Cas9</b> {{endonuclease}} is a four-component system that includes two small RNA molecules named CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA). Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier re-engineered the <b>Cas9</b> endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a [...] "single-guide RNA" [...] that, when combined with <b>Cas9,</b> could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA. [...] By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial <b>Cas9</b> system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage. [...] Another group of collaborators comprising Šikšnys together with Gasiūnas, Barrangou and Horvath showed that <b>Cas9</b> from the S. thermophilus CRISPR system can also be reprogrammed to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of its crRNA. [...] These advances fueled efforts to edit genomes with the modified CRISPR-Cas9 system.|$|E
2500|$|Transformed oligonucleotides are {{incorporated}} into the cellular DNA through λ-red- and <b>Cas9</b> endonuclease-mediated homologous recombination. [...] λ-red is activated when arabinose binds to expressed AraC, inducing dimerization of the AraC protein and subsequent DNA binding to activate the promoter [...] prior to oligonucleotide transfection. This step is followed by induced expression of the <b>Cas9</b> nuclease and the sgRNA through binding of anhydrotetracycline to the PTET promoter. <b>Cas9,</b> with {{the guidance of the}} transformed sgRNA, identifies the E. coli complement target sequence and initiates a double strand break. One crucial aspect is that the target gene must be in close proximity upstream of the PAM sequence. Fortunately, the PAM NGG sequence occurs at 424,651 instances on both strands of the E. coli chromosome, so this method is not limited in its targeted specificity.|$|E
2500|$|Using [...] "dead" [...] {{versions}} of <b>Cas9</b> (dCas9) eliminates CRISPR's DNA-cutting ability, while preserving {{its ability to}} target desirable sequences. Multiple groups added various regulatory factors to dCas9s, enabling them to turn almost any gene on or off or adjust its level of activity. Like RNAi, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) turns off genes in a reversible fashion by targeting, but not cutting a site. The targeted site is methylated, epigenetically modifying the gene. This modification inhibits transcription. Conversely, CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) promotes gene transcription. <b>Cas9</b> is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level. In bacteria, the presence of <b>Cas9</b> alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA sequences called promoters that immediately precede the target gene.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Dr. Alexander Marson at the University of California, San Francisco successfully edited the genome of human T cells using a <b>Cas9</b> ribonucleoprotein delivery method. This advancement has potential for applications in treating [...] "cancer immunotherapies and cell-based therapies for HIV, primary immune deficiencies, and autoimmune diseases".|$|E
2500|$|A simple {{version of}} the CRISPR/Cas system, CRISPR/Cas9, has been {{modified}} to edit genomes. [...] By delivering the <b>Cas9</b> nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added. The Cas9-gRNA complex corresponds with the CAS III crRNA complex in the above diagram.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{clusters}} of cas genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively there are 93 cas genes that are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. [...] 11 of the 35 families form the cas core, {{which includes the}} protein families Cas1 through <b>Cas9.</b> [...] A complete CRISPR-Cas locus {{has at least one}} gene belonging to the cas core.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Doudna and {{her colleagues}} {{generated}} a new discovery that would reduce the time and work needed to edit genomic DNA. Their discovery relies on a protein named <b>Cas9</b> found in the Streptococcus bacteria [...] "CRISPR" [...] immune system that works like scissors. The protein attacks its prey, the DNA of viruses, and slices it up. In 2015, Doudna gave a TED Talk about the bioethics of using CRISPR.|$|E
2500|$|Scientists can use viral or non-viral {{systems for}} {{delivery}} of the <b>Cas9</b> and sgRNA into target cells. Electroporation of DNA, RNA or ribonucleocomplexes {{is the most common}} and cheapest system. This technique was used to edit CXCR4 and PD-1, knocking in new sequences to replace specific genetic [...] "letters" [...] in these proteins. The group was then able to sort the cells, using cell surface markers, to help identify successfully edited cells. Deep sequencing of a target site confirmed that knock-in genome modifications had occurred with up to ∼20% efficiency, which accounted for up to approximately one-third of total editing events. However, hard-to-transfect cells (stem cells, neurons, hematopoietic cells, etc.) require more efficient delivery systems such as those based on lentivirus (LVs), adenovirus (AdV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV).|$|E
2500|$|The SCAR-less {{method is}} able to induce point mutations, oligonucleotide-mediated deletions, and short {{sequence}} insertions with a high efficiency. In the case of point mutations, oligonucleotides targeted to the lagging strand are designed to alter the either the PAM sequence or the protospacer sequences within 12 base pairs of the PAM as {{this is the most}} important region for <b>Cas9</b> specificity. With this process, both nonsense and missense mutations are possible. However, the subsequent transformations differ between nonsense and missense mutations: double transformations, where the pCas9cr4 plasmid and oligonucleotide are transformed simultaneously, are more efficient for nonsense mutations while single transformations, where each plasmid and oligonucleotide are transformed independently, are better suited for missense mutations [...] as demonstrated by colony PCR. The method is also able to successfully delete large regions of chromosomal DNA using oligonucleotides designed with upstream and downstream homology to the area of deletion. In the case of deletions, a single transformation protocol is more efficient and shows a 100% deletion rate following colony PCR. Further work should be pursued to determine causes for the different transformation efficiencies for various mutation types.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the unique}} ability of <b>Cas9</b> to bind to {{essentially}} any complement sequence in any genome, researchers wanted to use this enzyme to repress transcription of various genomic loci. To accomplish this, the two crucial catalytic residues of the RuvC and HNH domain can be mutated to alanine abolishing all endonuclease activity of <b>Cas9.</b> The resulting protein coined ‘dead’ <b>Cas9</b> or ‘dCas9’ for short, can still tightly bind to dsDNA. This catalytically inactive <b>Cas9</b> variant {{has been used for}} both mechanistic studies into <b>Cas9</b> DNA interrogative binding and as a general programmable DNA binding RNA-Protein complex.|$|E

Because the target specificity of <b>Cas9</b> stems from the guide RNA:DNA complementarity and not modifications to the protein itself (like TALENs and Zinc-fingers), engineering <b>Cas9</b> to target new DNA is straightforward. Versions of <b>Cas9</b> that bind but do not cleave cognate DNA {{can be used to}} localize transcriptional activator or repressors to specific DNA sequences in order to control transcriptional activation and repression. While native <b>Cas9</b> requires a guide RNA composed of two disparate RNAs that associate to make the guide - the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), and the trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA)., <b>Cas9</b> targeting has been simplified through the engineering of a chimeric single guide RNA. Scientists have suggested that Cas9-based gene drives may be capable of editing the genomes of entire populations of organisms. In 2015, scientists used <b>Cas9</b> to modify the genome of human embryos for the first time.|$|E
