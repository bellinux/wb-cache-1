Caps also perform as <b>cylinder</b> <b>mounting</b> components flange, cap trunnion, cap clevis. Cap size is determined based on the bending stress. A static seal / o-ring is used in between cap and barrel (except welded construction).|$|E
5000|$|As the manufacturers' product page states:The revolvers of cal. 357 Magnum {{have been}} {{designed}} to comply requirements of demanding users from among the law enforcing corps, private security agencies and citizens who take their safety seriously. The design of cartridge <b>cylinder</b> <b>mounting</b> in tilting console and shock transition control from the console to the frame considers as much as possible maintaining the minimum limits for a long time. Cylinder rotation design takes no compromise in forcing the cylinder turn by exact spacing distance to safely adjust to the barrel leaving no reckon on inertia of the cylinder to finish its turning movement. The user obtains thus a guarantee of safe action disabled when the cartridge is off the barrel axis even if the cylinder is braked, e.g. with impurities. The combination of 357 Magnum cartridge high output and our revolver makes up a reliable arms system for any crisis situation. Drop safety and all-steel design guarantee a high level of safety when carried under any condition. The accuracy and power of the six-inch version is a challenge for hunters using short guns.|$|E

40|$|The Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA) onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is {{designed}} to monitor the major constituents of the ISS's internal atmosphere. This mass spectrometer based system {{is an integral part}} of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) and is a primary tool for the management of ISS atmosphere composition. As a part of NASA Change Request CR 10773 A, several alterations to the hardware have been made to accommodate improved MCA logistics. First, the ORU 08 verification gas assembly has been modified to allow the verification gas cylinder to be installed on orbit. The verification gas is an essential MCA consumable that requires periodic replenishment. Designing the cylinder for subassembly transport reduces the size and weight of the maintained item for launch. The redesign of the ORU 08 assembly includes a redesigned housing, <b>cylinder</b> <b>mounting</b> apparatus, and pneumatic connection. The second hardware change is a redesigned wiring harness for the ORU 02 analyzer. The ORU 02 electrical connector interface was damaged in a previous on-orbit installation, and this necessitated the development of a temporary fix while a more permanent solution was developed. The new wiring harness design includes flexible cable as well as indexing fasteners and guide-pins, and provides better accessibility during the on-orbit maintenance operation. This presentation will describe the hardware improvements being implemented for MCA as well as the expected improvement to logistics and maintenance...|$|E

50|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad's class Q1 {{comprised}} {{a single}} experimental steam locomotive for freight service, #6130, built in March 1942. A duplex locomotive, {{it had a}} wheel arrangement of 4-6-4-4, comprising a four-wheel leading truck, two sets of driving wheels (six followed by four) in a rigid locomotive frame, and a four-wheel trailing truck. The first group of six driving wheels was driven {{by a pair of}} <b>cylinders</b> <b>mounted</b> conventionally in front of them, while the rear four driving wheels were driven by <b>cylinders</b> <b>mounted</b> behind them {{on either side of the}} firebox.|$|R

50|$|The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, which {{operated}} the Wellington-Manawatu line, had four similar locomotives built by Baldwin, two in 1888, one in 1894 {{and one in}} 1896. The WMR locomotives of 1894 and 1896, no. 12 and no. 13, were Vauclain compound locomotives, the first in New Zealand and the first narrow-gauge compounds in the world. While standard gauge compounds usually had the low-pressure <b>cylinder</b> <b>mounted</b> below the high-pressure cylinder on each side, this was often reversed on narrow-gauge locomotives, which had the larger low-pressure <b>cylinders</b> <b>mounted</b> above the high-pressure cylinders to provide greater clearance at platforms.|$|R
50|$|From its {{experiences}} with this locomotive, the PRR {{came up with}} an improved design, the Q2. This had normal-sized drivers, <b>cylinders</b> <b>mounted</b> in front of the wheels they drove, and were built largely unstreamlined.|$|R

50|$|Although the {{earliest}} examples can be dated to Richard Trevithick in around 1800, the type {{is best known}} as the products of Robey & Co. of Lincoln who patented their design in 1873.

The <b>cylinders</b> were <b>mounted</b> beneath the smokebox and a transverse crankshaft ran crossways beneath the boiler, just ahead of the firebox. The frame of these engines was a large iron box casting that formed a single piece foundation for both the engine and boiler.|$|R
