5|$|Competition <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> part in {{the mating}} rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length {{greater than that of}} a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} {{version of}} the game {{was based on a}} popular online version from GSN's website. In this version, the online player has five minutes to make as many hands of 21 as they can using four columns. The player <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> card in any of their columns as long as the subsequent total is 21 or less; if the card cannot be played in any column, it must be discarded. Playing exactly five cards in a column earns the player a bonus, while the jacks of spades and clubs allow any column to be cleared no matter what.|$|E

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, and stress. Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role in preventing further seizures.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 Sellers {{made his}} directorial debut with Mr. Topaze, {{in which he}} also starred. The film {{was based on the}} Marcel Pagnol play Topaze. Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to a life of crime to obtain wealth. The film and Sellers's directorial {{abilities}} received an unenthusiastic response from the public and critics alike, and Sellers rarely referred to it again. The same year he starred in the Sidney Gilliat-directed Only Two <b>Can</b> <b>Play,</b> <b>a</b> film based on the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis. He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz (Mai Zetterling), and his long-suffering wife Jean (Virginia Maskell).|$|E
5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are {{encountered in the}} game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E
5|$|Each of the game's worlds feature eight main levels, with a boss {{appearing}} {{at the end}} of every fourth and eighth level. Hidden throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins, the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level. Collecting Flowers adds flowers to the gate {{at the end of}} each level (not including boss levels). If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the end gate, they <b>can</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu, such as additional stars or maginifying glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins. At the end of each level, players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found, as well as how many stars they have remaining, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars. Completing all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world.|$|E
