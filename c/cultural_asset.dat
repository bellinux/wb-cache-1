40|$|This paper {{provides}} an economic {{justification for the}} protection of cultural property rights of indigenous groups. Cultural property either in the form of traditional knowledge or folklore carries the potential to increase wealth by adding to the knowledge base of an economy. But in order to ensure efficient use of <b>cultural</b> <b>assets,</b> the law should provide protection from overexploitation which is likely to occur as <b>cultural</b> <b>assets</b> can be characterized as a common pool resource. In contrast to other intellectual property such as inventions cultural goods are primarily provided by intrinsic motivation. External effects of using them in the production of other goods could crowd out this motivation. If <b>cultural</b> <b>assets</b> are part of the knowledge base of an economy, as argued here, protection of <b>cultural</b> <b>assets</b> should be implemented by either specific regulation by the state or the creation of property rights which can be traded on markets. International law should endeavour to provide a framework with lowest possible transaction costs while securing <b>cultural</b> <b>assets.</b> Intellectual property rights, Cultural property rights, common pool resource, knowledge base...|$|R

25|$|In 1931, {{she married}} flamenco singer Pepe Pinto. After the {{parenthesis}} of the Spanish Civil War, {{she came back}} to the stage, as part of several flamenco shows, together with artists like Concha Piquer. After this, she retired for a few years, and came back with a show called España y su Cantaora (Spain and her singer), together with her husband, which she toured for a few months and was acclaimed by the critics. Then she definitely retired again. In 1961 she received an homage in Córdoba, in which several well-known flamenco artists took part, such as Antonio Mairena, Juan Talega, Manuel Morao, or Fernando Terremoto. In 1968, a monument was built in her honour in her quarter of Alameda de Hércules. In the last three years of her life, she was completely retired owing to senile dementia. She died in 1969, {{a month and a half}} after her husband. In that same year, singer Anotnio Mairena recorded his album Honores a la Niña de los Peines in homage to her. In 1996, during the IX Bienal de Flamenco, the autonomous Andalusian government declared the voice of La Niña de los Peines Bien de Interés <b>Cultural</b> (<b>Asset</b> of Cultural Interest).|$|E

2500|$|The three sitting {{statues of}} Kannon that the Main Hall enshrines are the temple's main object of worship.

In spite of its dubious attribution, the statue is a city Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Asset.</b> The one in the middle is the statue said to have been made by Ennin, which also seems to go back only to the late Heian period and is a national Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Asset.</b> The one on the right is the statue traditionally attributed to Genshin, which has been dated {{to the middle of the}} Kamakura period and is far too young to really be by him.

It concludes by summarizing the possibility of applying one or several of these methods as part of the well established ECLAC disaster impact assessment methodology 1 and advances some recommendations and areas for turture research.
