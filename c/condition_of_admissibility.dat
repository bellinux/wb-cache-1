This approach can be viewed from the perspective of linear programming: there is a natural linear program for computing shortest paths, and solutions to its dual linear program are feasible if and only if they form a consistent heuristic (speaking roughly, since the sign conventions differ from place to place in the literature). This feasible dual / consistent heuristic defines a non-negative reduced cost and A* is essentially running Dijkstra's algorithm with these reduced costs.

The main objective of this thesis is to describe {{the development of an}} institute of an application for an appeal review throughout the legal history of the civil procedure {{in the area of the}} Czech Republic up to current state, with a particular focus on the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> such application and its essentials. My thesis is composed of three chapters. The first chapter is to introduce the reader to the historical development of an application of an appeal review from the very beginning in the 18 th century up to date. In particular, the landmark Constitutional Court decision (sp. zn. Pl. ÚS 29 / 11) is emphasized in the end of the chapter. The second chapter deals with the actual legislation of an application for an appeal review in The Code of Civil Procedure. Its main goal is to describe this institute as whole. It is also to provide the reader with further analysis of some controversial issues of the actual legislation as the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> an application and its essentials required by the law.

The second argument is directly relevant to this debate. It is that the inclusion of price rigidity into these models via short-cuts like Calvo contracts has required a key modification of the microfoundations methodology, such that internal consistency can only be claimed indirectly by appeal to theory developed elsewhere.

It will be argued that Article 168 of the Russian Civil Code, as a metarule, contains three types of rule: 1) rules dealing with the priority of special rules and exceptions (exclusive rules); 2) rules dealing with the interpretation of general, special and exclusive rules, as well as with the requirements of statutes or other legal acts violated by a transaction and established outside of Article 168 of the Civil Code; 3) rules dealing with the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> special rules and exceptions, as well as with the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> these rules. With regard to the first group of rules, the legislature and commercial courts consider Article 168 of the Civil Code a common base for other grounds in the Civil Code, and in certain other statutes, for declaring transactions invalid. According to the second group of rules, the subject-matter (object) of legal interpretation consists of two elements: а) the text of Article 168 of the Civil Code; and b) the texts of legal acts, described by the generic term “statute or other legal act. ” Article 168 of the Civil Code provides instructions, not only for rules as objects of application of the article, but also for the methods of interpreting violated requirements.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we perform a broad {{study of a}} class of {{relativistic}} field theories supporting non-topological soliton solution in three space dimensions. More precisely, we study (multi-) scalar fields arising in theories whose lagrangians are defined as general functions of the standard kinetic term, and (abelian and non-abelian) gauge fields in generalize gauge field theories with lagrangian densities defined as functions of the two standard quadratic invariants of the field. In the scalar case we have obtained a complete characterization of the static, spherically symmetric solutions which are finite-energy (definite positive) and stable. In the gauge field case we have performed a general study which also leads to a characterization of the electrostatic spherically symmetric solutions which forms and energies can {{be shown to be}} related to their (multi-) scalar counterparts. Along the study, the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility,</b> which corresponds to several restrictions to be imposed on the lagrangian densities in order to obtain physically consistent field theories, plays {{a crucial role in the}} exhaustive determination of this class of soliton-supporting non-linear field theories. From the variational analysis of the energy functional and the study of the dynamic evolution of the perturbations are these solutions in the field equations, we have obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for these (multi-) scalar and gauge solutions to be weakly stable, i. e. stable against small charge-preserving perturbations. Moreover, several explicit examples of lagrangians belonging to this class of theories have been introduced. These lagrangians have been analyzed in great detail, and we have obtained a complete description of their energies and other physically relevant properties. A particular example of this class of non-linear lagrangian field models is the Born-Infeld theory. Finally we have studied several applications that this class of lagrangians with non-topological solitons can have in diverse contexts, such as self-gravitating (scalar, abelian, non-abelian) soliton solutions or the phenomenological descripcion of the hadron internal structure and the hadronic interactions. Many other applications can be also envisaged from several results obtained in this work including soliton solutions within effective models of Quantum Electrodynamics, short-range behaviours, electric-magnetic dualities, etc...|$|E

A rudimentary outline of how this would work is provided. The creation in 1982 of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit represents the first significant appellate consolidation of a particular area of law in American history. Evaluating the Federal Circuit experiment is highly important to understanding, and perhaps improving upon, the institutional design of the federal judiciary. The Federal Circuit was grounded in a congressional desire for greater uniformity in the application of patent law. In patent law, as in other areas of the law, uniformity is a virtue. But uniformity is not the only virtue and centralization has its costs. The issue of centralization versus decentralization manifests itself in numerous areas of law, politics, economics and business. This article draws upon that literature and argues that the time is ripe to rethink the Federal Circuit experiment and the fixation on uniformity that gave rise to the experiment. The criticisms currently levied against the Federal Circuit - that it maintains excessive insularity, is subject to path dependency in its case law, and produces inadequately nuanced jurisprudence - can be traced back ultimately to the court 2 ̆ 7 s chief structural limitation: The court lacks the benefit of sister-circuit jurisprudence that would engender a healthy competition of rationales and provide a mechanism for testing legal innovations. Accordingly, the article proposes that in addition to the Federal Circuit, at least one, and perhaps two or three, extant circuit courts should have jurisdiction to hear appeals relating to patent law. This proposal represents a shift in strategy from one dominated by the pursuit of uniformity, to one where competition and diversity are equally important. As the literature from many other areas suggests, a choice between centralized and decentralized institutions cannot and should not be made with a polar solution. The issue is one of optimization. In 1982 Congress decided that the optimal number of federal appellate courts deciding patent cases was fewer than thirteen; we suggest that the optimal number may also be greater than one...|$|E

40|$|This study, about {{techniques}} used in commercial leasing contracts in companies that practice economic development, {{is influenced by}} a specific working hypothesis. It {{is the study of}} an entrepreneurial organization that succeeded {{in the space of a}} few short years to create an economic initiative capable of promoting the development of a flourishing commercial district in the Cagliari area. This example can give insight into a beneficial use of linked contracts systems for the creation of big economic operations and the development of productive activities during times where resources are scarce and the economy is contracting. Commercial leasing has always been thought of (and this is also the case with Policentro Domus de Janas corporation) as an excellent contractual technique for developing economic initiative. Even if one only considers how it gives the property owner an income from giving the right to use all or part of a productive activity, and how the tenant (who generally does not have the capital to risk investing in the beginning) tests the market by starting its own professional activity. With this objective in mind, this paper will develop in the space of three chapters. 1 The first chapter will frame commercial leasing in the context of the circulatory phenomena of productive apparatuses. The second will concentrate on analyzing the types of contracts used. In this way, the evolution of commercial leasing contracts will be retraced. Evolution that has affected applicable regulations of the business branch and the importance of the starting plan for the purposes of presenting negotiations in doctrine and in jurisprudence. The implications that this kind of contract has on a procedural level should not be omitted. With the inclusion of this figure by the legislator on the list of matters to be decided according to article 447 bis c. p. c. on one side, and subject to the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> pronounced by the legislative decree no. 28 / 2010 on the other. The body of this treatise will consist of analysis in the third chapter of the kind of contracts used by the Policentro Domus de Janas Corporation for the development of its commercial structures. It will also examine the linked contracts system prepared for the economic operation, the marketing of the areas. This sequence, which would eventually get underway with the signing of a preliminary leasing contract and then evolve into a sale of the same areas leased, makes it clear that they are specific in nature with regard to the so called organizational and promotional contract and the veritable business leasing contract. In the first of the two negotiations, the parties intend to base the economic operation and regulate all aspects about the start up and entrance of an entrepreneur in an integrated commercial structure. With the second, the strategy involved in deciding to give to that entrepreneur the right to use the areas through a kind of branch business leasing contract instead of a business lease or a rental of commercial space. 2 In conclusion, the final objective is to understand the peculiarities and limits of application of the model created by the Policentro and the eventual exportability to other kinds of commercial development projects. It is clear that negotiating tools such as commercial leasing allow for mobilizing capital and getting past restrictions on economic initiatives, restrictions due to the unwillingness of property owners to risk entrepreneurially during economic recession and to scarce creditfrom banking institutions. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{quadratic}} {{approximation of}} a linear mapping under affine constraints {{is a central}} problem in linear statistical inference. It is based on two fundamental orderings {{on the set of}} quadratic forms defined on a finite dimensional vector space E: one is Loewner ordering, and the other based on the trace of linear mappings of E into E. The direction of the affine subspace of constraints is a tensor product of two vector spaces. The search for minimum solutions is now replaced by investigation of minimal solutions, called optimal or admissible according to the ordering. A functional approach shows that we can obtain many identical results which often only depend on the linear structure of the considered vector spaces. We prove thereby two results: The first is a significant generalization of a theorem due to A. Olsen, J. Seely, and D. Birkes [11] on the completeness of the set of optimal or admissible solutions, and the second is theorem containing some necessary <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility.</b> This theorem is a consequence of an extension of an important theorem due to L.

The cases examined according to penal order proceedings constituted ca. 6 % of all criminal cases. They were concerned with the so-called trivial crime, directed mostly against property.

Moreover, reservations arose also with respect to negative prerequisites for penal order proceedings.

The analysis of the participation of the parties in hearings confirmed that in penal order proceedings the principles of directness, openness and of adversary trial system are absent, for in most instances the parties were not notified of the date of a court session. The examination of the contents of penal orders revealed that a prevailing penalty was a fine. Besides, the courts too often applied the additional penalty of publication of the penal order. As few as 13 % of penal orders were subject to objection, with only 7 % of penal orders objected to by the accused and their counsels.

40|$|We {{perform a}} study of the gravitating {{electrostatic}} spherically symmetric (G-ESS) solutions of Einstein field equations minimally coupled to generalized non-linear abelian gauge models in three space dimensions. These models are defined by lagrangian densities which are general functions of the gauge field invariants, restricted by some physical <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility.</b> They include the class of non-linear electrodynamics supporting ESS non-topological soliton solutions in absence of gravity. We establish that the qualitative structure of the G-ESS solutions of admissible models is fully characterized by the asymptotic and central-field behaviours of their ESS solutions in flat space (or, equivalently, by the behaviour of the lagrangian densities in vacuum and on the point of the boundary of their domain of definition, where the second gauge invariant vanishes). The structure of these G-ESS configurations for admissible models supporting divergent-energy ESS solutions in flat space is qualitatively the same as in the Reissner-Nordström case. In contrast, the G-ESS configurations of the models supporting finite-energy ESS solutions in flat space exhibit new qualitative features, which are discussed in terms of the ADM mass, the charge and the soliton energy. Most of the results concerning well known models, such as the electrodynamics of Maxwell, Born-Infeld and the Euler-Heisenberg effective lagrangian of QED, minimally coupled to gravitation, are shown to be corollaries of general statements of this analysis.

In Poland in years 1997 - 2002 the largest part of public assistance was directed to large state owned enterprises first of all in coal mining, agriculture as well as railway transportation sector and postal services. In year 2002 we could observe significant changes in the structure of this support. There was a great increase of support for the enterprises from private sector especially small and medium size. This change was due to the low of restructuring of public receivables. Enterprises use help in form of transfer of properties’ value and in form of decrease of tax burdens. Public assistance is a very important instrument for supporting competitiveness and elasticity. Its efficiency depends on the forms of support of entrepreneurs, cohesions of used instruments as well as on possibility of theirs implementation through subjects.

40|$|AbstractWe give a {{sufficient}} <b>condition</b> for <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> generalized Bayes estimators {{of the location}} vector of spherically symmetric distribution under squared error loss. Compared to the known results for the multivariate normal case, our sufficient condition is very tight and is close to being a necessary condition. In particular, we establish the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> generalized Bayes estimators {{with respect to the}} harmonic prior and priors with slightly heavier tail than the harmonic prior. We use the theory of regularly varying functions to construct a sequence of smooth proper priors approaching an improper prior fast enough for establishing the admissibility. We also discuss <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> minimaxity of the generalized Bayes estimator with respect to the harmonic prior...|$|R
40|$|The {{judiciary}} in Turkey {{is still}} {{preparing for the}} expected intermediate appellate review (istinaf) mechanism in Turkey although the official date for its functioning {{is yet to be}} specified. Under Turkish law, a first instance court decision can be appealed not because an assertion or a claim is rejected, but due to a substantive or procedural norm of law which should have been applied during the proceedings in an accurate manner. The scope of such review also covers the suitability of the first instance court’s decision. There are nonfunctional aspects to the judicial review as specified in the 2011 Code of Civil Procedure of which a major column of novelties consist of the suspended mechanism of dual appellate review. However, the 2011 Code of Civil Procedure regulates the intermediate appellate review as a series of procedural acts and steps. The reasons to appeal a first instance court’s decision can rather be deduced from the provisions of 2011 Code of Civil Procedure. In order to structure the reasons and stages of the intermediate appellate review in Turkey, a distinction is made in the present article between (i) review over the appeal’s <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility,</b> (ii) review <b>of</b> the decision’s legality, (iii) review of the decision’s legitimacy. Rationally, the reasons for intermediate appellate review should be construed as to accomodate at least the grounds for higher appellate review as well as the extraordinary judiciary review. As different areas of private law are based on different principles, it is noteworthy that cases referred to herein pertain to commercial law. Finally, due to the parallelism between the Turkish and the French legal systems, references to decisions given by the French jurisdiction on commercial matters are made throughout the present article...|$|R

In this paper, we give necessary <b>conditions</b> for <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> a finite group G over function fields of curves over complete discretely valued fields. Using this criterion, we give {{an example of a}} finite group which is not admissible over Qp(t). We also prove a certain Hasse principle for division algebras over such fields...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe study linear systems, {{described}} by operators A, B, C {{for which the}} state space X is a Banach space. We suppose that -A generates a bounded analytic semigroup and give <b>conditions</b> for <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> B and C corresponding to those in G. Weiss' conjecture. The crucial assumptions on A are boundedness of an H^∞ [...] calculus or suitable square function estimates, allowing to use techniques recently developed by N. Kalton and L. Weis. For observation spaces Y or control spaces U that are not Hilbert spaces we are led to a notion <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> extending previous considerations by C. Le Merdy. We also obtain a characterisation of wellposedness for the full system. We give several examples for admissible operators including point observation and point control. At the end we study a heat equation in X=L^p(Ω), p ∈(1,∞), with boundary observation and control and prove its wellposedness for several function spaces Y and U on the boundary ∂Ω...|$|R
