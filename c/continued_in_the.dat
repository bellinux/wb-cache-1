5|$|At the start, Hamilton, Massa and Kovalainen all {{maintained}} their grid positions. Hamilton quickly {{began to pull}} away from the other cars, at the rate of about half a second per lap. Behind the leading trio, Kubica passed Räikkönen off the grid, and went on to pass both Alonso and Trulli at the hairpin (turn 4), when Alonso's own attempted pass on Trulli delayed both drivers. The fight for fourth position <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stages of the race. Kubica ran wide at the final corner on lap four, impeding Trulli and therefore allowing Alonso to attempt an overtaking manoeuvre on the Toyota down the main straight. However, Trulli held on to his position, and Alonso was instead passed by Räikkönen, moving him down to sixth position. At the back of the field, Nakajima spun his Williams but recovered back onto the track and <b>continued</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race.|$|E
