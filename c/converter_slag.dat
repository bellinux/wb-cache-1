50|$|Reverberatory {{furnaces}} {{were often}} used to treat molten <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> to recover contained copper. This would be poured into the furnaces from ladles carried by cranes. However, the <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> is high in magnetite and some of this magnetite would precipitate from the <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> (due to its higher melting point), forming an accretion on the hearth of the reverberatory furnace and necessitating shut downs of the furnace to remove the accretion. This accretion formation limits the quantity of <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> that can be treated in a reverberatory furnace.|$|E
50|$|In March 1971, the {{practice}} of returning <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> to the reverberatory furnaces to recover the contained copper was discontinued. The slag return was a problem {{because of the high}} level of magnetite ("Fe3O4") in the slag. Magnetite has a higher liquidus temperature than the iron oxide ("FeO") normally found in the reverberatory furnace slag and it precipitated, causing a growing accretion in the reverberatory furnace, thus reducing the storage capacity of the furnace. MIM changed its <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> copper-recovery practice in 1971, and instead of returning all the hot <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> to the reverberatory furnace, allowed some of the slag to cool slowly and then treated it in the copper concentrator to produce a <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> concentrate.

40|$|The {{understanding}} and optimisation of the metallurgical processes require access to accurate {{data of the}} physical properties of slags. Viscosity {{is one of the}} most important properties in the case of metallurgical melts, in view of its direct effect on the kinetic conditions of the processes, and is one of the key factors to be taken into consideration in process modeling. The difficulty and high cost of measuring the viscosity of slags has led to development of number of viscosity models. Most of these models employ parameters extracted from experimental data of viscosity, which ensure the validity of the models in viscosity estimation. In this report models developed to estimate the viscosity of fully molten oxide slags were discussed. In addition viscosities of <b>converter</b> <b>slags</b> (Basic Oxygen Furnace, Argon-Oxygen Decarburization furnace) predicted with different models were compered. In the case of BOF-slag the Iida and the modified Urbain models seemed to be more reliable than the other models in predicting the viscosities. The values calculated by KTH model were too high for this high basic slag whereas in the case of NPL model the slag composition was observed to be outside of the working range of the model. Urbain model modified by Forsbacka as well as the modified Iida models takes account of chromium oxide as a separate component in the calculations and are thus assumed to be more reliable than the other models in predicting viscosities of chromium containing slags. However the reliability of these models is debatable in the case of high chromium containing slags e. g. AOD-slag after oxidising period due to existing of solid phases in the slag. Iida as well as the Urbain model modified by Forsbacka are also assumed to be reliable predicting viscosity of slag composition corresponding the AOD-slag after reduction period. Also NPL-model seemed to give reliable viscosity values, since in this case the slag composition is inside the working range of the model. Although there are plenty of experimentally measured viscosity data available for ternary systems, less data in limited ranges are available as the order of the system gets higher. Also lack of experimental data of very basic slag compositions as well as slags containing iron and chromium oxides is apparent. Due to lack of experimental data the performance of these models in predicting viscosities of <b>converter</b> <b>slags</b> was not able to evaluate.

Not only the total phosphorus distribution ratio but also the respective phosphorus distribution ratio among four basic oxides as components, i. e., CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO, in the slags and molten steel can be predicted theoretically by the developed IMCT phosphorus distribution ratio prediction model after knowing the oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface or the Fe (t) O activity in the slags and the related mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples in the slags. The calculated mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples in the slags equilibrated or reacted with molten steel show that the calculated equilibrium mole numbers or mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples, rather than the mass percentage of components, can present the reaction ability of the components in the slags. The predicted total phosphorus distribution ratio by the developed IMCT model shows a reliable agreement with the measured phosphorus distribution ratio by using the calculated mass action concentrations of iron oxides as presentation of slag oxidation ability. Meanwhile, the developed thermodynamic model for calculating the phosphorus distribution ratio can determine quantitatively the respective dephosphorization contribution ratio of Fe (t) O, CaO + Fe (t) O, MgO + Fe (t) O, and MnO + Fe (t) O in the slags. A significant difference of dephosphorization ability among Fe (t) O, CaO + Fe (t) O, MgO + Fe (t) O, and MnO + Fe (t) O has been found as approximately 0. 0 pct, 99. 996 pct, 0. 0 pct, and 0. 0 pct during a combined blown converter steelmaking process, respectively.

The phosphorus in molten steel beneath the slag-metal interface can be extracted effectively by the comprehensive effect of CaO and Fe (t) O in slags to form 3 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 and 4 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 until the carbon content is less than 0. 036 pct during a top-bottom combined blown steelmaking process...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The matte {{converting}} furnace s are {{found at the}} heart of the copper and nickel smelting processes where oxygen contained in air and industrial oxygen is used to oxidise iron in the furnace matte to produce blister copper or the iron free matte suitable for treatment in the downstream processes. A fundamental knowledge of the base metals matte smelting and converting processes system is valuable for maintaining a stable and optimum process operation. A mathematical model for the Ni - Cu - PGM matte converting process has been developed based on the assumption that the converting process is both in chemical and thermal equilibrium. The converting process demonstrated by the model is the Top Submerged Lance (TSL) base metal continuous converter that treats Ni - Cu - PGM furnace matte similar to the one utilized at one platinum smelter. The TSL PGM converter was chosen for the reasons that the Ausmelt/Isasmelt TSL smelting furnaces are high ly productive flexible smelting and converting units and environmentally friendly, that requires a low capital cost compared to other smelting processes. The model predicts the masses of the process inputs of air, oxygen, fuel coal or oil, silica flux and the outputs components contained in the three product s high grade matte, slag and offgas. The mathematical model utilises the matrix - inverse method that is used to solve the matrix representing a system of several linear equations to give the values of unknown variables. The mathematical matrix - inverse method provides us with the tool to solve many large linear equations arranged in a square matrix numerically to gives solutions. The matrix - inverse method was chosen because it is part of windows excel formulas as MINVERSE and MMULT formulas which is accessible on most computers with Microsoft windows program. The inverse of the matrices is solved using the Gauss - Jordan mathematical method. The study found that the matrix simulation model is able to give accurate predictions of the masses of the industrial TSL converter process inputs fuel, air, oxygen, and silica flux as well as the process outputs masses of the components of <b>converter</b> matte, <b>slag</b> and offgases. The model also indicated that changes in the feed matte composition, moisture in feed, matte feed rate, oxygen enrichment, bath operating temperature and fuel type results in change in one or more of the process inputs requirement and masses and composition of product phases. The simulated model results compare very well with the industrial plant process parameters sourced from one of the platinum smelters that use the TSL technology for {{converting furnace}} matte. The results predicted by the model provides good insight into the operations, control and design of the TSL Ni - Cu matte converter and therefore the model is regarded as an invaluable asset for predicting the process dynamics of the present and future converting units. The model provides a good understanding of the base matte converting process and as such will serve as a useful tool in improving and optimising the base metals converting processes without carrying out extensive and expensive tests. It is concluded from the study that the mathematical matrix - inverse calculation method is suitable for modelling the smelting and converting processes of the Ni - Cu - Fe - PGM matte in the TSL converter. The model results were validated through comparison with actual plant operating parameters sources from the relevant platinum smelter which indicated an accuracy of over 9 0 % on most parameters. The modelling of the base metal smelting and converting processes has valuably been furthered, however for complete confidence in the model results, further validation is recommended using other simulation softwares and methods...|$|R
40|$|Lintz-Donawitz (LD) <b>converter</b> <b>slag,</b> a {{by-product}} of the iron and steel-making industry is produced in large quantities in Isfahan, Iran. The slag contains 52. 8 and 2. 2 % (w/w) CaO and MgO, respectively. To {{determine the influence of}} LD slag on the chemical characteristics of three acid soils from Gilan, an incubation study was conducted. The soil samples were collected from 0 - 30 cm of rice and tobacco fields and a tea garden. Treatments were 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 % (w/w) of converter slag/kg soil. The slag was thoroughly mixed with 500 g soil in plastic pots. Soil moisture content was adjusted to near field capacity and changes in pH, EC and AB-DTPA-extractable Fe, Mn, Zn, P and K were determined at 1, 10, 30 and 60 days. Results showed that soil pH increased with increasing slag rates. Slag increased AB-DTPA-extractable P and Mn, the magnitude increase depend on the amount of slag applied. However, the effect of slag on AB-DTPA-extractable Fe depended on initial pH, initially decreasing at the pH range of 7. 4 - 8. 5 and then increasing at higher pH levels. Slag decreased AB-DTPA-extractable K especially in highly acid soil. In the present study, soil pH and AB-DTPA-extractable Fe decreased with time, though the effect of incubation time on pH was not significant. The effect of incubation time on AB-DTPA extractable Mn and P was different. Time effect on EC and AB-DTPA-extractable K was not significant. In general, soil chemical characteristics were more affected by slag rates than by incubation time. In conclusion, it seems that <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> is a suitable amendment for acid soils. It is suggested that the effect of LD <b>converter</b> <b>slag</b> on plant growth and chemical characteristics of acid soils be studied under field conditions...|$|E
