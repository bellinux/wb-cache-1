40|$|The Finite Strip Method (FSM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{efficient}} methods for structural analysis of bridges, reducing the time required for analysis without affecting the degree of accuracy. The Finite strip method is therefore an ideal platform for the traditional time-consuming dynamic analysis of long span bridges. The dynamic behavior of a continuous long span bridge significantly depends on the properties of all the bridge structural components. However, the current practice of using the finite strip method is limited to the analysis of the bridge deck subjected to simulated boundary conditions over the supports. The interactions between different bridge structures cannot be modeled using conventional methods. In this regard, this study introduces an integrated analytical solution for continuous long span bridges by modeling all the bridge components together, using the spline finite strip method. The Column Strips are developed to model the cantilever-behaved piers and towers, and <b>Cable</b> <b>Strip</b> is developed for the cables in long span bridges. In addition, a special Transition Section is developed to combine different structures in the finite strip environment. By representing the whole bridge as a single integrated system, the actual dynamic behavior of the bridge can be studied using the conventional dynamic analysis method. Moreover, by using the Pseudo Excitation Method (PEM), which is a fast complete quadratic combination algorithm using power spectral density matrix for random responses, the dynamic analysis of a complicated continuous long span structure can be performed in minimal time. In the study, the development of the Column Strips, <b>Cable</b> <b>Strip</b> and the Transition Section are presented, and the application of the time-history analysis method and PEM in the finite strip environment is introduced. Furthermore, three numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed solution...|$|E
40|$|Precise {{manipulation}} of micro objects became {{great interest in}} engineering and science with the advancements in microengineering and microfabrication. In this thesis, a magnetically levitated microgripper is presented for microhandling tasks. The use of magnetic levitation for positioning reveals {{the problems associated with}} modeling of complex surface forces and the use of jointed parts or wires. The power required for the levitation of the microgripper is generated by an external drive unit that makes further minimization of the gripper possible. The gripper is made of a biocompatible material and can be activated remotely. These key features make the microgripper a great candidate for {{manipulation of}} micro components and biomanipulation. In order to achieve magnetic levitation of microrobots, the magnetic field generated by the magnetic levitation setup is simulated. The magnetic flux density in the air gap region is improved by the integration of permanent magnets and an additional electromagnet to the magnetic loop assembly. The levitation performance is evaluated with millimeter size permanent magnets. An eddy current damping method is implemented and the levitation accuracy is doubled by reducing the positioning error to 20. 3 µm. For a MEMS-compatible microrobot design, the electrodeposition of Co-Ni-Mn-P magnetic thin films is demonstrated. Magnetic films are deposited on silicon substrate to form the magnetic portion of the microrobot. The electrodeposited films are extensively characterized. The relationship between the deposition parameters and structural properties is discussed leading {{to an understanding of the}} effect of deposition parameters on the magnetic properties. It is shown that both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetized films can be obtained using electrodeposition with slightly differentiated deposition parameters. The levitation of the electrodeposited magnetic samples shows a great promise toward the fabrication of levitating MEMS devices. The end-effector tool of the levitating microrobot is selected as a microgripper that can achieve various manipulation operations such as pulling, pushing, tapping, grasping and repositioning. The microgripper is designed based on a bent-beam actuation technique. The motion of the gripper fingers is achieved by thermal expansion through laser heat absorption. This technique provided non-contact actuation for the levitating microgripper. The analytical model of the displacement of the bent-beam actuator is developed. Different designs of microgripper are fabricated and thoroughly characterized experimentally and numerically. The two microgripper designs that lead to the maximum gripper deflection are adapted for the levitating microrobot. The experimental results show that the levitating microrobot can be positioned in a volume of 3 x 3 x 2 cm^ 3. The positioning error is measured as 34. 3 µm and 13. 2 µm when electrodeposited magnets and commercial permanent magnets are used, respectively. The gripper fingers are successfully operated on-the-fly by aligning a visible wavelength laser beam on the gripper. Micromanipulation of 100 µm diameter electrical wire, 125 µm diameter optical fiber and 1 mm diameter <b>cable</b> <b>strip</b> is demonstrated. The microgripper is also positioned in a closed chamber without sacrificing the positioning accuracy...|$|E

This system is based on the use of flat cables as readout elements, instead of the conventional copper strips.

50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the 3-ring system, variations in the design have raised safety concerns. For example, the move to mini rings and mini risers caused riser failures on some designs until riser strength was improved. The failure of some manufacturers to include stiff riser inserts and other hard housing cable guides to allow the free movement of the cutaway cable when risers and webbing are twisted has caused difficulty in cutting away from malfunctions with riser twists or harness deformations. The tolerance in the manufacture of the fabric risers and their connection to the rings is critical in maintaining the mechanical advantage of the 3-ring system and this has been compromised in some designs. Reversed risers placing the rings under the risers has prevented the rings moving freely and releasing under some cutaway scenarios. Replacement of the Lolon-F coating with Teflon impregnated compounds has caused both cracking and <b>cable</b> <b>stripping</b> problems.|$|R
50|$|DS3 {{interconnect}} cables {{must be made}} with true 75-ohm coaxial cable and connectors. Cables or connectors which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower {{the performance of the}} connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, Generic Requirements for Central Office Coaxial Cable, defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and <b>cable</b> <b>stripping</b> tools used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the true 75 ohm connectors known to work. RG-6 or even inexpensive RG-59 cable may work temporarily when properly connectorized, though it does not meet telephony technical standards. Type 735 26 AWG is used for interconnects up to 225 feet, and Type 734 20 AWG is used for interconnects up to 450 feet.|$|R

40|$|Actually, the Coriolis {{acceleration}} component {{experienced by}} axi-Downmagnetic tapes, paper sheets, textile fibers, band saws, aerial cable tramways, and crane hoist cables. Despite many advantages of these devices, noise and vibrations, particularly transverse vibra-tions, {{associated with the}} devices have limited their applications. For example, in magnetic tape drives, the vibration of a tape leads to signal modulation and accelerates the wear of the tape; in band saws, the vibration of a blade results in poor cutting quality. Therefore, understanding transverse vibrations of axially moving strings {{is important for the}} design of the devices. Furthermore, for high precision applications, it is desirable to introduce suitable control mechanisms to reduce vibrations of axially moving strings in order to improve performance of the devices. A string is a one-dimensional continuum that offers no resis-tance to bending. Since the gravitational force is sufficiently small compared with the tension force, the equilibrium configuration is a straight line. Many slender engineering elements such as belts, <b>cables,</b> <b>strips,</b> chains, tapes, ropes, and thread lines can be mod-eled as strings because their bending stiffness is relatively small. If slender engineering elements have rather large bending stiff-ness, they will be treated as moving beams. Slender engineering elements with curved equilibrium configurations will be treated as moving cables ~loose strings!. As for engineering elements that have considerable width, two-dimensional continuum models such as membranes, plates or shells should be used. The investigations on transverse vibrations and control of axi-ally moving strings have theoretical significance, because an axi-ally moving string is a simplest representative of distributed gy-roscopic systems. Axially moving strings, beams, cables, membranes, and plates all fall into the class of axially moving ally moving materials imparts a skew-symmetric or gyroscopic term to their governing equations. Due to particular characteristics of the gyroscopic term, the approaches developed in analysis and control of transverse vibrations of an axially moving string can be applied to other more complicated distributed gyroscopic systems. The relevant researches on transverse vibrations of axially mov-ing strings can be dated back to Skutc...|$|R

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of AS-Interface installations utilize the AS-Interface flat cable, defined {{as part of the}} AS-Interface specifications. A relatively small number of industries (e.g. valve control in process automation) use a round cable, mostly because it is easier to pull through conduit. While the shape of the cable does not matter (any other cable can be used) the electrical characteristics of the selected cable matters greatly. To prevent problems due to improper cable, most professionals suggest the AS-Interface flat cable. This cable is designed to make use of a cable piercing technology. When an AS-Interface module is installed on the network, piercing needles penetrate the cable jacket and displace the internal copper strands without cutting them. This allows AS-Interface modules to be installed anywhere on the network without cutting and preparing (i.e. removing <b>cable</b> jacket, <b>stripping</b> insulation and possibly applying a ferule) the cable first. The result is a faster installation without the chance of inadvertent shorts between the leads.|$|R

40|$|The BaBaR {{detector}} at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center {{is currently}} undergoing an upgrade {{to improve its}} muon and neutral hadron detection system. The Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) {{that had been used}} till now have deteriorated in performance {{over the past few years}} and are being replaced by Limited Streamer Tube (LSTs). Each layer of the system consists of a set of up to 10 streamer tube modules which provide one coordinate ({phi} coordinate) and a single ''Z-plane'' which provides the Z coordinate of the hit. The large area Z-planes (up to 12 m{sup 2 }) are 1 mm thick and contain 96 copper strips that detect the induced charge from avalanches created in the streamer tube wires. All the Z-planes needed for the upgrade have already been constructed, but only a third of the planes were installed last summer. After installing the 24 Z-planes last year, it was learned that 0. 7 % of the strips were dead when put inside the detector. This was mainly due to the delicate solder joint between the read-out <b>cable</b> and the <b>strip,</b> and since it is difficult to access or replace the Z-planes inside the detector, it is very important to perform various tests to make sure that the Z-planes will be efficient and effective in the long term. We measure the capacitance between the copper strips and the ground plane, and compare it to the theoretical value that we expect. Instead of measuring the capacitance channel by channel, which would be a very tedious job, we developed a more effective method of measuring the capacitance. Since all the Z-planes were built at SLAC, we also built a smaller 46 cm by 30 cm Z-plane with 12 strips just to see how they were constructed and to gain a better understanding about the solder joints...|$|R
