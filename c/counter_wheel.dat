5000|$|In a {{jurisdiction}} using {{a mechanical}} voting system, often called a [...] "voting machine", voters choose by pulling a lever {{next to their}} choice. There is a printed list of candidates, parties and referenda next to the levers indicating which lever is assigned to which choice. When the voter pulls a lever, it turns a connected gear in the machine, which turns a <b>counter</b> <b>wheel.</b> Each <b>counter</b> <b>wheel</b> shows a number, which {{is the number of}} votes cast using that lever. After the polls close, election officials check the wheels' positions and record the totals. No physical ballot is used in this system, except when the voter chooses to write-in a candidate. Other systems are replacing mechanical voting systems because they are inaccessible to disabled voters, do not have a physical ballot and are getting old.|$|E

5000|$|Tabulators {{built by}} the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1910 census could print their results. Prior to that, {{tabulator}} operators had to write down totals from <b>counter</b> <b>wheels</b> onto tally sheets. IBM developed a series of printing accounting machines, beginning in 1920. The 285 Numeric Printing Tabulator could read 150 cards per minute. The 405, introduced in 1934, could print at 80 lines per minute. It had 88 type bars, one for each print position, with 43 alphanumeric bars on the left, followed by 45 numeric-only bars. The IBM 402 series, introduced after World War II, had a similar print arrangement and was used by IBM in early computing devices, including the IBM Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{integrated}} {{power and}} attitude control for a bias momentum {{attitude control system}} is investigated. A pair of <b>counter</b> spinning <b>wheels</b> is used to provide the bias angular momentum and store/discharge energy for power requirement of the devices on the spacecraft. The roll/yaw motion is controlled by pitch magnetic dipole moment. The torque based control law of the wheels is designed, so that the desired pitch control torque is provided and the operation of charging/discharging energy is carried out based on the given power. System singularity in the control law of wheels is fully avoided by keeping the <b>wheels</b> <b>counter</b> spinning. A power management scheme using kinetic energy feedback is proposed to keep energy balance, which can avoid wheel saturation caused by superfluous energy. The minimum moment of inertia of the wheels {{is limited by the}} maximum bias angular momentum and the minimum energy, such constrains are analyzed in combination with the geometrical method. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme...|$|R

5000|$|Counter entries. An IBM tabulating machine, {{such as the}} 402 or 407 series {{would have}} several {{counters}} available in different sizes. (For example, the IBM 402/403 had four sets each of 2, 4, 6 and 8 digit counters, labeled 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 4A, 4B etc.) Each counter had two counter control entries to specify either addition (plus) or subtraction (minus). If neither were pulsed, no operation was performed. If addition was commanded, a digit impulse wired from a column to a counter entry hub started the <b>counter</b> <b>wheel</b> turning. It stopped automatically at zero time. Thus a pulse at 8 time caused the wheel to advance 8 steps, adding the value 8 to that counter position. Carries within a group were performed automatically. Carry in and carry out hubs allowed counters to be coupled, permitting longer numbers to be accumulated. Subtraction was more complicated and used nines complement arithmetic.|$|E

A desiccant wheel {{is the heart}} of this heat driven cooling system and it uses a solid desiccant for dehumidification with silica gel being the most widely used. Proper design of the wheel is important for the successful operation of the system and theoretical models are useful tools in predicting the performance and optimizing the design. In this paper, two heat and mass transfer models of a <b>counter</b> flow desiccant <b>wheel,</b> one considering only the gas-side resistance, and the other considering both solid-side and gas-side resistances are developed. The models show good agreement with experimental data. The model is used to conduct a comparative study on the performance of different wheel designs.

40|$|An often {{encountered}} {{problem when}} implementing a mass flow regulator in a rolling mill {{is the one}} with measurement of speed. The most widely used solution is to fit a pulse <b>counter</b> to a <b>wheel</b> that is {{in contact with the}} strip. Common problems with this design are for instance scratch marks on the strip and problems with the flatness measuring system.   One way of circumventing the aforementioned problems would be a non-contact measuring system. The market of today only offers systems based on the Doppler principle. This report evaluates three different systems for non-contact speed measurement. Important areas in the evaluation have been the ability to operate under normal rolling conditions, integration in existing control system and how well the sensor can be fitted to the rolling mill. The potential gains and possibilities for improvements have also been evaluated.   To be able to calculate the possible earning potential of the implementation of a mass flow regulator it’s very important to know how much scrap the rolling mill in question generates. The approximation showed that the average loss is 250 kg per coil which equals 2, 5 % of the weight of a full size coil. It’s possible to improve this number with a perfectly tuned mass flow regulator. Focus for the near future ought to be on designing a solution for measuring speed with existing components with a Laser-Doppler system as a backup plan...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{heat and}} {{moisture}} transfer between supply and exhaust air streams are investigated for a run-around {{system in which}} the coupling material is a desiccant coated solid that is transported between two exchangers. The finite difference method is used to solve the governing partial differential equations of the cross-flow heat exchangers in the supply and exhaust ducts. The outlet air properties are calculated for several inlet air operating conditions and desiccant properties. The accuracy of the heat transfer model is verified by comparing the simulations with well-known theoretical solutions for a single cross flow heat exchanger and a liquid coupled run-around system. The difference between the analytical predictions and the numerical model for sensible effectiveness for each exchanger and the run-around system were found to be less than 1 % over a range of operating conditions. The model is also verified by modifying the boundary conditions to represent a <b>counter</b> flow energy <b>wheel</b> and comparing the calculated sensible, latent, and total effectiveness values with correlations in the literature. Using the verified model for energy exchangers and the run-around energy recovery system, the sensible, latent and overall effectiveness are investigated in each exchanger and the run-around system during simultaneous heat and moisture transfer. The overall effectiveness of the run-around energy recovery system is dependent on the air flow rate, the solid desiccant flow rate, the desiccant properties, specific surface area, the size of each exchanger, and the inlet air operating conditions. The run-around system can achieve a high overall effectiveness when the flow rates and exchanger’s properties are properly chosen. Comparisons between the solid desiccant and salt solution run-around system effectiveness (Fan, 2005 and Fan et al, 2006) shows they are in good agreement. In a sensitivity study, the thickness of desiccant on the fibre is investigated in the solid run-around system. It was found that good performance is obtained with very thin desiccant coatings (1 or 2 micron). During the practical use of this system, a desiccant coated fibre could be inserted into very porous balls or cages that protect the desiccant coated fiber from mechanical wear. The performance sensitivity for this kind of run-around system is demonstrated...|$|R
