5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been <b>completed,</b> with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 <b>completed</b> in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 <b>completed</b> in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 <b>completed</b> in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was <b>completed</b> in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were <b>completed</b> in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was <b>completed</b> in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E

The minimal non-1-planar <b>complete</b> multipartite graphs are K3,7, K4,5, K1,3,4, K2,3,3, and K1,1,1,1,3.For instance, the <b>complete</b> bipartite graph K3,6 is 1-planar {{because it is a}} subgraph of K1,1,1,6, but K3,7 is not 1-planar.|$|R

The overpasses for Wiseman Boulevard, Westover Hills Boulevard and Military Drive between I-410 and Loop1604 were <b>completed</b> over the main lanes of SH151 in 1987. In 1988, the I-410 overpasses over the SH151 frontage roads were <b>completed,</b> as was the interchange with US90 at the eastern terminus. Also <b>completed</b> in 1988 were the frontage road bridges over Leon and Slick Ranch Creek, which enabled traffic to travel the entire corridor from Loop1604 to US90 {{by way of the}} frontage roads. The main lane overpasses at FM1957 (Potranco Road) and Ingram Road were <b>completed</b> in 1997. The overpasses at Pinn Road and Enrique M.

30|$|The <b>complete</b> {{convergence}} has {{a relatively}} <b>complete</b> development in probability limit theory. The notion of <b>complete</b> convergence {{was raised by}} Hsu and Robbins [12], and Chow [13] established <b>complete</b> moment convergence. The <b>complete</b> moment convergence is a more general version of the <b>complete</b> convergence. Lots of results on <b>complete</b> convergence and <b>complete</b> moment convergence for different sequences have been found under classical probability space. For example, Shen et al. [14], Wang et al. [15] and Wu and Jiang [16], and so on. Some recent papers had new results about <b>complete</b> convergence and <b>complete</b> moment convergence. For instance, Wang et al. [17] gained general results of <b>complete</b> convergence and <b>complete</b> moment convergence for weighted sums of some class of random variables, and Wang et al. [18] researched <b>complete</b> convergence and <b>complete</b> moment convergence for a class of random variables, and so on. In addition, the theorems of this paper are the extensions of the literature [14] under sub-linear expectation space. And we prove the theorems in this paper with the condition of C_V[|X|^pl(|X|^ 1 /α)]<∞, further Ê(|X|^pl(|X|^ 1 /α))≤ C_V[|X|^pl(|X|^ 1 /α)]<∞, 1 < p< 2 (l(x)> 0 is a slow varying function).|$|R
