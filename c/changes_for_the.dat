5|$|Auckland's {{population}} growth, {{as evidenced}} in the 2001 census, {{led to the}} formation for the 2002 general election of a new electorate called Helensville, which covered the north-western corner of the Auckland urban area. Key beat long-serving National MP Brian Neeson (whose own Waitakere seat had moved on paper to being a Labour seat through the boundary <b>changes)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National Party Helensville selection. At the 2002 election Key won the seat with a majority of 1,705, ahead of Labour's Gary Russell, with Neeson, now standing as an independent, coming third. Key won re-election with ease at the 2005 election garnering 63% of votes cast in Helensville, and increased his majority again in 2008, gaining 73% of the electorate vote.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced Tallon behind the stumps.

5|$|Debegri {{attempts}} to subdue Tlanth under {{the pretense of}} unpaid taxes and for conspiring to break the Covenant. Mel and Bran and their small group of forces – mostly farmers and tradespeople – initially succeed at foiling Debegari with guerilla tactics, such as blockading a stream to flood the enemy's camp. However, the war <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> worse when the capable Marquis of Shevraeth (25), {{the heir to the}} nearby principality of Renselaeus, takes command from Debegari. Shevraeth soon captures Mel and takes her to the capitol of Remalna-city, imprisoning her. Shevraeth tells her that the king orders her to surrender Tlanth's forces or face execution. Mel refuses, and soon escapes imprisonment with the help of their family spy, Azmus.|$|E
5|$|Despite making eight {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven Norwich started their League Cup campaign brightly with an entertaining 6–3 win at home to Bury with Johan Elmander scoring two of the six goals. The third round of the cup saw Norwich win away at Watford 3–2. Norwich were two goals down on 55 minutes but a goal from Josh Murphy, who was making his professional début, on 77 minutes inspired an extra time comeback. Chris Hughton again made eight <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fifth round of the cup which saw Norwich travel to Manchester United where two late goals resulted in a one-sided looking 4–0 defeat.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, {{the local}} {{authority}} began to systematically buy {{up all the}} stalls on the market, eventually bringing the entire market into public ownership. It was radically redesigned in the 1930s: stalls were arranged into parallel rows and a new City Hall was built along the entire {{western side of the}} marketplace to replace the by then inadequate Guildhall. This new arrangement survived with few significant <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the 20thcentury. By the 1990s, the market was becoming decrepit and, in 2003, proposals were made for another radical rebuilding of the area. These proposals were extremely controversial and were abandoned in 2004 in favour of a scheme which retained the parallel rows of stalls, but replaced the old stalls with steel units of four stalls each. The rebuilt market was completed in early 2006 {{and is one of the}} largest markets in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Geen {{was then}} {{selected}} and played three times for Wales in the 1912–1913 season. He earned his first cap against the same touring South Africans on 14 December. His next international appearance, under the captaincy of his Newport teammate Tommy Vile, was on 18 January 1913 against England. Wales were beaten in Cardiff 0–12. After the game, and {{disappointed by the}} performance {{of most of the}} team, the selectors made nine <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> upcoming match against Scotland. Only two backs were to be retained, Bobby Williams, the fullback, and Billy Geen, deemed the outstanding threequarter against England, moving from wing to centre. However, on the Wednesday preceding the encounter in Edinburgh, Geen withdrew after a training session due to an ongoing shoulder injury, and his place on the team was taken by Willie Watts.|$|E

The system allows users to access the car's computer and monitor fuel consumption, stability, g-force and vehicle dynamics. Other functions include data logging options, digital gauge displays, stopwatch, driver and racing options, along with controls for the Grange's Bi-Modal exhaust and Side Blind-Zone Alert. The HSV Enhanced Driver Interface and satellite navigation is standard across the E series 3 range.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, Mary Peters, the United States Secretary of Transportation, {{announced}} that the Second Avenue Subway would receive $1.3 billion in federal funding for the project's first phase, to be funded over a seven-year period. However, due to cost increases for construction materials and diesel fuel affecting the prices of contracts not yet signed, the MTA announced in June 2008 that certain features of the Second Avenue Subway would be simplified to save money. One set of changes, which significantly reduces the footprint of the subway {{in the vicinity of}} 72nd Street, is the alteration of the 72nd Street Station from a three-track, two-platform design to a two-track, single island platform design, paired with a simplification of the connection to the Broadway Line spur. Supplemental environmental impact studies covering the <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> proposed 72nd Street station was completed in June 2009.|$|E

5|$|Interest in {{producing}} an English-language version of Let the Right One In began in 2007 shortly {{before it was}} released to audiences. In 2008, Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> English version such as altering the setting from Stockholm to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.|$|E
5|$|Sinden made <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> third period. He benched Awrey and the Jean Ratelle line, {{going with}} three lines. In the third, Clarke scored to bring Canada within one. The Canadians {{attempted}} {{to get the}} equalizer, and Yvan Cournoyer put a puck off the post, but the Soviets broke out afterwards and Boris Mikhailov scored on the counter-attack to restore the two-goal lead with six minutes to play. Mikhailov skated across the Canadian net about 20 feet out, lured Dryden away from the net, then back-handed the puck into the net between his legs. The strategy of three lines, combined with the heat in the arena, had left the Canadians exhausted by then and the Soviets scored twice in the final minutes to finish with a 7–3 victory.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 1995 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. It was the firstround of the 1995 Formula One season. The 71-lap {{race was}} won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after {{starting}} from second position. David Coulthard {{finished second in}} a Williams, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari. Damon Hill, who started the race from pole position, spun out while leading on lap30 with an apparent gearbox problem, which was later {{found to be a}} suspension failure. Schumacher's win came despite Benetton encountering steering problems with his car during Friday practice, leading to him crashing heavily and necessitating steering component <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the event. Despite Schumacher's victory, Hill proved to be faster during the race, and seemed to be on course for a comfortable victory before his sudden retirement.|$|E

5|$|The {{changing}} strengths {{between the}} two opponents prompted the Luftwaffe to make operational <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle. Previous offensive campaigns had been initiated with Luftwaffe raids against opposing airfields to achieve air superiority. By {{this point in the}} war Red Army equipment reserves were extensive and the Luftwaffe commanders realised that aircraft could be easily replaced, making such raids futile. Therefore, this mission was abandoned. In addition, previous campaigns had made use of medium bombers flying well behind the frontline to block the arrival of reinforcements. This mission, however, was rarely attempted during Citadel.|$|E

Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett was promoted from the middle-order to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order.
