5000|$|The 620 has an APTC wet clutch. According to Ducati, the wet <b>clutch</b> reduces <b>lever</b> <b>operating</b> effort, {{ensuring}} gradual engagement, and {{incorporates a}} racing derived [...] "slipper" [...] device {{to reduce the}} tendency for the rear wheel to lock-up or chatter during aggressive downshifting.|$|R
5000|$|The classic farm tractor is {{a simple}} open vehicle, with two very large driving wheels on an axle below and {{slightly}} behind a single seat (the seat and steering wheel consequently are in the center), and the engine {{in front of the}} driver, with two steerable wheels below the engine compartment. This basic design has remained unchanged for a number of years, but enclosed cabs are fitted on almost all modern models, for reasons of operator safety and comfort. In some localities with heavy or wet soils, notably in the Central Valley of California, the [...] "Caterpillar" [...] or [...] "crawler" [...] type of tracked tractor became popular in the 1930s, due to superior traction and flotation. These were usually maneuvered through the use of turning brake pedals and separate track <b>clutches</b> <b>operated</b> by <b>levers</b> rather than a steering wheel.Four-wheel drive tractors began to appear in the 1960s. Some four-wheel drive tractors have the standard [...] "two large, two small" [...] configuration typical of smaller tractors, while some have four large, powered wheels. The larger tractors are typically an articulated, center-hinged design steered by hydraulic cylinders that move the forward power unit while the trailing unit is not steered separately.In the early 21st century, articulated or nonarticulated, steerable multitrack tractors have largely supplanted the Caterpillar type for farm use. Larger types of modern farm tractors include articulated four-wheel or eight-wheel drive units with one or two power units which are hinged in the middle and steered by hydraulic clutches or pumps. A relatively recent development is the replacement of wheels or steel crawler-type tracks with flexible, steel-reinforced rubber tracks, usually powered by hydrostatic or completely hydraulic driving mechanisms. The configuration of these tractors bears little resemblance to the classic farm tractor design.|$|R
50|$|For the {{transmission}} gearboxes, all DTM cars currently uses semi-automatic transmission with 6-speed gearbox operated by paddle shifters since 2012 season. From 2000-2011, all DTM cars were used sequential manual transmission with 6-speed gearbox <b>operated</b> by gear <b>lever.</b> The clutch of all DTM cars are CFRP 4-plate <b>clutch</b> <b>operated</b> by foot-pedal. Mechanical limited-slip differential are also allowed and {{constant velocity joint}} tripod driveshafts are also used.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> {{raises and}} lowers the center plate of the grip, {{which in turn}} {{operates}} the jaws. With the lever fully forward, the grip is open, and the cable is free to fall out (necessary when the cable crosses under another line, {{as well as at}} the ends of lines, and at [...] "let-go" [...] curves). With the cable lifted into the jaws, the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> is pulled back, forcing the jaws between two fixed rollers, and capturing the cable between the grip's replaceable mild-steel dies (but without applying pressure). To start moving the car, the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> is pulled back further, squeezing the cable between the dies.|$|R

50|$|The {{function}} of the breech mechanism is to close the breech, and thereby hold the cartridge case in place. The breechblock is {{the main part of}} the mechanism. It closes the breech and is hinged so that it can be swung open for loading. It is moved by an <b>operating</b> <b>lever.</b> The lever and breechblock are connected by an operating bar, operating in a T-slot in the breechblock carrier. Thus connected, complete motion of the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> to the right will cause the breechblock to rotate and to be swung clear of the breech recess. Swinging the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> fully to the right engages cam surfaces of the breechblock carrier and extractor, causing the extractor to eject the empty cartridge case.|$|R

50|$|Cable-pull 'V' Brakes {{also use}} the hub or metal discs as a braking surface. The hand <b>operated</b> <b>lever</b> pulls a metal cable to push {{polyurethane}} blocks against the braking surface. Advantages include low cost, low weight, and easy installation and maintenance. Disadvantages include low braking power, {{and the need to}} be regularly adjusted.|$|R
50|$|Screw jacks {{are limited}} in their lifting capacity. Increasing load {{increases}} friction within the screw threads. A fine pitch thread, which would increase {{the advantage of the}} screw, also reduces the size and strength of the threads. Longer <b>operating</b> <b>levers</b> soon reach a point where the lever will simply bend at their inner end.|$|R
50|$|The {{foot pedal}} {{operates}} by rod a transmission brake {{mounted on the}} rear end of the gearbox's second motion shaft. It {{is described as a}} powerful double-acting band brake. The brake's drum is surrounded by a water jacket. The hand <b>lever</b> <b>operated</b> side brakes (on the rear wheels) are also double-acting band brakes. These drums are fixed to the rear wheels. The <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> is inside the car by the right hand of the driver. The system of rods and levers incorporates an equalising arrangement.|$|R

50|$|Single or {{double ended}} access {{platforms}} are another {{variation of the}} mobile safety steps. As with standard mobile safety steps they have wheels which can be secured by a hand <b>operated</b> <b>lever,</b> but will have a larger platform. This allows for activities like maintenance work on walls, machinery and aircraft. The double ended platform will have two sets of steps with a platform in between.|$|R
50|$|Electromagnetic <b>clutches</b> <b>operate</b> {{electrically}} but transmit torque mechanically. This is {{why they}} used to be referred to as electro-mechanical clutches. Over the years, EM became known as electromagnetic versus electro-mechanical, referring more about their actuation method versus physical operation. Since the clutches started becoming popular over 60 years ago, the variety of applications and clutch designs has increased dramatically, but the basic operation remains the same today.|$|R

50|$|The Cineston's general {{operation}} {{is similar to}} the slide-controllers found in many modern mass transit systems. These controllers can be considered to be a re-implementation of the Cineston, as its fore-aft motion for acceleration and braking is the same. The change in layout is due to the introduction of new electronic controls, which do not require any mechanical connection between the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> and the electrical control systems.|$|R

50|$|Standardized limit {{switches}} are industrial control components manufactured {{with a variety}} of operator types, including lever, roller plunger, and whisker type. Limit switches may be directly mechanically operated by the motion of the <b>operating</b> <b>lever.</b> A reed switch may be used to indicate proximity of a magnet mounted on some moving part. Proximity switches operate by the disturbance of an electromagnetic field, by capacitance, or by sensing a magnetic field.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} prototype {{developed by}} Browning in early 1889 was a [...]44 caliber black powder cartridge rifle, weighing under 12 pounds. This version placed the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> {{at the front}} of the barrel, and was acted on directly by the muzzle blast. An improved design was offered to Colt in 1892. The lever was moved rearward, and power was supplied by a gas port about six inches (15 cm) back from the muzzle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Peabody rifles, {{manufactured by}} the Providence Tool Company, used a manually cocked side-hammer. Swiss gunsmith Friedrich Martini devised {{an action that}} resembled the Peabody but incorporated a hammerless striker cocked by the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> with the same motion that pivoted the block. The 1871 Martini-Henry which replaced the [...] "trapdoor" [...] Snider-Enfield was the standard British Army rifle of the later Victorian era, and the Martini was also a popular action for civilian rifles.|$|R
5000|$|The gun was {{originally}} chambered in 6mm Lee Navy and later, after {{the adoption of}} the Krag-Jørgensen rifle, in [...]30-40 Krag, 7×57mm Mauser caliber (the same cartridge used in the Spanish Model 1893 Mauser), and [...]30-06 Springfield in 1914. The 1914 version also included a lower tripod for firing prone; this is likely what led to the gun's nickname of [...] "potato digger", as the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> would dig into the ground if it were fired from too low a position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Peabody rifles, {{manufactured by}} the Providence Tool Company, used a manually cocked side-hammer. Swiss gunsmith Friedrich Martini developed a pivoting block action by modifying the Peabody, that incorporated a hammerless striker which was cocked by the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> {{with the same}} single, efficient motion that also pivoted the block. The 1871 Martini-Henry which replaced the [...] "trapdoor" [...] Snider-Enfield was the standard British Army rifle of the later Victorian era, and the Martini was also a popular action for civilian rifles.|$|R

50|$|The {{engine of}} the Mercedes 35 HP was {{at the front of}} the car driving the rear wheels through a large roller chain. The {{gearshift}} was at the driver's right side, featuring a gate change system with four forward speeds and a reverse gear. The drum like compact clutch system was attached to the flywheel. The flywheel consisted of a self-adjustable coil spring made up of wound spring steel. The tension at which the <b>clutch</b> <b>operated</b> was regulated by a conical cam.|$|R
50|$|Single-revolution {{clutches}} {{were developed}} in the 19th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> or (later) press of a button would trip the mechanism, engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine's crankshaft for exactly one revolution before disengaging the clutch. When the clutch is disengaged and the driven member is stationary. Early designs were typically dog clutches with a cam on the driven member used to disengage the dogs at the appropriate point.|$|R
50|$|A three-position safety {{attached}} at {{the rear}} of the bolt which <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> can be flicked from right (safety on, bolt locked) to middle (safety on, bolt can be opened for reloading), to left (ready to fire), but only when the rifle is cocked; otherwise, the safety will not move. The safety secures the firing pin. The safety catch lever is quite large, making it easy to operate, but posing a problem for mounting telescopic sights low above the receiver whilst retaining good operability of the safety catch lever.|$|R

50|$|In {{a typical}} lever action design, the <b>operating</b> <b>lever</b> lies under {{the rear of}} the gun, {{typically}} below the stock, and is hinged near the breech area. It is operated by rotating the lever down and forward, which causes the breechblock to slide rearward away from the barrel and eject the spent round. The potato digger mechanism bears some similarities to the basic lever action design, in effect it uses a lever that is powered by the expanding gasses that are propelling the bullet down the barrel, rather than the operator's hands.|$|R
50|$|On woodwind {{instruments}} {{such as a}} flute or saxophone, {{keys are}} finger <b>operated</b> <b>levers</b> used to open or close tone holes, thereby shortening or lengthening the resonating tube of the instrument. The keys on the keyboard of a pipe organ also open and close various valves, but the air flow is driven mechanically rather than lung powered, and the flow of air is directed through different pipes tuned for each note. The keys of an accordion direct the air flow from a manually operated bellows across various tuned vibrating reeds.|$|R
