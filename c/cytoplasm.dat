5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, {{like those}} of other insects, are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by <b>cytoplasm.</b> The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The <b>cytoplasm</b> is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
5|$|Specialized export {{proteins}} {{exist for}} translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the <b>cytoplasm</b> after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' {{central role in}} protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the <b>cytoplasm</b> is degraded rather than used in translation.|$|E
5|$|After DNA {{replication}} is complete, {{the cell}} must physically {{separate the two}} copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells. In prokaryotes(bacteria and archaea) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission, in which each circular genome attaches to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane invaginates to split the <b>cytoplasm</b> into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase, whereas the process of segregating chromosomes and splitting the <b>cytoplasm</b> occurs during M phase.|$|E
40|$|Four genomic {{arrangements}} of the maize mitochondrial atpA gene (encoding the α subunit of the F 1 ATPase), have been characterized. Most N (fertile) and S (male-sterile) <b>cytoplasms</b> contain two atpA {{arrangements of}} equal abundance. Prolonged exposure of blots of maize mitochondrial DNA probed with atpA-specific sequences show that <b>cytoplasms</b> previously reported to lack {{one of the}} atpA arrangements do contain the second arrangement but at low levels. Similarly, restriction fragments containing the atpA gene previously thought unique to male-sterile S and T <b>cytoplasms</b> are present in low abundance in fertile <b>cytoplasms.</b> These observations suggest that fertile and male-sterile <b>cytoplasms</b> of maize may be more closely related than previously thought, and suggest possible mechanisms to explain the observed mitochondrial genome diversity...|$|R
40|$|Techniques for {{preparing}} large populations of anucleate <b>cytoplasms</b> from cultured eukaryotic cells {{have only recently}} been described. The principal value of anucleate <b>cytoplasms</b> derives from studies {{that can be done}} after they are fused to whole cells. Since present methods for the isolation of heterokaryons are unsuitable for the selection of hybrids between whole cells and anucleate <b>cytoplasms</b> (heteroplasmons), a selective system has been developed which is based on the capacity of anucleate <b>cytoplasms</b> containing active enzymes to rescue whole cells poisoned with iodoacetate. Ethidium bromide, a partially effective agent, was used in conjunction with iodoacetate to demonstrate the feasibility of selecting heterokaryons by producing complementary biochemical lesions in the parental cell strains. The potential for artifact in these systems is not, however, entirely precluded...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} {{studies have shown}} that selection cannot maintain a joint nuclear-cytoplasmic polymorphism within a population except under restrictive conditions of frequency-dependent or sex-specific selection. These conclusions are based on fitness interactions between a diploid autosomal locus and a haploid cytoplasmic locus. We develop a model of joint transmission of X chromosomes and <b>cytoplasms</b> and through simulation show that nuclear-cytoplasmic polymorphisms can be maintained by selection on X-cytoplasm interactions. We test aspects of the model with a "diallel" experiment analyzing fitness interactions between pairwise combinations of X chromosomes and <b>cytoplasms</b> from wild strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Contrary to earlier autosomal studies, significant fitness interactions between X chromosomes and <b>cytoplasms</b> are detected among strains from within populations. The experiment further demonstrates significant sex-by-genotype interactions for mtDNA haplotype, <b>cytoplasms,</b> and X chromosomes. These interactions are sexually antagonistic [...] i. e., the "good" <b>cytoplasms</b> in females are "bad" in males [...] analogous to crossing reaction norms. The presence or absence of Wolbachia did not alter the significance of the fitness effects involving X chromosomes and <b>cytoplasms</b> but tended to reduce the significance of mtDNA fitness effects. The negative fitness correlations between the sexes demonstrated in our empirical study are consistent with the conditions that maintain cytoplasmic polymorphism in simulations. Our results suggest that fitness interactions with the sex chromosomes may account for some proportion of cytoplasmic variation in natural populations. Sexually antagonistic selection or reciprocally matched fitness effects of nuclear-cytoplasmic genotypes may be important components of cytonuclear fitness variation and have implications for mitochondrial disease phenotypes that differ between the sexes...|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} interact with the exosome complex in both the <b>cytoplasm</b> and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome complex. In the <b>cytoplasm,</b> the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.|$|E
5|$|Cystidia {{that are}} located {{along the edge}} of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of <b>cytoplasm</b> formed where numerous thin plates of <b>cytoplasm</b> meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the <b>cytoplasm</b> may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E

40|$|Exceptionally well-preserved Miocene pollen {{from the}} Bochnia salt mine of {{southern}} Poland is reported herein.  The halite deposits within the salt mine belonging to Late Badenian (Miocene) marine evaporites originated in the Paratethys. Rounded and angular structures are present inside pollen grains. On {{the basis of}} the similarity with plasmolyzed pollen grains of modern plants, these structures are considered to represent <b>cytoplasms</b> plasmolyzed in the condensed brine prior to fossilization. Two forms of plasmolyzed <b>cytoplasms</b> (concave and convex) can be observed in modern pollen. Both are distinguished in the investigated fossil material. In porate and colporate grains the shape of the plasmolyzed cellular content is concave while in inaperturate it is convex. The plasmolysis form depends on the type of apertures and pollen shape. The percentage of pollen with fossilized <b>cytoplasms</b> within individual taxa is a valuable environmental indicator, as it depends on the proximity of the pollen-producing plant assemblages to the depositional setting...|$|R
40|$|The {{indirect}} method of the fluorescent antibody (FA) technique {{was applied to}} observe primary porcine kidney cultured cells infected with porcine enterovirusess (V 76 and Kr 69 TC strains). Halo-like specific fluorescence was present {{in one part of}} the <b>cytoplasms</b> adjoined to the nuclei of the infected cells and rather large fluorescent granules were also scattered there 5 hours after inoculation (HAI), the first observation time. In the following time, the fluorescent granules tended to become smaller and to aggregate densely in the <b>cytoplasms</b> surrounding the nuclei of the cells. Twenty to 25 HAI, a cytopathic effect (CPE) consisting of shrinking and rounding of the fluorescent cells became obvious. The cellular and nuclear membranes became indistinct and dust-like fluorescenet granules filled the <b>cytoplasms</b> and the nuclei. The most suitable observation time in the diagnostic tests was confirmed to be from 15 to 20 HAI...|$|R
5|$|In prokaryotes endomembranes are rare, {{although}} in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded {{and most of}} the cell <b>cytoplasm</b> is filled with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering membranes may even form enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the <b>cytoplasm</b> and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the <b>cytoplasm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nuclear import {{depends on}} the importin binding its cargo in the <b>cytoplasm</b> and {{carrying}} it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the <b>cytoplasm.</b>|$|E

50|$|Connexins, such as GJA10, are {{involved}} in the formation of gap junctions, intercellular conduits that directly connect the <b>cytoplasms</b> of contacting cells. Each gap junction channel is formed by docking of 2 hemichannels, each of which contains 6 connexin subunits.|$|R
5|$|RNAi is an RNA-dependent gene {{silencing}} {{process that is}} controlled by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and is initiated by short double-stranded RNA molecules in a cell's <b>cytoplasm,</b> where they interact with the catalytic RISC component argonaute. When the dsRNA is exogenous (coming from infection by a virus with an RNA genome or laboratory manipulations), the RNA is imported directly into the <b>cytoplasm</b> and cleaved to short fragments by Dicer. The initiating dsRNA can also be endogenous (originating in the cell), as in pre-microRNAs expressed from RNA-coding genes in the genome. The primary transcripts from such genes are first processed to form the characteristic stem-loop structure of pre-miRNA in the nucleus, then exported to the <b>cytoplasm.</b> Thus, the two dsRNA pathways, exogenous and endogenous, converge at the RISC.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding <b>cytoplasm,</b> serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the <b>cytoplasm.</b> The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
5|$|However, in dinoflagellates, {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} remains intact, the centrosomes {{are located in}} the <b>cytoplasm,</b> and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.|$|E

A bone X-ray showed a solitary cystic osteolytic lesion in the right iliac bone. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis showed no demonstrable M-protein, and bone-marrow aspirates did not show any myeloma cells. Histologic examination of the tumor revealed aggregation of plasma cells with massive extracellular infiltration of the rhomboid-shaped crystalline structures. In immunoperoxidase staining, both these crystalline structures and the <b>cytoplasms</b> of the myeloma cells demonstrated a positive reaction for lambda light chain. By electron microscope, the large extracellular crystalline structures were observed, and we found unique rhomboid or rectangular-shaped crystalline structures in the <b>cytoplasms</b> of the myeloma cells...|$|R
40|$|Mitogen－{{activated}} protein (MAP) kinase cascades are activated {{in response}} to various extracellular stimuli. p 38 MAP kinase {{is one of the}} MAP kinase family and is activated {{in response to}} various extracellular stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses. To obtain information {{about the role of the}} p 38 MAP kinase in the neurons and the glial cells after axotomy, we nvestigated changes of p 38 MAP kinase expression in the dorsal motor nucleus(DMN) of the vagus nerve and the hypoglossal nucleus after axotomy in adult rats using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques. Expression of p 38 MAP kinase mRNA was observed in the <b>cytoplasms</b> of the neurons in control rats, and showed no marked changes after axotomy. Three days after axotomy, however, expression of p 38 MAP kinase mRNA was observed in the <b>cytoplasms</b> of perineuronal microglias in both nuclei. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of p 38 MAP kinase in the <b>cytoplasms</b> and nuclei of neurons in both nuclei in control rats. The stronger expression of activated p 38 MAP kinase was observed in the DMN ofthe vagus nerve than in the hypoglossal nucleus. After axotomy，the expression of p 38 MAP kinase, inactive and active, was reduced in the nuclei of neurons in both nuclei, while perineuronal microglias showed increased expression in their <b>cytoplasms</b> and nuclei. These findings indicate that the reduction of the expression of p 38 MAP kinase, inactive and active, influences the transcription factors, and plays an important role in retrograde neuronal reactions. Moreover, the increased expression of p 38 MAP kinase in the perineuronal microglias may be related to microglial cell reactions and retrograde neuronal reactions...|$|R

5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three nucleotides (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the <b>cytoplasm,</b> where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and <b>cytoplasm</b> compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After {{a certain amount of time}} the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous carcinomas are a rare form of endometrial cancer, {{making up}} less than 1–2% of all {{diagnosed}} endometrial cancer. Mucinous endometrial carcinomas are most often stage I and grade I, giving them a good prognosis.

It was of interest, therefore, to determine whether Yb subunits isolated from rat liver nuclei would return to nuclear fractions upon reintroduction to cell <b>cytoplasms</b> via red-blood-cell-mediated fusion. Labelled Yb subunits were associated with nuclear fractions 60 min after cell fusion. The microinjected protein remained associated with the nuclei for 18 h and was not extractable with low-salt washes.
