With Kunming in China as a case study, the determinants of long-duration <b>commuting</b> trips were identified based on logistic regression model. The results indicated that age, education level, number of workers, presence of retirees, and residential location {{have a significant impact}} on the occurrence of long-duration <b>commuting</b> trips. The ideal <b>commuting</b> times and tolerance thresholds of <b>commuting</b> time of long-duration commuters were also investigated. The statistical results revealed the distributions of ideal <b>commuting</b> times and tolerance thresholds of <b>commuting</b> time of both short- and long-duration commuters. The average tolerance threshold of <b>commuting</b> time and the average ideal <b>commuting</b> time of long-duration commuters were greater than those of short-duration commuters. For 97. 2 % of the long-duration commuters, their actual <b>commuting</b> time was longer than the ideal <b>commuting</b> time; this finding indicates that most long-duration commuters are dissatisfied with their <b>commuting</b> time.

5|$|The {{original}} railroad between San Francisco and San Jose (known as the Peninsula <b>Commute)</b> {{was built}} by the San Francisco and San Jose Rail Road in 1863. In 1870 the railroad was acquired by Southern Pacific. Southern Pacific double tracked the line in 1904. In 1958 the railroad had record ridership, 7.5 million passengers. The popularity of the railroad began to decline and in 1977 Southern Pacific petitioned to the state government to discontinue Peninsula <b>Commute.</b> After months of negotiation, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) reached {{an agreement with the}} three counties of which the Peninsula <b>Commute</b> ran through to continue rail operation. Under the agreement, the system was renamed Caltrain and operation responsibilities were shared by Caltrans, Southern Pacific and the three counties. The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board was formed in 1987, and it bought the right of way of Caltrain from Southern Pacific in late 1991 for $220million. The PCJPB formally took over the operation of Caltrain in 1992 and contracted Amtrak to operate the system. In the same year, Caltrain extended to Gilroy. Amtrak's contract with PCJPB was renewed in 2001.|$|E

College Park is served only on weekdays during Bellarmine College Preparatory's school <b>commute</b> time. Tamien {{is served by}} train on weekdays and by shuttle bus on weekends. The five southernmost stations—Capitol, Blossom Hill, Morgan Hill, San Martin, and Gilroy—are served only on weekdays during <b>commute</b> time.

40|$|Studies {{that model}} {{the effects of}} land use on <b>commuting</b> {{generally}} use a trip-based approach or a more aggregated individual-based approach: i. e. <b>commuting</b> is conceptualized in terms of modal choice, distance and time per single trip, or in terms of daily <b>commuting</b> distance or time. However, people try to schedule activities in a daily pattern and, thus, consider tours instead of trips. Data from the 2000 to 2001 Travel Behaviour Survey in Ghent (Belgium) illustrate that car use and <b>commuting</b> times significantly differ between <b>commuting</b> trips within work-only tours and more complex tours. Therefore, this paper considers trip-related decisions simultaneously with tour-related decisions.
