40|$|Cholecystokinin (CCK) -induced {{pancreatic}} {{growth in}} mice involves parallel increases in DNA and protein. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway regulates mRNA translation and its activation is implicated in growth of various tissues. The {{aim of this}} study was to elucidate whether mTOR activation is required for pancreatic growth in a mouse model of increased endogenous CCK release. In mice fed chow containing the synthetic protease inhibitor <b>camostat,</b> protein synthetic rates and phosphorylation of two downstream targets of mTOR, eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E binding protein 1 (4 E-BP 1) and the ribosomal protein S 6 (S 6), increased in comparison with fasted controls. The camostat-induced increases in protein synthesis and 4 E-BP 1 and S 6 phosphorylation were almost totally abolished by administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin 1 h prior to <b>camostat</b> feeding. In contrast, the phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and JNK and the expression of the early response genes c-jun, c-fos, ATF 3 and egr- 1 induced by <b>camostat</b> feeding were not affected by rapamycin.

40|$|Inhibition of airway {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC) function enhances mucociliary clearance (MCC). ENaC is positively regulated by channel-activating proteases (CAPs), and CAP inhibitors are therefore predicted {{to be beneficial}} in diseases associated with impaired MCC. The aims {{of the present study}} were to 1) identify low-molecular-weight inhibitors of airway CAPs and 2) to establish whether such CAP inhibitors would translate into a negative regulation of ENaC function in vivo, with a consequent enhancement of MCC. To this end, <b>camostat,</b> a trypsin-like protease inhibitor, provided a potent (IC 50 ∼ 50 nM) and prolonged attenuation of ENaC function in human airway epithelial cell models that was reversible upon the addition of excess trypsin. In primary human bronchial epithelial cells, a potency order of placental bikunin < <b>camostat</b> < 4 -guanidino-benzoic acid 4 -carboxymethyl-phenyl ester < aprotinin << soybean trypsin inhibitor = α 1 -antitrypsin, was largely consistent with that observed for inhibition of prostasin, a molecular candidate for the airway CAP. In vivo, topical airway administration of <b>camostat</b> induced a potent and prolonged attenuation of ENaC activity in the guinea pig trachea (ED 50 = 3 μg/kg). When administered by aerosol inhalation in conscious sheep, camo-stat enhanced MCC out to at least 5 h after inhaled dosing. In summary, <b>camostat</b> attenuates ENaC function and enhances MCC, providing an opportunity for this approach toward the negative regulation of ENaC function to be tested therapeutically.

40|$|Background ENaC (Epithelial Na+ channel) {{has been}} shown to be {{involved}} in CF and CF-like diseases. Although in last years our knowledge has greatly improved, the exact role and molecular mechanisms involved deserve further studies. The wild-type but deregulated ENaC may be a better therapeutic target than the mutated CFTR. Proteolytic activation and epigenetics could play a role both as regulatory mechanisms and as therapeutic targets. Aims The functional characterization of mutations in ENaC genes, identified in CF patients, requires a cellular model that recapitulates the physiological interactions between ENaC and CFTR channels. To this end, we transfected FRT (Fisher Rat Thyroid) cells, which do not express endogenous ENaC and CFTR genes, with tagged human ENaC genes. Moreover, we investigated whether epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation and chromatin compaction), known to control several biological functions, are involved in the physiologic and pathologic regulation of ENaC genes and whether inhibition of ENaC by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), curcumin and <b>camostat</b> may be synergistic or additive. Methods Mammalian expression vectors carrying the three tagged ENaC genes were achieved for each wild-type human ENaC subunit and used to transfect FRT cells transiently. To study ENaC activity, we measured fluid absorption from the apical side in polarized cells in the absence or in the presence of a low-molecular weight trypsin-like protease inhibitor <b>camostat</b> mesylate at different doses (0. 3 - 30 µM). Moreover we measured fluid absorption in 16 HBE, CFBE and primary bronchial epithelial cells both wild-type and mutated homozygous F 508 del / F 508 del after treatment with with 50 µM <b>camostat,</b> 100 µM SAM or 6 µM curcumin separately or in combination. Results FRT transfected with ENaC subunits in a ratio of alpha, beta and gamma of 2 : 1 : 1 showed a significantly higher fluid absorption than non-transfected cells. Nevertheless, <b>camostat</b> reduced significantly the rate of fluid reabsorption in transfected cells in a dose-dependent way. Concerning the epigenetic approach, in both 16 HBE and CFBE all three compounds lowered the fluid absorption rate, with the strongest effect provided by curcumin in 16 HBE and by SAM and <b>camostat</b> in CFBE. Both in 16 HBE and CFBE no either synergic or additive effect was detected. In WT primary cells a significant effect was obtained by SAM and <b>camostat</b> and when all the three drugs were used in combination. In mutated homozygous F 508 del / F 508 del primary cells, SAM lowered fluid absorption both alone or in combination with the other compounds. A significant reduction of fluid absorption was also detected when <b>camostat</b> alone was used and when all the three drugs were used in combination. Conclusions We have found optimal doses of <b>camostat</b> as inhibitor of ENaC function in a heterologous expression system by a fluid absorption assay. The goal of the following work will be to analyze transient and stable ENaC-FRT clones with CFTR expression. Moreover, our results suggest that the function of ENaC, as evaluated by fluid absorption assay, may be downregulated by epigenetic modulation acting on both DNA methylation and chromatin, as well as by inhibiting peptidase.

40|$|CONTEXT: The tumor protein p 53 -induced nuclear protein 1 (TP 53 INP 1) gene {{was found}} using DNA {{microarray}} technology as an overexpressed gene in acute pancreatitis.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated TP 53 INP 1 gene expression and its relationship with p 53 and apoptosis in spontaneous chronic pancreatitis in the Wistar-Bonn/Kobori rat. METHODS: Ninety four-week-old male Wistar-Bonn/Kobori rats were fed a special breeding diet until sacrifice. <b>Camostat</b> mesilate (n= 30) or a herbal medicine (Saiko-keishi-to; n= 30) were mixed with the diet, while the other 30 rats were untreated. The rats were sacrificed every 4 weeks for 20 weeks, and the pancreas was examined. In addition, 6 four-week-old male Wistar-Bonn/Kobori rats were sacrificed and studied as starting reference. Finally, Wistar rats (n= 36) were studied as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: TP 53 INP 1 mRNA expression was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using semi-quantitative analysis, direct sequencing and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: TP 53 INP 1 mRNA was strongly expressed at 12 weeks when chronic pancreatitis developed, with a second peak at 20 weeks. The expression kinetics of TP 53 INP 1 mRNA paralleled acinar cell apoptosis assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. The p 53 mRNA expression showed a single peak at 12 weeks. In situ hybridization revealed that TP 53 INP 1 mRNA was expressed mainly in acinar cells. Therapeutic drugs such as <b>camostat</b> mesilate and a herbal medicine Saiko-keishi-to suppressed the TP 53 INP 1 mRNA expression. TP 53 INP 1 mRNA induction in acinar cells was confirmed with in vitro experiments using an arginine-induced rat pancreatic acinar AR 4 - 2 J cell injury model.

In this study, we examined if CM {{has a distinct}} renoprotective effect from telmisartan (TE), a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) inhibitor, on the progression of CKD. We evaluated the effect of CM (400  mg/kg/day) and/or TE (10  mg/kg/day) on renal function, oxidative stress, renal fibrosis, and RAS components in the adenine-induced rat CKD model following 5 -weeks treatment period. The combination therapy with CM and TE significantly decreased the adenine-induced increase in serum creatinine levels compared with each monotherapy, although all treatment groups showed similar reduction in blood pressure. Similarly, adenine-induced elevation in oxidative stress markers and renal fibrosis markers were significantly reduced by the combination therapy relative to each monotherapy. Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} combination therapy on plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was similar to that of TE monotherapy, and CM had no effect on both PRA and PAC, suggesting that CM has a distinct pharmacological property from RAS inhibition. Our findings indicate that CM could be a candidate drug for an add-on therapy for CKD patients who had been treated with RAS inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Prostasin {{or human}} channel-activating {{protease}} 1 {{has been reported}} to {{play a critical role in}} the regulation of extracellular sodium ion transport via its activation of the epithelial cell sodium channel. Here, the structure of the extracellular portion of the membrane associated serine protease has been solved to high resolution in complex with a nonselective d-FFR chloromethyl ketone inhibitor, in an apo form, in a form where the apo crystal has been soaked with the covalent inhibitor <b>camostat</b> and in complex with the protein inhibitor aprotinin. It was also crystallized in the presence of the divalent cation Ca+ 2. Comparison of the structures with each other and with other members of the trypsin-like serine protease family reveals unique structural features of prostasin and a large degree of conformational variation within specificity determining loops. Of particular interest is the S 1 subsite loop which opens and closes in response to basic residues or divalent ions, directly binding Ca+ 2 cations. This induced fit active site provides a new possible mode of regulation of trypsin-like proteases adapted in particular to extracellular regions with variable ionic concentrations such as the outer membrane layer of the epithelial cell...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEmerging {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} aldosterone has direct deleterious effects on the kidney independently of its hemodynamic effects. However, the detailed mechanisms of these direct effects remain to be elucidated. We have previously reported that <b>camostat</b> mesilate (CM), a synthetic serine protease inhibitor, attenuated kidney injuries in Dahl salt-sensitive rats, remnant kidney rats, and unilateral ureteral obstruction rats, suggesting that some serine proteases {{would be involved in}} the pathogenesis of kidney injuries. The current study was conducted to investigate the roles of serine proteases and the beneficial effects of CM in aldosterone-related kidney injuries. We observed a serine protease that was activated by aldosterone/salt in rat kidney lysate, and identified it as plasmin with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Plasmin increased pro-fibrotic and inflammatory gene expressions in rat renal fibroblast cells. CM inhibited the protease activity of plasmin and suppressed cell injury markers induced by plasmin in the fibroblast cells. Furthermore, CM ameliorated glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in the kidney of aldosterone/salt-treated rats. Our findings indicate that plasmin has important roles in kidney injuries that are induced by aldosterone/salt, and that serine protease inhibitor could provide a new strategy for the treatment of aldosterone-associated kidney diseases in humans...|$|E

A serine protease prostasin has been demonstrated to have {{a pivotal role in}} the activation of the epithelial sodium channel. Systemic administration of adenovirus carrying human prostasin gene in rats resulted in an increase in plasma prostasin and aldosterone levels. However, the mechanism by which the elevation of prostasin levels in the systemic circulation stimulated the plasma aldosterone levels remains unknown. Therefore, we examined if prostasin increases the aldosterone synthesis in a human adrenocortical cell line (H 295 R cells). Luciferase assay using CYP 11 B 2 promoter revealed that prostasin significantly increased the transcriptional activity of CYP 11 B 2. Prostasin significantly increased both CYP 11 B 2 mRNA expression and aldosterone production in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, treatment with <b>camostat</b> mesilate, a potent prostasin inhibitor, had no effect on the aldosterone synthesis by prostasin and also a protease-dead mutant of prostasin significantly stimulated the aldosterone production. A T-type/L-type calcium channel blocker and a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor significantly reduced the aldosterone synthesis by prostasin. Our findings suggest a stimulatory effect of prostasin on the aldosterone synthesis by adrenal gland throug...|$|E
40|$|There is no proven {{specific}} {{drug therapy}} {{for the treatment}} of acute pancreatitis, including protease inhibitors. In this virtual Round Table, our invited authors reviewed the past, present, and projected future clinical relevance of protease inhibitors. Through their discussion, protease inhibitors are demonstrated to have broad inhibitory actions on serine proteases, the coagulation system, the complement system and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, both in vitro and in vivo. We are assured that proteases remain an important and active field of study. Several protease inhibitors, including gabexate mesilate, nafamostat mesilate and ulinastatin, have been used {{for the treatment of}} acute pancreatitis in Japan [1, 2]. <b>Camostat</b> mesilate, an orally active protease inhibitor, has also been used for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis [2]. Their major action in suppressing pancreatitis is that of inactivating trypsin and preventing autodigestion. In recent years, several actions of a protease inhibitor have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo studies. For example, gabexate has been revealed to inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) activation in human monocytes or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) [3, 4]. NF-kappa B plays a crucial role in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, and apoptosis [5, 6]. Therefore, gabexate has been hypothesized to have various functions in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, if gabexate therapies targe...|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease that remains refractory to current therapies. To characterize the expression and {{activity of the}} membrane-anchored serine protease matriptase in IPF in humans and unravel its potential role in human and experimental pulmonary fibrogenesis. Matriptase expression was assessed in tissue specimens from patients with IPF versus control subjects using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting, while matriptase activity was monitored by fluorogenic substrate cleavage. Matriptase-induced fibroproliferative responses and the receptor involved were characterized in human primary pulmonary fibroblasts by Western blot, viability, and migration assays. In the murine model of bleomycin-induced {{pulmonary fibrosis}}, the consequences of matriptase depletion, either by using the pharmacological inhibitor <b>camostat</b> mesilate (CM), or by genetic down-regulation using matriptase hypomorphic mice, were characterized by quantification of secreted collagen and immunostainings. Matriptase expression and activity were up-regulated in IPF and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In cultured human pulmonary fibroblasts, matriptase expression was significantly induced by transforming growth factor-β. Furthermore, matriptase elicited signaling via protease-activated receptor- 2 (PAR- 2), and promoted fibroblast activation, proliferation, and migration. In the experimental bleomycin model, matriptase depletion, by the pharmacological inhibitor CM or by genetic down-regulation, diminished lung injury, collagen production, and transforming growth factor-β expression and signaling. These results implicate increased matriptase expression and activity in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in human IPF and in an experimental mouse model. Overall, targeting matriptase, or treatment by CM, which is already in clinical use for other diseases, may represent potential therapies for IP...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis we {{describe}} the utilization of the live vaccine delivery vector, L. lactis {{for the development of}} an oral vaccine against EHEC infection. The vaccine is based on the recombinant expression of the EHEC T 3 SS protein, EspB in L. lactis. The recombinant vaccine strains could successfully induce mucosal and systemic immune responses in mice upon oral immunization. These responses characterized by the presence of EspB-specific IgA antibodies in the feces and total Igs in the serum. Additionally, a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 response was detected in Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. Furthermore, immunized mice showed protection against intestinal colonization by E. coli O 157 :H 7 upon oral challenge. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the potential of EspB as a candidate for oral vaccination against EHEC as well as the value of L. lactis as a vaccine delivery vector. The development of an oral vaccine based on the “GRAS” vector, L. lactis, can be particularly beneficial to infants and the elderly, which are the high risk groups for the complications of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Additionally, the present thesis we address the issue of the gastrointestinal survival of L. lactis in pigs. We offer a proof of concept for the feasible use of aluminium hydroxide (bile acid binder) and <b>camostat</b> mesylate (oral trypsin inhibitor) in oral formulations of L. lactis-based vaccines to improve the gastrointestinal survival of the bacterium in pigs. This will particularly allow the validation of L. lactis-based vaccines in porcine models of infection, which are proven more reliable in the case of EHEC infection. Additionally, with consideration to the physiological similarities between pigs and humans, the application of these protectants can be extended to improve the gastrointestinal survival of L. lactis in humans...|$|E
