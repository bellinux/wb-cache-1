500|$|The episode {{can also}} be seen as a story of revenge; it can be {{imagined}} that Christine has repressed the memory of her first boyfriend, and that he [...] "has come back into her life seeking revenge". On this interpretation, the Stranger is the boyfriend, and causes the crash by stepping out in front of Christine's car. McDowall suggests that the oddness early in the episode suggests that the story may be about [...] "an obsessive ex [...] a stalker". There is also indication that the episode is a ghost story. While Boyd sees this as misdirection {{on the part of the}} writers, for Benji Wilson, writing in the Daily Telegraph, the story is about ghosts, [...] "but not in the normal way – by the <b>close</b> <b>you</b> realised everyone's life is a ghost story, it’s just that your memories are the ghosts." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming <b>close</b> <b>you</b> could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by television critics. Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a {{nine out of}} ten rating, and opined that the episode was a [...] "home run episode" [...] for the series. Harrison continued: [...] "Its central conflict is intense, its action is solid, and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right. Light on the gore and heavy on the drama—just how I like my Sunday night zombie adventures." [...] Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, [...] "At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of [...] "Bloodletting" [...] provides more than enough action." [...] Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: [...] "It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on." [...] Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, and I found it interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood. The scenes between the two men were moving, and if you listened <b>close</b> <b>you</b> could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops. Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and let her know their son is in mortal danger, without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission, while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic." [...] In conclusion, Oesterle gave [...] "Bloodletting" [...] a 'B' grade. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, signaling a [...] "great" [...] response. Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode, and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger. Similarly, Paste Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8.3 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that [...] "Bloodletting" [...] was superior to the previous episode, opining that it was [...] "a character strengthening episode." [...] He continued: [...] "Even those throwaway threads are immensely important to what’s about to go down at the Green farm." ...|$|E
