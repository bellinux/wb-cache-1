For many of these treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.

25|$|Myocarditis is a {{sometimes}} fatal {{side effect of}} clozapine, which usually develops within {{the first month of}} commencement. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically C-reactive protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of heart failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent <b>case-control</b> <b>study</b> found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of clozapine dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate.|$|E

40|$|Cryptosporidiosis is {{the most}} common cause of {{outbreaks}} of disease linked to mains water supply in the United Kingdom and the second commonest in the United States. Recent evidence has suggested that prior population immunity may have an impact on the epidemiology of waterborne outbreaks and in particular prior immunity may reduce the power of <b>case-control</b> <b>studies</b> for demonstrating association between disease and water consumption behaviour. However, the degree of impact of prior immunity on the power of epidemiological studies is not yet clear. This paper reports the results of some simple mathematical models of outbreaks of waterborne disease in populations with varying levels of immunity due to prior water and non-water exposure. The basic outbreak model was run on a spreadsheet. To determine the impact of prior immunity on <b>case-control</b> <b>studies,</b> further analysis was done using a Monte Carlo method to simulate sampling from cases and controls. It was found that moderate degrees of prior immunity due to water associated disease could markedly reduce the relative risk of water consumption on illness in waterborne outbreaks.

The aim of these <b>case–control</b> <b>studies</b> was to calculate odds ratios indicating the relative risk of serious injury in car crashes.

The results showed that differences between the odds ratios in the DRUID <b>case–control</b> <b>studies</b> may indeed be (partially) explained by random and systematic errors.
