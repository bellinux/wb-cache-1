40|$|Objectives. The optimal granulometric {{composition}} of filler compound ensures the production of concrete having improved  physical and mechanical characteristics, {{as well as}} minimal binder  consumption. The properties of heat-resistant concrete largely  depend on the type and the ratio of its components. Taking this into  account, {{the aim of the}} study is to determine the optimal grain {{composition of}} heat-resistant concrete. Methods. Methods for optimising the properties of heatresistant basaltic concrete with a <b>composite</b> <b>binder</b> and  mechanochemical activation of the filler grains were used during the  course of the research. A simplex-centroid experiment design is  applied for this purpose. The <b>composite</b> <b>binder</b> was subjected to  mechanochemical activation. Samples were made by vibration-pressing from a concrete mix with a cone draught of 2 cm. Results. The grain composition of heat-resistant concrete is proved  {{to be the most important}} variable factor, regulating which the  properties of concrete can be varied. The compositions of heat- resistant basaltic concrete with activated <b>composite</b> <b>binder</b> having a  maximum application temperature of 700 ºС are developed.  The  influence of the grain composition of the basaltic filler on the  properties of basaltic concrete using mathematical experiment planning methods is determined. The regression equations for the ultimate tensile strength and bending stress of basaltic concrete are  obtained for heating temperature of 700 ºC. Conclusion. The granulometric composition of heat-resistant basaltic concrete based on the activated binder is optimised for basic physical and technical properties. The optimal granulometric  design of the composition of heat-resistant concrete indicates that as the coarse fraction (particles greater than  0. 63 mm) in the filler  composition increases, the ultimate tensile strength and bending  stress of heatresistant basaltic concrete is increased when heated to  a temperature of 700 ºС. This is due to a more compact arrangement of sand grains. </p...|$|E
