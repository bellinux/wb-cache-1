5|$|Radiocarbon {{dates are}} {{generally}} {{presented with a}} range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) {{on either side of the}} mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% <b>confidence</b> <b>level,</b> so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. It was {{the purpose}} of this study to {{construct}} a profile of Nebraska Extension Agents related to their awareness, self-perceived <b>confidence</b> <b>levels,</b> attitudes and present practices in selected areas of mass media communications. Method. A questionnaire, developed by the author, was mailed to 100 percent of the Nebraska Extension Agents. The questionnaire used a Likert scale to measure self-perceived <b>confidence</b> <b>levels</b> and educational effectiveness in regard to selected mass media tasks. A five point Likert scale was used to measure how often selected source materials were used in creating media releases. Personal media habits were revealed as well as professional mass media output. Demographic information such as years of experience, age, extension title, and previous mass media training, were also reported. Findings. Ninety-three percent of the agents returned the survey which was determined to be the complete population. Of these agents, 41 percent had no formal mass media communications training and 38 percent had only one media course. Agents listed several areas in which they needed further in-service training. Agents with high <b>confidence</b> <b>levels</b> in writing newspaper articles consistently spent more personal time reading newspapers than those with low <b>confidence</b> <b>levels.</b> No such relationship was fOL 1 l 1 d with radio and television. Agents with high <b>confidence</b> <b>levels</b> in producing selected media releases rated similar media methods as having higher educational effectiveness than agents with low <b>confidence</b> <b>levels.</b> Agents with high <b>confidence</b> <b>levels</b> also produced more media releases per month. No relationship was found between the amount of media releases produced per month and the years of experience an agent had. A positive relationship was also found between a high educational effectiveness rating and the amount of media releases produced per month. This study shows that attitudes, <b>confidence</b> <b>levels,</b> and personal media habits can and do affect the output of mass media releases by Nebraska Extension Agents...|$|R

500|$|In a {{sequence}} of 20 mock games of Jeopardy, human participants {{were able to use}} the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding.

Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times, Watson's reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated (instead of reacted to) the ready signal.

500|$|Watson's {{performance}} {{was characterized by}} some quirks. In one instance, Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings. (Jennings said [...] "What are the '20s?" [...] {{in reference to the}} 1920s. Then Watson said [...] "Whathe 1920s?") Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response. In another instance, Watson was initially given credit for a response of [...] "What is leg?" [...] after Jennings incorrectly responded [...] "What is: he only had one hand?" [...] to a clue about George Eyser (the correct response was, [...] "What is: he's missing a leg?"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect. The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek's original acceptance of Watson's response. Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles, with one bet at $6,435 and another at $1,246. Gerald Tesauro, one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson, explained that Watson's wagers were based on its <b>confidence</b> <b>level</b> for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator.|$|E
