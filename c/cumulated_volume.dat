30|$|Conclusion Our study {{presents}} the first large cohort of SCLC attacks admitted to ICU. Compartment syndrome {{was a particularly}} frequent complication and mortality over 59 attacks was 18.6 %. High <b>cumulated</b> <b>volume</b> of fluid therapy seems {{to be associated with}} poorer outcome. There was a trend toward mortality in patients treated with IgIV during the attacks and such treatment should be used with caution.|$|E
30|$|Results Between May 1992 and February 2016, 59 {{attacks in}} 37 {{patients}} were included. Sex ratio was 1.05 with {{an age of}} 51  ±  11.4  years. In ten patients, more than one attack was included. Thirty-four (92 %) patients had an IgG MG with Kappa light chain in 20 (59 %) patients. A trigger of the attack {{could be found in}} 34 (58 %) patients with flu-like syndrome being the most frequent (89 %). SAPS II score at admission was 54 [38 – 67] and SOFA score 6 [3 – 9]. Admission heart rate was 128  ±  21  bpm, admission arterial systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure were respectively 75 [55 – 94], 60 [44 – 70] and 45 [36 – 60] mmHg. Frequent clinical manifestations at admission were; unaltered consciousness despite profound arterial hypotension (83 %), asthenia (78 %), faintness (64 %), nausea and vomiting (53 %), edema (51 %), dyspnea (46 %), marbles (42 %), myalgia (39 %) and abdominal pain (36 %). Admission hemoglobin, protidemia, serum creatinine and arterial lactate were respectively 20.2 [17.9 – 22] g/dL, 50 [36.5 – 58.5] g/L, 176 [121 – 244.5] µmol/L and 4.6 [3.3 – 6.5] mmol/L. Five patients underwent phlebotomy for mistaken hyper viscosity syndrome and 57 (97 %) received fluid therapy with a <b>cumulated</b> <b>volume</b> of 4.5 [2.8 – 10.6] L over 1 [1 – 2.5] days. Norepinephrine was administered in 28 (47.5 %) patients, epinephrine in 10 (17 %) and corticosteroids in 19 (32 %). Twenty-two (37 %) patients required mechanical ventilation and 18 (30.5 %) underwent renal replacement therapy. Fifteen patients (25 %) were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IgIV) during the attack. Compartment syndrome occurred in 12 (32 %) patients and 11 (30 %) died in ICU. In univariable analysis (over 37 unique patients) main factors associated with mortality were SAPS II (p =  0.006) and SOFA score (0.005), neurological dysfunction (neuro SOFA score ≥ 3, p =  0.003), high ICU maximum weight (p =  0.008), high <b>cumulated</b> <b>volume</b> of fluid therapy (p =  0.017), mechanical ventilation (p <  0.0001) and renal replacement therapy (p =  0.002) but not treatment with IgIV (p =  0.12). Multivariable analysis retained a SOFA >  10 (OR 10.4 [1.1 – 91], p =  0.04) and a <b>cumulated</b> <b>volume</b> of fluid therapy > 8  L (OR 16.4 [1.2 – 230], p =  0.038) as independent factors of mortality. Treatment with IgIV (OR 11.5 [0.85 – 155], p =  0.066) was not independently associated with mortality.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In this paper, we {{model the}} {{simultaneous}} {{buy and sell}} trade arrival process in a limit order book market. The buy and sell process is modelled based on a bivariate intensity model. In this context we extend the autoregressive conditional intensity (ACI) model by allowing for time varying covariates. Using limit order book data from the SEATS system of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), we include variables that reflect {{the state of the}} order book with respect to market depth, tightness, as well as, the <b>cumulated</b> <b>volume</b> in the ask and bid queue. Moreover, changes of the order book induced by limit order arrivals are captured as time varying covariates. We show that the state of the order book as well as the observed trading process has {{a significant impact on the}} bivariate buy and sell intensity, and thus, influences traders ' decision when to trade and on which side of the market. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{approach}} to model serially dependent positive-valued variables which realize a non-trivial proportion of zero outcomes. This is a typical phenomenon in financial time series observed at high frequencies, such as <b>cumulated</b> trading <b>volumes.</b> We introduce a flexible point-mass mixture distribution and develop a semiparametric specification test explicitly tailored for such distributions. Moreover, we propose {{a new type of}} multiplicative error model (MEM) based on a zero-augmented distribution, which incorporates an autoregressive binary choice component and thus captures the (potentially different) dynamics of both zero occurrences and of strictly positive realizations. Applying the proposed model to high-frequency <b>cumulated</b> trading <b>volumes</b> of both liquid and illiquid NYSE stocks, we show that the model captures the dynamic and distributional properties of the data well and is able to correctly predict future distributions...|$|R
30|$|Indeed, we {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of the cylinder radius on gravity double differences above the cylinder centre in the two mentioned cases, i.e., the first one considering the real injection depth of Soultz-sous-Forêts geothermal plant and the second one considering the <b>cumulated</b> injected <b>volume</b> on the 27 th of July 2016. Hence, we defined two models which lead to a 30  µGal gravity change like the one measured at the station 7. We considered the density fixed (1060  kg/m 3).|$|R
30|$|One hundred sixty-two {{patients}} with a newly diagnosed glioma classified according to histologic and molecular genetic properties were evaluated. The biological tumour volume (BTV) was segmented in static 20 – 40  min p.i. 18 F-FET PET images using the established threshold of 1.6 [*]×[*]background activity. For each enclosed voxel, the time-to-peak (TTP), the late slope (Slope 15 – 40), and the tumour-to-background ratios (TBR 5 – 15, TBR 20 – 40) obtained from 5 to 15  min p.i. and 20 to 40  min p.i. images were determined. The percentage portion of these values within the BTV was evaluated with percentage volume fractions (PVFs) and <b>cumulated</b> percentage <b>volume</b> histograms (PVHs). The ability to differentiate histologic and molecular genetic classes was assessed and compared to volume-of-interest (VOI)-based parameters.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} forest structure, {{regeneration}} {{and distribution of}} dead wood in a virgin forest remnant and a close-to-nature managed beech–conifer mixture situated on Grmecˇ Mountain inWestern Bosnia. The investigations were carried out in a 1 ha permanent sample plot and 35 circular plots (20 m radius) in the virgin forest and in 17 circular plots (25 m radius) in managed forests. The number of trees in the managed forest was significantly (p ¼ 0. 05) higher than that in virgin forest {{and the distribution of}} the number of trees per diameter classes had a decreasing trend, but with a different shape in the virgin forest compared to the managed stands. In the lower diameter classes, the stock volume recorded in virgin forest was half of that in the managed forest, whilst for higher diameter classes the <b>cumulated</b> <b>volume</b> of the growing stock was almost double in virgin forest. The young crops had a significantly lower presence in the virgin forest and a larger volume of dead wood was identified in the virgin forest than in managed stands. The study results are important in assessing the consequences of close-to-nature management on the forest structure and regeneration when compared to the condition in virgin forests...|$|E
40|$|Mount Etna {{despite being}} an {{extremely}} active volcano which, {{during the last}} 400 years, has produced many lava flow flank eruptions has rarely threatened or damaged populated areas. The reconstruction of the temporal evolution of potentially hazardous flank eruptions represents a useful contribution to reducing the impact of future eruptions by and analyzing {{actions to be taken}} for protecting sensitive areas. In this work, we quantitatively reconstructed the evolution of the 1981 lava flow field of Mt Etna, which threatened the town of Randazzo. This reconstruction was used to evaluate the <b>cumulated</b> <b>volume,</b> the time averaged discharge rate trend and to estimate its maximum value. The analysis was conducted by comparing pre‐ and post‐eruption topographic surfaces, extracted by processing historical photogrammetric data sets and by utilizing the eruption chronology to establish the lava flow front positions at different times. An unusually high discharge rate (for Etna) of 640 m 3 /s was obtained, which corresponds well with the very fast advance rate observed for the main lava flow. A comparison with other volcanoes, presenting high discharge rate, was proposed for finding a clue to unveil the 1981 Etna eruptive mechanism. A model was presented to explain the high discharge rate, which includes an additional contribution to the lava discharge caused by the interception of a shallow magma reservoir by a dike rising from depth and the subsequent emptying of the reservoir...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} {{of the effects of}} trade on economic growth. The main contribution {{of this study is that}} the 2 ̆ 2 <b>cumulated</b> past <b>volume</b> of exports and imports 2 ̆ 2 is taken as the carrier of knowledge or the source of externality, while the previous studies assume that only the export sector generates positive externalities. We also investigate the contribution of exports as a source of foreign exchange. The empirical test on 119 countries indicates that trade, being the carrier of knowledge, plays an important role in contributing to economic growth. However, the empirical test does not show any correlation between exports and the reduction of import shortage, which is presumed to be a binding constraint on output growth...|$|R
40|$|The Commission des Operations de Bourses, the French Market Supervision Authorities, {{seems to}} detect {{only a limited}} number of cases where there is insider trading around merger and {{acquisition}} operations on the French Market. Do French firms really master their financial communication? Our work addresses directly this question. On a sample of 72 operations, involving 80 French firms, during the period 1995 - 1999 and, using daily and intra-day data, we analyse the evolution of cumulated abnormal returns, <b>cumulated</b> abnormal <b>volume,</b> relative spread and hidden order buying and selling volume prior the announcement. By splitting our sample between value creating and value destructing operations as well as operations preceded by rumours and operations not preceded by rumours in the financial press, we show clear evidences of the almost systematic presence of insider trading prior those operations on the French market...|$|R
40|$|A {{septic tank}} {{combined}} with a sand filter {{is the most common}} onsite wastewater treatment system worldwide, since it is a simple, lowcost and reliable treatment method. Alternatives to sand in filters could be advantageous in terms of availability of material and enhanced treatment properties. In this study, flow dynamics and pollutant transport in three filter materials; sand, pine bark and activated charcoal, intermittently dosed with artificial greywater, were simulated using the HYDRUS wetland module. The simulated results were compared with observations from laboratory filters and model hydraulic and microbial parameters were calibrated. Emphasis was placed on simulating the removal of organic pollutants by each filter type. Furthermore, for the bark and charcoal filters, removal of organic matter was simulated for different hydraulic and organic loading rates (HLR = 32 and 64 l m⁻² day⁻¹ and OLR = 13 - 6 and 28 g BOD₅ m⁻² day⁻¹). Comparing simulated with measured <b>cumulated</b> effluent <b>volume,</b> the normalised root mean square error for all three filter materials was small (0. 7 - 3. 5...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{transport}} {{is monitored}} by {{a specially designed}} instrumentation installed on a steep mountain streams (the Rio Cordon). The variability of bedload rate and yield reflects the variability in flow discharge. Bedload and flow data for ‘ordinary’ (low peak flow floods) and ‘exceptional’ sediment transport events are {{used to test the}} range of application of the bedload equations proposed for high gradient streams. Such equations overestimate bedload rate for ordinary events while their reliability increases when used to predict high bedload transport rates like those recorded during the exceptional flood that affected Rio Cordon on September 14, 1994. The best agreement between computed and measured values of <b>cumulated</b> bedload <b>volumes</b> is found by using the Bagnold [Bagnold, R. A., 1956. The flow of cohesionless grains in fluids. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London 249 A, 235 – 297. ], Smart and Jaeggi [Smart, J. M., Jaeggi, M. N. R., 1983. Sediment transport on steep slopes. Mitteil. 64, Versuchsanstalt für Wasserbau, Hydrologie und Glaziologie, ETH-Zürich, Switzerland, 191 pp. ] and Rickenmann [Rickenmann, D., 1991. Hyperconcentrated flow and sediment transport at steep slopes. J. Hydraul. Eng., Zurig 117 (11) 1419 – 1439] formulas. The Schoklitsch equation [Schoklitsch, A., 1962. Handbuch des Wasserbaues, 3 rd edn. Springer, Wien. ] also provides good estimations for instantaneous bedload rates at high-sediment transport intensity and unlimited sediment supply conditions. The formal type of the last equation is still valid and can be calibrated for low intensity bedload rates...|$|R
40|$|A tax on fuel {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{mechanisms}} for reducing truck transport externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions, road damage, congestion, and accidents. The economic efficiency properties of a fuel tax are examined for the farm-to-elevator grain trucking sector [...] a sector for which the road damage externality is often severe. Because trucking <b>volumes</b> <b>cumulate</b> more rapidly near the delivery points, marginal external cost is generally not proportional to distance. Further, noncompetitive FOB pricing by grain buyers implies that road tax discounts to offset price markups should be independent of location. In both cases, a fuel tax is not capable of efficiently addressing the externality. With discriminatory pricing by buyers, "cross-hauling" emerges and the optimal fuel tax is unexpectedly high because the buyer passes on only a portion of the tax to the farmer. In a simple example with discriminatory pricing, the optimal fuel tax reduces excess average trucking distance by less that 50 %. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R
30|$|Voxel-wise {{analysis}} was performed with an in-house developed software (C++ with integration of the ROOT data analysis framework, version 6.09 / 01, Cern, Switzerland; and ITK segmentation and registration toolkit, version 4.11, National Library of Medicine). For each voxel within the BTV, the following kinetic and static parameters were determined: the TTP, the late slope (Slope 15 – 40, 15 – 40  min p.i.), and the tumour-to-background ratios TBR 5 – 15 and TBR 20 – 40 in early 5 – 15  min p.i. and late 20 – 40  min p.i. summation images, with the BG signal derived from the respective time frame. The Slope 15 – 40 was estimated by linear fitting {{of the last three}} time points, and the TTP was estimated as the time corresponding to the maximal TAC value starting from 2.7  min p.i. to avoid influence from early blood signal. Within the BTV, the sub-volume fractions consisting of voxels with a specific parameter value were determined and stored in histograms. For this, the histograms were plotted with the binned parameter values on the x-axis (histogram bin sizes: time frames of dynamic PET images for TTP, 0.6 SUV/h for Slope 15 – 40, and 0.25 for TBR) and the percentage fractions of the total BTV on the y-axis (percentage <b>volume</b> fractions, PVFs). <b>Cumulated</b> percentage <b>volume</b> histograms (PVHs) were obtained by cumulating these PVF histograms up to the specific bin, to improve the robustness of parameter effect quantification [29, 30]. For example PVFTTP 15 – 20 corresponds to the percentage portion of voxels within the BTV with peak value in time frame 14 (15 – 20  min p.i.), and PVHTTP[*]<[*] 20 to the cumulated percentage portion of voxels with TTP <[*] 20  min p.i.. In order to exemplarily illustrate the influence of noise in dynamic PET data onto the estimation of parametric TTP and Slope 15 – 40 images, a simple method for noise reduction, a spatial Gaussian filter with 10  mm full width half maximum (FWHM), was applied to the dynamic PET data prior to the estimation and analysis of alternative TTP and Slope 15 – 40 images.|$|R
40|$|Investigating {{preferential}} flow, including macropore flow, {{is crucial}} to predicting and preventing point sources of contamination in soil, for example {{in the vicinity of}} pumping wells. With a view to advancing groundwater protection, this study aimed (i) to quantify the strength of macropore flow in four representative natural grassland soils on the Swiss plateau, and (ii) to define the parameters that significantly control macropore flow in grassland soil. For each soil type we selected three measurement points on which three successive irrigation experiments were carried out, resulting in a total of 36 irrigations. The strength of macropore flow, parameterized as the <b>cumulated</b> water <b>volume</b> flowing from macropores at a depth of 1 m in response to an irrigation of 60 mm h&# 8722; 1 intensity and 1 h duration, was simulated using the dual-permeability MACRO model. The model calibration was based on the key soil parameters and fine measurements of water content at different depths. Modelling results indicate high performance of macropore flow in all investigated soil types except in gleysols. The volume of water that flowed from macropores and was hence expected to reach groundwater varied between 81 % and 94 % in brown soils, 59 % and 67 % in para-brown soils, 43 % and 56 % in acid brown soils, and 22 % and 35 % in gleysols. These results show that spreading pesticides and herbicides in pumping well protection zones poses a high risk of contamination and must be strictly prohibited. We also found that organic carbon content was not correlated with the strength of macropore flow, probably due to its very weak variation in our study, while saturated water content showed a negative correlation with macropore flow. The correlation between saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and macropore flow was negative as well, but weak. Macropore flow appears to be controlled by the interaction between the bulk density of the uppermost topsoil layer (0 – 0. 10 m) and the macroporosity of the soil below. This interaction also affects the variations in Ks and saturated water content. Further investigations are needed to better understand the combined effect of all these processes including the exchange between micropore and macropore domains...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} high resolution high repetitively VIS-NIR remote sensing, like the forthcoming Sentinel- 2 mission {{to be launched}} in 2015, offers unprecedented opportunity to improve agricultural monitoring. In this study, regional evapotranspiration and crop water consumption were estimated over an irrigated area located in the Kairouan plain (central Tunisia) using the FAO- 56 dual crop coefficient water balance model combined with NDVI image time series providing estimates of the actual basal crop coefficient (Kcb) and vegetation fraction cover. Three time series of high-resolution SPOT 5 images have been acquired for the 2008 - 2009, 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013 hydrological years. We also benefited from a SPOT 4 time series acquired {{in the frame of}} the SPOT 4 -Take 5 experiment. The SPOT 5 images were radiometrically corrected, first, using the SMAC 6 s Algorithm, and then improved using invariant objects located on the scene. The method was first calibrated using ground measurements of evapotranspiration achieved using eddy-correlation devices installed on irrigated wheat and barley plots. For other crops for which no calibration data was available, parameters were taken from bibliography. Then, the model was run to spatialize irrigation over the whole area and a validation was done using <b>cumulated</b> seasonal water <b>volumes</b> obtained from ground survey for three irrigated perimeters. In a subsequent step, evapotranspiration estimates were obtained using a large aperture scintillometer and were used for an additional validation of the model outputs...|$|R
