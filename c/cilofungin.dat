50|$|<b>Cilofungin</b> (INN) is {{the first}} {{clinically}} applied member of the echinocandin family of antifungal drugs. It was derived from a fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It accomplishes this by interfering with an invading fungus' ability to synthesize the cell wall (specifically, it inhibits the synthesis of (1→3)-β-D-glucan).|$|E
50|$|Discovery of echinocandins {{stemmed from}} studies on papulacandins {{isolated}} from {{a strain of}} Papularia sphaerosperma (Pers.), which were liposaccharide - i.e., fatty acid derivatives of a disaccharide that also blocked the same target, 1,3-β glucan synthase - and had action only on Candida spp. (narrow spectrum). Screening of natural products of fungal fermentation in the 1970s led {{to the discovery of}} echinocandins, a new group of antifungals with broad-range activity against Candida spp. One of the first echinocandins of the pneumocandin type, discovered in 1974, echinocandin B, could not be used clinically due to risk of high degree of hemolysis. Screening semisynthetic analogs of the echinocandins gave rise to <b>cilofungin,</b> the first echinofungin analog to enter clinical trials, in 1980, which, it is presumed, was later withdrawn for a toxicity due to the solvent system needed for systemic administration. The semisynthetic pneumocandin analogs of echinocandins were later found to {{have the same kind of}} antifungal activity, but low toxicity. The first approved of these newer echinocandins was caspofungin, and later micafungin and anidulafungin were also approved. All these preparations so far have low oral bioavailability, so must be given intravenously only. Echinocandins have now become one of the first-line treatments for Candida before the species are identified, and even as antifungal prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cilofungin,</b> {{amphotericin}} B, and {{a combination}} of the two drugs were compared in a model of aspergillosis in immunocompetent mice in three experiments. <b>Cilofungin</b> was equivalent to amphotericin B in preventing death and eradicating cerebral aspergillosis, but it did not sterilize the kidneys. This is the first demonstration of the in vivo activity of <b>cilofungin</b> against any fungus other than Candida albicans. The mortality with combination therapy was higher than those with amphotericin B alone (P = 0. 003) and <b>cilofungin</b> alone (P = 0. 054), as was weight loss after infection, indicating antagonism between <b>cilofungin</b> and amphotericin B in this model.

40|$|The efficacies of <b>cilofungin</b> and {{amphotericin}} B {{separately and}} together in mice with disseminated candidiasis were studied. Male CD- 1 mice (age, 5 weeks) were infected intravenously with 3 X 10 (5) CFU of Candida albicans. At 4 days postinfection, intraperitoneal therapy was initiated and was continued for 14 days. Therapy groups included those given <b>cilofungin</b> at 6. 25 or 62. 5 mg/kg/day (given twice daily), amphotericin B at 0. 625 mg/kg/day (given once daily), <b>cilofungin</b> at 6. 25 mg/kg/day plus amphotericin B, and <b>cilofungin</b> at 62. 5 mg/kg/day plus amphotericin B. Mice were observed through 30 days postinfection. All infected untreated mice died of infection between days 6 and 18. Eighty-five percent of mice receiving <b>cilofungin</b> at 6. 25 mg/kg/day died between days 13 and 30. All other mice survived. Quantitative {{determination of the}} number of CFU of C. albicans in the spleens and kidneys of all survivors revealed that mice that had received both drugs had lower residual burdens of C. albicans. All mice treated with <b>cilofungin</b> at 62. 5 mg/kg/day plus amphotericin B had sterile spleens, whereas 42 to 58 % of mice given <b>cilofungin</b> or amphotericin B monotherapy had sterile spleens. All kidneys were infected in mice which had received <b>cilofungin</b> at 62. 5 mg/kg/day or amphotericin B. Neither organ was infected in 17 % of each group receiving combination therapy with <b>cilofungin</b> and amphotericin B. The number of CFU in the kidneys of mice treated with <b>cilofungin</b> at 62. 5 mg/kg/day plus amphotericin B was lower than those cultured from mice treated with <b>cilofungin</b> at 62. 5 mg/kg/day (P less than 0. 001, Mann-Whitney) or amhotericin B (P less than 0. 05). Modest synergy was noted in inhibition of the C. albicans isolate in vitro. Pharmacokinetic studies showed elevated levels of <b>cilofungin</b> but not amphotericin B in sera of mice treated with combined therapy compared with those in mice given monotherapy. No overt toxicity was evident with any regimen. The mechanism of increased efficacy may be altered <b>cilofungin</b> distribution, excretion, or metabolism; antifungal synergy; or both.

40|$|<b>Cilofungin</b> is an {{antifungal}} cyclopeptide which inhibits {{cell wall}} (1, 3) -beta-glucan biosynthesis in fungal organisms, and its action against Candida albicans (1, 3) -beta-glucan synthase {{has been widely}} studied. Since glucan synthase inactivation is thought to partially result from perturbations of the membrane lipid environment, the interaction of <b>cilofungin</b> with fungal membranes and phosphatidylcholine membrane vesicles was studied. <b>Cilofungin,</b> which contains two independent aromatic groups, has an excitation maximum of 270 nm and an emission maximum of 317 nm in aqueous solution. Comparison of the fluorescence properties of <b>cilofungin</b> {{with those of the}} analogs pneumocandin B 0, N-acetyl-tyrosinamide, and 4 -hydroxybenzamide indicated that the emission of <b>cilofungin</b> largely derived from the p-octyloxybenzamide side chain. Microsomal membranes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C. albicans, and phosphatidylcholine membrane vesicles induced a blue shift in the <b>cilofungin</b> emission spectrum and increased the <b>cilofungin</b> steady-state emission anisotropy, providing direct evidence for a cilofungin-membrane interaction. <b>Cilofungin</b> interacted more strongly with membranes of C. albicans than with those of S. cerevisiae, correlating with previous findings that C. albicans is far more susceptible than S. cerevisiae to the action of <b>cilofungin.</b> These findings support the hypothesis that drug-induced inhibition of the (1, 3) -beta-glucan synthesis results from the perturbation of the membrane environment and the interaction with the glucan synthase complex combined.

40|$|<b>Cilofungin</b> has potent {{in vitro}} {{activity}} against Candida albicans, but previous {{in vivo models}} using twice daily intermittent dosing regimens have not consistently demonstrated in vivo efficacy.

We compared the in vivo efficacy of continuous intravenous infusion of <b>cilofungin</b> with that of amphotericin B in a rabbit model of disseminated candidiasis. <b>Cilofungin</b> prepared as previously described in phosphate-buffered 33 % polyethylene glycol was lethal to infected rabbits in this model, as was phosphate-buffered 33 % polyethylene glycol alone. In contrast, <b>cilofungin</b> in 26 % polyethylene glycol and sterile water administered by continuous intravenous infusion was tolerated by rabbits, was significantly more effective than amphotericin therapy in reducing candida colony counts in kidney tissue, and was as effective as amphotericin therapy in lung and spleen tissue and in cardiac valvular vegetations.

40|$|We {{studied the}} plasma {{pharmacokinetics}} and tissue penetration of <b>cilofungin</b> (LY 121019), a new echinocandin antifungal compound, by intermittent and continuous infusion in rabbits. Following a single intravenous dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum concentration in plasma was 297 +/- 39 micrograms/ml, the area under the curve was 30. 1 +/- 6. 7 micrograms. h/ml, clearance was 30 +/- 10 ml/min/kg, volume of distribution was 0. 85 +/- 0. 23 liters/kg, half-life in distribution phase was 3. 7 +/- 0. 2 min (first 12 min postdose), and half-life in elimination phase was 12. 9 +/- 0. 7 min. When rabbits received <b>cilofungin</b> by continuous infusion (CI) at 10 mg/kg/h over 6 days, sustained concentrations in plasma of 290 +/- 56 micrograms/ml were seen, more than 50 -fold higher than predicted if kinetics were linear. Similarly, at 5 mg/kg/h, high levels were also obtained. Such elevated levels in plasma {{would not have}} been predicted from the pharmacokinetic characteristics of <b>cilofungin</b> given as a single intravenous dose. Further pharmacokinetic study at several rates of CI suggested that <b>cilofungin</b> elimination follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Simultaneous <b>cilofungin</b> levels in plasma and tissue were then determined for rabbits receiving six intravenous, intermittent doses (ID) of <b>cilofungin</b> at 15 mg/kg every 4 min and for rabbits receiving CI as described above. After ID, the mean of the ratios of <b>cilofungin</b> levels in tissue to those in plasma were highest for liver and bile but very low for cerebrum and cerebellum. After CI, ratios were as much as 89 times higher than for ID and significantly greater in the brain, choroid, kidney, and bile (P less than 0. 05). We conclude that following a single dose of <b>cilofungin,</b> the compound is rapidly cleared via first-order kinetics and does not penetrate into the central nervous system, whereas following CI, <b>cilofungin</b> exhibits nonlinear saturable kinetics, is slowly cleared, and significantly penetrates into central nervous system tissues...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cilofungin,</b> a new {{antifungal}} drug, {{was found}} to inhibit mycelial growth of Coccidioides immi-tis. Light and electron microscopic observations indicated delay in development of the outer hyphal wall. <b>Cilofungin</b> also blocked incorporation of the chitin substrate, N-acetylglucosamine, into mycelia. However, when C. immitiswas grown under conditions that induced spherule develop-ment, drug effects were dramatically decreased. Furthermore, efficacy of <b>cilofungin</b> in treatment of murine coccidioidomycosis could not be demonstrated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the β 1 – 3 glucan synthase inhibitor, <b>cilofungin,</b> on the {{incorporation}} of 35 S-methionine-labelled glucan associated proteins (GAP) in the cell wall of Candida albicans was investigated in a susceptible strain C. albicans 3153 and resistant strain C. albicans CA- 2. <b>Cilofungin</b> exerted a marked effect on the GAP composition of the cell wall at 0 ⋅ 25 mg/L, a concentration which reduced β 1 / 3 glucan synthesis by approximately 50 % and also inhibited {{the growth of the}} susceptible strain C. albicans 3153. A 46 kDa protein was present in large amounts in C. albicans 3153 but not in strain CA- 2. This protein was probably not mannosylated and its incorporation was greatly reduced by <b>cilofungin.</b> In addition, a well defined 34 kDa protein was identified together with a distinct band of high molecular mass polydisperse material of between 65 and 96 kDa and another of > 200 kDa. These proteins were strongly reactive to concanavalin A indicating that they were mannosylated, and treatment with <b>cilofungin</b> caused an increase in their production which was also confirmed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-Candida serum. In contrast, exposure of the drug-resistant strain CA- 2 to <b>cilofungin</b> did not result in changes in the composition of the GAP constituents. Only the mannosylated proteins of 34 kDa and the high molecular mass polydisperse material 65 – 96 kDa were present in the cell wall.

In contrast, there was 97 % mortality in infected controls receiving 2 x 10 (6) CFU intravenously and 93 % survival in mice treated with 1 mg of amphotericin B per kg once a day. Mice rendered granulocytopenic by the administration of cyclophosphamide showed survival rates of 83 and 80 % when treated with 25 or 35 mg of <b>cilofungin</b> per kg for 10 days compared with 43 % survival rate in mice treated with 1 mg of amphotericin B per kg (P = 0. 0030 and P = 0. 0080, respectively). Similar results were obtained when the two antifungal agents were administered for a period of 30 days. Administration of 25 or 35 mg of <b>cilofungin</b> per kg twice a day to granulocytopenic mice receiving 10 (6) CFU of C. albicans gave survival rates of 93 % and 93 % compared with 53 % survival with amphotericin B.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>cilofungin,</b> a beta 1 - 3 glucan synthase inhibitor, on the {{incorporation}} of the glucan associated proteins (GAP) into the mycelial wall of Candida albicans was investigated. For this study sub-inhibitory (< 2 micrograms/ml) doses of <b>cilofungin</b> were employed during the yeast to mycelial transition in a defined chemical medium, at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Under these conditions, and particularly at the dose of 0. 50 micrograms/ml <b>cilofungin</b> exerted a marked effect on GAP incorporation into the mycelial cell wall.

Radiolabel incorporation experiments demonstrated increased synthesis of a 34 kDa GAP, in addition to confirming the absence of the 46 kDa constituent, in mycelial cells under cilofunging treatment. Thus, sub-inhibitory doses of <b>cilofungin</b> may greatly alter the pattern of essential cell wall constituents such as the glucan-associated proteins, suggesting that this drug also has important effects on cell wall structure and fine organization, independent of, or prior to, its principal lytic effect on the fungal organism...|$|E

Six groups of rabbits were studied, untreated controls (n = 32) and five <b>cilofungin</b> dosage regimen groups consisting of the following: 25 mg/kg of body weight intravenously twice daily (VLoINT) (n = 9); 50 mg/kg twice daily (LoINT) (n = 9); 90 mg/kg twice daily (HiINT) (n = 11); 5 mg/kg/h for 18 h/day (LoCI) (n = 7); and 10 mg/kg/h for 18 h/day (HiCI) (n = 7). All regimens achieved plasma concentrations exceeding the MIC for Candida albicans (0. 25 microgram/ml). In vitro timed kill assays found that the fungicidal activity and rate of kill by <b>cilofungin</b> above the MIC for C. albicans was concentration dependent. At the lower dosage regimens (VLoINT, LoINT, and LoCI), <b>cilofungin</b> followed linear plasma pharmacokinetics, whereas at higher doses (HiCI and HiINT), nonlinear kinetics consistent with a saturated elimination pathway(s) were observed. Only HiCI and HiINT produced a 10 (3) - to 10 (4) -fold reduction in CFU per gram in candidiasis of the brain (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001). HiCI and HiINT also significantly reduced infection in the choroid (P less than or equal to 0. 05).

However, only the regimens with nonlinear saturation kinetics (HiCI and HiINT) produced a 10 (6) reduction in the spleen and a > 10 (5) reduction of C. albicans in the kidney and liver. A simple doubling of the dosage from LoCI to HiCI resulted in tissue concentrations that were 10 times higher and a 10 (2) - to 10 (4) -fold-greater antifungal effect.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of broth dilution antifungal susceptibility tests {{was performed by}} determining both the micro- and macrodilution MICs of amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, ketoconazole, and <b>cilofungin</b> against 38 isolates of Candida albicans, Candida lusitaniae, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Torulopsis glabrata. The following preliminary antifungal working group recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for broth macrodilution tests with antifungal agents were used: inocula standardized to 1 x 10 (4) to 5 x 10 (4) CFU/ml with a spectrophotometer, RPMI 1640 medium buffered with morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (pH 7. 0), incubation at 35 degrees C for 24 to 48 h, and an additive drug dilution procedure. Broth microdilution MICs were higher (two or more dilutions) than broth macrodilution MICs for all isolates tested with amphotericin B and for most isolates tested with ketoconazole, fluconazole, and <b>cilofungin.</b> MICs of flucytosine were the same by both techniques or lower by the broth microdilution test except in tests with C. neoformans. However, the only {{statistically significant differences between}} the two tests were observed with amphotericin B against all isolates (P = 0. 01 to 0. 07), ketoconazole against C. neoformans (P = 0. 01 to 0. 02), and <b>cilofungin</b> against C. albicans (P = 0. 05 to 0. 14). Tests performed with less dense inocula (1 x 10 (3) to 5 x 10 (3] produced similar results...|$|E
40|$|The time {{course of}} plasma drug levels and urinary {{recovery}} for two lipopeptide antifungal antibiotics, L- 671, 329 and <b>cilofungin,</b> were measured in male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and in female DBA/ 2 mice. The antibiotics were administered intravenously at 10 mg/kg {{of body weight}} in phosphate-buffered saline- 26 % polyethylene glycol for the rhesus monkeys and in 5 % dimethyl sulfoxide for the mice. Plasma and urine drug concentrations were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and/or a microbiological assay versus Aspergillus niger, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for both species. In {{each of the two}} rhesus crossover tests {{as well as in the}} mouse studies, the pharmacokinetics of the two compounds were similar; however, a marked difference was evident between species. The half-lives of L- 671, 329 and <b>cilofungin</b> in plasma were 39 and 34 min in the mice and averaged 1. 8 and 2 h in the rhesus monkeys, respectively. In mice and rhesus monkeys, urinary recovery was less than 4 % for both compounds...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} various test conditions on broth macro- and microdilution susceptibility test results for several species of yeasts with a new antifungal agent, <b>cilofungin.</b> As the pH decreased from 7. 4 to 3. 0, 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 1 / 2) increased up to 64 -fold. This effect was unrelated to yeast growth rate, solvent concentration, or choice of buffer. Broth microdilution results for 42 Candida albicans isolates at pH 7. 4 in synthetic amino acid medium, fungal (SAAMF), showed IC 1 / 2 results from 0. 08 to 2. 5 micrograms/ml, whereas at pH 3. 0 the results were 5. 0 or 10. 0 micrograms/ml. Fungicidal concentrations were closer to MIC results at the lower pH, i. e., an average of 16 -fold above the MIC at pH 3. 0, compared with an average 256 -fold difference at pH 7. 4. Two strains that had very different IC 1 / 2 results at pH 7. 4 and identical IC 1 / 2 results at pH 3. 0 {{were found to be}} equally susceptible to <b>cilofungin</b> therapy in rats. In additional studies, other medium effects were demonstrable, with yeast nitrogen broth and minimal essential medium generally yielding higher results than two other synthetic media (SAAMF and RPMI 1640 medium). However, susceptibility results did not change with inoculum between 10 (2) and 10 (5) yeast cells per ml or temperature between 30 and 37 degrees C. These studies indicate that pH is an important influence on in vitro rank order susceptibility of pathogenic yeasts to <b>cilofungin...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{antifungal}} antibiotic, echinocandin B (ECB), {{was modified}} by a sequential procedure {{in which the}} initial step involved enzymatic removal of the native N-linoleoyl group from the N-terminus using an Actinoplanes utahensis culture.

40|$|A murine {{model of}} focal hepatic {{candidiasis}} which we suggest simulates certain conditions of this clinical variant of systemic candidiasis in leukemic patients is described. We {{have shown that}} outbred mice inoculated with Candida albicans by the oral-intragastric route as infants (6 days old) and then immunocompromised by cyclophosphamide and cortisone acetate treatment 2 weeks later demonstrate systemic spread of the opportunistic pathogen to the liver, lungs, spleen, and kidneys. Treatment with the immunosuppressive drugs cyclophosphamide and cortisone acetate resulted in alteration of the normal integrity of the mucosal epithelium of the gut {{as well as in}} granulocytopenia. Approximately 55 % of the animals with C. albicans infections in the liver demonstrated hepatic abscesses. After these same infected, immunocompromised animals were treated with suboptimal dosages of antifungal agents (<b>cilofungin</b> or amphotericin B), either by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous (s. c.) routes, persistent hepatic abscesses were fewer in number and delimited by a distinct outer layer of host tissue but still contained large numbers of the viable pathogen. Blood cell counts indicated that these antifungal drug-treated animals had reestablished approximately the same number of leukocytes per microliter of blood as estimated prior to the immunocompromising drug treatment. Similar conditions in leukemic patients who were in remission and who were undergoing antifungal drug therapy for systemic candidiasis have been reported. Clearance of hepatic infections in mice was accomplished by using appropriate concentrations of amphotericin B administered by daily intraperitoneal or s. c. injection for 5 to 7 days or <b>cilofungin</b> by continuous s. c. infusion for 7 days. However, systemic antifungal therapy did not significantly reduce numbers of C. albicans cells in the stomach and esophagus. Persistent foci of gastrointestinal colonization by C. albicans, especially in the region of the cardial-atrium fold of the stomach of these mice, are reservoirs of the opportunistic pathogen from which reinfection may occur, leading to relapse of systemic candidiasis...|$|E
40|$|LY 303366 is a semisynthetic analog of the {{antifungal}} lipopeptide echinocandin B that inhibits (1, 3) -β-d-glucan synthase {{and exhibits}} efficacy in animal models of human fungal infections. In this study, we utilized flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide uptake, single-cell sorting, and standard microbiological plating methods {{to study the}} antifungal effect of LY 303366 on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. Our data indicate that an initial 5 -min pulse treatment with LY 303366 caused yeasts to take up propidium iodide and lose their ability to grow. Amphotericin B and <b>cilofungin</b> required longer exposure periods (30 and 180 min, respectively) and higher concentrations to elicit these fungicidal effects. These two measurements of fungicidal activity by LY 303366 were highly correlated (r > 0. 99) in concentration response and time course experiments. As further validation, LY 303366 -treated yeasts that stained with propidium iodide were unable to grow in single-cell-sorted cultures. Our data indicate that LY 303366 is potent and rapidly fungicidal for actively growing yeasts. The potency and rapid action of this new fungicidal compound suggest that LY 303366 may be useful for antifungal therapy...|$|E
40|$|Growth-subinhibitory nonlytic {{doses of}} <b>cilofungin</b> (a lipopeptide {{antibiotic}} affecting (1, 3) -P-D-glucan synthesis) inhibited {{the incorporation of}} 46 - to 48 -kDa glucan-associated (46 K) protein into the growing cell wall of Candida albicans. The purified 46 K protein constituent strongly reacted with a monoclonal antibody against enolase, a major cytoplasmic enzyme of the fungus. In addition, two internal fragments of 12 - and IS-amino acid residues from a tryptic digest of 46 K protein showed 100 %identity with amino acids in positions 34 - 4 S and 66 - 80 of enolase. Byimmunoelectron microscopy with polyclonal and monoclonal anti-enolase antibodies, the 46 K protein was clearly detected in the inner layers of the fungal cell wall. Thus, consistent with the proposed immunogenic and diagnostic roles of enolase in candidiasis, biochemical, immunochemical, and ultrastructural evidence strongly suggest that the cilofungin-susceptible 46 K protein is a cell wall-associated form of this enzyme. Antibiotics acting on the structure and metabolism of fungal cell wall are promising chemotherapeutic agents because of their potentially elevated selective toxicity and cytocidal mode of action [1 - 3].

40|$|A {{new series}} of semisynthetic, {{water-soluble}} pneumocandin analogs {{has been found to}} be extremely potent against Pneumocystis carinii in an immunocompromised-rat model. These compounds are 5 to 10 times more potent than the parent natural product, pneumocandin B 0 (L- 688, 786) (R. E. Schwartz et al., J. Antibiot. 45 : 1853 - 1866, 1992), and > 100 times more potent than <b>cilofungin.</b> One compound in particular, L- 733, 560, had a 90 % effective dose against P. carinii cysts of 0. 01 mg/kg of body weight when delivered parenterally (subcutaneously, twice daily for 4 days). This compound was also effective when given orally for the treatment and prevention of P. carinii pneumonia. For treating acute P. carinii pneumonia, oral doses of 2. 2 mg/kg twice daily for 4 days were required to eliminate 90 % of the cysts. A once-daily oral prophylactic dose of 2. 2 mg/kg prevented cyst development, and a dose of 6. 2 mg/kg prevented any development of P. carinii organisms (cysts and trophozoites), as determined through the use of a P. carinii-specific DNA probe (P. A. Liberator et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 30 : 2968 - 2974, 1992). These results demonstrate that the antipneumocystis activities of the pneumocandins can be significantly improved through synthetic modification. Several of these compounds are also extremely effective against candidiasis (K. Bartizal et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39 : 1070 - 1076, 1995) and aspergillosis (G. K. Abruzzo et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39 : 860 - 894, 1995) in murine models, making them attractive as broad-spectrum antifungal agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>cilofungin</b> (LY 121019, referred to hereafter as LY), a lipopeptide, was studied in a murine candidiasis model. CD- 1 mice (5 weeks old) were injected intravenously with 3 x 10 (5) Candida albicans yeast cells. Intraperitoneal LY or amphotericin B (AmB) therapy was begun 4 days after infection and was continued daily for 2 weeks. LY and AmB were compared at 62. 5, 6. 25, and 0. 625 mg/kg per day, with the LY dose {{split into two}} treatments per day. Mice were observed for 30 days postinfection, and survivors were necropsied. AmB at 62. 5 mg/kg per day was lethal {{in the absence of}} infection. Cumulative mortality for infected controls was 94 % (17 of 18). Survival of mice treated with the control diluent for LY was the same as survival with no treatment. Survival after 0. 625 mg of LY per kg per day was {{the same as that of}} the controls, and 6. 25 or 62. 5 mg of LY per kg per day was significantly superior. AmB treatment at 0. 625 or 6. 25 mg/kg per day was protective and superior to the same LY doses. Atrophied kidneys were common in AmB-treated mice, and mice treated with 6. 25 mg of AmB per kg per day appeared ill during therapy. The number of CFU recovered from kidneys and spleens of surviving mice reflected the same relationships between drugs and doses as those described for mortality. C. albicans was not cleared from the kidneys of mice in any group, and only in the 6. 25 -mg/kg-per-day AmB treatment group was not detectable C. albicans found in the spleens. These data indicate that LY or AmB suppresses candida infection but neither is curative in this model...|$|E
40|$|The lipopeptide {{antifungal}} agents, echinocandins, papulacandins, and pneumocandins, kill Candida albicans by inhibiting glucan synthesis. For this fungus, {{there is}} a good correlation of in vitro enzyme inhibition with in vitro assays of MICs. Semisynthetic lipopeptides such as <b>cilofungin,</b> LY 303366, L- 693, 989, and L- 733, 560 have activity in vivo against Aspergillus infections but appear to be inactive in broth dilution in vitro tests (MICs, > 128 micrograms/ml). To understand how compounds which lack activity in vitro can have good in vivo activity, we monitored the effect of pneumocandins on the morphology of Aspergillus fumigatus and A, flavus strains by light microscopy and electron microscopy and related the changes in growth to inhibition of glucan synthesis. Pneumocandin B 0 caused profound changes in hyphal growth; light micrographs showed abnormally swollen germ tubes, highly branched hyphal tips, and many cells with distended balloon shapes. Aspergillus electron micrographs confirmed that lipopeptides produce changes in cell walls; drug-treated germlings showed very stubby growth with thick walls and a conspicuous dark outer layer which was much thicker in the subapical regions. The rest of the hyphal tip ultrastructure was unaffected by the drug, indicating considerable specificity for the primary target. The drug-induced growth alteration produced very compact clumps in broth dilution wells, making it possible to score the morphological effect macroscopically. The morphological changes could be assayed quantitatively by using conventional broth microdilution susceptibility assay conditions. We defined the endpoint as the lowest concentration required to produce the morphological effect and called it the minimum effective concentration to distinguish it from the no-growth endpoints used in MIC determinations. The minimum effective concentration assay was related to inhibition of glucan synthase activity in vitro and may provide a starting point for development of susceptibility testing methods for lipopeptides...|$|E

DBA/ 2 mice were challenged intravenously with 1 x 10 (4) to 5 x 10 (4) CFU of C. albicans MY 1055 per mouse. Compounds were administered intraperitoneally at concentrations ranging from 1. 25 to 10 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for 4 days. At 6 h and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 days after challenge, five mice per group were sacrificed and their kidneys were homogenized and plated for enumeration of Candida organisms (CFU per gram). Progressiveness of response trends and no-statistical-significance-of-trend doses were derived to rank compound efficacy. 1, 3 -beta-D-Glucan synthesis 50 % inhibitory concentrations were determined by using a C. albicans (MY 1208) membrane glucan assay. Candida and Cryptococcus neoformans MICs and minimal fungicidal concentrations were determined by broth microdilution. L- 671, 329, L- 646, 991, L- 687, 901, and L- 687, 781 showed similar 1, 3 -beta-D-glucan activities, with 50 % inhibitory concentrations of 0. 64, 1. 30, 0. 85, and 0. 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. Data from in vitro antifungal susceptibility studies showed that L- 671, 329, L- 646, 991, and L- 687, 901 had similar MICs ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 0 micrograms/ml, while L- 687, 781 showed slightly higher MICs of 1. 0 to 2. 0 micrograms/ml for C. albicans MY 1055. Lipopeptide compounds were ineffective against C. neoformans strains. Results from in vivo experiments comparing significant trend and progressiveness in response analyses indicated that L- 671, 329 and L- 646, 991 were equipotent but slightly less active than L- 687 - 901, while L- 687, 781 was ineffective at 10 mg/kg.
