30|$|However, {{during the}} last few years, the export of live animals from Somaliland has been slowing, leading to the decline in {{national}} earning (SLCCIA 2015; SLCCIA 2016), and reducing pastoralists’ income. Adding value to the livestock and livestock products provides an avenue for reversing the declining incomes and sustaining the livelihoods of pastoralists. This can be achieved by slaughtering, processing and exporting <b>meat</b> (<b>chilled</b> carcasses or <b>packaged</b> <b>meat)</b> and by investing in the transformation and processing of livestock by-products like hides and skins, and bones, tallow and horns. Previous studies have shown that slaughtering and exporting processed meat involve higher costs of refrigeration (high costs of electricity in Somaliland) and transport to the importing countries (Negassa et al. 2012). On the other hand, improving the quality of hides and skins produced and developing the value chain beyond the wet blue tanning offer a more viable investment than exports of raw wet or dried hides and skins (Wanyoike et al. 2018). The same applies to harnessing and processing of tallow, bones and horns into an array of products that include soap, cooking oil and candles (from tallow) as well as an assortment of bone trinkets (jewellery, buttons, carvings etc.) from bones and horns. Of interest, processing of bones {{has been shown to be}} an important source of employment and income for women and youths (Kinyanjui and Noor 2013).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the {{thermodynamic}} analysis and the performance prediction of R 22 -E 181 absorption water <b>chilling</b> <b>package</b> for standard rating conditions according to ARI 560 - 2000. The analysis {{is based on the}} description of the exact thermodynamic cycle plotting the enthalpy-mass fraction and the temperature-enthalpy charts. The thermodynamic properties of the R 22 -E 181 are given in a new set of equations using extended experimental data from the literature. A step-by-step calculation model was established in order to predict the characteristic points of the thermodynamic cycle of the R 22 -E 181 ARU and to simulate its performance. The influence of the ambient conditions on the operation of the ARU is shown graphically when the saturated condensing temperature ranges from 30 to 45 degreesC. Regression analysis is carried out to express the actual coefficient of performance and the cooling load as functions of the condenser temperature and the absorber-condenser temperature difference. According to ARI Standard 560 - 2000 for an absorption water <b>chilling</b> <b>package,</b> it has been found that the integrated part-load value of the COP ranges from 53 to 60 %. When the saturated condensing temperature is 41. 1 degreesC, the saturated evaporating temperature is 4 degreesC and the ABS/COND temperature difference ranges from 6 to 9 degreesC. The decrease of the chilled water temperature passing through evaporator is 5. 6 degreesC. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment.

40|$|Naval {{refrigeration}} {{applications are}} similar to a high-rise building, only laid on its side. However, naval applications must deal with a corrosive marine environment, limited space for equipment, {{and the movement of}} the ship. This article describes the many additional constraints a designer faces in refrigeration system design for naval applications. The standards referred to in this article are case specific and can be used only after agreement with that particular navy. Usu-ally, each navy uses standards per its own re-quirements on a case-by-case basis. In many cases, navies allow equivalent or similar standards for equipment and raw materials after a detailed study of project specification requirements regarding improvements in system design and operation. Calculating Refrigeration Capacity Refrigeration plants are used onboard mainly for food preservation in cold rooms and for producing ice required for onboard consumption. Heat load calcula-tions provide the refrigeration capacity required for cold rooms. Heat load can be calculated by using methods available in technical literature or by using commer-cial software. The ASHRAE Handbook— Fundamentals and ISO Standard 75471 are useful for this purpose. The required capacity of a refrigeration plant is deter-mined from individual cold-room heat load, ice production load, and from the required cooling down period. Generally, the refrigeration plant on warships has a capacity in the range of 3. 5 kW to 50 kW (1 ton to 14 ton). For <b>chiller</b> <b>packages</b> in most cases, a navy will specify the required capacity, or capacity can be calculated from chilled water flow rate and temperature difference. The capacity usually is in the range of 35 kW to 2, 700 kW per <b>chiller</b> <b>package.</b> Refrigerant In developing countries, R- 22 will be phased out soon.
