The series starts with the visualized <b>Cloud</b> <b>of</b> Sound, in which modern music (mostly commissioned works) is staged with lasers, video projections, fireworks, ships, cranes, balloons, etc. This concert attracts an audience of about 100,000. The classic <b>Cloud</b> <b>of</b> Sound is the opening concert of the Brucknerfest, performed without visualization. The children's <b>Cloud</b> <b>of</b> Sound, an afternoon event since 1998, provides musical stories for younger listeners.|$|R
