5|$|Weeks after Eega release, its pirated {{version was}} released; it was {{illegally}} filmed in a theatre in Varadaiahpalem, Chittoor district. A forensic watermarking investigation on the pirated copies {{determined that a}} <b>camcorder</b> {{was used in the}} process. The digital watermarking also helped investigators locate the source of the piracy of Naan Ee to a theatre in Coimbatore.|$|E
5|$|Eric Koretz {{served as}} {{director}} of photography; he joined the team during a shift in focus in January 2008. Koretz used a Panasonic AG-HPX500 P2 HD <b>camcorder.</b> He commented to industry publication Videography about the choice of technique, that due to {{the intensity of the}} production team's travel schedule tape format would not have been an option. He stated he preferred using P2 cards over the HDD-based format due to its superior reliability. During the editing process, Glen Echo Entertainment utilized eight Apple Macintosh computers with Intel processors, equipped with Apple's Final Cut Pro editing software.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} written by Michael Arndt and was {{originally}} about an East Coast road trip from Maryland to Florida, but was shifted to a journey from New Mexico to California because of budget issues. Arndt started the script on May 23, 2000 and completed the first rough draft by May 26. He had initially planned on shooting the film himself by raising several thousand dollars and using a <b>camcorder.</b> Instead, he gave the screenplay to producers Ron Yerxa and Albert Berger who teamed up with Deep River Productions to find a potential director.|$|E

5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the <b>camcorder</b> footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E
5|$|Lester Burnham is {{a middle-aged}} {{advertising}} executive and magazine writer who despises his job. He is unhappily married to Carolyn, a neurotic yet fiercely ambitious {{real estate broker}} who grows red roses in their yard; their teenage daughter, Jane, abhors her parents and has low self-esteem. The Burnhams' new neighbors are the Fitts family, consisting of a homophobic retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts, his near-catatonic wife, Barbara, and their teenage son, Ricky, who constantly films his surroundings with a <b>camcorder,</b> collecting hundreds of recordings on videotapes in his bedroom. His part-time job as a bar caterer and waiter serves as a front for his secret marijuana dealings. Frank is a strict disciplinarian who previously sent Ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital. Jim Olmeyer and Jim Berkley, a gay couple who live nearby, welcome the Fitts family to the neighborhood. On the way to school, Frank reveals his homophobia while he angrily discusses the incident with Ricky.|$|E
5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} {{to do all}} the things on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's <b>camcorder</b> to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene. At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion magazine advertisement. The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs. In the first, Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships, producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking {{in the back seat of}} the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality <b>camcorder.</b>|$|E
5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and <b>camcorder,</b> among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E
25|$|During the credits, {{footage from}} a <b>camcorder</b> {{found on the}} boat begins with Steve's escapades before the {{outbreak}} and concludes with the group running out of supplies before finally arriving at an island, where they are attacked by another swarm of zombies. The <b>camcorder</b> drops, recording dozens of zombies chasing them, accompanied by the song Down with the Sickness by Disturbed.|$|E
50|$|Infrared (IR) {{cameras and}} <b>camcorders</b> are used with an IR {{illuminator}} to observe bat emergences and bat behaviour {{inside and outside}} roosts. The problem with this method is that deriving a count from a recording is tedious and time consuming, but <b>camcorders</b> can be useful as a backup in roost emergence counts to observe bats re-entering the roost. Many Sony <b>camcorders</b> are sensitive to infrared.|$|R
50|$|Since 2006, {{nearly all}} <b>camcorders</b> sold are digital. Tape-based (MiniDV/HDV) <b>camcorders</b> {{are no longer}} popular, since tapeless models (with an SD card or {{internal}} SSD) cost almost the same but offer greater convenience; video captured on an SD card can be transferred to a computer faster than digital tape. None of the consumer-class <b>camcorders</b> announced at the 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show recorded on tape.|$|R
50|$|The {{high end}} of the {{consumer}} market emphasizes user control and advanced shooting modes. More-expensive consumer <b>camcorders</b> offer manual exposure control, HDMI output and external audio input, progressive-scan frame rates (24fps, 25fps, 30fps) and higher-quality lenses than basic models. To maximize low-light capability, color reproduction and frame resolution, multi-CCD/CMOS <b>camcorders</b> mimic the 3-element imager design of professional equipment. Field tests have shown that most consumer <b>camcorders</b> (regardless of price) produce noisy video in low light.|$|R
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{test for the}} presence of PCP in Rodney King's body {{at the time of the}} arrest was negative. The incident was captured on a <b>camcorder</b> by local resident George Holliday from his apartment in the vicinity. The tape was roughly 12 minutes long. While the tape was presented during trial, some clips of the incident were not released to the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{applications}} that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition <b>camcorder</b> {{may require a}} card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. Digital cameras with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.|$|E
25|$|Technologically Sanyo has {{had good}} ties with Sony, {{supporting}} the Betamax video format from invention until the mid-1980s (the best selling video recorder in the UK in 1983 was the Sanyo VTC5000), while producing the VHS video format {{at the same}} time for the Fisher brand during the early 1980s, and later being an early adopter of the highly successful Video8 <b>camcorder</b> format. More recently, though, Sanyo decided against supporting Sony's format, the Blu-ray Disc, and instead gave its backing to Toshiba's HD DVD. This was ultimately unsuccessful, however, as Sony's Blu-ray triumphed.|$|E
50|$|In February 2009 ITV News bought 68 Sony HVR-Z5E {{handheld}} <b>camcorders</b> for its multi-skilling journalists.

25|$|On March 6, 2009, Pretec {{introduced}} the first SDXC card, a 32GB {{card with a}} read/write speed of 400Mbit/s. But only early in 2010 did compatible host devices come onto the market, including Sony's Handycam HDR-CX55V <b>camcorder,</b> Canon's EOS 550D (also known as Rebel T2i) Digital SLR camera, a USB card reader from Panasonic, and an integrated SDXC card reader from JMicron. The earliest laptops to integrate SDXC card readers relied on a USB 2.0 bus, which {{does not have the}} bandwidth to support SDXC at full speed.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of the mobile computers, the first computer mapping software became feasible, {{at about the same time}} as the popular adoption of the VHS <b>camcorder</b> began a rapid growth phase. Prior to the mid to late 1980s most motion picture equipment consisted of 8 mm film cameras. While the quality of the first VHS consumer cameras was quite poor (and the size somewhat cumbersome) when compared to traditional film formats, the amount of video which could be shot with a minimal amount of resources was much greater than any film format at the time.|$|E
50|$|Sony {{produces}} {{professional and}} prosumer <b>camcorders.</b>|$|R

25|$|The game {{presents}} the player's character design {{as being a}} self-made television stage talent or celebrity. It is a simple animation production studio which lets the user insert captured images such as human faces onto 3D models which had been made with Polygon Studio, dress up the models from an assortment of hundreds of clothes and accessories, and then animate the models with sound, music, and special effects. The player can connect an analog video source such as a VCR or <b>camcorder</b> to the Capture Cartridge and record movies on the Nintendo 64. A photograph of a person's face from a video source via the Capture Cassette or from the Game Boy Camera via the Transfer Pak, may be mapped onto the characters created in Polygon Studio and placed into movies created with Talent Studio.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} by a UN commissioned panel of independent experts (Peter Diaczuk, Daniel Spitz and Jeff Spivack) {{found that the}} video was authentic. In a point-by-point repudiation of the Sri Lankan government's assessment, the experts concluded that the reaction and movement of the victims' bodies and blood evidence were consistent with being shot; {{the movement of the}} weapon and the shooter and the gases expelled from the muzzle were consistent with live ammunition firing, not blank cartridges; {{there was no evidence of}} breaks in continuity in the video, no additional video layers; and no evidence of image manipulation; and that video had been filmed on a mobile phone, not a <b>camcorder,</b> as the Sri Lankan government's analysis had maintained. The experts were unable to explain 17 frames at the end of the video but this did not invalidate its authenticity.|$|E
30|$|Recaptured videos are {{recorded}} by digital <b>camcorders.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1999 Sony backported the DV {{recording}} {{scheme to}} 8-mm systems, creating Digital8. By {{using the same}} cassettes as Hi8, many Digital8 <b>camcorders</b> were able to play analog Video8/Hi8 recordings, preserving compatibility with already recorded analog video tapes. , Digital8 <b>camcorders</b> {{have been removed from}} the equipment offered by Sony.|$|R
50|$|Other consumer-grade <b>camcorders</b> {{are more}} {{suitable}} for film-style recording. In particular, the Canon HV20 and the Canon HV30 <b>camcorders</b> have progressive imaging sensors and are capable of shooting true progressive video preserving spatial resolution and having an added benefit of better light sensitivity compared to interlaced shooting modes.|$|R
