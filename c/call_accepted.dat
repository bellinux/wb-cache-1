40|$|A vast {{majority}} of communications in a network occurs between pairs of nodes, each such interaction is termed a call. The job of call control algorithm is to decide which {{of a set of}} <b>calls</b> to <b>accept</b> in the network so as to maximize a certain objective, viz., the number of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls</b> or the profit associated with the <b>accepted</b> <b>calls.</b> When a <b>call</b> is <b>accepted</b> it uses up some network resources, like bandwidth, along the path through which it is routed. Thus, the call control algorithm needs to make intelligent trade-offs between resource constraints and profits. In this paper, we investigate two variants of call control problems on ring networks; in the first, the algorithm is allowed to determine the route connecting the end nodes of a call, while in the second, the route is specified as part of the input. For the first variant, we show an efficient algorithm that achieves the objective of routing and maximizing the nrnber of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls</b> within an additive constant of at most 3 to an optimal algorithm. This yields by-product. For the fixed path variant, we derive a 2 -approximation for maximizing the profits (which could be arbitrary) of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls...</b>|$|R

We propose a new multicast routing algorithm called maximum {{mean number of}} new <b>calls</b> <b>accepted</b> before blocking multicast routing (MCBMR), which can more accurately capture the current and future loading of a network. Simulation results show that this algorithm, compared with LLMR, not only has a smaller network revenue loss, but also results in smaller call blocking probabilities for all classes of traffic. We also discuss the implementation issues of our proposed algorithm and develop two approximation methods, state approximation and curve fitting, which can reduce the measurement complexity significantly with only a slight performance degradation...|$|R

This kind of routing can give rise to several modes of behaviour. For example, the simple model I shall consider can exhibit bistability; the system fluctuates between a low-blocking state, where <b>calls</b> are <b>accepted</b> readily, and a high-blocking state, where the likelihood of a <b>call</b> being <b>accepted</b> can be quite low. I shall describe a method which enables one to assess the stability of the two states. In particular, it allows one to obtain qualitative estimates of the time for which these states persist...|$|R
