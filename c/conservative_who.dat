25|$|Gilbert was a <b>conservative</b> <b>who</b> {{believed}} architecture {{should reflect}} historic traditions and the established social order. His {{design of the}} new Supreme Court building (1935), with its classical lines and small size contrasted sharply with the very large modernist Federal buildings going up along the National Mall in Washington, D.C., which he disliked.|$|E

25|$|Kuhl, a {{seasoned}} New York politician, {{was the most}} politically experienced freshman of the 2004 House class. He was considered a fairly reliable <b>conservative</b> <b>who</b> generally voted against abortion rights, gun control and tax increases.

2500|$|An {{icon of the}} American {{conservative}} movement, Reagan {{is credited}} by his supporters with transforming {{the politics of the}} United States, galvanizing the success of the Republican Party. He brought together a coalition of economic <b>conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> supported his supply side economics; foreign policy <b>conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> favored his staunch opposition to Communism and the Soviet Union; and social <b>conservatives,</b> <b>who</b> identified with his religious and social ideals. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union the [...] "evil empire." [...] Conservatives also supported the Reagan Doctrine, under which the U.S. provided military and other aid to insurgency movements resisting governments aligned with the Soviet Union. For these and other efforts, Reagan was attacked by liberals at the time as a dangerous warmonger, but conservative historians assert that he decisively won the Cold War.|$|R

25|$|The second Conservative {{candidate}} {{turned out}} to be James Mawdsley, who was secretary of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, an unusual case of a <b>Conservative</b> <b>who</b> was an active trade unionist. The choice of Mawdsley as Conservative candidate had been kept secret and surprised several Conservatives who were not in the very small meeting at which the candidates were adopted. There was some discussion of which of the two very different Conservative candidates, the aristocrat or the labour representative, would be more popular in Oldham.|$|E
25|$|Citizen {{exhaustion}} {{due to the}} conflict's newfound intensity led to {{the election}} of president Belisario Betancur (1982–1986), a <b>Conservative</b> <b>who</b> won 47% of the popular vote, directed peace feelers at all the insurgents, and negotiated a 1984 cease-fire with the FARC at La Uribe, Meta, after a 1982 release of many guerrillas imprisoned during the previous effort to overpower them. A truce was also arranged with the M-19. The ELN rejected entering any negotiation and continued to recover itself {{through the use of}} extortions and threats, in particular against foreign oil companies of European and U.S. origin.|$|E
25|$|In 1918 Cory {{stood and}} won {{in support of}} the Coalition {{government}} of David Lloyd George. He had presumably been sent the Coalition Coupon as he was without Conservative opposition (although there was an Independent <b>Conservative</b> <b>who</b> polled derisively) and he was challenged by a Labour candidate who got 38% of the poll. At the 1922 general election Cory stood as a National Liberal as a supporter of Lloyd George. Labour did not stand a candidate but this did not help Cory, who lost to the Unionist candidate Anthony Hawke, the Recorder of Plymouth. Cory won the seat back from Hawke in 1923 but lost again in 1924.|$|E

25|$|Harvey stood {{down from}} Parliament at the 1918 general election, but tried to {{re-enter}} the House of Commons in 1922, having in 1921 been selected as Liberal candidate for Dewsbury in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Dewsbury had been Sir Walter Runciman's seat up until 1918, when, as {{an opponent of}} the Coalition government of David Lloyd George, Runciman had been opposed by a Coalition <b>Conservative</b> <b>who</b> {{had the benefit of}} the government coupon. In a three-cornered contest Harvey nearly regained the seat for the Liberals in 1922, but lost to Labour candidate Ben Riley by 756 votes (3.3% of the total vote), the Conservative candidate Osbert Peake, later to be MP for Leeds North came third.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Marburg speech, Hitler responded to the armed forces' demands to {{suppress}} the ambitions of Röhm and the SA by purging the SA leadership. The purge, known as the Night of the Long Knives, took place between 30 June and 2 July 1934. In the purge, Röhm {{and much of the}} SA leadership were murdered. General Kurt von Schleicher, the former Chancellor and a friend of Röhm's who had been scheming {{to take advantage of the}} rift between the SA and the Reichswehr to make a political comeback, was gunned down along with his wife. Also Gustav von Kahr, the <b>conservative</b> <b>who</b> had thwarted the Beer Hall Putsch more than ten years earlier, was killed and thrown into a swamp.|$|E
25|$|Until 1911, Prime Ministers had {{to guide}} {{legislation}} through the Commons and the Lords and obtain majority approval {{in both houses}} for it to become law. This was not always easy, because political differences often separated the chambers. Representing the landed aristocracy, Lords Temporal were generally Tory (later <b>Conservative)</b> <b>who</b> wanted {{to maintain the status}} quo and resisted progressive measures such as extending the franchise. The party affiliation of members of the Commons was less predictable. During the 18th century its makeup varied because the Lords had considerable control over elections: sometimes Whigs dominated it, sometimes Tories. After the passage of the Great Reform Bill in 1832, the Commons gradually became more progressive, a tendency that increased with the passage of each subsequent expansion of the franchise.|$|E

25|$|Willing to {{give their}} {{children}} the best education possible, Victoria and her husband entrusted this task to the bright but strict Calvinist philologist Georg Ernst Hinzpeter. Reputedly a liberal, Hinzpeter {{was in fact a}} staunch <b>conservative</b> <b>who</b> made William and Henry undergo a rigorous and puritanical upbringing, without praise or incentives. To complete their education, the princes were sent to a school in Kassel, despite the opposition of the King and court. Finally, William was enrolled at the University of Bonn, while his younger brother, who didn't show the same intellectual interests, was sent to the Navy at 16 years old. The education received by the children didn't allow them to have the open and liberal personalities that their parents wanted.|$|E
25|$|After sending several envoys, whom Carrera {{would not}} receive – and {{especially}} not Barrundia whom Carrera {{did not want}} to murder in cold blood – Morazán began a scorched-earth offensive, destroying villages in his path and stripping them of assets. The Carrera forces had to hide in the mountains. Believing Carrera totally defeated, Morazán and Barrundia marched to Guatemala City, and were welcomed as saviors by state governor Pedro Valenzuela and members of the <b>conservative</b> , <b>who</b> proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Morazán all the Guatemalan resources needed to solve any financial problem he had. The criollos of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a criollo caudillo like Morazán, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion.|$|E
25|$|In April 1554 Gerard was {{returned}} as MP for Steyning, Sussex. Steyning {{had belonged to}} Syon Abbey until the Dissolution of the monasteries but now formed part of the royal honour of Petworth. As steward of the honour, the decisive voice in selecting the members belonged to Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, a religious <b>conservative</b> <b>who</b> had supported the Somerset faction under Edward VI and was now a key supporter of Queen Mary and Lord Steward of her household. Significantly, {{he was happy to}} support Gerard. Sir Thomas Holcroft, Gerard's uncle {{was returned}} for the neighbouring constituency of Arundel, where almost all the members in the 16th century were nominated by the earls. However, for the 1555 election Gerard returned to Wigan, again being returned as junior to Barlow.|$|E
