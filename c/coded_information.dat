25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by <b>coded</b> <b>information.</b> This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave out a lot of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s {{at least}} 12½% of all British mail was {{conveyed}} under the personal frank of peers, dignitaries {{and members of}} parliament, while censorship and political espionage were conducted by postal officials. Fundamentally, the postal system was mismanaged, wasteful, expensive and slow. It had become inadequate {{for the needs of}} an expanding commercial and industrial nation. There is a well-known story, probably apocryphal, about how Hill gained an interest in reforming the postal system; he apparently noticed a young woman too poor to redeem a letter sent to her by her fiancé. At that time, letters were normally paid for by the recipient, not the sender. The recipient could simply refuse delivery. Frauds were commonplace; for example, <b>coded</b> <b>information</b> could appear {{on the cover of the}} letter; the recipient would examine the cover to gain the information, and then refuse delivery to avoid payment. Each individual letter had to be logged. In addition, postal rates were complex, depending on the distance and the number of sheets in the letter.|$|E

2500|$|As {{preparations}} for the liberation of Europe gathered pace, the US in particular found de Gaulle's tendency to view everything from the French perspective to be extremely tiresome. Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, referred to de Gaulle as [...] "an apprentice dictator", a view backed {{by a number of}} leading Frenchmen in Washington, including Jean Monnet, who later became an instrumental figure in the setting up of the European Coal and Steel Community that led to the modern European Union. Roosevelt directed Churchill to not provide de Gaulle with strategic details of the imminent invasion because he did not trust him to keep the information to himself. French codes were considered weak, posing a risk since the Free French refused to use British or American codes. De Gaulle refused to share <b>coded</b> <b>information</b> with the British, who were then obliged secretly to break the codes to read French messages.|$|E

50|$|Precoding is a {{technique}} which exploits transmit diversity by weighting the information stream, i.e. the transmitter sends the <b>coded</b> <b>information</b> to the receiver to achieve pre-knowledge of the channel.

40|$|Foreground {{segmentation}} {{for video}} frames has {{played an important}} role in many video applications, such as video surveillance, video indexing, etc. Due to most videos are compressed, foreground segmentation can benefit from utilizing such <b>coding</b> <b>information</b> and save much processing time. In this paper, we propose a real-time foreground segmentation algorithm for the moving camera based on the H. 264 video <b>coding</b> <b>information.</b> In the proposed algorithm, we first utilize the relative global motion model to calculate the approximate global motion vector and get the motion vector difference of each block. Then, according to the block partition modes, we assign different weightings and apply spatio-temporal refinement to these motion vector differences for further improving the accuracy of segmentation results. Finally, we segment out the foreground blocks by an adaptive threshold. With the aid of H. 264 video <b>coding</b> <b>information,</b> the proposed segmentation algorithm is more practical than many other methods based on spatial domain information in computational complexity...|$|R
