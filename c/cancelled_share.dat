40|$|Background/Objectives: This study {{explores the}} {{incidence}} of <b>cancelling</b> treasury <b>shares</b> events in Malaysia and examines the financial characteristics of companies that {{are more likely to}} <b>cancel</b> their <b>shares.</b> Methods/Statistical Analysis: The study utilizes descriptive analysis to assess {{the incidence of}} <b>cancelling</b> treasury <b>share</b> events among non-financial and non utility Malaysian companies. Tobit regression analysis is used to gauge the relationship between firm financial characteristics and the incidence of <b>cancelling</b> treasury <b>share</b> events. Findings: There were a total of 175 events of <b>cancelling</b> treasury <b>shares</b> occurred between the years 2001 and 2012. This study finds that profitability positively and significantly affects the decision to <b>cancel</b> treasury <b>shares,</b> while excess cash flows negatively influence a firm’s decision to <b>cancel</b> treasury <b>shares.</b> Furthermore, smaller size companies are {{more likely to engage in}} <b>cancelling</b> their <b>shares.</b> Application/Improvements: The study finds that smaller firms are more likely to <b>cancel</b> their treasury <b>shares</b> as these companies may have severe information asymmetry problems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Following {{the recent}} French reform on open-market {{repurchase}} programs, we investigate the {{buy and sell}} behaviour by firms on their own shares. Unlike American studies, we can construct a sample of really bought, sold and <b>cancelled</b> <b>shares</b> for each firm per month. These data come from the registration at the “Commission des operations de bourse (COB) ” equivalent to the American SEC. Five standard behaviours of firms are established (cancellation, large purchase, buy-sell, large sale and low activity). With this classification, we observe {{the impact of the}} open-market repurchase program on three major financial variables: ownership structure, dividend payment and stock return. Concerning, the relation between ownership structure and firm repurchase behaviour, we note a less concentrated ownership structure for the firms <b>cancelling</b> their <b>shares.</b> In the same way, the dividend substitution hypothesis does not seem effective for the cancellation firms sample. Lastly, we do not distinguish any long-run abnormal returns for all the kinds of repurchase behaviour. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{shares are}} repurchased, they may either be {{canceled}} or held for reissue. If not <b>canceled,</b> such <b>shares</b> {{are referred to}} as treasury shares.

40|$|Purpose – Most {{research}} on share repurchases {{is based on}} the USA. Recently, the rate of share repurchases by UK companies has increased significantly; such a marked increase in activity would suggest a change in strategic factors generating this activity. This paper aims to focus on UK practice, the motivations of UK companies to repurchase shares and compares similar research in the USA. Design/methodology/approach – Strategic motives for share repurchase activity are examined by a questionnaire survey of the finance directors of the top UK 200 companies. The outcome is compared to equivalent US research. The theoretical underpinning of the survey is based on six prominent hypotheses from the academic literature. Findings – The results indicate that a primary motive of share repurchases in the UK is to achieve an optimal capital structure, and that the requirement to <b>cancel</b> <b>shares</b> is fundamental to buy-back decisions in the UK. Research limitations/implications – USA/UK comparison has limitations, nevertheless it highlights differences and possible reasons. A follow-up study in the current market conditions may give further clarity. Also, a survey of smaller quoted companies may further enhance our understanding of the motives. Practical implications – The likelihood is of this trend being maintained, especially in view of legal development. Originality/value – Individual respondents indicated that finance directors have a genuine interest in this topic and that further research would be beneficial in both practical and academic use. Share buy-backs can be an effective part of the overall strategy of a company, however the effects of a repurchase are ultimately short term...|$|R

50|$|A new Act of Parliament {{was needed}} to {{authorise}} the change of route and reduce the share capital, and this was obtained on 28 June 1858; the original capital had been £160,000 with authorisation for loans to £53,000 but this was now reduced to £50,000 share capital and £16,600 in loans. As the Exeter and Exmouth would now only build a line from Topsham to Exmouth, the L&SWR needed authority to build the part from Exmouth Junction to Topsham, and it obtained an Act for purpose on 12 July 1858. (The line joined the L&SWR Salisbury to Exeter main line at Exmouth Junction.) Just after opening the E&ER company raised an additional £30,000 in loans at 5% to <b>cancel</b> forfeited <b>shares,</b> and a further £25,000 was raised in June 1861.|$|R

500|$|After Sony <b>canceled</b> their <b>shared</b> {{universe}} {{plans and}} started sharing the Spider-Man character with Marvel Studios, multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU. Scott Meslow of The Week noted the perceived flaws {{of the first}} Amazing Spider-Man film, outside of its lead performances, and how the sequel [...] "doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own. …We now have a textbook example of how not to reboot a superhero franchise, and if Sony and Marvel are wise, they'll take virtually all those lessons to heart as they chart Spider-Man's next course." [...] Scott Mendelson noted that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [...] "was sold as less a sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man than a backdoor pilot for Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six. …Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one that really was rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, Amazing Spider-Man could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate." [...] This would have saved Sony [...] "a boatload of money", and potentially reversed the film's relative financial failure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{delay element}} {{insensitive}} to power supply and temperature variations become important as circuit speeds increase. A delay element, {{based on a}} CMOS thyristor, is proposed in this paper. This thyristor uses current rather than voltage to control the delay, exhibiting a low power supply noise sensitivity of 9. 43 % and a temperature variation sensitivity of 314 PPM/°C. A technique to <b>cancel</b> the charge <b>sharing</b> effect during switching is incorporated into the delay element to further enhance power supply insensitivity. The delay element is combined with a bandgap reference voltage generator to produce a digitally controlled variable delay line. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed delay element has a lower power supply and temperature sensitivity than a classical chain of inverters. The power consumed by the proposed delay element is lower than an inverter chain, and is much lower than a differential delay element. I...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{findings on the}} restructuring component of the decision process. Two experiments are described employing hypothetical vacation choice dilemmas. The aim was to explore {{the conditions under which}} outcomes common to two risky prospects with the same probabilities of occurrence are or are not cancelled and how consequent decisions are influenced. The design of the options presented to participants was based on pilot work to establish appropriate contexts. The key independent variable was the semantic relatedness between outcomes of the same risky prospect. The main finding was that the participants did not <b>cancel</b> the outcome <b>shared</b> by two prospects when it was semantically related to another outcome within the same prospect. In this case, the prospect with greater risk was chosen significantly more frequently in comparison to when the common outcome was unrelated to other outcomes. An interpretation of the findings is presented in terms of contingent editing processes...|$|R
40|$|Extract] The tax {{treatment}} of share buy-backs is provided for in Division 16 K of Part III of the ITAA 1936 comprising s 159 GZZZJ thru to s 159 GZZZS. Division 16 K was enacted in 1990 to complement {{changes to the}} corporations legislation that permitted companies to buy-back their shares: [159 GZZZJ. 1060]. Thus the division applies where a company buys a share (or non-share equity – s 159 GZZZIA) in itself from a shareholder and <b>cancels</b> the <b>share.</b> On-market v off-market distinction: The division distinguishes between on-market and off-market share buy-backs. These concepts are defined in s 159 GZZZK. If the share is listed on a stock exchange and the purchase {{is made in the}} ordinary course of business of that stock exchange, the buy-back will be an on-market purchase. All other buy-backs are treated as off-market. As to the concept of the ordinary course of business on a stock exchange see Attorney-General (Vic) v Walsh's Holdings Ltd [1973] VR 137 in which Gowans J said at 144 that the phrase “carries overtones of an anonymous competitive bargaining in an open forum according to the common and usual course of that activity and without unusual features in the bargaining suggestive of collateral objectives”; see also Cuming Smith & Co Ltd v Westralian Farmers Co-operative Ltd (1978) 3 ACLR 906; Green v Crusader Oil NL (1985) 10 ACLR 120 and ICAL Ltd v County Natwest Securities Australia Ltd (1988) 13 ACLR 129...|$|R
30|$|Masking {{with single}} {{aggregator}}: {{for a total}} number of smart meters N> 1 and a single aggregator M= 1, the masking scheme preserves full privacy in terms of spatial resolution, and it preserves full privacy with respect to temporal resolution. Given exactly one aggregator M= 1, the basic approach for multi-resolution masking is applied. A receives a set of N masked values and a single key share. By combining both, A can calculate the sum at a particular resolution. For spatial aggregation, privacy is preserved by the scheme proposed by Kursawe et al. [9], i.e., the individual measurements are masked, and the random <b>shares</b> <b>cancel</b> each other out upon summation. The temporal resolution {{is limited by the}} resolution of the key share. The privacy preserving feature of this approach has been discussed in detail in section Basic approach. Section Proof of correctness includes the proof of correctness for the masking approach in combination with wavelets.|$|R
5000|$|Hess Oil and Chemical, an oil refiner and {{marketer}} {{founded by}} Leon Hess, acquired 10% {{of the company}} for US$100 million in 1966 after the British government sold a stake it had amassed during World War II. Albert Levinson became the {{senior vice president and}} designed the Hess logo. Hess and Amerada would announce plans for a merger in December 1968. Some Amerada stockholders led by Morton Adler criticized the arrangement as being too favorable for Hess. Adler argued Amerada's oil reserves would contribute the lion's share of assets for the proposed company, so Amerada stockholders should retain more control of the new company. Before the stockholder vote on the matter, Phillips Petroleum, an integrated oil firm, approached Amerada with its own merger proposal, but the offer was declined in March. Still interested, Phillips nonetheless stated it would not carry out a proxy fight against the proposed Hess deal. Hess fearing such a strategy, made a cash tender offer of US$140 million for an additional 1.1 million shares of Amerada, which would double its holding in the company. The new shares would be employed in a May stockholder vote deciding the merger's fate. The vote took place amidst shareholder rancor that in addition to echoing Adler's arguments, objected to Amerada's financing of the recently completed tender offer. Hess planned to <b>cancel</b> the <b>shares</b> and the cost of the acquisition would be absorbed by the newly formed company. One shareholder at the meeting quipped, [...] "It looks to me as if Hess is buying Amerada with Amerada's money." [...] Proponents of the deal won, and the US$2.4 billion merger combining a purely production company with a refinery and marketer operation was completed. However controversy was not yet extinguished by the stockholder confirmation. A class action federal lawsuit in 1972 claiming the proxy vote information was misleading. In 1976, a court agreed that the company falsely claimed to have considered each company's assets as a reason for the merger.|$|R
5000|$|The 'dry' {{two-stage}} {{device was}} known as [...] "Morgenstern". It was tested on 7 April 1954. The predicted yield of Morgenstern, which had a highly innovative secondary stage, was between 0.33 and 3.5 megatons, with an expected yield of 1 megaton. The actual yield was 110 kilotons. Morgenstern was a 'fissile fizzle'. Post shot analysis showed that the failure {{was due to the}} premature heating of the secondary by the neutron flux of the primary. This was a simple design defect, and not related to the unique geometry of the secondary. The UCRL's other shot, the 'wet", i.e. cryogenic, Ramrod device, originally scheduled for the Echo shot was <b>cancelled</b> because it <b>shared</b> the same simple design defect as Morgenstern. The name [...] "Morgenstern" [...] (German for Morning Star) was chosen because of the shape of the secondary. The secondary consisted of a central sphere from which spikes were radiating, resembling a morning star / mace. The spikes may have been an idea from Teller and colleagues to use implosive jets to compress the thermonuclear core. It would be well over two decades before weapons were designed which utilized a secondary concept similar to that which went untested in the Koon shot.|$|R
40|$|World {{deepwater}} {{is famous}} for its rich oil and gas reserves, and has become an important source of global oil and gas supply, with a rising investment which will be over the shallow water counterparts in the next few years, as well as an expansion of oil and gas output. The ‘Deepwater Golden Triangle’ of the North American Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa has been leading the most exploration, development and investment activities in the world, and their experience on fiscal system during different development stages has great reference value other than advanced technologies. Under the assumptions of uncertain oil price and producing cost, this paper analyzed China fiscal system for deepwater oil and gas development, modeled the free natural resource tax, uplifting the threshold of special oil levy, and other scenarios, and compared their results on contractor’s net presented value, internal return rate and present index. Based on net present value, internal return rate, profitability index, as well as the domestic fiscal policies, this paper found that Special Oil Levy levied only on profit oil and the <b>cancel</b> of government <b>share</b> oil would have the most significant incentives, while lower the income tax rate to 15 %, raising the threshold price at which the Special Oil Levy payable by 15 $/bbl and zero Value-added tax have much higher feasibility...|$|R
2500|$|Legal capital must be {{maintained}} (not distributed to shareholders, or distributed [...] "in disguise") unless a company formally reduces its legal capital. Then it can make distributions, which might be desirable if a company wishes to shrink. A private company must have a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, and the directors must then warrant that the company will remain solvent and {{will be able to}} pay its debts. If this {{turns out to be a}} negligent statement, the director can be sued. But this means it is hard to claw back any profits from shareholders if a company does indeed go insolvent, if the director's statement appeared good at the time. If not all the directors are prepared to make a solvency statement, the company may apply to court for a decision. In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary. The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest. There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions, however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to <b>cancel</b> preferential <b>shares</b> before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to preferential payment as a way of considering [...] "the position of the company itself as an economic entity". Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law, but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is express authority in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from distributable profits. Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of distributable profits. Crucially, the directors must also state that the company will be able to pay all its debts and continue for the next year, and shareholders must approve this by special resolution. Under the Listing Rules for public companies, shareholders must generally be given the same buy back offer, and get shares bought back pro rata. How many shares are retained by the company as treasury <b>shares</b> or <b>cancelled</b> must be reported to Companies House. From the company's perspective the legal capital is being reduced, hence the same regulation applies. From the shareholder's perspective, the company buying back some of its shares is much the same as simply paying a dividend, except for one main difference. Taxation of dividends and share buy backs tends to be different, meaning that often buy backs are popular just because they [...] "dodge" [...] the Exchequer.|$|R
