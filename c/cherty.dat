The four main divisions, from the top down, are the Upper Slaty, Upper <b>Cherty,</b> Lower Slaty and Lower <b>Cherty.</b> Below these are {{quartzite}} and granite, and Virginia Slate and Duluth gabbro lie above.

5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and <b>cherty</b> sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E
25|$|Spectacular {{hydrothermal}} {{features are}} a part of the Richat Structure. They include the extensive hydrothermal alteration of rhyolites and gabbros and a central megabreccia created by hydrothermal dissolution and collapse. The siliceous megabreccia is at least 40m thick in its center to only a few meters thick along its edges. The breccia consists of fragments of white to dark gray <b>cherty</b> material, quartz-rich sandstone, diagenetic <b>cherty</b> nodules, and stromatolitic limestone and is intensively silicified. The hydrothermal alteration, which created this breccia, has been dated to have occurred about 98.2 ± 2.6million years ago using the 40Ar/39Ar method.|$|E
40|$|Antonio Mourâo Cavalcante - Ethnopsychiatry: culture {{comes to}} the aid of health. The Author takes a case history as a basis for {{developing}} a discussion where he emphasizes the psychiatric and cultural aspects of a situation. This is a typical ethnopsychiatric approach, which goes back to the work of Georges Devereux and Tobie Nathan. The psychiatric elements the case presents suggest a depression. The cultural aspects, closely linked to the realities of life in the Nordeste region of Brazil, reflect the world of rural traditional, steeped in religious beliefs and struggles for power. The scenario is typical of ancient Brazil which, through the aging patient, shows the decline, even the progressive disappearance, of that world, now suffused with modernity and social pluralism.

40|$|The authors wish {{to express}} their {{gratitude}} to S. Bonnet, C. <b>Chertier</b> and M. Batteau for their technical help in carnosol quantification and sample stability studies. International audienceThis paper illustrates {{the application of a}} recently proposed protocol allowing the scale-up prediction on hydrostatic countercurrent chromatography columns (centrifugal partition chromatographs or CPC). A commercial extract of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) was used as the starting material containing 0. 48 % of carnosol, an active pharmaceutical ingredient with great potential. After a rapid method development on a small-scale 35 -mL CPC instrument that allowed for the determination of the solvent system and maximum sample concentration and volume, the purification was transferred on two larger instruments using the "free space between peaks" method. The method takes into account the technical limitations of the larger instruments, such as pressure and/or maximum centrifugal field, and allows, by simply running an analytical-sized injection on the large scale rotor, to give an accurate prediction of the maximum sample load and best throughput. The 0. 27 g of rosemary extract maximum load on a 35 -mL CPC was transferred as a 1. 9 g load on a 254 -mL medium size CPC and 9 g load on a 812 -mL CPC. The maximum process efficiency of 3. 1 mg of carnosol per hour obtained on the small 35 -mL column was transferred on the 254 -mL CPC giving 8. 3 mg/h and, on the larger 812 -mL column 49. 4 mg of carnosol could be obtained per hour. If the scaling-up in CPC instruments is not directly homothetic, it can be highly predictable through a few simple experiments...|$|R

60|$|In {{crossing}} the Atlantic we hove-to, {{during the morning}} of February 16th, 1832, close to the island of St. Paul's. This cluster of rocks is situated in 0 degrees 58' north latitude, and 29 degrees 15' west longitude. It is 540 miles distant from the coast of America, and 350 from the island of Fernando Noronha. The highest point is only fifty feet above {{the level of the}} sea, and the entire circumference is under three-quarters of a mile. This small point rises abruptly out of the depths of the ocean. Its mineralogical constitution is not simple; in some parts the rock is of a <b>cherty,</b> in others of a feldspathic nature, including thin veins of serpentine. It is a remarkable fact that all the many small islands, lying far from any continent, in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, {{with the exception of the}} Seychelles and this little point of rock, are, I believe, composed either of coral or of erupted matter. The volcanic nature of these oceanic islands is evidently an extension of that law, and the effect of those same causes, whether chemical or mechanical, from which it results that a vast majority of the volcanoes now in action stand either near sea-coasts or as islands in the midst of the sea.|$|E
60|$|This pile of strata dips at {{an angle}} of about 20 degrees to N.E. by N., close up {{to the foot of}} the Cuesta de Los Hornos, a crooked range of {{mountains}} formed of intrusive rocks of the same nature with the above described hillocks. Only in one or two places, on this south-eastern side of the range, I noticed a narrow fringe of the upper gypseous strata brushed up and inclined south-eastward from it. On its north-eastern flank, and likewise on a few of the summits, the stratified porphyritic conglomerate is inclined N.E.: so that, if we disregard the very narrow anticlinal fringe of gypseous strata at its S.E. foot, this range forms a second uniclinal axis of elevation. Proceeding in a north-by-east direction to the village of Combarbala, we come to a third escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate, dipping eastwards, and forming the outer range of the main Cordillera. The lower beds were here more jaspery than usual, and they included some white <b>cherty</b> strata and red sandstones, alternating with purple claystone porphyry. Higher up in the Cordillera there appeared to be a line of andesitic rocks; and beyond them, a fourth escarpment of the porphyritic conglomerate, again dipping eastwards or inwards. The overlying gypseous strata, if they ever existed here, have been entirely removed.|$|E

50|$|Lithologically the up to 50 meter thick Ruhpolding Formation {{consists}} of black-green to red radiolarites grading into <b>cherty</b> limestones, <b>cherty</b> marls and <b>cherty</b> shales. It has formed from radiolarian ooze. The ooze consolidated diagenetically to thinly layered and regularly banded cherts. The chert layers are usually separated by very thin claystone layers creating a cyclic appearance. This cyclicity might correlate with Milankovic cycles. A plausible diagenetic cause can be excluded due to slump structures that incorporate several individual cycles. The cherts are mainly earthy red, but show greenish-blackish hues in places. The red coloration due to hematite {{is caused by}} the complete oxidation of iron compounds in oxygen-rich bottom waters. The red layers show Fe3+/Fe2+ > 1, whereas in the greenish layers the ratio is < 1, the coloration in the latter being tied to sericite, chlorite and maybe pyrite.|$|E

50|$|During the Triassic (Upper Norian and Rhaetian) <b>cherty,</b> platy limestones are {{deposited}} in the Tethyan region, an example being the Hornsteinplattenkalk of the Frauenkogel Formation in the southern Karawanks of Austria. They are composed of interlayered cherts and micrites separated by irregular, non-planar bedding surfaces. The <b>cherty</b> horizons have originated from radiolarian-rich limestone layers which subsequently underwent silicification. Similar sediments in Greece incorporate layers with calcareous turbidites. On local horsts and farther upslope these sediments undergo a facies change to red, radiolarian-rich, ammonite-bearing limestones. In central Japan clay-rich radiolarites were laid down as bedded cherts in the Upper Triassic. Their depositional environment was a shallow marginal sea with rather high accumulation rates of 30 meters/million years.
