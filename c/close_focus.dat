500|$|As Farr points out, [...] "snakes {{instantly}} notice you"; Dickinson's version {{captures the}} [...] "breathless immediacy" [...] of the encounter; and The Republicans punctuation renders [...] "her lines more commonplace". With the increasingly <b>close</b> <b>focus</b> on Dickinson's structures and syntax {{has come a}} growing appreciation that they are [...] "aesthetically based". Although Johnson's landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson's manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, {{can be drawn from}} varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page. Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson's handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin's 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts' dashes more closely.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} compound microscopes, which combine {{an objective lens}} near the specimen with an eyepiece to view a real image, appeared in Europe around 1620. The design {{is very similar to}} the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. Again claims revolve around the spectacle making centers in the Netherlands including claims it was invented in 1590 by Zacharias Janssen and/or his father, Hans Martens, claims it was invented by rival spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, and claims it was invented by expatriate Cornelis Drebbel who was noted to have a version in London in 1619. Galileo Galilei (also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could <b>close</b> <b>focus</b> his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version. The name [...] "microscope" [...] was coined by Giovanni Faber, who gave that name to Galileo Galilei's compound microscope in 1625.|$|E

5000|$|The {{generally}} accepted visual distance of <b>closest</b> <b>focus</b> [...] is 250 mm, and eyepiece power is normally specified assuming this value.

50|$|However, the Kilfitt Makro-Kilar 4 cm f/3.5 (West Germany/Liechtenstein) of 1955 for Exakta 35mm SLRs {{changed the}} {{everyday}} meaning of macro lens. It {{was the first}} lens to provide continuous close focusing. Version D of Heinz Kilfitt's (West Germany) Makro-Kilar focused from infinity to 1:1 ratio (life-size) at two inches; version E, to 1:2 ratio (half life-size) at four inches. The Makro-Kilar was a Tessar mounted in an extra long draw triple helical. SLR cameras were best for macro lenses because SLRs do not suffer from viewfinder parallax error at very <b>close</b> <b>focus</b> distances.|$|E
50|$|The FD series {{included}} {{a number of}} zoom lenses with close-focusing mechanisms, targeted at amateur photographers. The series also included three true macro lenses at 50mm, 100mm, and 200mm. These offered exceptionally <b>close</b> <b>focusing</b> and were corrected for flatness of field at close shooting distances. The 50mm and 100mm were marketed with extension tubes that allowed life-size reproduction. The 200mm can reach life size without additional extension.|$|R
5000|$|Strictly speaking, {{macrophotography}} is technical photography {{with actual}} image size ranging from near life-size (1:1 image-to-object ratio) to about ten or twenty times life-size (10 or 20:1 ratio, at which photomicrography begins). [...] "Macro" [...] lenses were originally regular formula lenses optimized for close object distances, {{mounted on a}} long extension tube or bellows accessory to provide the necessary <b>close</b> <b>focusing,</b> but preventing focusing on distant objects.|$|R
