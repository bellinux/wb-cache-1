5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E

5|$|Tuberculosis {{is closely}} linked to both {{overcrowding}} and malnutrition, {{making it one of}} the principal diseases of poverty.

The attack rate of confirmed infection in <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> was 2. 4 % overall, ranging from 0. 9 % among aircraft passengers to > 5 % among household members. Risk factors for infection among <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> were younger age, being a household member of an index case-patient, exposure during the index case-patient's symptomatic phase, and longer exposure. Among <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> with positive test results {{at the start of}} quarantine, 17. 2 % had subclinical infection.

5|$|As Lord President of the Council, Dudley {{headed a}} {{distinctly}} conciliar government {{and sought to}} introduce the adolescent King into business. Taking over an almost bankrupt administration, he ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances in ways that led to some economic recovery. To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis, appointing Lords Lieutenants who were in <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> with the central authority. Dudley's religious policy was—in accordance with Edward's proclivities—decidedly Protestant, further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E

5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} repulsive forces of {{interaction}} between atoms at <b>close</b> <b>contact.</b> When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{estimate}} the average numbers of <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> of soldiers patients with tuberculosis (TB), who admitted to Chest Diseases Hospital, in their troops, and to reveal active patients and the cases who needs for chemoprophylaxis, and to evaluate the treatment results. METHODS: This study was done in Pulmonary Division of GATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital between 1 st of January 2005 and 31 st of March 2006. Persons who worked with soldier patients bacteriologially diagnosed with TB in our hospital, in closed areas, and/or sleeping in the same dormitory were accepted as <b>close</b> <b>contacts.</b> Contacts were performed tuberculin skin test (TST), and taken their chest roentgenogram at 0, 3 rd, and 6 th months. More than 10 mm indurations in cases with no BCG and 15 mm indurations in cases with BCG were accepted as positive TCT. <b>Close</b> <b>contacts</b> that had positive TST or more than 6 mm increase in their controls were given the chemoprophylaxis with isoniasid for six months. Ninety-two smear positive patients with PTB were enrolled into the study. RESULTS: The mean age was 21. 6 &# 177; 2. 3 years. Of the 4501 <b>close</b> <b>contacts,</b> 89 % were screened during the first period and the control rates at 3 rd and 6 th months decreased to 58 % and 42 %, respectively. 11 new tuberculosis cases were found by screening of <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> (with an incidence of 244 / 100. 000). TST positivity or conversion was shown in 420 contacts, and were given chemoprophylaxis. Of 165 (39. 2 %) were completed six month therapy. COCLUSION: In our study, although the number of <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> per patients was significantly higher, the incidence of patients in <b>close</b> <b>contacts</b> was low.

5|$|Throughout {{his travels}} Marlborough {{remained}} in <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> with the Electoral court of Hanover, determined {{to ensure a}} bloodless Hanoverian succession on Anne's death. He also maintained correspondence with the Jacobites. The spirit of the age saw little wrong in Marlborough's continuing friendship with his nephew, the Duke of Berwick, James II's illegitimate son with Arabella. But these assurances against a Jacobite restoration (which he had been taking out since {{the early years of}} WilliamIII, no matter how insincere), stirred Hanoverian suspicions, and perhaps prevented him from holding the first place in the counsels of the future GeorgeI.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in Western Europe where priests {{were clearly}} demarcated from the laymen, the clergy of the Eastern Roman Empire {{remained}} in <b>close</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the rest}} of society. Readers and subdeacons were drawn from the laity and expected to be at least twenty years of age while priests and bishops had to be at least 30. Unlike the Latin church, the Byzantine church allowed married priests and deacons, {{as long as they were}} married before ordination. Bishops, however, were required to be unmarried.|$|E

5|$|Cantonese people, {{like the}} Hakka, were well known {{throughout}} Southeast Asia as mineworkers.

They migrated to Java {{about the same time as}} the Hakka, but for different reasons. In Indonesia's cities they became artisans, machine workers, and owners of small businesses such as restaurants and hotel-keeping services. The Cantonese are evenly dispersed throughout the archipelago, and number far less than the Hokkien or the Hakka. Consequently, their roles are of secondary importance in the Chinese communities.|$|E
