500|$|Austen's novels {{quickly became}} fashionable among opinion-makers, namely, those aristocrats who often {{dictated}} fashion and taste. Lady Bessborough, sister to the notorious Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, commented on Sense and Sensibility {{in a letter}} to a friend: [...] "it is a clever novel. ...tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it." [...] The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to one of the book's heroines: [...] "I think Marianne & me are very like in disposition, that <b>certainly</b> <b>I</b> am not so good, the same imprudence, [...] ".|$|E

500|$|PedroII {{regarded}} {{the death of}} his son as [...] "the most fatal blow that I could ever receive, and <b>certainly</b> <b>I</b> would not have survived were it not that I still have a wife and two children". The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Moore told Wired that DC {{offered him}} {{the rights to}} Watchmen back, if he would agree to prequel and sequel projects. Moore said that [...] "if they said that 10 years ago, when I asked them for that, then yeah it might have worked [...] But these days I don't want Watchmen back. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>I</b> don't want it back under those kinds of terms." [...] DC Comics co-publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee responded: [...] "DC Comics would only revisit these iconic {{characters}} if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves." [...] Following months of rumors about a potential Watchmen follow-up project, in February 2012 DC announced it was publishing seven prequel series under the [...] "Before Watchmen" [...] banner. Among the creators involved are writers J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein, and artists Lee Bermejo, J. G. Jones, Adam Hughes, Andy Kubert, Joe Kubert, and Amanda Conner. Though Moore has no involvement, Gibbons gave the project his blessing.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 1942, at {{the time}} when Stanley was {{preparing}} the draft drawings of the murals, the Japanese began an action which would become known as the Selarang Barracks Incident. It was an incident concerning seventeen thousand Anglo-Australian POWs, who were forced to vacate their buildings and be exposed for nearly five days in the open without water or sanitation for refusing to sign a [...] "No Escape Pledge". Against this backdrop, Stanley began to paint the murals. No one had asked the Japanese for permission to draw and at no stage did they interfere with his work. Considering the purpose of the murals, Stanley felt that the Chapel was basically dedicated to peace and reconciliation, and so he choose universal themes for the murals which would embrace all mankind. Paint was not readily available in the camp, but with the aid of the other prisoners, who unquestionably put themselves at great risk, materials to make the paint were gradually acquired—brown camouflage paint, a small amount of crimson paint, white oil paint and billiard chalk were found and brought for Stanley use. Despite still being very ill, Stanley set to work on the murals in early September 1942. His illness meant that he could only paint for a limited period each day, for perhaps 15 minutes at a time followed by a rest. To compensate {{as much as he could}} for the lack of coloured paint, Stanley resorted to using large brush strokes and big areas of solid colour when painting. In September 1942, a few weeks after Stanley began painting the murals, he was informed that his work party was to be sent north to Thailand to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. A colonel in charge of the hospital, who knew of his work-in-progress murals, intervened to have Stanley transferred back to the hospital so that he could continue on his work in the Chapel. Most of Stanley's unit who went to the Thai-Burma Railway never returned. Stanley recounted: [...] "Had I gone with them, most <b>certainly,</b> <b>I</b> would have died. So the murals very directly saved my life in the way I could never have foreseen... It's a terrible sense of debt... that one feels to the chapel." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Smith re-joined Iron Maiden, {{along with}} vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who commented, [...] "When {{he left the}} band in 1990, I think {{everybody}} was a bit surprised at how much we missed him and <b>certainly,</b> <b>I</b> don't think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him – big time. I wouldn't have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasn't in the band. I just don't {{think it would have}} been complete without Adrian, and now, it's great having three guitarists." [...] The band embarked on a short tour, after which the new line-up's first album, Brave New World, was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|In the Clue mailout for September 2008 Naismith stated: [...] "Despite the rumours, we've made no {{decisions}} about possible replacements for Humph, and {{are unlikely to}} make any decisions this year at least. [...] <b>Certainly</b> <b>I</b> don't envisage us selecting anyone on a permanent basis for several series." [...] It was announced that the show would continue recording beginning in 2009. The first new shows would be hosted by rotating guest presenters (similarly to the format of Have I Got News for You) before a permanent replacement host was decided. In the Clue mailout for February 2009 Naismith announced that Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon would host two shows each, to be recorded in April, May and June 2009 respectively. The programme returned on 15 June 2009, chaired by Fry with the usual panellists and special guest Victoria Wood. Every series since then has been chaired by Dee.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, when Gunn {{said he had}} the [...] "basic story" [...] for Vol. 2 {{while working}} on the first film, {{he also said he}} had ideas for a {{potential}} third film. Despite this, Gunn was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third Guardians film, saying it would depend on his feelings after making Vol. 2. In April 2016, Feige said the future MCU films are [...] "still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond, but <b>certainly</b> <b>I</b> would say Guardians 3 is [...] up there. I don't know what exactly the order will be." [...] In March 2017, Gunn stated there would be a third film [...] "for sure. We're trying to figure it out," [...] also adding, [...] "There are no specific plans for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. But we know unless something goes horribly—which is always possible, you never know—I think that Marvel would want to make another movie." [...] He also reiterated he was still unsure if he would be involved with the film, and that he would figure out his involvement and his next project [...] "over the next couple of weeks." [...] The following month, Gunn announced he would return to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Klementieff is expected to reprise her role as Mantis. Vol. 3 is scheduled to be released in 2020.|$|E

2500|$|On 13 November 1965, Tynan {{participated in}} a live TV debate, {{broadcast}} {{as part of the}} BBC's late-night satirical show BBC-3. He was asked whether he would allow a play to be staged in which sexual intercourse was represented on the stage, and replied: “Well, I think so, <b>certainly.</b> <b>I</b> doubt if there are any rational people to whom the word 'fuck' would be particularly diabolical, revolting or totally forbidden. I think that anything which can be printed or said can also be seen." [...] No recording survives of the programme, but Private Eye always maintained that Tynan's stammer made it the first three-syllable four-letter word. At the time, this was {{believed to be the first}} time the word [...] "fuck" [...] had been spoken on British television – although it has since been pointed out that at least three others have a prior claim: Brendan Behan on Panorama in 1956 (although his drunken slurring was not understood); an anonymous man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the River Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV's magazine show, Roundabout, that his job was [...] "fucking boring"; and the actress and raconteur Miriam Margolyes, who claims to have used the word in frustration whilst appearing on University Challenge in 1963. Johnson later called Tynan's use of the word [...] "his masterpiece of calculated self-publicity", adding [...] "for a time it made him the most notorious man in the country".|$|E
2500|$|During the 15th century {{opinion was}} more evenly split {{as to the}} nature of the Pyramids. [...] An {{anonymous}} traveler in 1420 speaks of going [...] "to see the most marvelous fourteen granaries of Pharaoh, five or six miles distant from Cairo." [...] He continues, [...] "you must cross the river Nile that flows from the Earthly Paradise ... and from the top [...] there is a good view of the very large city of Cairo. [...] But there, around these granaries, there is such a great colony of rats that it sometimes seems as if they cover the entire ground." [...] In 1436 the Spaniard Pero Tafur visited and left a rather fanciful account: [...] "We went to see the Granaries of Joseph, which are three leagues from the mouth of the river, in the desert. Although they say that there are many more further inland, there are only three here, two great ones, and one lesser one. They are diamond shaped, with the apex raised, and they must be much higher than the Great Tower at Seville. As one enters through the door there is a wall joined to another, making a circular stairway which reaches to the top, with many windows. And the beasts, when they are laden, climb up and are unloaded through those windows, and so they fill the granaries to the top. [...] <b>Certainly</b> <b>I</b> never thought that there was such a great building in the world to-day, nor have I seen the like before or since." [...] Another curious interpretation was offered by Georges Lengherand, Mayor of Mons, who visited in 1486: [...] "These granaries are very marvelous buildings and there used to be fourteen and now there are only six or seven. [...] It is impossible to enter, and they are all of dressed stone ... and are in the manner of a hill ... And while we were there, we found four wolves asleep on the stones ... And around these granaries are small little chambers, several cut into the rock; I do not know what could be their use, unless at the time theses granaries were in existence there were guards in these little chambers." [...] The German traveler Arnold von Harff paid a visit in 1497 and left a fairly objective report: [...] "We went across the Nile to these three Kassa Pharaonis. [...] As we approached near these three towers we saw that they were very strange buildings ... We climbed up outside for three full hours to the top, which is about two roods square. [...] From there we saw far out over the whole of the land of Egypt, and over the country to Alexandria and the western sea ... They say that King Pharaoh caused the towers to be built during the lean years, and kept them full of corn. [...] That is why they are called the Kassa Pharaonis. [...] But I could find no entrance. [...] Some say that they are the tombs of the old kings of Egypt." ...|$|E
