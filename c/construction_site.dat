40|$|In both {{developing}} countries, {{the construction}} industry {{is considered to be}} one of the most significant industries in terms of its impact on health and safety of the working population. Construction industry is both economically and socially important. However, {{the construction industry}} is also recognized to be the most hazardous. The objectives of this research are to investigate the safety performance in the <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The data were collected from the contractor, consultant and developer by using questionnaire to evaluate the safety performance in <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The questionnaires were distributed to respondents. The result show that there were still a lack of commitment from government, insurance company, the labour ministry, the developers, consultants and also the contractors to improving safety performance on the <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The suggestion is to improve the safety performance on the <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The government should follow up the safety performance by visiting the <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The insurance company should be more active in visiting the <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The developer should be more active toward safety by controlling, visiting the process in <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The contractors have to train the workers and promote the safety culture and follow up the safety performance. The consultant should control all the tools in the <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> to insure that those tools are safe...|$|R

40|$|In {{the coming}} years the {{maintenance}} costs for the German motorway network will continue to rise. The {{vast majority of the}} German motorways were opened to traffic between 1965 and 1985, which means that these sections of road are increasingly becoming in need of renovation. The simultaneous increase in traffic load and particularly the high proportion of heavy traffic are causing considerable damage to the road surface. This leads to an increased need for both short-term and long-term <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> In Germany the traffic routing forms 3 + 1 and 4 + 0 are mainly used in the area of long-term <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> These forms of traffic routing are in direct competition with each other as they can be used under very similar boundary conditions (cross-sectional widths, traffic load etc.). In the context of the scientific tests both forms of traffic routing were subjected to a safety and a traffic flow analysis. The evaluation of over 6, 500 traffic accidents in 269 <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> yielded the results that 3 + 1 <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> show an average of 10 % lower general accident risk than 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Furthermore in an accident with personal injury considerably more road users are injured or killed in 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Narrow inner areas of <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> may at first glance seem safer than wider 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites,</b> the effects of narrow road lanes however on the capacity and the more massive congestion situations involved are to be evaluated negatively in particular with regard to the hazard of traffic jams on road safety. Neither does the introduction of “staggered traffic” in combination with a general ban on overtaking on narrow lanes promise a long-term solution to efficiency problems. The efficiency still remains restricted in contrast to wider lanes and a significant reduction in traffic jams cannot be expected. The evaluations of the traffic flow tests in 20 empirically tested <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> reveal that the capacities in 3 + 1 <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> are up to 12 % higher than the capacities of 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> In particular with heavy traffic proportions of over 15 %, 3 + 1 traffic routings show advantages with regard to efficiency. The evaluation of the above-mentioned findings from the safety assessments and traffic tests leads to the conclusion that 3 + 1 <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> must be recommended and 4 + 0 <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> preferred...|$|R

40|$|Construction {{activities}} generate {{construction noise}} may cause noise annoyance {{among the public}} residents. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the noise annoyance level due to the sound pressure levels and the distances from the <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Three public resident areas around Johor which located near to the <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> have been selected. Two important indicators such as sound pressure levels and distances between the receiver and the noise sources were measured. 42 questionnaires were randomly distributed to the public residents who live near to the <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The results showed that all respondent have different annoyance levels due to the construction noise. The sound pressure levels received by the public residents are increasing with the decreasing of the distance between the receiver and the noise sources. Thus, the relationship of noise annoyance levels is directly proportional to the sound pressure levels produced from <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Meanwhile, the noise annoyance levels are decreasing with the increasing of the distances. As a conclusion, the public residents who live nearer to the <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> suffered from a high noise annoyance level as expected...|$|R

40|$|The study {{discusses}} {{the effectiveness of}} health and safety induction practices on <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> {{against the background of}} the Zambian construction industry experience. The research design included the literature review of relevant literature. Questionnaires and interviews were administered to regulatory bodies, health, and safety personnel. Observation was also employed on <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> to assess the health and safety practices being used. Health and safety in the construction industry are not something to be ignored or overlooked. The construction industry needs to take heed of the serious consequences of inadequate health and safety induction practices. The implications of inadequate health and safety induction procedures included among others threats to profitability, corporate social responsibility and increased turnover of the workforce leading to poor productivity. Adequate health and safety practices can improve the health and wellbeing of employees, reduce financial implications on firms and encourage productivity on <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Despite this, accidents are still prevalent on <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> in Zambia. The overall result of this research denotes that the implementation of health and safety induction practices is inadequate, as indicated by the negligent and non-adherent attitude to health and safety induction aspects on the sites by most stakeholders on <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> Therefore, health and safety induction practices are ineffective as preventive measures for reduction of accidents on <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> in Zambia...|$|R
