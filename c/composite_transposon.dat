40|$|A large {{transposable element}} (TE) {{comprising}} the white-apricot and roughest genes {{has been found}} to transpose to well over a hundred sites scattered over the Drosophila genome. We report the cloning of the essential parts of several TEs. TE 98 and TE 28 sequences were cloned by `walking' along the chromosome from the previously cloned heatshock genes. The ends of the TEs are characterized by dispersed repetitive elements belonging to the foldback (FB) family. FB elements are also associated with two independently isolated transposable elements originating from the white locus, Tp wc- 1 and Tp w+IV. The strong correlation between FB elements and large <b>composite</b> <b>transposons</b> suggests that a pair of these elements can mobilize large intermediary DNA segments. One particular FB family member, FB-NOF, is associated with TE 28, the white-crimson (wc) mutant, the wc-derived Tp wc- 1 and probably also with Tp w+IV. A unique sequence located close to the white end of TE 28 was used to clone the borders of TE 77 and the surrounding sequences in the bithorax region, indicating that the TE {{can be used as a}} probe for gene isolation.

40|$|The {{movement}} of the bacterial insertion sequence IS 50 and of composite elements containing direct terminal repeats of IS 50 involves the two ends of IS 50, designated O (outside) and I (inside), which are weakly matched in DNA sequence, and an IS 50 encoded protein, transposase, which recognizes the O and I ends and acts preferentially in cis. Previous data had suggested that, initially, transposase interacts preferentially with the O end sequence and then, in a second step, with either an O or an I end. To better understand the cis action of transposase and how IS 50 ends are selected, we generated a series of <b>composite</b> <b>transposons</b> which contain direct repeats of IS 50 elements. In each transposon, one IS 50 element encoded transposase (tnp +), and the other contained a null (tnp-) allele. In {{each of the five}} sets of <b>composite</b> <b>transposons</b> studied, the transposon for which the tnp+ IS 50 element contained its O end was more active than a complementary transposon for which the tnp - IS 50 element contained its O end.

50|$|Gene {{members of}} a multigene family or multigene {{families}} within superfamilies exist on different chromosomes due to relocation of those genes after duplication of the ancestral gene. Transposable elements {{play a role in}} the movement of genes. Transposable elements are recognized by inverted repeats at their 5' and 3' ends. When two transposable elements are close enough in the same region on a chromosome, they can form a <b>composite</b> <b>transposon.</b> The protein transposase recognizes the outermost inverted repeats, cutting the DNA segment. Any genes between the two transposable elements are relocated as the <b>composite</b> <b>transposon</b> jumps to a new area of the genome.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{genes for}} {{chlorate}} reduction in six bacterial strains were analyzed {{in order to}} gain insight into the metabolism. A newly isolated chlorate-reducing bacterium (Shewanella algae ACDC) and three previously isolated strains (Ideonella dechlora-tans, Pseudomonas sp. strain PK, andDechloromarinus chlorophilusNSS) were genome sequenced and compared to published sequences (Alicycliphilus denitrificans BC plasmid pALIDE 01 and Pseudomonas chloritidismutans AW- 1). De novo assembly of genomes failed to join regions adjacent to genes involved in chlorate reduction, suggesting the presence of repeat regions. Using a bioinformatics approach and finishing PCRs to connect fragmented contigs, we discovered that chlorate reduction genes are flanked by insertion sequences, forming <b>composite</b> <b>transposons</b> in all four newly sequenced strains. These insertion sequences delineate regions with the potential to move horizontally and define a set of genes that may be important for chlorate reduction. In addition to core metabolic components, we have highlighted several such genes through comparative analysis and visualiza-tion. Phylogenetic analysis places chlorate reductase within a functionally diverse clade of type II dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductases, part of a larger family of enzymes with reactivity toward chlorate. Nucleotide-level forensics of regions surrounding chlorite dismutase (cld), as well as its phylogenetic clustering in a betaproteobacterial Cld clade, indicate that cld has beenmobi-lized at least once from a perchlorate reducer to build chlorate respiration.

50|$|The Tn5 {{transposon}} {{system is}} a model system {{for the study of}} transposition and for the application of transposon mutagenesis. Tn5 is a bacterial <b>composite</b> <b>transposon</b> in which genes (the original system containing antibiotic resistance genes) are flanked by two nearly identical insertion sequences, named IS50R and IS50L corresponding to the right and left sides of the transposon respectively. The IS50R sequence codes for two proteins, Tnp and Inh. These two proteins are identical in sequence, save for the fact that Inh is lacking the 55 N-terminal amino acids. Tnp codes for a transposase for the entire system, and Inh encodes an inhibitor of transposase. The DNA-binding domain of Tnp resides in the 55 N-terminal amino acids, and so these residues are essential for function. The IS50R and IS50L sequences are both flanked by 19-base pair elements on the inside and outside ends of the transposon, labelled IE and OE respectively. Mutation of these regions results in an inability of transposase genes to bind to the sequences. The binding interactions between transposase and these sequences is very complicated, and is affected by DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks. In addition, other proteins {{seem to be able to}} bind with and affect the transposition of the IS50 elements, such as DnaA.|$|E

The second deletion transposon contains a conditional origin of replication that allows deleted chromosomal DNA to be captured as a complementary plasmid. By plating cells on media that do not support plasmid replication, the deleted chromosomal material is lost and if it is essential, the cells do not survive.

40|$|ABSTRACT Despite {{evidence}} for the prevalence of horizontal gene transfer of respiratory genes, {{little is known about}} how path-ways functionally integrate within new hosts. One example of a mobile respiratory metabolism is bacterial chlorate reduction, which is frequently encoded on <b>composite</b> <b>transposons.</b> This implies that the essential components of the metabolism are en-coded on these mobile elements. To test this, we heterologously expressed genes for chlorate reduction from Shewanella algae ACDC in the non-chlorate-reducing Shewanella oneidensisMR- 1. The construct that ultimately endowed robust growth on chlorate included cld, a cytochrome c gene, clrABDC, and two genes of unknown function. Although strain MR- 1 was unable to grow on chlorate after initial insertion of these genes into the chromosome, 11 derived strains capable of chlorate respi-ration were obtained through adaptive evolution. Genome resequencing indicated that all of the evolved chlorate-reducing strains replicated a large genomic region containing chlorate reduction genes. Contraction in copy number and loss of the ability to reduce chlorate were also observed, indicating that this phenomenon was extremely dynamic. Although most strains contained more than six copies of the replicated region, a single strain with less duplication also grew rapidly. This strain contained three additional mutations that we hypothesized compensated for the low copy number. We remade the mutations combinatorially in the unevolved strain and determined that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) upstream of cld enabled growth on chlorate and was epistatic to a second base pair change in the NarP binding sequence between narQP and nrfA that enhanced growth...|$|R

Analysis of 133 whole-genome sequences covering the taxonomic diversity of Acinetobacter spp. de-tected aphA 6 in the chromosome of 2 isolates of A. guillouiae, which is an environmental species, 1 of 8 A. parvus isolates, and 5 of 34 A. baumannii isolates. The gene was also present in 29 out of 36 A. guillouiae isolates screened by PCR, indicating that it is ancestral to this species. The Pnative promoter for aphA 6 in A. guillouiae and A. parvus was replaced in A. baumannii by PaphA 6, which was generated by use of the insertion sequence ISAba 125, which brought a 35 sequence. Study of promoter strength in Escherichia coli and A. baumannii indicated that PaphA 6 was four times more potent than Pnative. There was a good correlation between aminoglycoside MICs and aphA 6 transcription in A. guillouiae isolates that remained susceptible to amikacin. The marked topology differences of the phylogenetic trees of aphA 6 and of the hosts strongly support its recent direct transfer within Acinetobacter spp. and also to evolutionarily remote bacterial genera. Concomitant expression of aphA 6 must have occurred because, contrary to the donors, it can confer resistance to the new hosts. Mobilization and expression of aphA 6 via <b>composite</b> <b>transposons</b> and the upstream IS-generating hybrid PaphA 6, followed by conjugation, seems the most plausible mechanism.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the CH 19 beta-lactamase structural gene (blaZ) reveals it to be identical to the blaZ gene from E. faecalis HH 22 and to the blaZ gene from the staphylococcal beta-lactamase transposon Tn 552. We also report the presence of nucleotide sequence identical to a 317 -bp region of the staphylococcal insertion sequence IS 256 upstream of the blaZ gene in both CH 19 and CX 19. The identical segment of IS 256 is present downstream of the blaZ gene of CX 19, suggesting a second insertion of the element (in the inverted orientation) accompanying transfer to the recipient strain. Restriction analysis of the areas beyond the ClaI sites used to clone these regions suggests that full copies of the IS 256 -like element (designated IS 256 E) are present in all positions but that these elements were not {{directly involved in the}} transfer of the beta-lactamase gene to the recipient strain. We have also identified a region downstream of the second IS 256 E insertion site which exhibits substantial homology to ISSIW, an iso-ISSI insertion originally identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. These data suggest that the two enterococcal blaZ genes sequenced to date evolved from a common ancestor and may at one time have been incorporated into a transposon similar to Tn 552. They also suggest that IS 256 -like elements are mobile in E. faecalis and capable of inserting {{in a manner consistent with}} the formation of novel <b>composite</b> <b>transposons.</b> Finally, they provide the first confirmation of the presence of an ISSI-like element in enterococci, raising the possibility that these elements play a role in the exchange of chromosomal antimicrobial resistance determinants...|$|R

The analysis of triclosan resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates had previously shown that in about half of the strains, the mechanism of triclosan resistance consists on the heterologous duplication of the triclosan target gene due to the acquisition of an additional fabI allele derived from Staphylococcus haemolyticus (sh-fabI). In the current work, the genomic sequencing of 10 of these strains allowed the characterization of two novel <b>composite</b> <b>transposons</b> TnSha 1 and TnSha 2 involved in the spread of sh-fabI. TnSha 1 harbors one copy of IS 1272, whereas TnSha 2 is a 11. 7 kb plasmid carrying TnSha 1 present either as plasmid or in an integrated form generally flanked by two IS 1272 elements. The target and mechanism of integration for IS 1272 and TnSha 1 are novel and include targeting of DNA secondary structures, generation of blunt-end deletions of the stem-loop and absence of target duplication. Database analyses showed widespread occurrence of these two elements in chromosomes and plasmids, with TnSha 1 mainly in S. aureus and with TnSha 2 mainly in S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis. The acquisition of resistance by means of an insertion sequence-based mobilization and consequent duplication of drug-target metabolic genes, as observed here for sh-fabI, is highly reminiscent of the situation with the ileS 2 gene conferring mupirocin resistance, and the dfrA and dfrG genes conferring trimethoprim resistance both of which are mobilized by IS 257. These three examples, which show similar mechanisms and levels of spread of metabolic genes linked to IS elements, highlight the importance of this genetic strategy for recruitment and rapid distribution of novel resistance mechanisms in staphylococci.

40|$|AbstractWe {{discovered}} two new complex elements {{while studying}} large genomic rearrangements and segmental duplications {{in the human}} genome. Both resemble bacterial <b>composite</b> DNA <b>transposon</b> Tn 9, consisting of a core flanked by mobile elements, except that the flanking element is not a DNA transposon but instead is long terminal repeat retrotransposon-like with human endogenous retrovirus and satellite sequences. Based on the core size, we named them Xiao (∼ 30  kb) and DA (∼ 280  kb), meaning small and big, respectively, in Chinese. Xiao originated from a 19 p region encoding olfactory receptor 7 E members after the human/ape divergence from Old World monkeys, while DA likely evolved from a Xiao by inserting ∼ 200  kb of chimeric sequence from 16 p and 21 q into the Xiao core, resulting in a target site duplication of 3. 4  kb. DA/Xiao was identified in 30 loci on 12 chromosomes, and only DAs mediated intrachromosomal rearrangements, based on our reconstructed human–mouse–rat ancestral genome and the rhesus macaque genome...|$|R
