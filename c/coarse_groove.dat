50|$|Each kapa {{manufacturer}} used an ie kūkū, a beater {{with four}} flat sides that were each carved differently. Another way to carve the kapa is by starting on the four-sided affairs, with the <b>coarsest</b> <b>grooves</b> {{on one side}} used first in breaking down the bast, or wet bark. Then, the beating continued using two sides with finer grooves. Lastly, finishing touches were accomplished with the remaining smooth side of the beater. The carvings left an impression in the cloth that was hers alone. After the European discovery of the Hawaiian Islands, Western traders travelled to Hawaii especially for kapa.|$|R
50|$|The {{head and}} body {{are up to}} 7 inches long with a 5-inch tail. They weigh up to 7 ounces. They have a short thick body and dense fur, {{consisting}} of fine hairs and <b>coarse,</b> <b>grooved</b> spines (hence the common name “spiny rat”). The fur is brownish above and grayish white below with a faint orange tinge. The spines on the animal’s back are black throughout while the spines underneath are usually white with a reddish-brown tip. The spines cover the body except for the regions around the mouth, ears, feet and tail. The tail is bi-colored for its entire length.|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} spectroscopy {{experiments with}} visible adaptive optics (AO) telescopes at Starfire Optical Range and Mt. Wilson {{have demonstrated that}} spectral resolution can be routinely improved {{by a factor of}} - 10 over the seeing-limited case with no extra light losses at visible wavelengths. With large CCDs now available, a very wide wavelength range can be covered in a single exposure. In the near future, most large ground-based telescopes will be equipped with powerful A 0 systems. Most of these systems are aimed primarily at diffraction-limited operation in the near IR. An exciting new opportunity will thus open up for high resolution IR spectroscopy. Immersion echelle gratings with much <b>coarser</b> <b>grooves</b> being developed by us at LLNL will {{play a critical role in}} achieving high spectral resolution with a compact and low cost IR cryogenically cooled spectrograph and simultaneous large wavelength coverage on relatively small IR detectors. We have constructed a new A 0 optimized spectrograph at Steward Observatory to provide R = 200, 000 in the optical, which is being commissioned at the Starfire Optical Range 3. 5 m telescope. We have completed the optical design of the LLNL IR Immersion Spectrograph (LISPEC) to take advantage of improved silicon etching technology. Key words: adaptive optics, spectroscopy, high resolution, immersion grating...|$|R
50|$|To {{create a}} {{sandblasted}} letter, a rubber mat is laser-cut {{from a computer}} file and glued to the stone. The blasted sand then bites a <b>coarse</b> <b>groove</b> or channel into the exposed surface. Unfortunately, many of the computer applications that create these files and interface with the laser cutter {{do not have a}} wide selection of many typefaces, and often have inferior versions of those typefaces that are available. What now can be done in minutes, however, lacks the striking architecture and geometry of the chisel-cut letter that allows light to play across its distinct interior planes.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{record of}} Tel valley reveals the {{presence}} of the primates in its various zones during the Pleistocenephase. Paleolithic is being documented in Kalahandi, like Moter river basin in Dharamgarh region. The prehistoric painting in Gudahandi in Kalahandi shows a well advanced human settlement in the region. World's largest size celt (axe) of late stone age culture has been recovered from Chandrasagarnala in Kalahandi. This is the largest stone Axe of the world measuring 47cm and weighing 2.5kg, which shows very sophisticated workmanship. Similarly mesolithic and neolithic historical records are evident in Bijadongar, Koradongar , Gudahandi, Bicchakhaman, Budigarh, Chandrasagarnala, Karlapada, Bhaludongar, Chilpa, Habaspur, Belkhandi, Jamugudapadar, Dongargarh, Asurgarh, Phurlijharan, Ghantmal, Kuttrukhamar, Jampadar, Pipalnala, Godang, Budipadar, Mahimapadia, Nehena, Penjorani, Yogimath etc. in Kalahandi. The findings include hand axe, cleaver, pebble tools (chopper-chopping), core, blade, flake, point, celt, ring stones, microlithics, <b>coarse</b> pottery, <b>grooving</b> marks, cave art (painting & carving) etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{fracture}} {{surfaces of}} sonic and hand scaler instruments fractured under clinical and laboratory conditions {{were compared to}} their etched sections, and analyzed for evidence revealing the process that led to their failure. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy indicated {{the quality of the}} martensitic stainless steel comprising the sonic scalers, all from one manufacturer, was inferior to the steel comprising the hand scalers from another manufacturer. The sonic scalers contained stringer inclusions aligned longitudinally and consisting of calcium, aluminum, silicon, and other elements up to 50 µm in length. The sonic scalers displayed brittle fracture while the hand scalers displayed mainly ductile fracture. Microcracks occurred between stringer inclusions. Microhardness for sonic scalers, although slightly higher and significantly different from hand scalers, proved ineffective for detecting a structure-property relationship. Microscopy, however, proved very useful for this purpose and also well-suited for analyzing the stress state occurring on the instruments at the time of failure. All sonic scalers were stressed by being bent inwards, while a hand scaler was pulled and torqued by twisting. Retained <b>coarse</b> grinding <b>grooves</b> also affected fracture. Recommendations are made for hand instrument standards to include checks on steel quality for inclusions of the stringer type...|$|R
5000|$|After this, {{the bark}} is beaten {{on a wooden}} tutua anvil using wooden mallets called ike. In the beating the bark is made thinner and spread out to a width of about 25 cm. This phase {{of the work is}} called tutu (or tutua). The mallets are flat on one side and have <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>grooves</b> on the other sides. First the coarse sides are used and, {{towards the end of the}} work, the flat side (tā-tua). The {{continuous}} [...] "thonk" [...] beats of the tapa mallet is a normal sound in Tongan villages. If several women work together they can make a concert out of it. In that case there might be one who tukipotu, beats the end of the tutua to set the rhythm.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{tracks are}} all instrumentals, of which, [...] "Ruckzuck" [...] and [...] "Stratovarius" [...] are closest {{to a rock}} music {{approach}} in style. [...] "Ruckzuck" [...] has a tightly arranged opening section that includes a dramatic change of tempo, before an extended and largely percussive middle section, with an even faster reprise of the opening theme to end the piece. Following an extended drone opening played on keyboards, [...] "Stratovarius" [...] develops a scary organ intro as a looser succession of mainly guitar and drum based jams that build and break down. [...] "Megaherz", a duet played by Hütter and Schneider, begins as a deep, rippling bass tone that steadily expands with electronic treatments to a discordant climax. Following this, there is a meditative middle section played with flute and keyboards, after which the piece closes {{with a series of}} wave-like crescendos of increasing intensity. [...] "Vom Himmel hoch" [...] begins with distant-sounding drones that develop into Doppler effect sweeps as the keyboards begin to mimic the sound of falling bombs. Eventually, a very <b>coarse</b> rock <b>groove</b> emerges (triggered by the first beats of Dinger's drums), that quickens in tempo and, after a brief sonic interruption, reaches an explosive finale.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{contains}} {{descriptions of}} new and rare species of the family Galatheidae {{in the collection of}} the decapod Crustacea from the Sagami Bay, made by His Majesty the Emperor of Japan. Some well-known species are also included in the collection but excluded herein. Three new and one rare species, viz. Galathea imperialis sp. nov., Munida bellior sp. nov., Munidopsis granulata sp. nov. and M. camelus (Ortmann), are treated herewith. The first species is different from the other members of the genus Galathea in general features of the carapace. It is, however, inserted into this genus for the present. Of the last species additional details are provided. We are greatly indebted to the staff members in the Biological Laboratory, Imperial Household, for giving us the facilities to this study. We must be also thankful to Dr. Fenner A. Chace, Jr. of the U. S. National Museum for valuable suggestions on the presence or absence of epipods in the deep-sea forms. Galathea imperialis sp. nov. (Figs. 1, 2) Description of holotype. Carapace longer than broad, oblong in shape; transverse striae obscure, but three striae, i. e. anterior, middle and posterior ones slightly in evidence. Carapace sparsely furnished with long <b>coarse</b> setae; cervical <b>groove</b> distinct; no spines on gastric region. Rostrum fiat and triangular; lateral margin unarmed. Outer orbital angle not formed. Anterolateral spine prominent. Lateral margin of carapace with a spine immediately behind the cervical groove and with a spine on middle. Basal segment of antennule armed with two spines on outer dista...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{morphological}} and molecular analyses of a Florida topotype and other populations of Hemicriconemoides strictathecatus showed that this sheathoid nematode {{consists of two}} morphotypes, both with an average stylet length of more than 70 μm, but having different tail termini, bluntly pointed or rounded. These findings confirmed the morphological similarity of H. strictathecatus with H. mangiferae, which was considered a junior synonym of this species as previously proposed by Decraemer & Geraert (1992, 1996). Populations of a sheathoid nematode with a stylet length ranging from 62. 5 to 72. 0 μm from Taiwan, China, South Africa and Venezuela and identified in previous studies as H. strictathecatus {{were found to be}} morphologically and molecularly different from this species and are now considered as representatives of H. litchi. Another sheathoid nematode population from Florida, considered to be H. mangiferae by McSorley et al. (1980), was also found to be morphologically and molecularly congruous with H. litchi. During nematological surveys in Florida, a new sheathoid nematode was detected on date palms imported from California into Florida and is described herein as H. phoenicis sp. n. This new species is related morphologically to the H. strictathecatus morphotype with pointed tail terminus. Both have a stylet longer than 70 μm. The new species is phylogenetically related to H. strictathecatus and H. litchi. It differs morphologically from other Hemicriconemoides species by the cuticular ornamentation of the annuli, which are marked by <b>coarse</b> longitudinal ridges, <b>grooves</b> and thick margins. Morphological and molecular characterisations of H. cocophillus from Mozambique and Florida, USA are also elucidated in this study. New phylogenies of the genus Hemicriconemoides as inferred from the analyses of the ITS rRNA, D 2 -D 3 of 28 S rRNA and partial coxI gene sequences are provided. Pablo Castillo and Juan E.
