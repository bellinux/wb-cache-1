Motorists in today's busy world seek the best option in locating available parking points. The need for an efficient parking system stems from increased congestion, motor vehicle pollution, driver frustration and fatigue to mention but a few. This study was conducted {{at a time when}} the world was experiencing a financial crisis and more than ever motorists needed intelligent parking systems to reduce the cost of gas spent driving around to find parking. Indeed, the time spent driving around would be beneficial if used to do work that would put one at an advantage in the <b>credit</b> <b>recession.</b> The study was also conducted at a time when South Africa was preparing to host the 2010 soccer world cup. In the preparation to manage motor vehicle congestion, this study was a viable solution to manage the expected challenge of parking. This study presents the design and illustrates the performance of an intelligent parking system based on an integrated architecture where (1) Wireless Sensor networks (WSNs) using Small Programmable Object Technology (SPOT) motes are launched into parking places to monitor the activity of the parking area through light intensity sensing and (2) the sensed information is gathered and channeled through a gateway into databases used for parking space visualization and information dissemination over the World Wide Web technology and mobile devices via a Multi Protocol label Switching (MPLS) network. Using an illustrative simulation model of a small parking system built around a new generation of SUNspot motes, the study demonstrates how a real life smart parking iv system can be deployed to benefit motorists in today's busy World and serves as a foundation to future work on how this emerging generation of motes can be used to provide better ways of finding parking...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{develops}} a simple model on the asymmetric role of credit markets in output fluctuations. When credit markets are underdeveloped and enterprise activity is financed by trade credit, shocks may induce a break-up {{of credit and}} production chains, leading to sudden and sharp contractions. The development of a banking sector can reduce the probability of such collapses and hence {{plays a crucial role}} in softening output declines. However, the banking sector becomes a shock amplifier when shocks originate in the financial sector. Using industry-level data across a large cross-section of countries, we provide evidence in support of the model's predictions.

We use relative-to-industry growth {{in sales and}} growth in inventories as measures of a firm’s ability to fund its activities. We find that during recessions, industry-adjusted sales growth rates drop more for bank-dependent focused firms than for bankdependent diversified firms. This result holds after controlling for endogeneity of the diversification decision and survivorship bias. We find that inventory growth rates drop more for bank-dependent focused firms than for bank-dependent diversified firms during recessions even after controlling for contemporaneous growth in sales. Consistent with a credit constraint explanation, we document a larger drop in net debt issuances for bank-dependent focused firms during recessions. Overall, bankdependent diversified firms appear less <b>credit</b> constrained during <b>recessions</b> and consequently exhibit less cyclical behavior than bank-dependent focused firms. 3 This paper examines whether corporate diversification alleviates credit constraints.

In this paper we hypothesize that balance sheet indicators of creditworthiness could affect the external finance premium for bonds as they do for premia in other markets. Using bond-specific and firm-specific data for the United States, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand during 1995 - 2005 we find that firms with better financial health face lower external finance premia in all countries. When we introduce firm-level heterogeneity we show that financial variables appear to be both statistically and quantitatively more important in the Asian market than in the US. Finally, the premium is more sensitive to firm-level variables during <b>credit</b> crunches, <b>recessions</b> and sudden stops than other periods, with stronger effects for the Asian bond market.

30|$|Overall, the {{evidence}} indicates that policymakers are not powerless to boost employment or increase income from work—in either the context of countercyclical efforts following a severe downturn or the longer term. Specific types of hiring credits that states adopted in the Great <b>Recession</b> period—in particular, <b>credits</b> targeting the unemployed, and with recapture provisions—succeeded in boosting employment, although many other types of credits did not spur job growth. In addition, “deep” hiring credits {{in the form of}} generous wage subsidies often amounting to 100  % were effective at motivating employers to hire disadvantaged workers after the Great Recession, with some persistence of higher employment and earnings beyond the subsidy period. Perhaps consistent with earlier research suggesting that narrowly targeted hiring credits are ineffective, these wage subsidies did not focus on the severely disadvantaged, and some subsidies targeted the long-term unemployed. This evidence on hiring credits suggests that we might consider enacting legislation that triggers hiring <b>credits</b> when <b>recessions</b> hit, as we do with UI extensions and other automatic stabilizers.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the {{traditional}} difficulty encountered in finding evidence {{on the effects of}} credit availability on economic activity depends on the fact that these effects are powerful but rare and vary with the cycle. The global financial crisis offers an opportunity to test this assumption.

We find that the elasticity of a firm’s investment to the availability of bank credit has been significant in periods of economic contraction, but not in other periods; that the ability to tap alternative sources of finance is crucial to this result; that during the global crisis the impact of credit constraints on Italian investment in manufacturing was significant. credit availability; <b>credit</b> channel; Great <b>Recession...</b>|$|R

40|$|I {{construct}} a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} where a recession is initiated by losses suffered by financial institutions, and exacerbated by their inability to extend credit to the real economy. The event that triggers the recession {{is similar to a}} redistribution shock: a small sector of the economy — borrowers who use their home as collateral — defaults on their loans (that is, they pay back less than contractually agreed). When banks hold little equity in excess of regulatory requirements, their porfolio losses require them to react immediately, either by recapitalizing or by deleveraging. By deleveraging, banks transform the initial redistribution shock into a credit crunch, and amplify and propagate the financial shock to the real economy. In my benchmark experiment aimed at replicating key features of the Great <b>Recession,</b> <b>credit</b> losses (that is, a redistribution shock) of about 5 percent of GDP lead to a 3 percent drop in output, whereas they would have little effect on economic activity in a model where banks are just a veil...|$|R

The most grounded explanation for these economic downturns comes from Austrian business cycle theory. Firstly, U. S.

All measures must be taken to avoid the disruption of societies and economies, and this effort needs to be coordinated at the European and international level.

40|$|Up {{until now}} the National Minimum Wage (NMW) {{introduced}} in April 1999 {{appears to have}} been a policy success. So far there has been little evidence of a negative effect on employment. However, to date, the NMW has largely been operating in a period of prolonged economic expansion. Since the spring of 2008 the UK economy has experienced a downturn of significant proportions. In this report we examine the impact of the UK minimum wages in force during the 1980 s and 1990 s recessions when a system of Wages Councils was in operation. Wages Councils set (different) minimum rates of pay in a range of low-paying industries. However there were still a large number of low-wage industries not covered by the legislation. This project analyses the impact of the two previous recessions on employment and wages in Wages Council sectors relative to other similar but uncovered low-wage industries using data from the New Earnings Survey and Workforce in Employment Survey form the panel. The findings are informative about the likely consequences of the NMW in the current recession. We can find no significant detrimental impact on employment from the Wages Councils. We do find some evidence of negative hours effects from the Wages Councils, although we cannot find any further detrimental impacts through the recessions of the 1980 s or 1990 s. In addition, our individual level results are consistent with higher turnover in the Wages Councils sectors. We do find some evidence of a slowdown in turnover through the recessions, and some evidence that hiring increased in the 1990 s recession in these low wage sectors. None of the results here indicate that the National Minimum Wage will have any more detrimental impacts on employment through the recent <b>Credit</b> Crunch <b>recession.</b> However, one must be mindful of the fact that recessions can be very different. Our individual results suggest this. So the recent recession that the UK has experienced may play out differently across different sectors than have recessions of the past...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to a variety of}} fields. First, it explores the driving forces in the deterioration of bank capital during the pre-crisis period. Mehran et al. (2011) and Acharya et al. (2011) provide evidence of this phenomenon, but there has not been any empirical analysis that explains the determinants of such deterioration. Second, it is the first analysis to our knowledge that analyzes the determinants of banks’ financing choices by accounting for the corporate finance theories and the role of capital regulation. There are a handful of studies that study issuances of financial instruments, but they focus only on a subset, such as long-term debt in European banks (Rixtel et al. 2016), subordinated debt in the United States (Covitz and Harrison 2004), or bonds and securitization in European countries (Carbó-Valverde et al. 2017; Almazán et al. 2015). Third, it provides policy arguments to justify a tougher definition of regulatory capital in Basel III, since banks have incentives to comply with capital regulation through the financing alternative of lowest cost that is recognized as eligible capital. This incentive indicates that the problem of <b>credit</b> expansions or <b>recessions</b> in capital are not only due to procyclicality (Repullo and Suárez 2012; Repullo et al. 2010; Ayuso et al. 2004), but also because of the composition of the capital.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{medium-term}} behavior of output following banking crises, and {{its association with}} pre- and post-crisis conditions and policies. We find that output tends to be depressed substantially following banking crises, with no rebound to the precrisis trend. However, growth does eventually tend to return to its precrisis rate, with substantial crosscountry variation in outcomes. The depressed path of output typically results from reductions of roughly equal proportions in the employment rate, the capital-to-labor ratio, and total factor productivity. Initial conditions that are strongly associated with medium-run output losses include the short-run change in output, the occurrence of a joint banking-and-currency crisis, and a high precrisis level of investment. Short-run fiscal and monetary stimulus is associated with smaller medium-run deviations of output and growth from the precrisis trend.
