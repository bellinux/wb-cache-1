Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory.

5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions.

5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of <b>condensed</b> <b>matter</b> <b>physics</b> {{is closely related}} to the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The (2 + 1) -dimensional “universal ” {{variable}} separation formula (Tang, Lou and Zhang, Physical Review E 66, 046601 (2002)) {{is extended}} {{to a more}} general form for some (2 + 1) -dimensional integrable systems. Various independent arbitrary functions {{have been included in}} the extended formula. Starting from the universal formula and its extended form, a new type of solitons, foldons, is studied both analytically and graphically. The foldons may be “folded ” in quite complicated ways and then possess quite rich structures and abundant interaction behaviors. The completely elastic interaction property for a quite general class of foldons is proven and the corresponding phase shifts are explicitly given. PACS. 02. 30. Jr, 02. 30. Ik, 05. 45. Yv.
