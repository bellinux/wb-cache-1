40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to calculate the}} minimum-fuel driving control for a point-mass vehicle on a road with constant slope. The main control is the engine torque. Gear shifting, <b>clutch</b> <b>disengagement,</b> and braking {{are taken into account}} with a switching condition. The methodology can take into account distance and time constraints. Only longitudinal vehicle dynamics are used in combination with a quasistatic polynomial fuel consumption model. Simulations are given to analyze the optimal driving control and assess the fuel savings for acceleration and deceleration. status: publishe...|$|E
5000|$|A {{sprag clutch}} {{is used in}} most older {{automatic}} transmissions and some newer ones for shifts which require the synchronized engagement of one <b>clutch</b> with the <b>disengagement</b> of another. Using an overrunning clutch instead of a hydraulically actuated one makes this synchronization automatic. The sprag clutch simply [...] "lets go" [...] once the reaction force it provides is no longer needed.|$|R
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of control technology in automotive powertrain system is that, it enables the whole powertrain {{system to be}} precisely controlled; thereby, improving the overall vehicle powertrain performance and sustainability. This paper describes a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller development for an electro-mechanical friction clutch (EMFC) system for automotive applications especially, those using continuously variable transmission (CVT). Initially, a simulation study was carried out to determine the PID preliminary parameters values derived using the Astrom and Hagglund tuning method with Ziegler-Nichols formula; then, they are manually being fine- tuned experimentally to improve the <b>clutch</b> engagement and <b>disengagement</b> control performance until satisfying engagement and disengagement process are achieved. The results of this work show that the application of Astrom-Hagglund method and Ziegler-Nichols formula is capable of providing a practical solution for obtaining initial parameters of the PD controllers of engagement and disengagement control of the EMFC system. Through optimizing of P and D parameters, the system indicated excellent performances with improvement in terms of percentage overshoot, settling time and a very small steady state error for <b>clutch</b> engagement and <b>disengagement</b> processes...|$|R
5000|$|The {{report is}} taken from a study, begun in 1986, in which the NHTSA {{examined}} ten vehicles suffering from an [...] "above average" [...] number of incident reports and concluded that those incidents must have resulted from driver error. In the lab tests, throttles were positioned to wide open prior to brake application {{in an attempt to}} replicate the circumstances of the incidents under study. However, {{it is important to note}} that the newest vehicle involved in the study was a 1986 model and that no test vehicles were equipped with the electronic control (drive by wire) systems common in 2010. All vehicles were equipped with automatic transmissions, that is, no vehicles had manual transmissions with left foot <b>clutch</b> pedal <b>disengagement</b> of engine power.|$|R

This system retained the conventional manual transmission mechanicals but replaced the normal clutch mechanism with an electro-mechanical one without a foot pedal. <b>Clutch</b> engagement and <b>disengagement</b> on the Valeo unit is triggered by movement of the gear-lever, although the electronic control unit combines data from sources including engine, road-speed and gear selection to warn against, or over-ride, attempted selections outside the specified operating limits.|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out in the {{framework}} of a funded project aimed at evaluating the feasibility of an ad hoc <b>clutch</b> for the <b>disengagement</b> an auxiliary device, i. e. the vacuum pump used with the powerbrake in diesel engine vehicles, when its operation is not required. In this way it is possible to improve the overall vehicle efficiency. Strict design specifications were defined with reference to available room, torque transmission, absence of axial loads and fail-safe operation. A magnetorheological clutch with permanent magnets was conceived to fulfil the technical requirements. Different clutch geometries were compared with particular reference to the fail-safe operation and torque capabilities. After an iterative procedure, in which both mechanical design and magnetic field analyses were considered, the most promising solution was defined and a prototype was built and tested. A four-pole sliding permanent magnet was adopted to generate the magnetic field. The experimental results validated the developed models and demonstrated the feasibility developed models and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution. A principle for the automatic clutch actuation is also presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the control of}} an electromagnetic clutch. The considered clutch is particularly based on the modulated field principle and has two shafts with speed ratio of 1. 14 at synchronous conditions. The <b>clutch</b> engagement and <b>disengagement</b> and torque transmission is controlled by manipulation of the stator currents and the slip speed between the two shafts. The dynamic model of the electromagnetic clutch {{is found to be}} nearly identical to that of a permanent magnet synchronous machine, however the electrical speed is replaced by the slip speed. The relationship between the torque transmission between the input and output shafts and the electrical power input is explained. A clutch control strategy based on the d-q current control is presented. The test bed setup with the experimental prototype electromagnetic clutch is presented and the simulation results for this prototype is presented. It is shown that the electrical power demanded by the clutch is high only during engagement and disengagement transient periods and the steady state power is only required to compensate the electrical losses in the clutch. Experimental results demonstrate the controllability of the clutch with the proposed strategy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{overrunning}} clutch {{is one of}} the critical components that can engage and disengage according to the movement requirement of the power system and the rotor system. The merits of the different {{overrunning clutch}} are analyzed by the design characteristic, reliability, weight, process of the manufacture and so on. In the end, the application and development of the high speed overrunning clutch are discussed according to the characteristics of the transmission system that have high reliability, long life and light weight. Function of the High Speed Overrunning Clutch in the Transmission System of the Helicopter The high speed overrunning clutch {{is one of the}} critical components. When the power system drives the rotor system, the high overrunning clutch is on engagement mode that the speed of the driven part always tries to be equal to that of the driver. However, the high overrunning <b>clutch</b> is on <b>disengagement</b> mode that the speed of the driven part highly attempt that of the driver. The driver and driven parts of the high overrunning clutch is on differential speed during the twin or more engine being in start-up and the power system being on the G. I condition whereas the rotor system being on the autorotation condition. The speed of driven part is equal to 100 % nominal speed and the driver part is 0 during the start-up and one engine idling (OEI). The performance of the high spee...|$|R
40|$|In {{most of the}} Automotive Air Conditioning Systems (AACSs) {{though the}} {{compressor}} is powered by the car engine, the evaporator blower and the condenser fan are run by an alternator. Further, this alternator is powered from engine shaft. If there is any fault in the alternator that must drop the output voltage. This variation in output voltage can be achieved from a car battery by regulating its charging current. Owing to this, a stationary test rig for an AACS is developed with all actual automotive components coupled {{with a large number}} of sensors and additional accessories. However, the present investigation is restricted only to its air conditioning system, the alternator is replaced by a 12 volt lead acid car battery (capacity: 36 Ah) to invigorate the maneuvering of compressor <b>clutch</b> engagement and <b>disengagement</b> as well, empowerment of the prime movers. Now, a continuous monitoring of the system performance is done at different battery charge level. A DC power source is used to keep the battery voltage constant in different levels by varying the charging current. Further, in each battery charge level tests are conducted at three different blower speeds by regulating the existing toggle switch of the automobile. It is observed that the evaporator blower and the condenser fan speeds reduces continuously with the discharging of the storage battery, resulting a certain drop in air flow rate across the heat exchangers. Hence, the discharge pressure and the temperature increases due to lack of proper cooling across the condenser. Here, the continuous monitoring of the battery discharge voltage {{and its impact on the}} deterioration on the system cooling capacity, compression work and the COP are reported...|$|R
