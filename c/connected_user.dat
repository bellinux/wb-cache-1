Currently {{there is a lack of}} uniform interoperability plans and implementation. There is a lack of common industry view on architectural framework. This increases costs and slows down 3rd party mobile development. An open approach is required across all industries to achieve same end results and services.|$|E

50|$|The GGSN {{converts}} the GPRS packets {{coming from}} the SGSN into the appropriate packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or X.25) and sends {{them out on the}} corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are converted to the GSM address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN address of the user and his or her profile in its location register. The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the <b>connected</b> <b>user</b> equipment (UE). The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.|$|E

For each video user connected to Red 5 streaming server, CPU, memory, and I/O resources are utilized. However, with the current development in computer hardware technology, these are not very critical. The performance bottleneck that limits the number of users the server would accommodate with higher quality of service (QoS) depends on the network channel capacity.|$|E
30|$|Predicting {{popularity}} {{in social media}} from intrinsic properties of newly submitted content is difficult [17]. However, users’ early reactions provide some measure of predictability [4, 11, 18, 19]. The early votes on a story allow estimating its interestingness to fans and other users, thereby predicting how the story will accumulate additional votes. These predictions are for expected values and cannot account for the large variation due, for example, to a subsequent vote by a highly <b>connected</b> <b>user</b> {{which leads to a}} much larger number of votes.|$|E

40|$|The {{traffic in}} {{telephone}} networks is analyzed in this paper. Unlike the classical traffic analysis where call blockings {{are due to}} the limited channel capacity, we consider here a more realistic cause for call blockings {{which is due to}} the way in which users are networked in a real-life human society. Furthermore, two kinds of user network, namely, the fully <b>connected</b> <b>user</b> network and the scale-free network, are employed to model the way in which telephone users are connected. We show that the blocking probability is generally higher in the case of the scale-free user network, and that the carried traffic intensity is practically limited not only by the network capacity but also by the property of the user network.

40|$|With the {{constant}} march towards a paperless business environment, database systems {{are increasingly being}} used to hold more and more sensitive information. This means they present an increasingly valuable target for attackers. A mainstream method for information system security is Role-based Access Control (RBAC), which restricts system access to authorised users. However {{the implementation of the}} RBAC policy remains a human intensive activity, typically, performed at the implementation stage of the system development. This makes it di cult to communicate security solutions to the stakeholders earlier and raises the system development cost, especially if security implementation errors are detected. The use of connection pooling in web applications, where all the application users connect to the database via the web server with the same database connection, violates the the principle of minimal privilege. Every <b>connected</b> <b>user</b> has, in principle, access to the same data. This may leave the sensitive data vulnerable to SQL injection attacks or bugs in the application...|$|E
40|$|Partially {{connected}} {{operation is}} the circumstance {{in which the}} communication link between two computers is intermittent, either by choice or because or failure. This paper describes the design and performance of a user level toolkit that is suited to accessing the home directory of a partially <b>connected</b> <b>user</b> in a bandwidth-efficient manner. Compared to custom file systems for partially connected operation, the toolkit is easier to deploy and provides extra degrees of flexibility because it runs at user level and uses the local file system for its cache. The toolkit {{makes it possible for}} unaltered clients to access NFS file systems exported by unaltered servers. The maintenance of consistency between client and server is automatic provided that certain assumptions are upheld, the primary one being that sharing is limited {{in such a way that}} there is a "single locus of update. " That is, for extended periods, updates are applied either to the client's cache or directly to the server, but [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An open eHealth {{platform}} for health management using adaptable service profiles for different medical specialties {{is currently being}} validated in the regional health information network of Santorini, in the Southern Aegean region of Greece. The core of the installation is an electronic health record (EHR), customized for primary care, that has been extended with advanced eHealth services. Users of the EHR can create an active episode folder by selecting an eHealth service profile. Relevant clinical data {{can be added to}} the folder and users will be aware or be notified of updates. Once in a folder, a <b>connected</b> <b>user</b> perceives the actions of other users in the same folder and may use medical devices in a collaborative manner. The underlying service engineering framework allows maintenance of service profiles without disrupting the operation of the system. Preliminary results show that end-users have recognized the efficiency of the system and are eager to use it in managing the health of their patients both in their office and at the patients ' home...|$|E
