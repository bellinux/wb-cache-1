The only surface {{preparation}} required for modern ground coats is degreasing of the steel with a mildly alkaline solution. White and coloured second [...] "cover" [...] coats of enamel are applied over the fired ground coat.

There are various methods of transferring the design while removing the backing-paper, {{some of which are}} suited to machine application.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Titanium white <b>cover</b> <b>coat</b> is {{required}} to produce stable white color development without a lack of hiding substrate and with less coating thickness. The basic mechanism of titanium <b>cover</b> <b>coat</b> is to disperse crystals of titanium dioxide well in glass structure so as to promote a good white color development. Therefore, it significantly affects the covering power of titanium <b>cover</b> <b>coat</b> whether {{a sufficient number of}} the crystals are dispersed or not in the glass structure. Chemical compositions of the <b>cover</b> <b>coat</b> frit, milling formula and firing conditions are key to a good color development, and another factor critical to covering power is bubble structure in enamel layer or a number and size of bubbles. Bubbles in enamel layer generate diffused reflection which may supplement covering power of titanium dioxide. The amount of soluble salts in enamel, clay content and firing conditions affect the final bubble structure.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{preparing}} an ultra-thin, adhesiveless, multi-layered, patterned polymer substrate is disclosed. The process {{may be used}} to prepare both rigid and flexible cables and circuit boards. A substrate is provided and a polymeric solution comprising a self-bonding, soluble polymer and a solvent is applied to the substrate. Next, the polymer solution is dried to form a polymer coated substrate. The polymer coated substrate is metallized and patterned. At least one additional coating of the polymeric solution is applied to the metallized, patterned, polymer coated substrate and the steps of metallizing and patterning are repeated. Lastly, a <b>cover</b> <b>coat</b> is applied. When preparing a flexible cable and flexible circuit board, the polymer coating is removed from the substrate...|$|E

40|$|Mie {{scattering}} is {{an important}} tool for diagnosing microparticles or aerosol particles in technical or natural environments. Mie theory is restricted to spherical, homogeneous, isotropic and non-magnetic particles in a non-absorbing medium. However, as microparticles are hardly ever spherical or homogeneous, there is much interest in more advanced scattering theories. During recent decades, scattering methods for non-spherical and non-homogeneous particles have been developed and even some computer codes are readily available. Extension of Mie theory <b>covers</b> <b>coated</b> spheres, stratified spheres and clustered spheres. For homogeneous non-spherical particles such as spheroids, ellipsoids and finite cylinders, surface discretization methods have been developed. Scattering by inhomogeneous particles may be computed by volume discretization methods. ...|$|R

50|$|Single-sided {{flexible}} circuits have {{a single}} conductor layer made of either a metal or conductive (metal filled) polymer on a flexible dielectric film. Component termination features are accessible only from one side. Holes may be formed in the base film to allow component leads to pass through for interconnection, normally by soldering. Single sided flex circuits can be fabricated with or without such protective coatings as cover layers or <b>cover</b> <b>coats,</b> however {{the use of a}} protective coating over circuits is the most common practice. The development of surface mounted devices on sputtered conductive films has enabled the production of transparent LED Films, which is used in LED Glass but also in flexible automotive lighting composites.|$|R

40|$|A high {{temperature}} oxidation resistant, {{thermal barrier coating}} system is disclosed for a nickel cobalt, or iron base alloy substrate. An inner metal bond coating contacts the substrate, and a thermal barrier <b>coating</b> <b>covers</b> the bond <b>coating.</b> NiCrAlR, FeCrAlR, and CoCrAlR alloys are satisfactory as bond coating compositions where R=Y or Yb.

40|$|In this Chapter, {{we review}} the {{theoretical}} analysis {{and the design}} principles of electromagnetic cloaking devices working both at microwaves and optical frequencies. The cloaking approach we use {{is based on the}} scattering cancellation principle, applied not only to canonical geometries but also to irregularly-shaped objects with anisotropic scattering response. The cloaking devices are synthesized through plasmonic or metamaterials conformal <b>covers,</b> <b>coating</b> a given object, providing a significant and uniform scattering reduction of the overall structure, independent of the angle of incidence, position and polarization of the illuminating electromagnetic radiation. The robustness of the invisibility cloak is also discussed, proposing a proper figures of merit and validating the theoretical formulation and the design procedure through full-wave numerical simulations. The simulation results confirm that the plasmonic cloaking technique may be effectively applied to highly reduce the scattered field of even strongly anisotropic dielectric, plasmonic or conducting objects. ...|$|R

50|$|For ground coats, the {{composition}} of a frit for any given application is determined primarily by the metal used as the substrate: different varieties of steel, and different metals such as aluminium and copper, require different frit compositions to bond to them. For <b>cover</b> <b>coats</b> the frit is composed to both bind to the ground-coat and produce the desired external properties. Frit is normally prepared by mixing the ingredients and then milling the mixture into a powder. The ingredients, most often metal oxides and minerals such as quartz (or silica sand), soda ash, borax, and cobalt oxide, are acquired in particulate form; the precise chemical composition and amount of each ingredient must be carefully measured and regulated. Once prepared, this powdered frit is then smelted and stirred to promote even distribution of materials; most frits are smelted at temperatures between 1150 and 1300¬∞C. After smelting, the frit is again milled into a powder, most often by ball mill grinding.|$|R
40|$|The {{attachment}} of Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan I) and two {{strains of}} group A and G streptococci on glass <b>cover</b> slips <b>coated</b> with fibronectin, fibronectin fragments, or fibrinogen was studied. The attachment was quantitated by counting the attached bacteria on glass surfaces {{coated with a}} similar molarity of the proteins. Fibronectin was a more effective attachment factor than fibrinogen for staphylococci, while group G streptococci attached better on fibrinogen- than on fibronectin-coated cover slips. In this system, group A streptococci bound almost exclusively to substrate-bound fibrinogen. Attachment experiments involving the use of staphylococci pretreated with soluble fibronectin or fibrinogen revealed that bacterium-bound fibronectin and fibrinogen were able to enhance the adherence on <b>cover</b> slips <b>coated</b> with fibronectin. The 30 -kilodalton NH 2 -terminal and the 120 - to 140 -kilodalton COOH-terminal fragments of fibronectin, both of which contain bacterial binding sites, mediated the staphylococcal attachment, suggesting that both parts of the molecule {{are involved in the}} attachment mediated by fibronectin...|$|R
