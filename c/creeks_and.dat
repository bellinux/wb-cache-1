5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Towns County, Georgia forced multiple {{residents to}} evacuate from rising flood water. Numerous <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> rivers {{in the northern}} portion of the state overflowed.|$|E
5|$|More than 500 named <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> rivers make up Oklahoma's waterways, {{and with}} 200 lakes created by dams, it holds the nation's {{highest number of}} {{artificial}} reservoirs. Most of the state lies in two primary drainage basins belonging to the Red and Arkansas rivers, though the Lee and Little rivers also contain significant drainage basins.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} routes was {{suitable}} for heavy freight. Lighter cargoes were carried in York boats to Hudson Bay or in canoes {{on the border}} route. Both routes required navigation of large and hazardous lakes, shallow and rapid-strewn rivers, and swampy <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> bogs, connected by numerous portages where both cargo and watercraft had to be carried on men's backs.|$|E

5|$|September 8, 2004– Former Hurricane Frances {{crosses the}} western {{portion of the}} state, {{dropping}} very heavy rainfall peaking at 23.6inches (599mm) on Mount Mitchell. The rainfall causes widespread flooding, with many <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> rivers surpassing flood stage; hundreds of homes and businesses are damaged or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Stylidium habitat {{includes}} grassy plains, open heaths, rocky slopes, sandplains, forests, and {{the margins}} of <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> water holes. Somes species, such as S. eglandulosum, can even be found in disturbed areas like near roads and under powerlines. Others (i.e. S. coroniforme) are sensitive to disturbance and are considered rare because of their extremely specific habitat.|$|E
5|$|The species {{grows in}} sand dunes of white, white-grey or {{yellow-brown}} sand, amongst {{a system of}} ephemeral salt creeks. Populations occur both in low-lying areas near <b>creeks,</b> <b>and</b> atop dunes. The vegetation {{has been described as}} low open woodland over heath, and as tall open shrubland with some scattered trees.|$|E
50|$|The East Walker River {{rises from}} snow melt in the Sierra Nevada of eastern California north of Mono Lake {{and near the}} {{northeast}} boundary of Yosemite National Park. The mainstem begins in {{the south end of}} the Bridgeport Valley in Mono County, California, and flows from there north past Bridgeport, where it is impounded to form the Bridgeport Reservoir. Perennial tributaries of the river above Bridgeport Reservoir begin with Green <b>Creek</b> (<b>and</b> its Summers <b>Creek</b> sub-tributary), then Virginia <b>Creek</b> (<b>and</b> its Dog <b>Creek,</b> Dunderberg <b>Creek,</b> <b>and</b> Clearwater <b>Creek</b> sub-tributaries). Next Robinson <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Buckeye <b>Creek</b> (<b>and</b> its Swauger <b>Creek</b> sub-tributary) enter the reservoir.|$|R
50|$|As of 2000, the <b>creek</b> <b>and</b> two of {{its tributaries}} (Little Sulphur <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Squaw <b>Creek)</b> still {{supported}} steelhead trout.|$|R

5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes {{in the ground and}} gather up the oil as they could, often leading to <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the habitat}} quality of upper Fishing Creek {{and its tributaries}} were rated {{on a scale of}} 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. Most of this part of the creek and its tributaries were rated 166 or higher, which was considered optimal. The waters near the mouths of West Branch and East Branch Fishing <b>Creeks,</b> <b>and</b> Fishing Creek near Benton, were rated 113 to 160, considered suboptimal. A portion of West Creek was rated 60–112, considered marginal.|$|E
5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} contains glassworts {{and common}} cord {{grass in the}} most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The drier areas contain maritime grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass. The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats.|$|E

5000|$|Both Panoche <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Panoche Valley, are {{referred}} to as the [...] "Big Panoche", distinguishing them from the Little Panoche <b>Creek,</b> <b>and</b> valley.|$|R
5|$|The town of Milford Haven lies on {{the north}} bank of the Milford Haven waterway, which is a ria or drowned valley. This is a {{landscape}} of low-lying wooded shorelines, <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> mudflats. There {{has been a great}} deal of loss and degradation of local mudflat habitat as a result of industrial and commercial development – one study indicated a 45 per cent loss in Hubberston Pill.|$|E
5|$|The virgin forests cooled {{the land}} and streams, and centuries of {{accumulated}} organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into the <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> runs so that they flowed more evenly year-round. Pine Creek and its tributaries were home to large numbers of fish, including trout, but dams downstream on the Susquehanna River have eliminated the shad and eels once found here by blocking their migrations. Habitat for land animals was destroyed by the clearcutting of forests, {{but there was also}} a great deal of hunting, with bounties paid for large predators.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the <b>Creeks</b> <b>and</b> the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Pocomoke River, several creeks also flow into Pocomoke Sound: Ape Hole <b>Creek,</b> East <b>Creek,</b> <b>and</b> Marumsco <b>Creek</b> in Maryland, <b>and</b> Bullbegger <b>Creek,</b> Messongo <b>Creek,</b> <b>and</b> Guilford <b>Creek</b> in Virginia.|$|R
50|$|As of 2000, Austin <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> all {{its major}} tributaries all {{supported}} steelhead trout. Austin <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> East Austin <b>Creek</b> also harbored California freshwater shrimp.|$|R
50|$|Tributaries {{include the}} Square <b>Creek,</b> Betts <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Mearon <b>Creek</b> in Alberta; Adskwatim Creek, Osborn River, La Guarde <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Siphon <b>Creek</b> in British Columbia.|$|R
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis lies on both {{banks of}} the Mississippi River, {{just north of the}} river's {{confluence}} with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> waterfalls, many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. It was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle, with Minneapolis proper containing America's fifth-highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies. As an integral link to the global economy, Minneapolis is categorized as a global city.|$|E
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|E
50|$|To {{the west}} of the {{township}} flow the Eyre <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> smaller Quoich <b>Creek,</b> <b>and</b> these join the Mataura River about 2 km to the south.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} small creeks on the {{northern}} shore, including Pooles <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Manor <b>Creek.</b> On the southern shore small creeks include Morgan <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Scotchman <b>Creek.</b>|$|R
50|$|The primary inflow to {{the lake}} is an unnamed <b>creek,</b> <b>and</b> the primary outflow is an unnamed creek which flows via Limestone <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Bronte <b>Creek</b> to Lake Ontario.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through <b>creeks</b> <b>and</b> marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of December, Nicolls was {{directed}} to join the expedition against New Orleans. Nicolls joined General Edward Pakenham's force, accompanied by less than 100 Seminole, Creek, and Choctaw warriors. At the Battle of New Orleans on 8 January 1815, Nicolls was attached, {{with some of his}} men, to the brigade commanded by Colonel William Thornton of the 85th Regiment of Foot (Bucks Volunteers). Nicolls was the senior-ranking officer of the Royal Marines present at the battle, but Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane forbade Nicolls {{to take part in the}} fighting personally, fearing that mishap to Nicolls might deprive the British of their most competent officer serving with the <b>Creeks</b> <b>and</b> Seminoles. The actual battlefield command of the 100 Royal Marines brigaded with the 85th Foot went to a less senior officer, Major Thomas Benjamin Adair, commanding officer of the Marine detachment on HMS Vengeur. Nicolls embarked HMS Erebus on 12 January at Cat Island Roads, and disembarked at Apalachicola on 25 January, accompanied by several Creek warriors and a number of Royal Marine reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the river}} system was tidal {{as far as}} Hackney Wick, several of the mills were tide mills, {{including}} those at Abbey Mills and those at Three Mills, one of which survives. Construction of the New River {{in the seventeenth century}} to supply drinking water to London, with subsequent extraction by waterworks companies, led to a lowering of water levels, and the river was gradually canalised to maintain navigation. Significant changes occurred with the creation of the Lee Navigation in 1767, which resulted {{in the construction of the}} Hackney Cut and the Limehouse Cut, allowing barges to bypass most of the back rivers. A major reconstruction of the rivers took place in the 1930s, authorised by the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, but by the 1960s, commercial usage of the waterways had largely ceased. Deteriorating infrastructure led to the rivers dwindling to little more than tidal <b>creeks,</b> <b>and</b> they were categorised in 1968 as having no economic or long-term future.|$|E
50|$|As of 2000, Maacama <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> all {{its major}} tributaries all {{supported}} steelhead trout. Franz Creek also harbored California freshwater shrimp, <b>and</b> Redwood <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Maacama <b>Creek</b> hosted coho salmon.|$|R
50|$|Major tributaries of the Kiamichi River include Jack Fork <b>Creek,</b> Buck <b>Creek,</b> <b>and</b> Ten Mile <b>Creek.</b> Black Fork <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> Pine <b>Creek</b> are {{the most}} {{significant}} tributaries of Little River.|$|R
