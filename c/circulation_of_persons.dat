Here we have investigated longitudinally the effects of induction chemotherapy, conditioning radiochemotherapy, and allogeneic HSCT on composition, phenotype, and recovery of circulating innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in 51 acute leukemia patients. We found that reconstitution of ILC 1, ILC 2, and NCR(-) ILC 3 was slow {{compared with that of}} neutrophils and monocytes.

In the present study, we investigated the consequences of these elevated levels of IL- 18 on natural killer (NK) cells and the immunopathogenesis of AIDS. We show here an inverse correlation between IL- 18 concentrations and absolute numbers of various subsets of NK cells in infected persons. Recombinant human IL- 18 caused increased death of a human NK cell line, {{as well as of}} primary human NK cells in vitro. The IL- 18 -mediated cell death was dependent upon Fas-FasL interactions and tumor necrosis factor alpha. IL- 18 induced the expression of FasL on NK cells, increased the transcription from the human FasL promoter, reduced the expression of Bcl-XL in NK cells, and increased their sensitivity to FasL-mediated cell death.

By the end of the 19 th century many Italian painters had established their studios in Cairo and Alexandria and worked as professors in art schools. They were committed to the institutionalization of the artistic practice, in particular, in the conception of the School of Fine Arts in Cairo established by Prince Yussuf Kamal in 1908. Besides, a number of young Egyptians belonging to the generation of the so-called “pioneers” received grants to study art in Italy, in particular in Rome and Florence. These ties were strengthened by the political climate of the 1920 s and 1930 s and the diplomatic relationships between the Egyptian monarchy and the Italian government.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether HIV- 1 produces microRNAs and elucidate whether these miRNAs can induce inflammatory response in macrophages (independent {{of the conventional}} miRNA function in RNA interference) leading to chronic immune activation. Methods: Using sensitive quantitative Real Time RT-PCR and sequencing, we detected novel HIV-derived miRNAs in the sera <b>of</b> HIV+ <b>persons,</b> and associated with exosomes. Release of TNFa by macrophages challenged with HIV miRNAs was measured by ELISA. Results: HIV infection of primary alveolar macrophages produced elevated levels of viral microRNAs vmiR 88, vmiR 99 and vmiR-TAR in cell extracts and in exosome preparations from conditioned medium. Furthermore, these miRNAs were also detected in exosome fraction of sera from HIV-infected persons. Importantly, vmiR 88 and vmiR 99 (but not vmiR-TAR) stimulated human macrophage TNFa release, which is dependent on macrophage TLR 8 expression. These data support a potential role for HIV-derived vmiRNAs released from infected macrophages as contributing to chronic immune activation in HIV-infected persons, and may represent a novel therapeutic target to limit AIDS pathogenesis.

The city had, however, from remote times, experimented with welcoming practices (temporary or not) and experienced significant events in the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> It was not just in the Middle Ages that such introductions of people coming from other regions can be verified in the Bolognese territory.  A great immigration was decreed by Rome in the 2 nd century B.

Even if the migratory processes in the history of Bologna were numerous, this contribution nevertheless directs its attention to the 12 th - 13 th centuries, a period that, thanks to the presence of the Studium and to economic activities, forced the city to confront anew an elevated number of students.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a {{chronology}} of events presented by the Romanian media, especially newspapers with national coverage and impact like Gândul and Adevărul, between {{the first week of}} June to the first week of September 2015, when the issue of having a mosque erected in Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, was intensely debated by intellectuals, politicians, and religious professionals. The debates were intensely heated from the onset of these events and most of them revealed that most of the participants were driven by anti-Muslim attitudes, xenophobia, and assertive nationalism, a complex of feelings that I called “negative ecodomy”. The concept of “negative ecodomy” presupposes an attempt to built a safe environment, in this case for Romanians in their own country, but the adjective “negative” was added to the the positive idea of “ecodomy” because these efforts to offer a safe context for Romanians were accompanied by the negativity of anti-Muslim, xenophobic, and nationalistic activities. This array of negative ecodomic attitudes were displayed by Romanians not only in online media but also in the street through protests and other similar actions in a country which {{has been a member of}} the European Union for almost a decade and was supposed to adhere to the European Union’s basic principles of multiculturalism and the free <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> The totality of these events show that Romanians are still rather far from accepting the European Union’s fundamental philosophy or perhaps these principles themselves should be reconsidered and reinterpreted in the context of the massive Middle Eastern and African immigration and the constant, if not increasing threat of Islamic terrorism.

40|$|The {{idea of a}} {{political}} union, {{as well as an}} economic union of Europe, beyond free <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons,</b> goods and services, has always been included in the ideals of the building of Europe. However, its de jure formalization only occurs on November 1, 1993, when the Treaty of Maastricht is in force and a new political and strategic actor is in place: the European Union (EU). Since then, literature has "defined" the European Union in order to clearly establish what this UPO - Unidentified Political Object (an expression by Jacques Delors in the 1990 s) - is or what it can be. One of the ideas which has been a focus of discussion is that of "legislative actor" (Manners, 2001; 2002), which claims that the European Union has progressed towards normativity, both internally as well as externally, to its close neighbors and its relations {{with the rest of the}} world. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on Europe's quality or condition to impose rules. We will begin by systematizing a series of achievements which, according to Manners, lead to the triangle democracy, Human Rights and good governance in the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon on December 13, 2007 and its entering in full force on December 1, 2009. However, this paper does not disregard the fact that the concept "legislative actor" has been (re) worked and perfected by its author and other scholars due to criticism and empirical studies and has thus been altered, enhanced and argued against. Therefore, some concepts will be studied whose arguments will allow us to question the internal and external dimension of the actor European Union. We will also explore the symbolic power of the Union in the development of tools and capacity to be acknowledged as an actor able to face current threats and challenges but whose profile may not be different from other actors in international relations. Finally, we will discuss the impact of the EU having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012 on the (re) defining of rules, values and principles and on the present financial crisis in the future of the "economic giant but {{a political}} dwarf"...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{day after}} the 2015 Belgian National Day (21 July), a {{political}} and media controversy exploded. A MR (Mouvement réformateur – Wallon party) party’s deputy declared on his public social media page {{that it was a}} shame that the only person interviewed by a national TV channel during the celebration was a Belgian veiled woman of Moroccan origin. To quote his words: “Ah, the ONLY person interviewed by the Radio Television Belge Francophone (RTBF), a veiled women that says nice things about Belgium! Yeah, we live in a marvellous country, but not politically correct! As if during the Congo national day, Congolese TV would interview a White man, and only him! But in Congo this will never happen! […]”. Then, he declared “this way the RTBF wants to confine us within a sort of communitarian regime!” Public reactions for and against these statements have quickly run on social media as well as the newspapers. This event is one among several others in the country. For instance, in 2010 - 2011, some deputies submitted a proposal to restraint family reunification arguing that “most of these family reunifications are solicited by Belgian citizens, born in Belgium from immigrant parents, or having acquired Belgian nationality” and declaring openly that this measure aimed to stop intra communitarian marriages as they perceive that intra-family marriages are conducive to migration among Moroccans. Do not old legacies matter?Since the 1960 s, Morocco has been the main workforce supplier for Belgium (convention of 1964). Nowadays, Moroccans are the most ancient migrant community. In 2012, they reached a total of 429500 and 49 % of this demographic group had acquired the Belgian nationality. The population of Belgians of Moroccan origin represent 13 % of the whole population in Brussels. Besides, Moroccans are the most significant group of non-EU entrepreneurs (8 % out of the total). Overall, Moroccan immigration to Belgium was mainly driven by the pursuit of more prosperous economic opportunities. However, unlike in other countries, such as France and Spain, there was no colonial ties whatsoever: Moroccan immigration flourished, in the beginning, upon a consent from both sides Belgium which solicited manual workers and Morocco that was willing to offer its national workforce:Indeed, the case of Moroccan immigration to France and Spain, as aforementioned, was at its inception dictated by colonialism, and thus, was asymmetrical in many respects. Morocco was a French and Spanish protectorate from 1912 until 1956. Unfortunately, there are still colonial residuals at stake since Morocco and Spain are still disputing the cities of Ceuta and Melilla - as well as other small pieces of land - which are under Spanish control nowadays. How to probe into the new dynamics of EU-Morocco relations with regards to migration?Within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, established since 1995, the North African Kingdom enjoys an advanced position in the agreements with the European Union. As Morocco acquired the advanced status in 2004, we have witnessed a blooming economic exchange but not equal fluidity in the mobility of people on both sided of the Mediterranean not even after the implementation of the Global Approach to migration in 2005 and the agreement of mobility facilitation in 2013. It {{is interesting to note that}} Morocco has become the gatekeeper of migrants towards Europe. EU seeks actively to influence Moroccan migration policy in a way that suits European interests: This is best illustrated in the on-going discussions on Readmission Agreements. It seems that these agreements are the price to be paid by Morocco to obtain a “quota” of legal migrants to Europe at the detriment of a “real” mobility and free <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> In a way, the policy if implemented would simply be a translation of the logic “you get more according to what you give”. A diachronic approach to migration, does it offer clues to untangle the problem?The paper explores Moroccan “postcolonial and economic preferential” old and new ties and European migration management, analysing them through the voices of migrants and cross-national couples. The discourse of several institutional and para-institutional actors (ex. politicians, bureaucrats, civil society militants, social workers) will be integrated to offer a detailed and articulate contextual frame of analysis. Combining two analytical approaches, namely, “recognition” and sentiment of “belonging” in relation to the implementation of “politics of belonging”, the paper questions if and how both colonial domination and economic hegemony have been substituted by migration management. It seems, in fact, that behind the façade of enhancing international collaborations and protecting internal public security, migration policies highlight the broader question of the selection of who fits and has to be included among quasi-citizens and, perhaps, future citizens, affecting directly the Moroccan population (invited to settle) settled in Europe...|$|E
