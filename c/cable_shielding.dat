50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>shielding</b> may be {{required}} in order to improve a Cat 6 cable's performance in high electromagnetic interference (EMI) environments. This shielding reduces the corrupting effect of EMI on the cable's data. Shielding is typically maintained from one cable end to the other using a drain wire that runs through the cable alongside the twisted pairs. The shield's electrical connection to the chassis on each end is made through the jacks. The requirement for ground connections at both cable ends creates the possibility that a ground loop may result if one of the networked chassis is at different instantaneous electrical potential with respect to its mate. This undesirable situation may compel currents to flow between chassis through the network cable shield, and these currents may in turn induce detrimental noise in the signal being carried by the cable.|$|E

The counterpart is the introduction of new constraints such as the electromagnetic vulnerability where the equipment functioning can be disturbed by electromagnetic effect. The perturbation can happen in various conditions: (1) Inside an electrical harness between power supply wire and command wire; (2) Between electrical harnesses; (3) Or because of external sources (electrical equipment, engines, Wi-Fi etc.) or natural ones like lightening. This concerns machine design, robotic assembly lines, devices for commercial buildings and public facilities, embedded systems (aircraft, trains, boats, tramways, drones), and in general, all automatic devices and electrical systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} empirical {{results of}} cable noise reduction techniques {{as demonstrated in}} a TEM cell operating with radiated fields from 2 - 200 MHz. It is {{the first part of}} a two-paper series. This first paper discusses cable types and shield connections. In the second paper, the effects of load and source resistances and chassis connections are examined. For each topic, well established theories are compared to data from a real-world physical system. Finally, recommendations for minimizing cable susceptibility (and thus cable emissions) are presented. There are numerous papers and textbooks that present theoretical analyses of cable noise reduction techniques. However, empirical data is often targeted to low frequencies (e. g. 100 MHz). Additionally, a comprehensive study showing the relative effects of various noise reduction techniques is needed. These include the use of dedicated return wires, twisted wiring, <b>cable</b> <b>shielding,</b> shield connections, changing load or source impedances, and implementing load- or source-to-chassis isolation. We have created an experimental setup that emulates a real-world electrical system, while still allowing us to independently vary a host of parameters. The goal of the experiment was to determine the relative effectiveness of various noise reduction techniques when the cable is in the presence of radiated emissions from 2 MHz to 200 MHz. The electronic system (Fig. 1) consisted of two Hammond shielded electrical enclosures, one containing the source resistance, and the other containing the load resistance. The boxes were mounted on a large aluminium plate acting as the chassis. Cables connecting the two boxes measured 81 cm in length and were attached to the boxes using standard D 38999 military-style connectors. The test setup is shown in Fig. 2.

40|$|Spectral Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) allows obtaining {{images of}} the complex {{electrical}} conductivity for a broad frequency range (mHz to kHz). It has recently received increased interest {{in the field of}} near-surface geophysics and hydrogeophysics because of the relationships between complex electrical properties and hydrogeological and biogeochemical properties and processes observed in the laboratory with Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP). However, these laboratory results have also indicated that a high phase accuracy is required for surface and borehole EIT measurements because many soils and sediments are only weakly polarizable and show phase angles between 1 and 20 mrad. In the case of borehole EIT measurements, long cables and electrode chains (> 10 meters) are typically used, which leads to undesired inductive coupling between the electric loops for current injection and potential measurement and capacitive coupling between the electrically conductive <b>cable</b> <b>shielding</b> and the soil. Depending on the electrical properties of the subsurface and the measured transfer impedances, both coupling effects can cause large phase errors that have typically limited the frequency bandwidth of field EIT measurement to the mHz to Hz range. The aim of this study is i) to develop correction procedures for these coupling effects to extend the applicability of EIT to the kHz range and ii) to validate these corrections using controlled laboratory measurements and field measurements. In order to do so, the inductive coupling effect was modeled using electronic circuit models and the capacitive coupling effect was modeled by integrating discrete capacitances in the electrical forward model describing the EIT measurement process. The correction methods were successfully verified with measurements under controlled conditions in a water-filled rain barrel, where a high phase accuracy of 2 mrad in the frequency range up to 10 kHz was achieved. In a field demonstration using a 10 m borehole EIT chain with 8 electrodes with 1 m electrode separation, the corrections were also applied within a 1 D inversion of the borehole EIT measurements.
