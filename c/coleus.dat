500|$|Eliza Ridgely [...] John's {{wife and}} the subject of Thomas Sully's famous portrait, Lady with a Harp, {{purchased}} many artworks and furnishings for the mansion. She was a noted horticulturist and had successively larger and more elaborate gardens cultivated on the grounds, with a large variety of flowers and shrubs grown in the estate's greenhouses and tended by some of the 60slaves purchased by John Carnan Ridgely. By the mid-19th century, the Hampton estate had one of the most extensive collections of citrus trees in the U.S., along with various exotic trees and plants gathered by Eliza Ridgely during her frequent travels to Europe and the Orient. In the warm months, the potted citrus plants were brought outside and arranged around the terraced gardens, then taken into the heated orangery during the winter. She had one section of the garden planted with colorful red, yellow, pink, and maroon <b>coleus</b> from Asia. In 1859, [...] Hampton's fame for lavish style was such that {{the author of a book}} on landscaping wrote, [...] "It has been truly said of Hampton that it expresses more grandeur than any other place in America".|$|E

40|$|Pogonomyrmex <b>colei</b> is a workerless inquiline ant {{known only}} from nests of P. rugosus, its closest relative. Ten of 776 (1. 3 %) host nests were parasitized {{at a site}} in central Arizona, while none of 1499 {{potential}} host colonies were parasitized at two other locales. Colonies of P. <b>colei</b> are perennial, and host alate females in 9 of 10 colonies demonstrates that host queens survive parasitism. Three of 10 colonies died over 19 colony years of observation, while only 1 of 601 colonies became newly parasitized. Mating occurs in morning for up to 2 - 3 days following summer and fall rains and in afternoon during cool fall days. Mating is intranidal just outside the nest entrance, with males returning to the natal nest. Male P. <b>colei</b> may be flightless because their wing area is reduced compared to host males. Females fly from the nest and locate potential host colonies by following trunk trails. Workers are the largest barrier to nest establishment, as they removed over 90 % of P. <b>colei</b> females placed in trunk trails or that entered host nests. Males and females of P. <b>colei</b> and P. anergismus, the only other congeneric inquiline species, are diminutive compared to their hosts, with females 30 % lighter than host workers. Fat content is lower and water content is higher in P. <b>colei</b> and P. anergismus females than in their hosts...|$|R

40|$|The Sahelian Eco-Farm (SEF) is an {{integrated}} agriculture production system that provides simultaneous {{solutions to the}} main constraints of Africa’s rain-fed agriculture. These are: soil erosion, low soil fertility, low water use efficiency, droughts, insufficient supply of animal feed, low income, and inefficient distribution of the labor force. The SEF is an alley cropping system in which trees and/or shrubs are intercropped with annual crops. The first SEF model under development is composed of Acacia <b>colei</b> trees, domesticated Ziziphus mauritiana called Pomme du Sahel (PDS) and three annual crops (millet, cowpeas and Roselle). Soil erosion by water is prevented by the construction of earth bunds combined with micro-catchments every thirty meters down the slope. PDS trees are planted inside each micro-catchment. Erosion by wind is prevented by the wind breaking effect of the Acacia <b>colei</b> trees and by mulch produced from the Acacia branches and phyllodes. Acacia <b>colei</b> trees {{play a major role}} in soil fertility enhancement. The trees are pruned once a year and their branches are spread over the field adding organic matter to the soil. Tree roots add organic matter and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Soil fertility is also enhanced by crop rotation...|$|R
