5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, <b>California</b> <b>gull,</b> eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E

50|$|It is {{estimated}} that the population on Gunnison Island (about 10,000) constitutes about 10-20% of the entire American white pelican population; there are also about 15,000 <b>California</b> <b>gulls</b> that nest on the island.|$|R
25|$|Occasionally, these {{pelicans}} may nest in colonies on isolated islands, {{which is}} believed to significantly {{reduce the likelihood of}} mammalian predation. Red foxes and coyotes readily predate colonies that they can access, the later being the only known species to hunt adult pelicans (which are too large for most bird predators to subdue). Several gulls have been known to predate pelican eggs and nestlings (including herring, ring-billed and <b>California</b> <b>gull),</b> as well as common ravens. Young pelicans may be hunted by great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles, and golden eagles. The pelicans react to mammalian threats differently from avian threats. Though fairly approachable while feeding, the pelicans may temporarily abandon their nests if a human or other large mammal closely approaches the colony. If the threat is another bird, however, the pelicans do not abandon the nest and may fight off the interloper by jabbing at them with their considerable bills.|$|E
500|$|While the {{definition}} of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend {{their lives on the}} ocean, many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea. Most strikingly, many species breed tens, hundreds or even thousands of miles inland. Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed; for example, the snow petrel, the nests of which have been found [...] inland on the Antarctic mainland, are unlikely to find anything to eat around their breeding sites. The marbled murrelet nests inland in old growth forest, seeking huge conifers with large branches to nest on. Other species, such as the <b>California</b> <b>gull,</b> nest and feed inland on lakes, and then move to the coasts in the winter. Some cormorant, pelican, gull and tern species have individuals that never visit the sea at all, spending their lives on lakes, rivers, swamps and, in the case of some of the gulls, cities and agricultural land. In these cases it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors. Some seabirds, principally those that nest in tundra, as skuas and phalaropes do, will migrate over land as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —We {{investigated}} colony {{size and}} diet composition of piscivorous waterbirds (gulls, terns, and cormorants) nesting {{on the lower}} Columbia River from the mouth (river km 0) {{to the head of}} McNary Pool (river km 553) in 1997 and 1998. The study was prompted by concern that avian predation might constitute a significant source of mortality to juvenile salmonids Oncor-hynchus spp. during out-migration. The diet of <b>California</b> <b>gulls</b> Larus californicus and ring-billed gulls L. delawarensis nesting in colonies above The Dalles Dam (river km 308) included few fish and very few juvenile salmonids. The sole exception was a small colony of <b>California</b> <b>gulls</b> in which salmonids accounted for 15 % (by mass) of the diet. Juvenile salmonids were, however, {{an important component of the}} diet of colonial waterbirds nesting in the Columbia River estuary. On Rice Island (river km 34), salmonids accounted for 74 % (by mass) of the diet of Caspian terns Sterna caspia, 46 % for double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus, and 11 % for glaucous-winged 2 western gulls L. glaucescens 3 L. occidentalis. Juvenile salmonids were especially prevalent in the diets of colonial waterbirds on Rice Island during April and May. By comparison, juvenile salmonids were significantly less prevalent in the diet of cormorants and gulls nesting lower in the estuary on East Sand Island (river km 8), presumably due to th...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Parental {{effort was}} studied among known-aged <b>California</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus californicus) with a brood size of two. Results {{supported}} three of Triver's predic-tions from parent-offspring conflict theory. First, {{the amount of}} time parents withheld food from offspring increased with increasing offspring age. Second, older parents were less likely than younger parents to withhold food from offspring throughout the period of parental care. Third, older parents had a longer period of paren-tal care compared to younger parents. Adult survival to future breeding seasons was inversely related to dura-tion of parental care. Older parents, in association with their greater levels of parental effort, had a lower surviv-al rate compared to that of younger parents...|$|R

40|$|Salt {{evaporation}} ponds {{have played}} an important role as habitat for migratory waterbirds across the world, however, efforts to restore and manage these habitats to maximize their conservation value has proven to be challenging. For example, salinity reduction has been a goal for restoring and managing former salt evaporation ponds to support waterbirds in the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. Here, we describe a case study of unexpected consequences of a low-dissolved oxygen (DO) event on trophic interactions in a salt pond system following management actions to reduce salinity concentrations. We document the ramifications of an anoxic event in water quality including salinity, DO, and temperature, and in the response of the biota including prey fish biomass, numerical response by <b>California</b> <b>Gulls</b> (Larus californicus), and chick survival of Forster's Tern (Sterna forsteri). Management actions intended to protect receiving waters resulted in decreased DO concentrations that collapsed to zero for ≥ 4 consecutive days, resulting in an extensive fish kill. DO depletion likely resulted from an algal bloom that arose following transition of the pond system from high to low salinity as respiration and decomposition outpaced photosynthetic production. We measured a ≥ 6 -fold increase in biomass of fish dropped on the levee by foraging avian predators compared with weeks prior to and following the low-DO event. <b>California</b> <b>Gulls</b> rapidly responded to the availability of aerobically-stressed and vulnerable fish and increased in abundance by two orders of magnitude. Mark-recapture analysis of 254 Forster's Tern chicks indicated that their survival declined substantially following the increase in gull abundance. Thus, management actions to reduce salinity concentrations resulted in cascading effects in trophic interactions that serves as a cautionary tale illustrating the importance of understanding the interaction of water quality and trophic structure when managing restoration of salt ponds...|$|R
