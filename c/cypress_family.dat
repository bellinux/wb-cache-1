2500|$|Sequoia sempervirens [...] is {{the sole}} living species of the genus Sequoia in the <b>cypress</b> <b>family</b> Cupressaceae (formerly treated in Taxodiaceae).

50|$|The forests {{around the}} lakes were {{dominated}} by conifers including members of the podocarp (Podocarpites), pine, araucaria (Araucarites), and <b>cypress</b> <b>families.</b> There were also ginkgos, czekanowskialeans, bennettitaleans, ephedra (Ephedrites), horsetails (Equisetites), ferns, and mosses. The leaves and needles of the trees show adaptations to a dry season, {{but some of the}} ferns and mosses are types that grow in very wet habitats. It is possible that the latter avoided dry conditions by growing very close to bodies of water. Archaefructus has been described as the earliest known flowering plant (Angiosperm), and it is reconstructed as a water plant.|$|R

40|$|The {{state of}} Washington has ongoing nitrate {{contamination}} {{problems in the}} mid-Colombia Basin and estuarine ecosystems, such as the Hood Canal. Forest Service {{researchers have found that}} Eastern juniper wood fibers show promise in contaminant removal from water and became more effective after prior use at acid mine sites. The {{purpose of this study was}} to select tree species from the Northwest region and determine portions of these trees (wood, bark) that might make effective filters for nitrate removal from water. Six species of trees in the Cedar and Bald <b>Cypress</b> <b>families</b> were selected. Samples of heartwood, sapwood and bark were obtained. The wood samples were pretreated with a weak acid solution (pH 3) and distilled water (control). The following data were recorded: liquid absorbed during pretreatment, tannin leaching, tissue density and sorption of nitrate from solution. Samples that proved most effective at nitrate removal were also evaluated for re-release of sorbed nitrate back into water. Nitrate removal from water solution was most effective with incense cedar bark (22 % removal/water pre-treatment, 28 % removal/acid pre-treatment) and Port-Orford cedar bark (33 % removal/water pre-treatment, 30 % removal/acid pre-treatment) ...|$|R

50|$|Cedar oil, {{also known}} as cedarwood oil, is an {{essential}} oil derived from various types of conifers, most in the pine or <b>cypress</b> botanical <b>families.</b> It is produced from the foliage, and sometimes the wood, roots, and stumps which have been left after cutting of trees for timber extraction. It has many uses in medicine, art, industry and perfumery, and while the characteristics of oils derived from various species may themselves vary, all have some degree of bactericidal and pesticidal effects.|$|R
50|$|Although termed cedar or cedarwood oils, {{the most}} {{important}} oils are produced from distilling wood {{of a number of}} different junipers and <b>cypresses</b> (of the <b>family</b> Cupressaceae), rather than true cedars (of the family Pinaceae).

50|$|In the past, Kisii (Gusii) was {{a heavily}} forested area, with old {{indigenous}} broadleaf rainforest trees and other flora. It {{was part of}} the old Congo Basin forests. The only remnant of this old forest in Kenya is the Kakamega Forest, which is the westernmost tip of the Equatorial rainforest. The two ancient forest areas were linked through Nandi and Kericho, before the Nandi and Kericho areas were cleared for tea farming and settlement. Now most of the tree life in Kisii (Gusii) consists of members of 4 tree families, all of them introduced from outside the continent. The most common trees in Kisii are the Eucalyptus spp. family (blue gum/eucalyptus), Grevillea robusta and Black Wattle (Acacia mearnsii). All these three species are native to Australia. Finally, there is the Cupressus spp. <b>family</b> (<b>cypress)</b> native to South America. Other plant life forms are cultivated tea, bananas, maize, coffee and napier grass, with very little remaining of indigenous biodiversity.|$|R

5000|$|E1 Music {{was formed}} in January 1987 as [...] "Koch Records" [...] {{to serve as the}} North American {{umbrella}} for Koch Entertainment. They would sign many country, classical, and rock acts including Ringo Starr, Joan Baez, Chris Brubeck, Bob James, and an exclusive distribution with Suge Knight's embattled Death Row Records.
