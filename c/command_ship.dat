5|$|Even {{before her}} launch, there was {{considerable}} discussion of Tritons role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine's extended use. These included configuration {{to serve as a}} <b>command</b> <b>ship</b> (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced sonar scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine (SSGN), or a minelaying submarine. However, {{with the exception of the}} <b>command</b> <b>ship</b> option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.|$|E
5|$|Between 1761 and 1790, 14-15 turumas were built, {{including}} Amphion, {{a modified}} version used by King Gustav III as both a pleasure craft and <b>command</b> <b>ship.</b> The turuma was among the heaviest in the arsenal of the archipelago fleet {{and a number of}} them served in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. It had three masts, two decks and was equipped with 16–22 pairs of oars along with a crew of about 220–260. Its length was 35–39m, width 9m and the draft 3,3m. The armament consisted of 24–28 heavy guns with up to 24 swivel guns for close-quarter combat.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the earlier}} scout cruisers, the Boadicea class was {{designed}} to provide destroyer flotillas with a <b>command</b> <b>ship,</b> theoretically offering the ability to scout ahead {{of the group and}} locate targets for the smaller ships to attack. They were enlarged and more powerfully armed versions of the earlier ships, fitted with steam turbines. Curiously, they were no faster than the older ships and equally unsuccessful in their intended role as they lacked the speed of the destroyers they were supposed to escort.|$|E
50|$|Senyavin and Zhdanov were {{converted}} to <b>command</b> <b>ships</b> in 1971 by replacing the aft turrets with extra accommodation and electronics. These two <b>command</b> <b>ships</b> were fitted with a helicopter deck and hangar and a SA-N-4 Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) system. Senyavin had four twin 30 mm guns installed atop the SA-N-4 missile system.|$|R

5|$|On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard Iowa. Clark {{observed}} Iowa {{in action}} as her guns shelled the Wonsan {{area for a}} third time, accounting {{for the destruction of}} a major enemy ammunition dump. On 25 September, Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a feint to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships' big guns. During the operation, Iowa provided anti-aircraft support to , an amphibious force <b>command</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Kaiser Wilhelm II and her sisters were brought back into active duty as coastal defense ships in the V Battle Squadron. Her age, coupled with shortages of ship crews, led to her withdrawal from this role in February 1915, after which she served as a <b>command</b> <b>ship</b> for the High Seas Fleet, based in Wilhelmshaven. Following {{the end of the}} war in November 1918, Kaiser Wilhelm II was stricken from the navy list and sold for scrap in the early 1920s. Her bow ornament is preserved at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March, {{the ship}} arrived back in Libau, where {{she began her}} duties as Schultz's <b>command</b> <b>ship.</b> During this period, her crew was reduced {{to the point that}} she was only capable of {{providing}} harbor defense. In June, the naval command further reduced the number of ships operating in the Baltic, and Schultz, whose role had been taken over by the commander of the VI Scouting Group, left Braunschweig on 3 June. The ship left Libau for Kiel on 1 August, arriving there two days later. On 24 August, her crew was reduced further. She was thereafter used as a training ship for naval recruits, until 20 August 1917, when she was decommissioned and used as a barracks ship {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918. In this role, the ship supported the III Submarine Flotilla.|$|E
50|$|Amphibious <b>command</b> <b>ships</b> (LCC) of the United States Navy are large, {{special purpose}} ships, {{originally}} designed to command large amphibious invasions. However, as amphibious invasions have become less likely, they are now used as general <b>command</b> <b>ships,</b> and serve as floating headquarters for two, forward deployed, numbered Fleet commands. Currently, they are assigned to the 6th and 7th fleets as flagships.|$|R

5|$|The final {{episode of}} the game sees Aldaris and the Protoss {{government}} branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player (later hinted to be Artanis) initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while {{on a mission to}} arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead. A Protoss civil war erupts, pitting Tassadar, Zeratul, and their allies against the Protoss establishment. The dark templar prove their worth when they use their energies to slay two more of the Zerg cerebrates on Aiur, and the Conclave reconciles with them. Aided by Raynor's forces—who sided with Tassadar back on Char—the Protoss break through the Overmind's weakened defenses and destroy the Overmind's outer shell, but take heavy casualties in the process. Tassadar channels his own psionic energies in combination with those of the dark templar through the hull of his <b>command</b> <b>ship</b> and crashes it into the Overmind, sacrificing himself in order to destroy it.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{regarded}} in the German Navy as excellent sea boats {{with an easy}} roll; the ships rolled up to 30° with a period of 10seconds. They maneuvered easily; at hard rudder the ships lost up to 60percent speed and heeled over 9°. However, they suffered from severe vibration, particularly at the stern, at high speeds. They also had very wet bows, even in moderate seas. The ships had a crew of 33 officers and 650 enlisted men. However, when serving as a squadron flagship, the crew was augmented by an additional 13 officers and 66 enlisted men. While acting as a second <b>command</b> <b>ship,</b> 9 officers and 44 enlisted men {{were added to the}} standard crew. Wittelsbach and her sisters carried a number of smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
25|$|She {{was built}} to patrol Norwegian {{territorial}} waters and act as a rescue ship for sea travelers. Throughout her life she served in numerous roles; as a royal yacht (1892-1905, 1905-1908), <b>command</b> <b>ship</b> (1905), offshore patrol vessel and rescue ship (1892-1940), headquarters and depot ship (1940-1943), accommodation ship (1945-1946) and civilian cargo ship (1946-1947).|$|E

50|$|As of 1905, {{ships of}} the United States Navy were by law divided into classes called rates. Vessels {{of the first}} rate had a {{displacement}} tonnage in excess of 8000 tons; second rate, from 4000 to 8000 tons; third rate, from 1000 to 4000 tons; and fourth rate, of less than 1000 tons. Converted merchant vessels that were armed and equipped as cruisers were of the second rate if over 6000 tons, and of the third rate if over 1000 and less than 6000 tons. Auxiliary vessels such as colliers, supply vessels, repair ships, etc., if over 4000 tons, were of the third rate. Auxiliary vessels of less than 4000 tons—except tugs, sailing ships, and receiving ships which were not rated—were of the fourth rate. Torpedo-boat destroyers, torpedo boats, and similar vessels were not rated. Captains <b>commanded</b> <b>ships</b> of the first rate; captains or commanders <b>commanded</b> <b>ships</b> of the second rate; commanders or lieutenant-commanders <b>commanded</b> <b>ships</b> of the third rate; lieutenant-commanders or lieutenants <b>commanded</b> <b>ships</b> of the fourth rate. Lieutenant-commanders, lieutenants, ensigns, or warrant officers might command unrated vessels, {{depending on the size}} of the vessel.|$|R

25|$|She is {{also one}} of two Treasury-class (out of seven total) Coast Guard cutters still afloat. Serving her country for 50 years, the Taney saw action in both theaters of combat in World War II, serving as <b>command</b> <b>ship</b> at the Battle of Okinawa, and as part of fleet escort in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. She also served in the Vietnam War in Operation Market Time. Taney patrolled the seas working in drug interdiction and {{fisheries}} protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} again requisitioned on 23 August 1940 {{for a tour}} of Africa before {{travelling}} to Bombay. During the following two years, Britannic served India via Cape Town. The capacity of the ship increased from 3,000 to 5,000 troops. In 1943, the ship served as the <b>command</b> <b>ship</b> of a convoy to land troops in Algiers. Subsequently, between November 1943 and May 1944, the ship made eight North Atlantic crossings, carrying 20,000 American soldiers. It then transported troops to Italy and the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|Suicide {{air attacks}} by the Japanese {{continued}} throughout June 1945, although most were intercepted by combat air patrol (CAP) fighters and downed {{before they could}} reach their targets. Such raids took place on 18 out of 30 days that month. On 25 June 1945, at 01:20, a float seaplane passed near Taney, provoking return fire from the <b>command</b> <b>ship</b> and batteries ashore which combined to splash the intruder. During this month-long period, at least 288 enemy planes attacked the ships in Taneys vicinity, and at least 96 of these were destroyed.|$|E
