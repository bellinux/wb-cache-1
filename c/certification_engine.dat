40|$|FAA fan blade-out {{certification}} testing on turbofan engines occurs very late in an engine's development program {{and is very}} costly. It is of utmost importance to approach the FAA <b>Certification</b> <b>engine</b> test {{with a high degree}} of confidence that the containment structure will not only contain the high-energy debris, but that it will also withstand the cyclic loads that occur with engine spooldown and continued rotation as the non-running engine maintains a low rotor RPM due to forced airflow as the engine-out aircraft returns to an airport. Accurate rig testing is needed for predicting and understanding material behavior of the fan case structure during all phases of this fan blade-out event...|$|E
40|$|This study {{defines a}} family of {{advanced}} technology Stratified Charge Rotary Engines (SCRE) appropriate for the enablement {{of the development of}} a new generation of general aviation aircraft. High commonality, affordability, and environmental compatibility are considerations influencing the family composition and ratings. The SCRE family is comprised of three engines in the 70 Series (40 cu in. displacement per rotor), i. e. one, two, and four rotor and two engines in the 170 Series (105 cu in. displacement per rotor), i. e., two and four rotor. The two rotor engines are considered the primary engines in each series. A wide power range is considered covering 125 to 2500 HP through growth and compounding/dual pac considerations. Mission requirements, TBO, FAA <b>Certification,</b> <b>engine</b> development cycles, and costs are examined. Comparisons to current and projected reciprocating and turbine engine configurations in the 125 to 1000 HP class are provided. Market impact, estimated sales, and U.

40|$|Engine 0209, the <b>certification</b> <b>engine</b> {{for the new}} Phase 2 + Hot Gas Manifold (HGM), showed severe {{deterioration}} of the Main Combustion Chamber (MCC) liner during hot fire tests. One theory on {{the cause of the}} damage held that uneven local distribution of the fuel rich hot gas flow through the main injector assembly was producing regions of high oxidizer/fuel (O/F) ratio near the wall of the MCC liner. Airflow testing was proposed to measure the local hot gas flow rates through individual injector elements. The airflow tests were conducted using full scale, geometrically correct models of both the current Phase 2 and the new Phase 2 + HGMs. Different main injector flow shield configurations were tested for each HGM to ascertain their effect on the pressure levels and distribution of hot gas flow. Instrumentation located on the primary faceplate of the main injector measured hot gas flow through selected injector elements. These data were combined with information from the current space shuttle main engine (SSME) power balances to produce maps of pressure, hot gas flow rate, and O/F ratio near the main injector primary plate. The O/F distributions were compared for the different injector and HGM configurations...|$|E

40|$|Under {{this project}} SETECS {{performed}} research, created the design, {{and the initial}} prototype of three groups of security technologies: (a) middleware security platform, (b) Web services security, and (c) group security system. The results of the project indicate that {{the three types of}} security technologies can be used either individually or in combination, which enables effective and rapid deployment of a number of secure applications in open networking environments. The middleware security platform represents a set of object-oriented security components providing various functions to handle basic cryptography, X. 509 certificates, S/MIME and PKCS No. 7 encapsulation formats, secure communication protocols, and smart cards. The platform has been designed in the form of security engines, including a Registration Engine, <b>Certification</b> <b>Engine,</b> an Authorization Engine, and a Secure Group Applications Engine. By creating a middleware security platform consisting of multiple independent components the following advantages have been achieved - Object-oriented, Modularity, Simplified Development, and testing, Portability, and Simplified extensions. The middleware security platform has been fully designed and a preliminary Java-based prototype has been created for the Microsoft Windows operating system. The Web services security system, designed in the project, consists of technologies and applications that provide authentication (i. e., single sign), authorization, and federation of identities in an open networking environment. The system is based on OASIS SAML and XACML standards for secure Web services. Its topology comprises three major components: Domain Security Server (DSS) is the main building block of the system Secure Application Server (SAS) Secure Client In addition to the SAML and XACML engines, the authorization system consists of two sets of components An Authorization Administration System An Authorization Enforcement System Federation of identities in multi-domain scenarios is supported by a set of security engines that represent the core of the Federated Identities Management Server, which is also an extension of the Domain Security Server. The Federated Identity Management server allows users to federate their identities or terminate the federation between the service provider and the identity provider. At the service provider web site, the users are offered a list of identity providers to which they can choose to federate their identities. After users federate their identity, they can perform Single Sign-On protocol in an environment of federated domains. The group security system consists of a number of security technologies under a unified architecture, which supports creation of secure groups and execution of secure group transactions and applications in an open networking environment. The system is based on extensions of the GSAKMP standard for group key distribution and management. The Top layer is the Security Infrastructure with the Security Management and Administration System components and protocols that provide security functions common to all secure network applications The Middle layer is the Secure Group Protocols and Applications layer, consisting of the Policy and Group Key Distribution Server and Web-based (thin) Client. The Bottom layer is the supporting Middleware Security Platform, the cryptographic platform already described above. The group security system is designed to perform the functions necessary to create secure groups and enable secure group applications. Specifically, the system can manage group roles, create and disseminate a group security policy, perform authentication and authorization of users using PKI certificates and Web services security, generate group keys, and recover from compromises. In accordance with the GSAKMP standard, the group security system must perform all the required group life-cycle functions: group definition, group establishment, group maintenance, and group removal. The group security system has been designed to support four roles: The Security Domain Administrator is responsible for providing security functions defined in the top layer The Server Administrator. The central component of the group security system is the Policy and Group Key Distribution Server The Group Officer (GO) authorizes the creation of groups at a specific Policy and Group Key Distribution Server The Group Member (user) is any entity that participates in group transactions. Secure Group Applications The group security system has been designed to support four secure group applications: A Secure Instant Messaging: with the Secure Instant Messaging application A Secure Whiteboard A Secure Document Sharing A Secure Document Archiving: During the project, the group security system architecture was fully designed and preliminary prototyping was carried out for some of its components...|$|E

40|$|A clear {{need was}} {{established}} by the aero-engine manufacturers and the certifying authorities for a re-assessment of the published rules governing <b>engine</b> <b>certification</b> for large flocking birds.

40|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} from aircraft {{is a complex}} issue because of the limited possibility of measurements in flight conditions.

40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} {{dictate that}} the heavy duty automotive diesel engine will have t o comply with increasingly more stringent exhaust emission standards. Nowhere are these standards more stringent than the 199 - 94 USA requirements. Meeting these standards in production {{and during the}} engine's useful life, while maintaining or improving engine performance and fuel economy, is an extremely demanding technical challenge. This paper describes the technology that will be utilized on heavy duty diesel engines to meet the US 1994 stundard and examines how thefleet operator may be affected. 1 INTRODUCTlON Regulations aimed at limiting gaseous exhaust emis-sions from commercial vehicles were introduced in the United States several years ago. In 1988 standards aimed at limiting the emission rates of particulates from diesel-powered commercial vehicles were introduced. Continuing concerns over the environment led {{to the introduction of}} tighter standards for both particulates and nitrogen oxides (NO,) for the 199 Os, as shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1 shows results for 1988 <b>certification</b> <b>engines</b> when tested over the US Federal Transient Procedure (FTP), demonstrating that the best engines in each class can satisfy the 1988 - 90 requirements but fail to comply with the 1991 - 94 standards. It {{should also be noted that}} the primary method of achieving low NO, by injection timing retard results in increased particulate. Addi-tionally, the US requirement that the standards must be met in production for the useful life of the engine dic-tates that the engine manufacturer must achieve the lower engineering targets shown in Fig. 1. At present the US 1991 - 94 standards are the most stringent worldwide. Currently, standards similar to US 1991 are being proposed and discussed in Europe (1) for 0. 7...|$|R
