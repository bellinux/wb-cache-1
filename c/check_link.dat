40|$|In this paper, several {{problems}} in associating hyperlinks to {{text and the}} diverse possibilities {{to overcome these problems}} are discussed. At the current stage, an important aspect is knowledge retrieval of hypertexts. Our advanced studies on hyperlink management focus mainly on a concept similar to Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems as a possibility for the automatic generation of links for hypertexts in addition to traditional textual based methods. A detailed discussion of the basic ideas of CBR and an evaluation of its usefulness follows. Finally, methods to evaluate the quality of the proposals are described. 1 Introduction The need for high quality hypertexts is increasing {{as a result of the}} growing of the World Wide Web (WWW). One of the most difficult tasks when writing hypertexts is the finding of appropriate links. Modern web authoring systems should not only provide possibilities to <b>check</b> <b>link</b> consistencies and help to manage any changes that might occur, but shoul [...] ...|$|E

5000|$|Discovering broken links {{might be}} done {{manually}} or automatically. Automated methods, including plug-ins for WordPress, Drupal and other content management system {{can be used to}} detect the presence of broken URLs. An alternative is using a specific broken link checker like Xenu's Link Sleuth. However, if a URL returns an HTTP 200 (OK) response, it may be accessible, but the contents of the page could have changed and may no longer be relevant. So manual <b>checking</b> <b>links</b> seems to be a must. Some web servers also return a soft 404, reporting to computers that the link works even though it doesn't. Bar-Yossef et al. (2004) [...] developed a heuristic for automatically discovering soft 404s.|$|R

In such a case we can use bandwisth measurement or estimation tools run between the end points to find the size and possibly the location of the bottleneck.
