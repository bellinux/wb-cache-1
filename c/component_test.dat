40|$|Component-based {{systems are}} {{becoming}} prevalent {{at a rapid}} pace. With the growing demand for components, there arises a need for adequate <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> procedures. The <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> process at user end suffers with the unavailability of source code, which precludes extrapolating standard testing approaches. Effective Object Oriented (OO) <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> techniques require structural and behavioral information of component as a necessary test support element. We propose an OO component-testing framework that relies on utilization of metadata captured in discrete descriptors. A component developer generates a Component-Descriptor (CD) concomitantly with the component that provides behavioral analyses. The user chooses a component by browsing CDs and preparing Component Requirements Descriptor (CRD). Using analyses of component behavior in CD and of minimal requirements in CRD, third-party tester (TPT) conducts user directed <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> and reports bugs to the provider {{in the form of}} Component-Test-Specification-Descriptor (CTSD). The provider eliminates those bugs and returns the modified component and CD to TPT. This continues until TPT is satisfied with the reliability of component services. TPT then packages CTSD with the component for the user. The component provider, user, and TPT, each has the responsibility for descriptors unique to their perspective. The proposed framework attempts to eliminate the dilemma of unavailable information and supports objectivity in <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> process...|$|R

40|$|This {{portfolio}} comprises two projects {{linked by}} {{the theme of}} software <b>component</b> <b>testing,</b> which is also {{often referred to as}} module or unit testing. One project covers its standardisation, while the other considers the analysis and evaluation of the application of selected testing techniques to an existing avionics system. The evaluation is based on empirical data obtained from fault reports relating to the avionics system. The standardisation project is based {{on the development of the}} BC BSI Software <b>Component</b> <b>Testing</b> Standard and the BCS/BSI Glossary of terms used in software testing, which are both included in the portfolio. The papers included for this project consider both those issues concerned with the adopted development process and the resolution of technical matters concerning the definition of the testing techniques and their associated measures. The test effectiveness project documents a retrospective analysis of an operational avionics system to determine the relative effectiveness of several software <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> techniques. The methodology differs from that used in other test effectiveness experiments in that it considers every possible set of inputs that are required to satisfy a testing technique rather than arbitrarily chosen values from within this set. The three papers present the experimental methodology used, intermediate results from a failure analysis of the studied system, and the test effectiveness results for ten testing techniques, definitions for which were taken from the BCS BSI Software <b>Component</b> <b>Testing</b> Standard. The creation of the two standards has filled a gap in both the national and international software testing standards arenas. Their production required an in-depth knowledge of software <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> techniques, the identification and use of a development process, and the negotiation of the standardisation process at a national level. The knowledge gained during this process has been disseminated by the author in the papers included as part of this portfolio. The investigation of test effectiveness has introduced a new methodology for determining the test effectiveness of software <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> techniques by means of a retrospective analysis and so provided a new set of data that can be added to the body of empirical data on software <b>component</b> <b>testing</b> effectiveness...|$|R
