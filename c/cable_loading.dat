40|$|The {{breakdown}} of insulation in cables while in service can cause considerable damage to {{equipment and the}} accessories {{to which they are}} connected. PD in cables arises due to the overstressing of cable insulation resulting from electric field enhancement caused by imperfections in cable core and screen. The nature and magnitude of PD activity depends upon the type of defect, aging, environmental factors, applied voltage and <b>cable</b> <b>loading.</b> Reduction in system voltage can potentially reduce PD, which will correspondingly extend the service life of the cable. Currently, industry voltage statutory requirements permit ± 6 % tolerance setting on nominal voltage on distribution networks. This ± 6 % voltage reduction on may have little or an adverse effect on PD magnitude depending on the nature of defect present in the cable. Hence there is a clear requirement to pre-determine the PD inception voltage in cables through laboratory experiments to understand the significance of voltage reduction. This means to verify the effect of voltage reduction on extinguishing or minimizing PD activity in cables. In this paper, range of voltages at which PD incepts termed as partial discharge inception voltage(PDIV) is measured using a test cell containing different types of electrode configuration having different spacing. PDIV measured using the test cell is verified by conducting partial discharge testing in paper insulated lead covered (PILC) and cross-linked poly ethylene(XLPE) cables.

Nevertheless, it is still of a great importance that the existing assets continue to operate reliably and their health is maintained. Moreover, the failures of distribution cables are extremely disruptive, costly to repair and have a serious impact on customer confidence.

This research investigates a method of developing a prognostic capability for evaluation of the health and long term performance of aging distribution cable circuits. Developing such prognostic models will significantly improve the prognosis accuracy, allowing the targeting of maintenance and reduction of in-service failures. Real-time measurements taken close to underground cables can update the models giving a more accurate prognostic tool.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the <b>cable</b> <b>loading</b> support capacity of red alder, Alnus rubra Bong., Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr, and western hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg., tail trees. Capacity is measured in terms of combined stress resulting from compression and bending, rather than the traditional methods of buckling or compressive stress alone. Results from field tests to determine modLili of elasticity, base stiffness values, and functions for moment of inertia are presented to provide strength properties for capacity analysis. A two dimensional model with one guyline is used to calculate the combined stress at points along the trees. In addition to strength properties of each species, model inputs include front and rear skyline angles, rigging I height, and the following guyline parameters: angle, metallic area, unit weight, modulus of elasticity, and lower end pretension. The control calculations for each species are made with the guyline angle equal to a rear skyline angle of 45 degrees. A 3 / 411 guyline with 100 pounds of pretension is used, and the skyline and guyline are placed at a height of 30 feet, Given these conditions, it was found that a skyline angle of about 15 degr. ees below horizontal maximized combined stress per pound of skyline tension in alder and spruce. An angle of about 10 degrees below horizontal was found to maximize stress in hemlock per pound of skyline tension. Figures are presented which show that skyline tension to a given level of stress may be a function of tree diameter, if other variables are held constant. Values for maximum allowable combined stress for each species are set by adjusting published average values downward. Calculations for 16 inch (diameter inside bark) trees indicate that hemlock is able to withstand the greatest skyline tension of the three species before reaching its allowable stress, with alder and spruce following in descending order. A comparison is made between a 14 inch DIB Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, and a 16 inch DIB alder, spruce and hemlock.

This electrical cable can weigh up to 10 kg per metre and is often lifted in restricted spaces in underground coal mines. Seven male subjects performed eight cable lifting and hanging tasks, while trunk kinematic data and trunk muscle electromyograms (EMGs) were obtained. The eight tasks were combinations of four postures (standing, stooping kneeling on one knee, or kneeling on both knees) and two levels of <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> (0 N or 100 N load added to the existing cable weight). An EMG-assisted model was used to calculate forces and moments acting on the lumbar spine. A two-way split-plot ANOVA showed that increased load (p< 0. 05) and changes in lifting posture (p< 0. 05) independently affected trunk muscle recruitment and spinal loading. The increase in <b>cable</b> <b>load</b> resulted in higher EMG activity of all trunk muscles and increased axial and lateral bending moments on the spine (p < 0. 05). Changes in posture caused more selective adjustments in muscle recruitment and affected the sagittal plane moment (p < 0. 05). Despite the more selective nature of trunk EMG changes due to posture, the magnitude of changes in spinal loading was often quite dramatic. However, average compression values exceeded 3400 N for all cable lifting tasks...|$|R

40|$|Our {{energy supply}} chain is {{changing}} rapidly, {{driven by a}} societal push towards clean and renewable resources. However, these resources are often uncontrollable (e. g., wind and sun) and are increasingly being exploited on smaller scales (e. g., rooftop photovoltaic). This poses a reliability challenge for the operation of our energy supply chain, specifically for our electricity grid. In this grid, supply and demand must be matched at all times, since storage is virtually on-existent. Traditionally, the supply is controlled centrally and follows the load, where the latter {{is assumed to be}} uncontrollable. With the growing number of uncontrollable distributed renewable resources in the system, the centralized paradigm is quickly becoming infeasible. To combat the decreasing flexibility due to loss of controllability on the generation side, often the exploitation of flexibility on the consumption side is considered. This flexibility comes from devices that can adapt their energy use, e. g., smart white goods or electric vehicles (EVs) with smart chargers. Such resources of flexibility on the consumer side are called distributed energy resources (DERs). With the expected growth of the number of DERs in future energy systems, their coordination offers potential to operate the grid more efficiently and allows the integration of more (uncontrollable) energy from renewables into the grid. Traditional steering approaches in the electricity grid do not scale well with the number of DERs and were not designed for the diversity (i. e., heterogeneity) of the envisioned DERs. Thus, new energy management approaches are required. In this thesis we introduce and study such an energy management approach called profile steering. The profile steering approach decentralizes (part of) the computational effort to ensure scalability, making it a decentralized energy management approach. Profile steering relies on predictions and scheduling,meaning that it predicts the future system state and requirements and schedules the use of flexibility of the available DERs to best meet the system goals. We focus on the distribution grid, as {{a large part of the}} DERs are expected to be present in this part of the grid. The profile steering approach influences the energy use of DERs using generic steering signals. We show that the approach can incorporate a broad class of such steering signals. This implies that the approach is flexible enough to be applied in many different situations. Furthermore, we exploit the hierarchical structure of the electricity grid to set up a corresponding hierarchical control structure. This structure allows us to incorporate local limitations into our approach, for instance maximum <b>cable</b> <b>loading</b> of the considered grid section. As the developed approach is decentralized, we distribute (part of) the required computation to a local level, i. e., to a controller inside a home or embedded in a device. Such controllers often do not have large computational power. To ensure the computations can be feasibly executed on these local controllers with low computational power the resulting distributed scheduling problems have to be researched. We show that many of these problems fall into the class of resource allocation problems, which are well studied in literature. Several of these problems are extensions of known problems. Therefore, we apply some of the techniques found in literature and extend them to include common cases (current and futuristic) in residential energy settings. In particular we consider buffering devices. Such buffering devices can utilize an internal buffer to decouple (part of) the time they require energy for their operation and the time this energy is taken from the grid. The first type of such a device we consider is the electric vehicle (EV). Scheduling the energy use of the EV is similar to a classical resource allocation problem if it can charge at any rate between zero and a given maximum. To solve this case we apply techniques from literature. However, if the EV can only be charged at a finite number of rates, the problem becomes NP-hard, even if we are only interested in obtaining feasible solutions. To circumvent this issue we consider an adaptation of the problem for which we develop an efficient solution method giving results that are nearly identical to feasible solutions to the original problem. In a follow up chapter we extend the results found for the EV to devices that also allow discharging, e. g., residential stationary batteries and EVs with vehicle-to-grid capabilities. Furthermore, we study heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems as a special case. In these systems the energy losses depend on the energy present in the storage (in this case the house itself). Next to developing a method to control such a device, we also study the effect of prediction errors on our approach and show that we can effectively deal with them in the case of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems using an approach inspired by model predictive control. We use simulations to show the validity of profile steering using several cases. We show that profile steering can also be used to achieve near optimal results when minimizing the degradation of a power transformer. This indicates that the benefits that can be expected from using our approach are not limited to energy markets, but also include increased lifetime of grid assets resulting in reduced investment costs in these assets. Summarizing, the introduced profile steering decentralized energy management approach promises to be a valuable approach in the future (smart) electricity grid where it can unlock the potential of many residential DERs and assist in an effective and efficient energy transition...|$|E
