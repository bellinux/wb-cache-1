5000|$|Some federal, state, {{local and}} {{education}} government employees pay no Social Security but {{have their own}} retirement, disability systems that nearly always pay much better retirement and disability benefits than Social Security. These plans typically requires vesting—working for 5-10 years for the same employer before becoming eligible for retirement. But their retirement typically only depends on {{the average of the}} best 3-10 years salaries times some retirement factor (typically 0.875%-3.0%) times years employed. This retirement benefit can be a [...] "reasonably good" [...] (75-85% of salary) retirement at close to the monthly salary they were last employed at. For example, if a person joined the University of California retirement system at age 25 and worked for 35 years they could receive 87.5% (2.5% × 35) of their average highest three year salary with full medical coverage at age 60. Police and firemen who joined at 25 and worked for 30 years could receive 90% (3.0% × 30) of their average salary and full medical coverage at age 55. These retirements have cost of living adjustments (COLA) applied each year but are limited to a maximum average income of $350,000/year or less. Spousal survivor benefits are available at 100-67% of the primary benefits rate for 8.7% to 6.7% reduction in retirement benefits, respectively. UCRP retirement and disability plan benefits are funded by contributions from both members and the university (typically 5% of salary each) and by the compounded investment earnings of the accumulated totals. These contributions and earnings are held in a trust fund that is invested. The retirement benefits are much more generous than Social Security but are believed to be actuarially sound. The main difference between state and local government sponsored retirement systems and Social Security is that the state and local retirement systems use compounded investments that are usually heavily weighted in the stock market securities—which historically have returned more than 7.0%/year on average despite some years with losses. Short term federal government investments may be [...] "more" [...] secure but pay much lower average percentages. Nearly all other federal, state and local retirement systems work in a similar fashion with different benefit retirement ratios. Some plans are now combined with Social Security and are [...] "piggy backed" [...] on top of Social Security benefits. For example, the current Federal Employees Retirement System, which covers the vast majority of federal civil service employees hired after 1986, combines Social Security, a modest defined-benefit pension (1.1% per year of service) and the defined-contribution Thrift Savings Plan. The current Social Security formula used in calculating the benefit level (primary insurance amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone who worked in OASDI <b>covered</b> <b>employment</b> and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the role of the agricultural sector's output and trade on the economic growth and development of the State of Oregon. Economic base theory is applied in the analysis of Oregon's Gross State Product (GSP) between 1977 and 1991. The basic sector is defined to include the agricultural sector, the forest products sector, and all other manufacturing sectors. A static Local Quotient method is utilized to define Oregon's exporting sectors. Linear regression analyses are applied to measures of Oregon's exports, as well as the GSP of total output, based on the economic base theory. The results of the Location Quotient method using Oregon's <b>covered</b> <b>employment</b> data for the year 1991, indicate that the agricultural sector is a net exporting sector, a criteria for establishing base industry status. Regression analysis of Oregon's GSP, indicates that the aggregate manufacturing sector (SIC 20 - 3 9), is significant in explaining changes in GSP as well as changes in the GSP of all non-manufacturing industries. In contrast, the agricultural sector including manufactured food products (SIC 20), is found to be relatively insignificant in explaining variation in the State total GSP over the period 1977 - 1991. Foreign Direct investment is also found to be a significant variable in explaining variations in state GSP over this time. Conclusions remain guarded, however, due to relatively high collinearity among explanatory variables. Regression results to more directly measure economic growth based on first differences in GSP indicate that the aggregate manufacturing sector is again statistically significant in explaining variations in Oregon's non-basic industries GSP as well as the state total GSP. On the other hand, the agricultural sector is found to be statistically insignificant in explaining variations in the growth of Oregon's non-basic industries GSP, and the state total gross state product over the study's period of time 1977 - 1991. Data show that the agricultural sector constitutes the largest portion of Oregon's foreign exports and has significant power in explaining the state total foreign exports. However, comprehensive data is not available to establish total out-of-state exports. Results of regression analysis of Oregon's total <b>covered</b> <b>employment</b> show that the agricultural sector is significant in explaining variations in Oregon's total <b>covered</b> <b>employment,</b> while manufacturing industries exhibit relatively low significance and predictability in explaining Oregon's total <b>covered</b> <b>employment.</b> This apparent contradiction in findings of the GSP model are attributed to the fact that employment is not a good proxy for regional economic activity. A regression analysis of an alternative specification of employment data based on payroll indicates that the aggregate manufacturing sector is significant in explaining changes in Oregon's <b>covered</b> <b>employment</b> payroll. In this model specification, the agricultural sector's total covered payroll is found to be of only modest significance and exhibits substantially lower impact on Oregon's total covered payroll...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The BLS multifactor {{productivity}} series decomposes labor {{productivity growth}} into components {{associated with increased}} capital intensity of production and shifts in the skillcomposition {{of the work force}} attributable to changes in the level and distribution of human capital. The use of administrative record data on actual accumulated work experience as an indicator of workers ’ current productivity is a distinguishing features of this series. The current procedure relies on a one-time match of Social Security Administration (SSA) data to records from the March 1973 CPS to develop an experience proxy that is entered in a human capital wage equation. Since the parametric relationship between accumulated work experience and the demographic characteristics of the work force is unlikely to remain stable over time, the BLS has undertaken a long-run research project to update the work experience data at regular intervals. Two independent sources of information on accumulated work experience were examined: SSA administrative record data on quarters of <b>covered</b> <b>employment,</b> and data from the 1984 Survey o...|$|E
