Nevertheless, residual vibrations may still affect the instruments' performance, ranging from narrow high frequency vibration peaks to wide low frequency windshake-type perturbations.

The adaptive self-tuning controller {{is based on a}} dual action, obviously on control input, and also on reference signal. The proposed adaptive fuzzy controller includes a mechanism to adapt one of the tuning parameters. Some comparative studies are performed regarding the performance of a conventional fuzzy PI controller and the designed adaptive fuzzy PI controller (all with application to excitation control of a synchronous generator functioning in active power load regime). Also, to design the adaptive self-tuning controller two situations were considered concern the used parameters estimator: in the first case using a recursive least square error parameters estimator and, in the second, using a parameters estimator based on Givens orthogonal transformation.

40|$|The {{design of}} an {{efficient}} control strategy will usually require a suitable model representing both the steady-state and dynamic {{performance of the}} process. In most practical problems {{the complexity of the}} process usually dictates a complicated theoretical model which is not readily compatible with the need to design simple regulators. However, the majority of high order and stochastic effects that characterise the operation of a large dynamic complex system can frequently be represented in terms of simple dynamic models which can be readily used to design suitable <b>controllers.</b> <b>Identification</b> can often be used to estimate such models from input/output data records and gives further knowledge and insight of the process and its environment.

40|$|In direct {{data-driven}} controller tuning, {{a mathematical}} model of the plant is not needed, as the control law is directly derived from experimental data.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{investigation}} of a small-scale stand-alone power system, based on both experimental work and computer simulations. The power system in this study uses solar energy as energy input, lead-acid batteries as short-term energy storage, and hydrogen as long-term energy storage. The main focus is upon operation {{and control of the}} hydrogen subsystem, as a robust controller is needed in order to prevent excessive use of the components in this subsystem. The laboratory power system comprises of: Hydrogen subsystem (PEM electrolyser, metal hydride, and PEM fuel cell), a lead-acid battery, programmable power supply for emulation of PV arrays, wind turbines, and controlled characterisation of the individual system components, and a programmable electronic load. The intention was to build the laboratory power system as simple and energy efficient as possible. The components were connected directly in parallel on a common 48 V DC bus bar, no power electronics were applied between the components. Furthermore, the metal hydride and the fuel cell were air-cooled, avoiding auxiliaries required for water- cooling. The electrolyser, however, needed water-cooling. But with the electrolyser delivering hydrogen at 16 bars to a low pressure metal hydride, no use of compressor was required. On the other hand, metal hydrides needs purified hydrogen gas, > 99. 999 %, in order to maintain its capacity as specified by the manufacturer. The actual work in this thesis is divided in three main parts: 1. Design, construction, and operation of a laboratory hydrogen power system 2. Establishment of a computer model of the laboratory hydrogen power system, which interpolates and extrapolates its outputs based on experimental data collected from the laboratory system 3. Establishment of control algorithms for high-level energy management of the laboratory hydrogen power system based on the developed computer model. It is a goal to make the implementation and maintenance of these control algorithms as simple as possible. Furthermore, the control algorithms must enable efficient usage of the system components and secure energy supply to the end user The results of this thesis are divided in two main parts: The first part of the main results relates to the proposal and development of two types of control algorithms for high-level energy management, which will be denoted as the Control Matrix and the Fuzzy controller in the thesis. These control algorithms are suggested as opposed to the more traditional battery five-step charge <b>controller.</b> <b>Identification</b> of important system parameters and choosing proper settings for control parameters must be implemented into the control algorithms in order to finalise a complete control strategy. It will be shown that the electrolyser annual runtime decreases while the electrolyser annual hydrogen production remains the same by using the proposed control strategies, thus running the electrolyser more efficient. Furthermore, with a reduction in the total number of electrolyser start-ups, a more stable system operation is achieved. The second part of the main results relates to the operational experience of the small-scale laboratory hydrogen power system. Due to the amount of power required by the local control system integrated into the fuel cell and the electrolyser, the energy efficiency of the fuel cell and the electrolyser is lower at partial loads. Thus, with the additional energy needed for hydrogen purification, the round-trip efficiency of the hydrogen subsystem is found to be rather low (< 30 %), when the fuel cell and the electrolyser runs at low partial loads. However, it is encouraging that the hydrogen subsystem can reach 35 – 40 % when the fuel cell and the electrolyser are allowed to run at nominal power levels, in addition to optimal arrangement of the hydrogen purification unit. These energy efficiencies are higher than efficiencies achieved with diesel-fuelled generators. Besides, stand-alone power systems often resides in remote areas where transportation of diesel is costly, thus local production of the fuel by means of electrolyser and excess renewable energy can be profitable. Regarding the difficulty of measuring the true amount of hydrogen present in the metal hydride, and because this system parameter is important in the control strategy, a pressurised vessel is recommended instead of the air-cooled metal hydride. Furthermore, it is recommended to use DC/DC converters in the hydrogen power system in order to ensure power quality within specifications and robust operation. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{adaptative}} control algorithm, {{which is designed}} by adding a parametric identification method to a non-linear <b>controller.</b> The <b>identification</b> module is built upon the Hopfield neural network, resulting in an unconventional network with time-varying weights and biases. The convergence of the estimations of the parameters of a dynamical system was proved in previous work, {{as long as the}} system inputs can be freely manipulated to provide persistent excitation. Henceforth the behaviour of the closed-loop system, when the inputs result from the controller equations, is here analyzed in order to assess both the tracking performance of the full adaptive <b>controller</b> and the <b>identification</b> ability of the neural estimator. The algorithm is applied to an idealized robotic system with two joints, whose positions and velocities are required to follow, as closely as possible, a prescribed reference trajectory. The simulation results show a satisfactory control performance, since the demanded trajectory is almost accurately followed. The estimated values also converge to the correct parameters, as long as the controller provides sufficiently rich signals to the system. The results are similar to a conventional least-squares adaptive controller, with a much lower computational cost. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech...|$|R

40|$|In non-iterative {{data-driven}} controller tuning, {{a set of}} measured input/output data of {{the plant}} is used directly to identify the optimal controller that minimizes some control criterion.

Several solutions that deal with the effect of measurement noise in this specific identification problem have been proposed in literature. The consistency and statistical efficiency of these methods are discussed in this paper and the performance of the different methods is compared.
