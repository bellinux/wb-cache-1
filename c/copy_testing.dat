40|$|Background/Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} subjects with incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using brief cognitive tests. Methods: A total of 147 MCI patients were followed for 4 - 6 years and the incidence of AD was 11. 6 %/year. At baseline, the cube <b>copying</b> <b>test,</b> clock drawing test, MMSE and measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid(1 - 42) (Abeta(42)) were performed. Results: The cube <b>copying</b> <b>test,</b> but not the clock drawing test, could predict AD among MCI patients with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 64 (p < 0. 01). The relative risk for future AD was increased in MCI subjects with impaired cube <b>copying</b> <b>test</b> (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio = 1. 8, p < 0. 05) and the incidence of AD was 18. 2 % in this subgroup. Combining the cube <b>copying</b> <b>test</b> with either rCBF or CSF Abeta(42) had additive effects on the risk assessment for future development of AD. MCI patients achieving high scores on both MMSE and cube <b>copying</b> <b>test</b> had a very low risk of developing AD (incidence of AD = 1. 6 %). Conclusion: In conclusion, combinations of the cube <b>copying</b> <b>test</b> with MMSE, rCBF and CSF Abeta(42) measurements can identify subgroups of MCI subjects with either substantially reduced or increased risk for future development of AD...|$|R

40|$|We tested how {{consumers}} recognize, {{understand and}} value on-package information about food production methods that {{may contribute to}} a more sustainable agriculture. Nine <b>copy</b> <b>tests</b> were formed, each containing {{one out of three}} products and one out of three panels of information. The products were (1) fillet of chicken, (2) semi-skimmed milk and (3) fillet of salmon. The panels of information were (a) a certified organic logo and details about the animal welfare standards of organic products, (b) just the logo, or (c) a statement in which the product was attributed to the world market. About 371 customers of a supermarket in the city of Amsterdam filled in a questionnaire, which included a subset of three <b>copy</b> <b>tests.</b> The results showed that many consumers did not realize that the organic logo already covers all the standards. They were inclined to underestimate the distinctive advantage of the logo; products with logo and details got higher ratings of positive attributes but were also considered more expensive. As a consequence, the detailed information panels enabled consumers to choose more in agreement with their personal values but the net impacts on purchase intentions were small. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a novel {{quantitative}} method for examining the cube <b>copying</b> <b>test.</b> The analysis has been only through qualitative observation for the test. Therefore we applied a quantitative method to analyze cube <b>copying</b> <b>test</b> results. Figures were digitized and their symmetry was studied to determine correlation coefficients (CCs). This study included 19 elderly subjects (68 - 92 years) who complained of memory disturbance or being afraid of dementia, and 9 younger subjects (21 - 60 years) who visited our hospital with minor head trauma or dizziness. Six CCs were examined between the sample and drawn figures, between the drawn figure and 180 °-rotated drawn figure, between the left half and right half of the drawn figure, between the upper half and lower half of the drawn figure, between a quadrant and an opposite 180 °-rotated quadrant of the drawn figure. All CCs were significantly low for the elderly group. The elderly group also showed mild deterioration in the Hasegawa 2 ̆ 7 s Dementia Scale (21. 1 / 30) and CT findings with cortical and/or ventricular dilatation and lacunae. No neurological deficit was noted for the younger group. Our quantitative method may be useful for evaluating not only constructional apraxia but also dementia and mild cognitive impairment...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{dementia}} with Lewy bodies (DLB) may display a different cognitive pattern from Alzheimer's disease (AD) with more severe impairment performing visuospatial/visuoconstructive tasks. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether the analysis of the MMSE pentagon copy could be a useful diagnostic screening tool in prodromal DLB. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) were followed over 3 -years until a diagnosis of DLB (MCI-DLB: n = 30) and AD (MCI-AD: n = 23) were made according to standard criteria. At the first assessment patients underwent a thorough cognitive assessment including the Qualitative Scoring MMSE Pentagon Test (QSPT), the NPI, the UPDRS as well as questionnaires to determine fluctuations and sleep disorders. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects who were unable to determine the correct number of angles in the pentagon <b>copy</b> <b>test</b> was 45. 1 % of MCI-DLB and 8. 3 % of MCI-AD patients (sensitivity 41. 1 %; specificity 91 %). Attentive/executive functions and visual-spatial abilities were worse in the MCI-DLB group, while episodic memory impairment was greater in MCI-AD. Subtle extrapyramidal signs (63 %) and RBD symptoms (56 %) were the most frequent clinical features supporting the diagnosis of MCI-DLB. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that a poor performance in determining the number of angles when performing the pentagon <b>copying</b> <b>test,</b> together with the presence of subtle extrapyramidal signs and symptoms of RBD may serve as a predictive tool for early DLB...|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, after DAR was {{determined}} to be a poor predictor of sales, the research industry began to depend on a measure of persuasion as an accurate predictor of sales. This shift was led, in part, by researcher Horace Schwerin who pointed out, “the obvious truth is that a claim can be well remembered but completely unimportant to the prospective buyer of the product - the solution the marketer offers is addressed to the wrong need” (Honomichl). As with DAR, it was Procter and Gamble’s acceptance of the ARS Persuasion measure (also known as brand preference) that made it an industry standard.

40|$|In US v. Philip Morris USA Inc. (2006), {{six major}} tobacco {{companies}} {{were ordered to}} provide funding for an extremely large corrective advertising and marketing campaign. The Court ruled that consumers may have been misled and deceived about the (1) health effects of smoking, (2) addictiveness of smoking, (3) lack of health benefit from low tar/light cigarettes, (4) companies’ manipulation of nicotine delivery and cigarette design, and (5) health effects of secondhand smoke. Using print advertising <b>copy</b> <b>test</b> procedures, this research focused on the potential effectiveness of test ads submitted to the Court in impacting these target beliefs. In an initial pilot study, reliable multi-item measures {{for each of these}} belief themes were developed and assessed. These multi-item belief measures were then employed in the subsequent main study, in which the effects of two versions of a print advertisement (submitted to the Court in this litigation) were tested using a mixed experimental design.

Results suggested that the beliefs about light/low tar cigarettes may be substantially affected by such a campaign. The addition to the ad copy of graphic visuals, such as those currently used on cigarette packages in Canada and Australia, had mixed results overall. Contributions of the research include the development of reliable multi-item measures for critical smoking-related beliefs, as well as implications of the <b>copy</b> <b>test</b> findings for this specific case and corrective advertising, tobacco counter advertising, and public policy, in general...|$|R
