40|$|The {{principle}} of using hollow spiral winding is not novel, but the study {{on this topic}} is far from complete. In this paper, how hollow the central region of the coreless printed spiral winding (CPSW) inductor should be for a given footprint area {{in order to achieve}} the maximal quality factor Q max and to maintain high inductance value is explored. A hollow factor based on the ratio of the inner hollow radius and the outer winding radius τ = R in/R out, is proposed as for optimization and quantifying how hollow a spiral winding is. The relationship between τ and Q max, which depends on the operating frequency and the dimensional parameters of CPSW inductor, is established. For a specific operating frequency, it is discovered that if the <b>conductor</b> <b>width</b> is comparable with the skin depth, or the conductors are placed relatively far away from each others, the hollow design of the CPSW inductor has little improvement on Q but reduces the inductance. If the <b>conductor</b> <b>width</b> is much larger than the skin depth and the conductors are closely placed, the hollow spiral design is recommended.

To quantify this effect, we first compute the resonator current distribution, from which the ?-dependent parameters (such as kinetic inductance) are calculated. Optimum responsivity for phase measurement is achieved by using the thinnest film with the narrowest center <b>conductor</b> <b>width</b> at the lowest possible temperature.

The impurity disorder is modeled by the 2 D δ-barriers with the randomly chosen positions and signs. The electron transmission through the wires is calculated by the scattering-matrix method, and the Landauer conductance is obtained. We calculate the persistent current in the rings threaded by magnetic flux: We incorporate into the scattering-matrix method the flux-dependent cyclic boundary conditions and we introduce a trick allowing to study the persistent currents in rings of almost realistic size. We mainly focus on the numerical results for L much larger than the electron mean-free path, when the transport is diffusive. If the grain boundaries are weakly reflecting, the systems with grain boundaries show the same (mean) conductance and the same (typical) persistent current as the systems with impurities, and the results also agree with the single-particle theories treating disorder as a white-noise-like potential. If the grain boundaries are strongly reflecting, the typical persistent currents can be about three times larger than the results of the white-noise-based theory, thus resembling the experimental results of Jariwala et al.
