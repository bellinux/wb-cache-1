40|$|The {{implementation}} of increasingly stringent Clean Air Act Regulations by the coal utility industry {{has resulted in}} an increase in the concentration of unburned carbon in coal combustion fly ash. In 1999, around 6 million tons of unburned carbon were disposed in the US, due to the present lack of efficient routes for its utilization. However, unburned carbon is a potential precursor for the production of adsorbent carbons, since it has gone through a devolatilization process while in the combustor, and therefore, only requires to be activated. Accordingly, this report evaluates and compares several routes for the production of activated carbons from unburned carbon, including physical activation with steam or CO{sub 2 }, and chemical activation using KOH pretreatment. During the present reporting period (June 30, 2000 [...] June 29, 2001), Task 1 ''Procurement and characterization of CCBPs'' was concluded, including samples from pulverized utility boilers, a utility <b>cyclone</b> <b>unit</b> equipped with a beneficiation technology, a suspension-fired research boiler, and a class C fly ash. The characterization studies showed that the samples collected have significantly different carbon contents, as determined by the ASTM C 114 procedure, with the sample from the <b>cyclone</b> <b>unit</b> containing the highest carbon content (LOI of {approx} 80 %), since this unit has been retrofitted with a technology to separate the unburned carbon from the fly ash. The porosity of the samples assembled was characterized by N{sub 2 } adsorption isotherms at 77 K. The surface areas of the class F fly ash samples from pulverized coal combustors are between 30 - 40 m{sup 2 }/g, while the samples from the suspension-fired research boiler had surface area around 115 m{sup 2 }/g. As expected, the surface areas of the class C ash is much higher than that of the class F ashes, with values up to 390 m{sup 2 }/g. In addition, during the current reporting period, also Task 2 ''Development of activated carbons'' and Task 3 ''Characterization of activated carbons'' were continued...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} role of coal as {{a source}} of energy in the 21 st century will demand environmental and cost-effective strategies for the use of coal combustion by-products (CCBPs), mainly fly ash containing unburned carbon. However, the carbonaceous residue in fly ash, unburned carbon (UC), is a potential precursor for the production of adsorbent carbons, since it has gone through a devolatilization process while in the combustor, and therefore, only requires to be activated. Accordingly, this research program focuses on the development of activated carbons from the unburned carbon present in fly ash. During the present reporting period (June 30, 1999 [...] June 29, 2000), Task 1 ''Procurement and characterization of CCBPs'' was initiated and samples from various combustion systems were collected. The suite assembled thus far includes samples from pulverized utility boilers with low-NOx burners and Selective Non Catalytic Reduction system, and also from an utility <b>cyclone</b> <b>unit.</b> The characterization studies showed that the sample from the <b>cyclone</b> <b>unit</b> contained the highest carbon content (LOI of {approx} 80 %), since this unit has been retrofitted with a technology to separate the unburned carbon from the fly ash. In contrast, the sample from the unit retrofitted with a Selective Non Catalytic Reduction system showed the lowest carbon content with LOI values around 2 - 4 %. The samples from the utility boilers with low-NOx burners were collected from the hot-side hoppers and present carbon contents {approx} 50 %. The BET (N{sub 2 } 77 K) surface areas of the samples investigated were between 30 - 40 m{sup 2 }/g and the pore volume is mainly due to mesopores. In addition, during this reporting period, also Task 2 ''Development of activated carbons'' and Task 3 ''Characterization of activated carbons'' were initiated. The investigations showed that after steam activation at 850 C, the unburned carbon samples generated activated carbons with microporous structure and surface areas up to 443 m{sup 2 }/g. The samples activated with steam present generally higher surface areas than those using CO{sub 2 } or KOH pretreatment, probably due to the faster reaction rate of steam. The activation process could tailor the inherent mesoporosity of these materials into the desired porosity for a specific application, since the mesophore volume accounted for {approx} 66 % of the total pore volume for the parent samples, while after steam activation the micropore volume accounted for over 60 % of the total...|$|E
40|$|A {{study to}} {{establish}} the total particulate emission factor (EFs) from boiler of a palm oil mill plant equipped with a multi-cyclones particulate arrestor was performed and reported in this research. The mill employs a 500 kg steam/ h capacity of water-tube typed boiler and processes 60 tonnes per hour of fresh fruit bunch (FFB). The samples of the dust were collected iso-kinetically using the USEPA method 17 sampling train through a sampling port located after a multidust <b>cyclone</b> <b>unit.</b> Results showed that the total dust generated from the boiler is 62. 15 g/s and the calculated total dust emission factor based on the boiler capacity is 7. 46 g/kg. Poor combustion process is among the main factor {{that leads to the}} high particulate emission. EFs data allows for early prediction of pollutants emission, which subsequently will assist in determining the degree of control and the air pollution control system needed, besides evaluating the effectiveness of the existing pollution control strategies. The establishment of EFs for palm oil mills will definitely bring benefits for a better management of health and safety risks in palm oil mills, now and in the future...|$|E

As part of the company's Phase II CAAA compliance plan, IP proceeded with similar online systems at its Baldwin, Wood River, Havana, and Vermilion stations for all 10 of its coal-fired units. These Operator Advisory Systems utilize the Ultramax Method ™ and Dynamic Optimization, known as ULTRAMAXÆ. Of particular interest are the installations on Baldwin Units 1 and 2, which are 575 MW B&W <b>cyclone</b> <b>units.</b> Throughout the power generation industry, there has been great concern {{about how to deal with}} high NOx levels and meet EPA regulations while avoiding excessive capital costs. Based on previous applications of ULTRAMAX to <b>cyclone</b> <b>units,</b> a successful control strategy was employed for optimization of the Baldwin cyclones. These empirical model structures were then integrated with Baldwin’s Distributed Control System (DCS), a Westinghouse WDPF interfaced with an Oil Systems Plant Information System (PI), to provide continuous online optimization. The online optimization system meets IP’s objectives of NOx reduction and concurrent improvement in boiler efficiency. IP benefits by achieving compliance with emission regulations while securing cost savings and a rapid return on investment. Implementing ULTRAMAX as an integrated online solution on the Baldwin cyclone boilers, as well as Unit 3, a 595 MW ABB-CE tangential unit, assists the operator when conditions change, simplifies data collection and enables daily updating of boiler models.

A cold-side electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubber are used at MRY and MoSES for controlling particulate and sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) emissions, respectively. Several approaches for significantly and cost-effectively oxidizing elemental mercury (Hg{sup 0 }) in lignite combustion flue gases, followed by capture in an ESP and/or FGD scrubber were evaluated. The project team involved in performing {{the technical aspects}} of the project included Babcock & Wilcox, the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC), the Electric Power Research Institute, and URS Corporation.

In addition, powdered activated carbon (PAC) was injected upstream of the ESP at MRY Unit 2. The work involved establishing Hg concentrations and removal rates across existing ESP and FGD units, determining costs associated with a given Hg removal efficiency, quantifying the balance-of-plant impacts of the control technologies, and facilitating technology commercialization.

40|$|A four week {{testing program}} was {{completed}} during this project {{to assess the}} ability of the combination of deep staging, Rich Reagent Injection (RRI), and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to reduce NOx emissions below 0. 15 lb/MBtu in a cyclone fired boiler. The host site for the tests was AmerenUE's Sioux Unit 1, a 500 MW cyclone fired boiler located near St. Louis, MO. Reaction Engineering International (REI) led the project team including AmerenUE, FuelTech Inc., and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). This layered approach to NOx reduction is termed the Advanced Layered Technology Approach (ALTA). Installed RRI and SNCR port locations were guided by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based modeling conducted by REI. During the parametric testing, NOx emissions of 0. 12 lb/MBtu were achieved consistently from overfire air (OFA) -only baseline NOx emissions of 0. 25 lb/MBtu or less, when firing the typical 80 / 20 fuel blend of Powder River Basin (PRB) and Illinois No. 6 coals. From OFA-only baseline levels of 0. 20 lb/MBtu, NOx emissions of 0. 12 lb/MBtu were also achieved, but at significantly reduced urea flow rates. Under the deeply staged conditions that were tested, RRI performance was observed to degrade as higher blends of Illinois No. 6 were used. NOx emissions achieved with ALTA while firing a 60 / 40 blend were approximately 0. 15 lb/MBtu. NOx emissions while firing 100 % Illinois No. 6 were approximately 0. 165 lb/MBtu. Based on the performance results of these tests, economics analyses of the application of ALTA to a nominal 500 MW <b>cyclone</b> <b>unit</b> show that the levelized cost to achieve 0. 15 lb/MBtu is well below 75 % of the cost of a state of the art SCR...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effectiveness of engineering controls to reduce contaminant concentrations in a swine farrowing room during winter in the U. S. Midwest. Over two winters, changes in air quality were evaluated following installation of a 1700 m 3 h- 1 (1000 cfm) recirculating ventilation system to provide 5. 4 air exchanges per hour. This system incorporated one of two readily available dust control systems, one based on filtration {{and the other on}} cyclonic treatment. A second treatment evaluated reductions in carbon dioxide (CO 2) associated with replacement of standard, unvented gas-fired heaters with new vented heaters, installed between the two winter test periods. The concentrations of carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide were negligible in the test room. Although concentrations of ammonia increased over each winter test period, the increase was unrelated to increased air movement from the new recirculating ventilation system. The dust concentrations were significantly reduced by the ventilation system for both inhalable dust (23 % to 44 % with filtration, 33 % with cyclone) and respirable dust (32 % with filtration, 20 % with cyclone), significant (p 0. 024) for all except respirable dust using the cyclone (p = 0. 141). The filtration unit is recommended to improve livestock building air quality because it was more effective than the <b>cyclone</b> <b>unit</b> at reducing respirable dust. Carbon dioxide concentrations were significantly lower with vented heaters (mean = 1400 ppm, SD = 330 ppm) compared to unvented heaters (mean = 2480 ppm, SD = 160 ppm). A 940 ppm reduction in CO 2 was attributed {{to the use of the}} vented heater, after accounting for differences in outdoor temperatures and animal housing over both test periods. The benefits of readily available technology to significantly reduce concentrations of dust and CO 2 demonstrates useful control options to improve air quality in swine buildings.

40|$|The Wabash {{gasification}} facility, {{owned and}} operated by sgSolutions LLC, {{is one of the largest}} single train solid fuel gasification facilities in the world capable of transforming 2, 000 tons per day of petroleum coke or 2, 600 tons per day of bituminous coal into synthetic gas for electrical power generation. The Wabash plant utilizes Phillips 66 proprietary E-Gas (TM) Gasification Process to convert solid fuels such as petroleum coke or coal into synthetic gas that is fed to a combined cycle combustion turbine power generation facility. During plant startup in 1995, reliability issues were realized in the gas filtration portion of the gasification process. To address these issues, a slipstream test unit was constructed at the Wabash facility to test various filter designs, materials and process conditions for potential reliability improvement. The char filtration slipstream unit provided a way of testing new materials, maintenance procedures, and process changes without the risk of stopping commercial production in the facility. It also greatly reduced maintenance expenditures associated with full scale testing in the commercial plant. This char filtration slipstream unit was installed with assistance from the United States Department of Energy (built under DOE Contract No. DE-FC 26 - 97 FT 34158) and began initial testing in November of 1997. It has proven to be extremely beneficial in the advancement of the E-Gas (TM) char removal technology by accurately predicting filter behavior and potential failure mechanisms that would occur in the commercial process. After completing four (4) years of testing various filter types and configurations on numerous gasification feed stocks, a decision was made to investigate the economic and reliability effects of using a particulate removal gas cyclone upstream of the current gas filtration unit. A paper study had indicated that there was a real potential to lower both installed capital and operating costs by implementing a char cyclonefiltration hybrid unit in the E-Gas (TM) gasification process. These reductions would help to keep the E-Gas (TM) technology competitive among other coal-fired power generation technologies. The Wabash combined cyclone and gas filtration slipstream test program was developed to provide design information, equipment specification and process control parameters of a hybrid cyclone and candle filter particulate removal system in the E-Gas (TM) gasification process that would provide the optimum performance and reliability for future commercial use. The test program objectives were as follows: 1. Evaluate the use of various cyclone materials of construction; 2. Establish the optimal cyclone efficiency that provides stable long term gas filter operation; 3. Determine the particle size distribution of the char separated by both the cyclone and candle filters. This will provide insight into cyclone efficiency and potential future plant design; 4. Determine the optimum filter media size requirements for the cyclone-filtration hybrid unit; 5. Determine the appropriate char transfer rates for both the cyclone and filtration portions of the hybrid unit; 6. Develop operating procedures for the cyclone-filtration hybrid unit; and, 7. Compare the installed capital cost of a scaled-up commercial cyclone-filtration hybrid unit to the current gas filtration design without a <b>cyclone</b> <b>unit,</b> such as currently exists at the Wabash facility...|$|E
40|$|A NO{sub x} {{minimization}} {{strategy for}} coal-burning wall-fired and cyclone boilers was developed that included deep air staging, innovative oxygen use, reburning, and advanced combustion control enhancements. Computational fluid dynamics modeling {{was applied to}} refine and select the best arrangements. Pilot-scale tests were conducted by firing an eastern high-volatile bituminous Pittsburgh No. 8 coal at 5 million Btu/hr in a facility that was set up with two-level overfire air (OFA) ports. In the wall-fired mode, pulverized coal was burned in a geometrically scaled down version of the B and W DRB- 4 Z{reg_sign} low-NO{sub x} burner. At a fixed overall excess air level of 17 %, NO{sub x} emissions with single-level OFA ports were around 0. 32 lb/million Btu at 0. 80 burner stoichiometry. Two-level OFA operation lowered the NO{sub x} levels to 0. 25 lb/million Btu. Oxygen enrichment in the staged burner reduced the NO{sub x} values to 0. 21 lb/million Btu. Oxygen enrichment plus reburning and 2 -level OFA operation further curbed the NO{sub x} emissions to 0. 19 lb/million Btu or by 41 % from conventional air-staged operation with single-level OFA ports. In the cyclone firing arrangement, oxygen enrichment of the cyclone combustor enabled high-temperature and deeply staged operation while maintaining good slag tapping. Firing the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal in the optimum arrangement generated 112 ppmv NO{sub x} (0. 15 lb/million Btu) and 59 ppmv CO. The optimum emissions results represent 88 % NO{sub x} reduction from the uncontrolled operation. Levelized costs for additional NO{sub x} removal by various in-furnace control methods in reference wall-fired or cyclone-fired units already equipped with single-level OFA ports were estimated and compared with figures for SCR systems achieving 0. 1 lb NO{sub x}/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. Two-level OFA ports could offer the most economical approach for moderate NO{sub x} control, especially for smaller units.

40|$|Most efforts {{devoted to}} {{modification}} of the combustion process to reduce NOx formation in fossil fuel fired boilers and furnaces involve the use of air or fuel staging. Low NOx burners utilize aerodynamic staging through the burner design to separate {{the majority of the}} combustion air from the fuel within the primary combustion zone to create a locally fuel rich reducing zone. Overfire air (OFA) employs furnace level air staging to create a high temperature fuel-rich reducing zone. Both strategies are used heavily in state-of-the art low-NOx coal-firing systems to achieve cost-effective NOx reductions and the majority of coal-fired utility boilers are presently equipped with combustion modifications of this type. In particular, since 1996, the majority of existing cyclone-fired boilers have been retrofit with OFA systems which have been demonstrated to reduce full load NOx emissions from 1 - 2 lb/MBtu down to emissions as low as 0. 2 – 0. 3 lb/MBtu. The lowest NOx emissions have been attained in units with good air flow measurement and controls to accommodate deep levels of staging (e. g. 0. 8 - 0. 9 barrel stoichiometric ratio) without compromising unit operability. However, even with significant levels of furnace staging, well-controlled and designed OFA systems are not expected to lead to full load NOx emissions below a 0. 15 lb/MBtu limit in most <b>cyclone</b> fired <b>units,</b> regardless of coal type.

40|$|Dense medium <b>cyclone</b> (DMC) <b>units</b> {{have been}} {{extensively}} used to upgrade run-of-mine coal {{in the contemporary}} coal preparation industry. In the past decades, development of DMCs has been mostly based on empirical methods, however, this would not give rise to the much enhanced understanding of the fundamentals of DMC under diverse conditions, and the consequences often have limited applicability. Recently, mathematical modeling was used to improve the understanding of DMCs (Suasnabar and Fletcher, 1999; Brennan, 2003; Narasimha et al., 2006). Specially, Wang (2009) and Chu (2010) carried out systemically numerical studies on the multiphase flow of DMC by use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM). In this work, a statistic method, i. e., nonlinear curve fitting and multiple-regression procedure are repeated to analyse the CFD and CFD-DEM simulation data generated at the University of New South Wales, resulting {{in a set of}} empirical equations in which the performance of the DMC {{is a function of the}} geometrical, material and operational conditions. By use of the obtained equations, a robust and readily usable PC-based simulator of dense medium cyclone is developed to examine the performance of DMCs in a fast and easy way. The proposed computer model can investigate the effects of key variables related to the operational conditions, geometry and material properties on DMC flow and performance. In order to validate this computer model, comparisons of the effect of some key variables between the formulated empirical model and experimental results have been carried out. Qualitative agreements between predicted results with those measured are obtained in various aspects, such as the effect of some key variables on the performance of DMCs, and already established trends in literature. Moreover, it is shown that the developed computer model can quantitatively predict the operation of DMCs, and is superior to other empirical models reported in the literature in terms of simplicity, generality and accuracy. A comprehensive parametric study is carried out by use of the PC-based simulator, which explores the effects related to geometrical conditions, operational conditions and material properties on DMC flow and performance. The obtained relationship among the key variables could be used to facilitate engineering application and as a guide in the control, design and optimization of DMC units in coal preparation industry...|$|R
