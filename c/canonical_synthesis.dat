40|$|To make {{synthesized}} speech {{more natural}} and col-loquial the regularity of synthesized speech {{has to be}} overcome and spontaneous speech effects have to be in-tegrated into the synthesis process. In a first step to-wards spontaneous speech we introduced different dura-tion control methods in speech synthesis. In this paper we summarize the results of previous works (see for instance [1]) of changing the speaking rate indirectly by controlling the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion through different pronunciation variant selec-tion algorithms. The presented results of listening exper-iments show a significant improvement in the category colloquial impression. To evaluate {{the quality of the}} most outstanding vari-ant selection approach compared to the canonical synthe-sis (as the state-of-the-art system), we performed a new listening test on longer speech samples. The variant syn-thesis applying a pronunciation variant sequence model achieved a significant lower listening effort and a higher overall rate (MOS) compared to the <b>canonical</b> <b>synthesis.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|The co-translational {{incorporation}} of selenocysteine (Sec) requires that UGA {{be recognized as}} a sense rather than a nonsense codon. This is accomplished by the concerted action of a Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, SECIS binding protein 2, and a ternary complex of the Sec specific elongation factor, Sec-tRNASec, and GTP. The mechanism by which they alter the <b>canonical</b> protein <b>synthesis</b> reaction has been elusive.

40|$|We {{present and}} {{evaluate}} a novel switching mechanism called layered switching. Conceptually, the layered switching implements wormhole {{on top of}} virtual cut-through switching. To show the feasibility of layered switching, {{as well as to}} confirm its advantages, we conducted an RTL implementation study based on a <b>canonical</b> wormhole architecture. <b>Synthesis</b> results show that our strategy suggests negligible degradation in hardware speed (1 %) and area overhead (7 %). Simulation results demonstrate that it achieves higher throughput than wormhole alone while significantly reducing the buffer space required at network nodes when compared with virtual cut-through.

40|$|This paper formulates an {{elementary}} algorithm for resolution of singularities {{in a neighborhood}} of a singular point over a field of characteristic zero. The algorithm is composed of finite sequences of Newton polyhedra and monomial transformations and based on Weierstrass preparation theorem. This approach entails such new methods as <b>canonical</b> reduction and <b>synthesis</b> of monomial transformations as well as latency and revival of primary variables. The orders of primary variables serve as the decreasing singularity invariants for the algorithm albeit with some temporary increases. A finite partition of unity in a neighborhood of the singular point is constructed in an inductive way depending on the topological constraint imposed by Euler characteristic of the normal vector set of Newton polyhedron...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{current period}} of IT {{development}} {{is characterized by}} an explosive growth of diverse information representation languages. Applying integration and composition of heterogeneous information components it is required to develop the canonical information model serving for adequate expression of semantics of various information models used in the environment encompassing required heterogeneous components. Basic principles of the <b>canonical</b> model <b>synthesis</b> include fixing of its kernel, constructing the kernel extensions for each specific information model of the environment so that this extension together with the kernel could be refined by this information model, and forming the canonical model as a union of all such extensions. Previously these principles have been successfully applied to the synthesis of structural and object canonical models. This paper 1 applies this technique to synthesis of the process canonical model. The method proposed is based on interpretation of process model semantics in logics, and specifically, in the Abstract Machine Notation that made possible to construct provable refinements of process specifications. This method {{has been applied to}} the environment of process models defined by workflow patterns classified by W. M. P. van der Aalst. Thus the canonical process model synthesized possesses a property of completeness with respect to broad class of process models used in various Workflow Management Systems as well as the languages used for process composition of Web services. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} computation based circuit synthesis technique is presented for the Reed-Muller <b>canonical</b> form. The <b>synthesis</b> methodology {{is reduced to}} the problem of finding a solution to linear system of equations in the real-field. The mathematical formulation for this technique is developed and it is shown that a unique solution exists. A synthesis example is presented along with a discussion on implementation issues. 1 Introduction As the complexity of VLSI circuitry increases, testability concerns tend to grow proportionally. The well-known properties of the Reed-Muller canonical form make it an attractive candidate for testable circuit implementations [1]. Previously, the automated synthesis of Reed-Muller logic circuits was accomplished via symbolic Boolean algebra manipulations [2] [3], or the use of the Reed-Muller transforms [9] [10] [13]. In this paper, we present an approach similar to the Reed-Muller transform technique, however, we develop a more general mathematical framewo [...] ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe N-terminal nuclear export {{sequence}} (NES) of inhibitor {{of nuclear}} factor kappa B (NF-κB) alpha (IκBα) promotes NF-κB export from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, but the physiological role of this export regulation remains unknown. Here we report the derivation {{and analysis of}} genetically targeted mice harboring a germline mutation in IκBα NES. Mature B cells in the mutant mice displayed nuclear accumulation of inactive IκBα complexes containing a NF-κB family member, cRel, causing their spatial separation from the cytoplasmic IκB kinase. This resulted in severe reductions in constitutive and <b>canonical</b> NF-κB activities, <b>synthesis</b> of p 100 and RelB NF-κB members, noncanonical NF-κB activity, NF-κB target gene induction, and proliferation and survival responses in B cells. Consequently, mice displayed defective B cell maturation, antibody production, and formation of secondary lymphoid organs and tissues. Thus, IκBα nuclear export is essential to maintain constitutive, canonical, and noncanonical NF-κB activation potentials in mature B cells in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the exchange}} rate under a floating exchange rate regime for a small open economy with perfect capital mobility may appear like a managed float or even a firmer peg. We present a <b>canonical</b> new neo-classical <b>synthesis</b> open economy model where the central bank follows a strategy directed at maintaining price stability. It is shown that the behaviour {{of the exchange}} rate depends {{on the structure of}} the economy and {{on the nature of the}} relevant shocks. In the case of very open economies the exchange rate will look quasi-fixed in response to shocks stemming from the international capital markets. It is also shown that the joined endogeneity of the interest rate and the exchange rate has important implications for the empirical testing of uncovered interest rate parity.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} {{simplified}} realization {{problem of a}} special class of positive-real admittances similar to biquadratic functions but with an extra pole at the origin, which is widely used {{in the analysis of}} suspension systems. The results in this paper are motivated by passive mechanical control with the inerter. The concept of strictly lower complexity is first defined, whose indices in this paper are the total number of elements, the number of resistors (dampers), and the number of capacitors (inerters). We then derive a necessary and sufficient condition for this class of admittance to be realized by the networks that are of strictly lower complexity than the canonical realization by the Foster Preamble method. To solve this problem, it is shown that it suffices to consider the following: 1) networks with at most four elements, 2) irreducible five-element resistor-inductor (RL) networks, and 3) irreducible five-element resisitor-inductor-ca-pacitor (RLC) networks. Other cases are shown to be impossible. By finding their corresponding network configurations through a series of constraints and deriving the corresponding realizability conditions, the final condition can be obtained. Finally, the U-V plane and numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

40|$|International audienceDevelopment of the {{mammalian}} embryo is, by definition, epigenetic. At {{the level}} of the nucleosome, the building block of the chromatin, changes in chromatin structure can be regulated through histone content. Apart from the <b>canonical</b> histones whose <b>synthesis</b> is restricted to S-phase, different histone variants have been identified. Histone variants can help to establish specialised chromatin regions and to regulate developmental and cell differentiation processes. While the role of histone variants has been extensively explored in differentiated cells, less is known in germ cells and embryos. Increasing lines of evidence suggest that the functions and/or properties of histone variants in embryos might be different to those in somatic cells. During reprogramming, histone variants such as H 3. 3 or H 2 A. Z are candidates to play potential important roles. We suggest that H 3. 3 has an important role in setting up a 'transition' signature, and provides the possibility to infer changes in chromatin architecture independent of DNA replication. This should confer flexibility during important developmental processes. The specific pathways through which H 3. 3 could regulate different chromatin conformations at different loci and the identification of specific proteins responsible for this deposition are an important challenge for future investigation. Lastly, the set of variants incorporated within the nucleosome can have important consequences in the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms during development...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{producing}} a corpus-based synthesizer with the owner’s voice can only be achieved if the system can handle recordings with less than ideal characteristics. One of the limitations is that a normal speaker does not always pronounce a word exactly as predicted by the language rules. In this work we compare two methods for handling variations on word pronunciation for corpus-based speech synthesizers. Both approaches rely on a speech corpus aligned with a phone-level segmentation tool that allows alternative word pronunciations. The first approach performs an alignment between the observed pronunciation and the canonical form used in the system’s lexicon, allowing the mapping of the time labels from the observed phones into the <b>canonical</b> form. At <b>synthesis</b> time the unit selection is performed on the phone sequence predicted by the system. In the second approach, no modification is performed on the phone sequence generated by the segmentation tool. This way, at synthesis time, the words are converted into phones by using the speaker’s word pronunciation, rather than the system’s lexicon. Finally, both approaches are compared by evaluating the naturalness of the signals generated by each approach. 2. 2 Lexicon pronunciation Speaker’s word pronunciations are projected onto the Lexicon pronunciations Alignment between both phonetic sequences Mismatching segments not {{to be used in}} isolation 2. 3 Speaker-specific pronunciatio...|$|R
40|$|Serine is a both a proteinogenic {{amino acid}} {{and the source}} of one-carbon units {{essential}} for de novo purine and deoxythymidine <b>synthesis.</b> In the <b>canonical</b> glucose-derived serine <b>synthesis</b> pathway, Homo sapiens phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) catalyzes the first, ratelimiting step. Genetic loss of PHGDH is toxic towards PHGDH-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines even in the presence of exogenous serine. Here, we use a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify small molecule PHGDH inhibitors. These compounds reduce the production of glucose-derived serine in cells and suppress the growth of PHGDH-dependent cancer cells in culture and in orthotopic xenograft tumors. Surprisingly, PHGDH inhibition reduced the incorporation into nucleotides of one-carbon units from glucose-derived and exogenous serine. We conclude that glycolytic serine synthesis coordinates the use of one-carbon units from endogenous and exogenous serine in nucleotide synthesis, and suggest that one-carbon unit wasting may contribute to the efficacy of PHGDH inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.
