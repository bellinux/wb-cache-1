5|$|The {{underpinnings}} {{of the local}} economy are based on Moncton's heritage as a commercial, distribution, transportation, and retailing centre.

It was thought that this location would support the Audiencia of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, the velodrome {{was removed}} {{and the track}} {{converted}} for use for speedway. For the 1952 Winter Olympics, the venue was upgraded with a new ice hockey clock, a new lighting system and new ice hockey boards. The speedway course was dismounted in 1968. During the 1980s, the stadium became a <b>central</b> <b>location</b> for drug dealing, but the traffic moved away during the 1990s. In 1985, artificial ice was laid north of the football pitch, costing 2.1 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Of this, NOK1.3 million was financed by Grüner IL through loans. At {{the same time a}} new gravel pitch was laid on the football field.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to build}} a new stadium in Malmö {{originated}} in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö IP to be too small for major events. However, the city council could not agree where to build the new stadium, and the matter was dropped for the time being. It was not until Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup that the question resurfaced. The location of the stadium was a main subject of discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, while others thought that the stadium should be located in central Malmö, near the neighbourhood of Pildammsparken. Proponents of a <b>central</b> <b>location</b> ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954.|$|E

5|$|Shenandoah Valley and Newtown's <b>central</b> <b>location</b> {{attracted}} {{heavy traffic}} through the region, and wagon-making {{emerged as an}} important industry for the town; Newtown artisans supplied wagons throughout the state.

Due to the <b>central</b> <b>location</b> of the stadium within the city, parking space is limited, and spectators are advised to use public transportation, particularly for more prominent matches. The stadium is also located close to the underground railway station Triangeln, which opened in December 2010 as a part of Citytunneln.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the modern}} {{companies}} and institutions have a inevitable need for secure connections with remote locations trough broadband WAN networks. The reason for such requisite is mainly {{the need for}} shared services utilization like application servers, database servers, messaging servers, etc., physically located at remote datacenters. In this paper, we present realistic VPN implementation and configuration for a company with two <b>central</b> <b>locations</b> (head office and warehouse) and branch offices in several cities. For secure communication between <b>central</b> <b>locations</b> and branch offices, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels are implemented. EIGRP protocol is used for routing the data between networks. From the implementation analyses conducted in this paper, we can figure out that this approach allows low-complexity realization and low-cost maintenance solution...|$|R

5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} on a common strategy: Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion—by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards Ragnit (Neman). To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a <b>central</b> <b>location</b> from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction rather quickly. Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To keep their plans secret and mislead the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location.

In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where {{he knew he had}} the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a <b>central</b> <b>location,</b> and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E
