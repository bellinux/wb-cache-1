500|$|King's Highway 407 (pronounced [...] "four-oh-seven") is a tolled 400-series {{highway in}} the Canadian {{province}} of Ontario. Comprising a privately leased segment {{as well as}} a publicly owned segment, the route begins in Burlington and travels through the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) suburbs of Oakville, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Markham, Pickering and Whitby before ending in Oshawa. The segment between Burlington and Brougham in Pickering is leased to and operated by the 407ETR Concession Company Limited and is officially known as the 407 Express Toll Route (407ETR). It begins at the junction of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) and Highway403 in Burlington, and travels [...] across the GTA to Brock Road in Pickering. East of Brock Road the freeway continues east as Highway 407 East (Highway 407E), a toll route operated by the provincial government, for [...] to Harmony Road in Oshawa. Highway407 is the first electronically operated toll highway opened in the world; there are no toll booths {{along the length of the}} route. Distances are <b>calculated</b> <b>automatically</b> using transponders or licence plates, which are scanned at entrance and exit points. Major interchanges along the route include the QEW, Highway403, Highway401, Highway410, Highway427, Highway400, Highway404, and Highway412.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} phase of this study, a data-base {{containing}} clinical and laboratory findings of 704 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), originating from 29 centres and 14 countries, was used to assess the validity of 4 common indices of disease activity, SLAM, BILAG, SLEDAI and SIS. The physician's judgement of activity was assumed as the unique reference criterion (gold standard). Computer programmes were developed to <b>calculate</b> <b>automatically</b> the 4 activity indices; this computation appeared to correspond with manual computations in a sample of 60 appropriately selected cases. All 4 indices were closely correlated with each other (r in the range of 0. 716 to 0. 872), and with the physician's score (r in the range of 0. 620 to 0. 719). In {{the second phase of the}} study the activity index developed in part I (ECLAM) was prospectively validated, and its performance compared to that of the other scales, both as a single state index and as a transition index (i. e., its ability to assess disease activity at a single point in time and to detect variations in consecutive readings). A computer-assisted clinical chart was prepared for this purpose. This chart allowed us to <b>calculate</b> <b>automatically</b> all the indices. Two consecutive observation times (time 0, and time 1 three months later) were included in the study protocol. Data on 75 patients from 19 centres were collected, and each patient was observed twice.

5000|$|Based on the examination, {{the flight}} was uneventful until the approach. However, during the cruise stage of the flight, First Officer Davtyan stated: [...] "**** it.. who {{operates}} such flights with the jitter and not enough sleep". This may indicate that he didn't have adequate sleeping hours, meaning he was fatigued at the time. The BEA also noted that neither pilot understood how the autopilot of an Airbus A320 works. Analysis of the internal communications {{at this stage of}} the flight shows that Captain Grigoryan was annoyed by the fact that in DESCENT mode (MANAGED MODE) the descent rate was not as high as he expected. BEA noted that in this mode, the descent rate is <b>calculated</b> <b>automatically,</b> depending on a number of parameters describing the descent, e.g. the aircraft attitude in relation to the preset profile and so on. This fact shows that either the Captain did not fully understand the autopilot work algorithm in the DESCENT mode, or was in a state of high psycho-emotional strain with an imperative to land at Sochi as soon as possible.|$|E
