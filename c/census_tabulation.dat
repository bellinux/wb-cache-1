40|$|Objectives: We {{investigate}} how much state-to-state elderly migration patterns have changed during 1970 - 2000 {{and compare the}} findings from two commonly-used sources of data, the <b>Census</b> flow <b>tabulations</b> and the integrated public use micro samples (IPUMS). Methods: We calculate descriptive statistics such as migration rates, the distribution of top destination and origin states, and a new migration Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) that measures geographic concentration. Comparisons over time and between data sources are formalized using correlations and regression analyses that permit persistent flow patterns. Results: After an increase between 1970 and 1980, elderly migration rates have been stable, with a slight decline. Elderly migration has become less geographically concentrated; the decline of California and Florida and ascension of Nevada and the Carolinas as top destinations is evident. Correlation and regression analyses reveal that migration patterns are overall very persistent over time, especially using <b>Census</b> <b>tabulations</b> based on a larger sample. Discussion: Elderly migration patterns have been quite stable since 1970. Using the IPUMS, as most migration studies do, exaggerates the changes in elderly migration over time in both descriptive and statistical analyses, a result that is likely due to its smaller sample size and the relative rarity of an interstate move...|$|R

There is also evidence that as towns themselves grow wealthier, such as in Zhejiang, better educated people in rural areas were likely to shift their jobs from the farm to non-farm sector in towns nearby, instead of leaving the countryside to migrate to other provinces.

40|$|The {{focus of}} Symposium' 99 is on {{techniques}} and methods for combining data from different sources and on {{analysis of the}} resulting data sets. In this talk we illustrate the usefulness of taking such an "integrating" approach when tackling a complex statistical problem. The problem itself is easily described - it is how to approximate, as closely as possible, a "perfect census", and in particular, how to obtain census counts that are "free" of underenumeration. Typically, underenumeration is estimated by carrying out a post enumeration survey (PES) following the census. In the UK in 1991 the PEF failed to identify the full size of the underenumeration and so demographic methods were used to estimate {{the extent of the}} undercount. The problems with the "traditional" PES approach in 1991 resulted in a joint research project between the Office for National Statistics and the Department of Social Statistics at the University of Southampton aimed at developing a methodology which will allow a "One Number Census" in the UK in 2001. That is, underenumeration will be accounted for not just at high levels of aggregation, but right down to the lowest levels at which <b>census</b> <b>tabulations</b> are produced. In this way all census outputs will be internally consistent, adding to the national population estimates. The basis of this methodology is the integration of information from a number of data sources in order to achieve this "One Number"...|$|R
40|$|Harrison, Rubinfeld (1978 c) used a hedonic {{model to}} find out how house values were {{affected}} by air pollution in Boston, when other variables were taken into consideration. Their primary interest was in estimating willingness to pay for cleaner air. They chose to use 506 census tracts as units of observation because median house values for these units of aggregation were published in the 1970 <b>census</b> <b>tabulations.</b> Air pollution values from the model output, represented by nitrogen oxides (NOX), were available for 122 model output zones, of which only 96 fell within the study area defined by the chosen census tracts. These NOX values were then assigned proportionally to all census tracts falling within each model output zone. By re-aggregating the house value data to the 96 air pollution model output zones and refitting the regression model, the total impact of air pollution on house values, and thus the estimated willingness to pay, increases markedly. By extending the analysis to include spatially lagged independent variables, the total impact of air pollution on median house values, and consequently on the willingness to pay analysis, increases by over three times. Use of weighting to adjust the units of observation for the relative numbers of housing units behind each median house value further buttresses this conclusion. It is shown conclusively that the choice of observational units matters crucially for the estimation of economic parameters of interest in this data set...|$|R

Although ACE was generally implemented as planned, the Bureau found that it overstated census undercounts because of an error introduced during matching operations and other uncertainties. The Bureau concluded that additional review and analysis of these uncertainties would be needed before the data could be used. Matching more than 1. 4 million census and ACE records involved the following four phases, each with its own matching procedures and multiple layers of review: computer matching, clerical matching, field follow-up, and clerical matching. The Bureau applied quality assurance procedures to each phase of person matching. Because the quality assurance procedures had failure rates of less than one percent, the Bureau reported that person matching quality assurance was successful at minimizing errors. Overall, the Bureau carried out person matching as planned, with few procedural deviations. GAO identified areas for improving future ACE efforts, including more complete documentation of computer matching decisions and better assurance that problems do not arise with the bureau's automated systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The Census of Agriculture {{provides}} a continuing historical {{record of what}} has happened on New York State farms and its wider rural economy. The purpose of this report is to provide readily accessible information on basic historical facts about agriculture in New York State such as land in farms, numbers of farms, acreage of major crops and numbers of livestock for census years dating back to 1992. Census results for 2007 show that 24 percent (7. 5 million acres) of the State’s land area was in farms. This acreage is roughly equal to the land in farms reported in the early 1990 s but far below the peak acreage in the early 1900 s. Much of the land formerly in farms has reverted to forest or brush. Total cropland in 2007 was 4. 31 million acres of which 79 percent was harvested. Some of these results trace to data adjustments made in conjunction with the 2002 and 2007 <b>census</b> <b>tabulations.</b> These adjustments accounted for under enumeration and helped boost harvested cropland acreage above levels reported in the late 1980 s. Looking at farm numbers, New York has not shared in the 2002 - 2007 net increase in farm numbers reported nationally by the USDA for this decade; New York is among 11 states with net farm decreases between 2002 and 2007. This information must be interpreted with care because of important structural changes in acquisition, management, and reporting of census data in the last decade. Current census procedures involve USDA determinations on potential crop/ livestock commodity sales, along with the practice of counting participants in federal conservation programs as farms, if federal payments are sufficient to meet the $ 1, 000 threshold required to qualify such a unit as a farm. In 2007, nearly 10, 000 New York farms (27 % of all farms) had commodity sales below $ 1, 000 during the census year. The comparable percentage for the entire US is 31 %.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} indirect techniques of fertility and mortality estimation to historical census data, both in published form and as micro census samples derived from the original enumerators' manuscripts. There are many instances in which census data exist but adequate vital registration data do not, {{such as in the}} United States prior to 1933, when the Birth and Death Registration Areas finally covered the entire nation. Since the United States has taken decennial censuses since 1790, and since all the original population schedules except those for 1890 have been preserved, it is possible to apply these indirect methods. For example, the censuses of 1900 and 1910 asked questions on children ever born, children surviving, and duration of current marriage, but this information was never tabulated or used for 1900 and only partly tabulated for 1910. The Public Use Samples of the 1900 and 1910 censuses make possible the utilization of those data to estimate levels, differentials, and even recent trends in childhood mortality. Application of own-children methods to samples of the censuses since 1850 permits estimation of age-specific overall and marital fertility rates. Finally, the use of the 1900 Public Use Sample in conjunction with published data on parity from the 1910 <b>census</b> (or <b>tabulations</b> from the 1910 Public Use Sample) allows application of the two-census, parity increment method of birth rate estimation. ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{concern of}} this thesis {{is with the}} {{position}} {{of women in the}} United States. Specifically, the focus is on women in the professions. The theoretical perspective is taken from Everett C. Hughes’ 1945 discussion of “Dilemmas and Contradictions of Status. ” Hughes maintained that when an incumbent of a status holds an unexpected auxiliary characteristic he is in a dilemma because others {{do not know how to}} respond to the contradictory stimuli. Others’ responses tend to reflect unfavorably back on the individual’s self-image and he seeks to avoid reactions from others by adopting behavior to reduce the impact of the discrepant status. The professions in the United States are characterized by a basic body of abstract knowledge and the ideal of service. Thirteen occupations were established as professions, ranked on the basis of those characteristics and a boundary line was drawn between professions and non-professions. A selection of seven professions was made on which to test the hypotheses. These seven were: medicine, university teaching, dentistry, natural science, social science, with veterinary medicine and social work marking off the lower boundary. Women in these professions were considered to be in an inconsistent status because they hold the unexpected characteristic of a female in a male-dominated occupation and meet the other conditions of status inconsistency. Since the female professional can do nothing about changing her discrepant characteristic of being female, it is hypothesized that she adopts behavior which brings her status characteristics in accord and reduces the impact of her inconsistent status. This behavior may consist of avoidance, isolation and/or social segregation on the part of the female professional and her clients or colleagues. The modes of adaptation selected are the basis of the eight hypotheses of the study: 1) women enter the professions in smaller proportions than men, 2) women professionals do not participate fully in the colleague-group, 3) women enter positions isolated from the public, 4) women tend to be salaried rather that self-employed, 5) women tend to be in career lines apart from positions of power and prestige, tend to be in career lines apart from positions of power and prestige, 6) women fill the lower echelons of a profession, 7) women specialize in those areas relating to the normatively accepted women’s role, and 8) women tend to deal with patients of equal or lower status. The data on which the hypotheses were tested were obtained from many different published sources relating the seven professions. These sources consisted in the main of <b>census</b> <b>tabulations,</b> professional directories, sample surveys, National Education Association publications, and the National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel. It was found that the data generally supported all the hypotheses with the exception of hypothesis number three which could not be tested. There seems to be a consistent pattern for the few women who do enter the professions to enter a limited number of them and to specialize in those areas which are consistent with the prescribed role of women in American society. Moreover, they tend to teach or enter research, work in educational institutions and be on salary. Women are not usually found in the top positions nor the most lucrative positions within a profession. Further, their career lines do not lead to the top positions and they tend to fill the lower echelons within each profession. It may be concluded that women professionals adopt this pattern throughout the professions, that their career pattern is very different than that of male professionals, and it is suggested that they adopt this pattern in order to reduce the impact of their inconsistent status set...|$|R
