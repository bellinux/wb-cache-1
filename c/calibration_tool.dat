50|$|Libraries and {{archives}} {{around the}} world have collections of many thousands of coarse-groove mechanical audio recordings, phonograph or gramophone records, largely 78s or 78 rpm discs. This is a substantial recorded heritage of mankind's music and spoken word made over a period of 65 years. The 78 rpm disc was largely out of production by 1960. These mechanical recordings won't be available indefinitely since the plastics used in their manufacture are deteriorating slowly but steadily. Preservation programs have been underway by a number of organizations. Decreasing costs of digital storage media now make it possible to consider all mechanical audio recordings for transfer to the digital domain. Thus a widespread need was recognized by the Audio Engineering Society (AES) to provide a <b>calibration</b> <b>tool</b> for standard transfer of mechanical coarse-groove audio recordings from the analog to the digital domain.|$|E
50|$|Fogel uses isotope ratios {{in ancient}} sediments and fossils to trace climate, diet, and species {{presence}} over time.In one study, she and collaborators used Genyornis newtoni eggshells in Australia ranging from 100,000 to 50,000 {{years of age}} to show that their extinction 50,000 years ago was likely due to human impact rather than climate changes. 40,000 years ago, Australia went through a dry period, as recorded in emu eggshells, but the extinction of Genyornis 50,000 years ago rather than 40,000 suggests that their extinction was likely unrelated to the drying. Using stable carbon isotopes, her group determined that Genyornis consumed nearly exclusively C3 plants, and that their cranial morphology indicated a browser reliant upon shrubland. Because {{it seems that the}} Genyornis diet is fairly restrictive, {{it is likely that the}} arrival of humans around 55,000 years ago and their burning of land may have caused some megafauna extinction as it changed the flora population. She has used similar techniques to study amino acids in the elephant birds of Madagascar and measure the isotope ratios in modern ostrich eggshells as a <b>calibration</b> <b>tool</b> for paleoenvironmental studies of Africa.Isotope ratios can also indicate species and diet characteristics in fossilized specimens. A Paleozoic fossil of Prototaxites has attracted attention dating back to 1859 due to its odd tree-like trunk measuring up to 8m long. Because the Paleozoic Era was one of drastic organismal shift, and the origin of vascular plants, it was previously unclear if Prototaxites were vascular plants or fungal species. However, a team of researchers, including Fogel, found the ùõø13C of the species to be as much as 13‚Ä∞ different from contemporaneous vascular plants, suggesting that Prototaxites are in fact heterotrophs, and more likely a fungus.|$|E

40|$|Instrument {{calibration}} {{can be seen}} {{as having}} several different components; clearly there is the use of specific <b>calibration</b> <b>tools</b> according to specific procedures on well defined data sets to yield calibration parameters. Also the application of such calibration parameters to data is part of the general process of instrument calibration. Possibly {{the most important part of}} the instrument calibration process is the actual design and development of the various <b>calibration</b> <b>tools</b> and procedures. Especially critical is the possibility for instrument specialists to efficiently incorporate refined instrument understanding into standard calibration and data processing steps. The experience obtained in developing SWS calibration strategies when going from pre-ground test theory through instrument level tests, performance verification, operations and post operations are discussed. The importance of a flexible and adaptable data analysis environment as well as continued access to all test data -i. e. both pre-flight and in-flight- is illustrated...|$|R
50|$|Korzenowski, {{having been}} taught by Vazquez on Earth, and in {{developing}} her {{work within the}} Thistledown, planned a radical extension of the inertial field of the sixth chamber - effectively extending the field away to an infinite extent within the seventh chamber. In order to do this effectively, he and his engineers modified a set of semi-sentient field <b>calibration</b> <b>tools</b> to build the first Clavicles. Unlike the field <b>calibration</b> <b>tools</b> from which they were descended, the Clavicles possessed the ability not only to manipulate the field, but extend it {{as an extension of}} the will of the operator. Already radical enough, Korzenowski and his team went further. By extending the field of the Sixth Chamber from within the Seventh Chamber of the Thistledown, they could then directly access what Vasquez had calculated within her own work - alternate world lines as non-gravity bent geodesics of superspace.|$|R
50|$|The {{simulator}} provides engineers, {{teams and}} drivers {{the opportunity to}} test and develop the whole car setup and data analysis systems, to optimize the driving skills and to learn new tracks. Allows a driver to drive exactly the same monocoque used on the track, with the same controls (pedals, brake, instrument panel) and {{the same level of}} feedback (effort steering and brake). The helmet is mandatory, as well as the gloves, the shoes and the race suit. The advanced system of complete circuit simulation, obtained by laser scanning high-fidelity combined with sophisticated multi-body model, allows to replicate the real car behavior with unprecedented accuracy. The pilot has the opportunity to learn not only the speed with which it must take a curve, but the same curve as it really is; roughness of the terrain, bumps and curbs are entirely modeled thanks to the technology of laser scanning data processing. There are all the cars and the tracks of all the categories in which it operates Dallara, from Formula Three to IndyCar, from Monte Carlo to Indianapolis. It is possible to change any configuration parameter in the car {{to meet the needs of}} the pilot and test the changes in a controlled environment. The thermal model of the tire allows the preparation of structures for both the qualification for the race, considering the wear of the tires, the characteristics of the track and weather conditions. All changes can be imposed immediately via the user interface developed in Dallara. This has been specifically designed to ensure ease of use, data security and speed of execution. The simulator allows you to analyze the same data channels of a real car, with even greater precision in the absence of noise in the signal and error during <b>calibration</b> <b>tool.</b> The fidelity of the mathematical model has been validated carefully by professional pilots in various categories. It is also possible to access a series of channels normally impossible to obtain on a real machine (for example, the forces on the tires). This allows a more detailed and scrupulous behavior of the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Optimization tools {{have been}} {{developed}} for automatic calibration of water distribution models. The tools are often based upon a powerful genetic algorithm optimization and seamlessly integrated with hydraulic and water quality modeling systems. It provides the advanced features for engineers and modelers. In spite {{of the power of the}} GA modeling, some users report that the optimal <b>calibration</b> <b>tool</b> has not worked effectively for practical model calibration. This paper presents a case study on uncovering the causes of problems in automated calibration and proposes an approach for effectively applying the optimization calibration method. The case study involves a real water distribution system. The model is constructed by experienced modeling engineers and an optimization <b>calibration</b> <b>tool</b> is applied to calibrating the model. However, the initial application of the <b>calibration</b> <b>tool</b> did not make any improvement at all over the uncalibrated model. A detailed analysis has been conducted to diagnose the problems with the model calibration. This study uncovers an error prone application of the optimization-based <b>calibration</b> <b>tool</b> and illustrates effective procedures for applying the <b>calibration</b> <b>tool</b> to a real water distribution model. The procedure and steps have been found efficient at improving model calibration. They may also serve the general guidelines for calibrating water distribution models even without use of optimization...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} some {{results from a}} study in {{progress}} on methods for the measurement {{of the length of}} a robber in a surveillance video image. A <b>calibration</b> <b>tool</b> was constructed for the calibration of the camera. Standard procedures for computing the lens distortion, image projection parameters and the length of the robber have been implemented in Mathematika. These procedures are based on the use of pixel coordinates of markers on the <b>calibration</b> <b>tool,</b> the robber's head (and, optionally, his feet) and an estimation of his position in the coordinate system that is defined by the <b>calibration</b> <b>tool.</b> Monte-Carlo simulation is used to compute a histogram of the robber's length, yielding an estimation of minimum and maximum values. In a repeated process pixel and position coordinates are selected randomly from predefined ranges and, using these data sets, the length, position and quality of the fit are computed and stored. The range of the length in the histogram can be made smaller by selecting only those data sets that can meet one or more constraints, e. g. the quality of the fit should be good and the position of the robber should be within the physical limits of the scene.
