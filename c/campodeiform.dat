5|$|Beetle larvae can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles {{along the sides of}} their bodies. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as <b>campodeiform.</b> Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|E
5|$|Holometabolism, or {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{is where the}} insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form {{can be one of}} several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), <b>campodeiform</b> (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E
500|$|About 14,500 {{species of}} caddisfly in 45 {{families}} have been recognised worldwide, but many more species remain to be described. Most {{can be divided into}} the suborders Integripalpia and Annulipalpia {{on the basis of the}} adult mouthparts. The characteristics of adults depend on the palps, wing venation and genitalia of both sexes. The latter two characters have undergone such extensive differentiation among the different superfamilies that the differences between the suborders is not clear-cut. The larvae of Annulipalpians are [...] <b>campodeiform</b> (free-living, well sclerotized, long legged predators with dorso-ventrally flattened bodies and protruding mouthparts). The larvae of Integripalpians are polypod (poorly sclerotized detritivores, with abdominal prolegs in addition to thoracic legs, living permanently in tight-fitting cases). The affinities of the third suborder, Spicipalpia, are unclear; the larvae are free-living with no cases, instead creating net-like traps from silk.|$|E

50|$|Other species however may be <b>campodeiform</b> (a form {{reminiscent}} {{of members of}} the genus Campodea, elongated, more or less straight, flattened, and active, with functional legs). This stage is variously adapted to gaining and accumulating the materials and energy necessary for growth and metamorphosis.|$|E
50|$|In typical {{examples}} the first-instar larval morphology is <b>campodeiform</b> (meaning: elongated, flattened, and active, {{more or less}} {{resembling the}} morphology of insects in the genus Campodea). There is however, considerable variety in the forms of planidia that occur in various families and orders; in the beetle family Meloidae, the three-clawed planidium originally was called a triungulin, and similar planidia for example, those of the Strepsiptera, may also be called triungula.|$|E
50|$|Symphrasinae larvae are {{sedentary}} parasitoids on bee, wasp or scarab beetle larvae. Larvae of the Calomantispinae are predators {{of small}} arthropods, and {{in at least}} one species they are mobile. Mantispinae have the most specialized larval development among all mantidflies studied to date (the life history of the Drepanicinae remains unknown): their <b>campodeiform</b> larvae seek out female spiders or their egg sacs which they then enter; the scarabaeiform larvae then feed on the spider eggs, draining egg contents through a piercing/sucking tube formed by modified mandibles and maxillae, pupating in the egg sac.|$|E

40|$|Mature larva and pupa of Macrolygistopterus subparallelus Pic are {{described}} and compared to known Calochromini immatures. Larvae were collected alive inside dead trunk in the Atlantic Forest at Estacao Biologica de Boraceia, Salesopolis, Sao Paulo, Brazil. They were maintained in laboratory conditions, and the pupal period was 12 days (one observation). The pupa of this genus is described {{for the first}} time. This larva differs from known Calochromini larvae mainly because of its almost cylindrical <b>campodeiform</b> body and longer urogomphi.
