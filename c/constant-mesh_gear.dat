5000|$|The Damaizin & Pujos was a French {{automobile}} manufactured only in 1910. The company built chassis with a patented <b>constant-mesh</b> <b>gear</b> change, and {{may also}} have been known as [...] "Dux".|$|E
50|$|Scammell {{launched}} the three-axle 6x4 Crusader at London's 1968 Earls Court Commercial Vehicle Show. The truck {{was designed for}} high-speed long distance transport, typically to cover 250,000 miles a year. The truck included a 'repair by replacement' philosophy to cut downtime {{and the consequences of}} unscheduled maintenance. The drive line included a 9.3-litre GM Detroit Diesel 8V71N two-stroke diesel engine, rated at 273 bhp. This drove through a Fuller RoadRanger 16-speed <b>constant-mesh</b> <b>gear</b> box, to an Albion double-drive and two-spring bogie, using double reduction and cross lockable drive axles. The final reduction took place in the hubs to give better ground clearance under the differential housings. Scammell used the same rear bogie on its highly successful 24-ton Double Drive Routeman 8x4 tipper chassis, launched at the same exhibition. As most contemporary 32-ton and maximum capacity trucks in the UK had engine power ratings of between 150 and 220 bhp, the Crusader's 273 bhp attracted immediate attention, much of it unfavourable from deeply conservative operators.|$|E
