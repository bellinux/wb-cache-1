40|$|Many of the {{mutagenic}} or lethal {{effects of}} ionization radiation {{can be attributed}} to damage caused to the DNA by low-energy electrons. To gain insight on the parameters affecting this process, we measured the low-energy electron (< 2 eV) transmission yield through self-assembled monolayers of short DNA oligomers. The electrons that are not transmitted are captured by the layer. Hence, the transmission reflects the capturing efficiency of the electrons by the layer. The dependence of the capturing probability on the base sequence was studied, as was the state of the <b>captured</b> <b>electrons.</b> It is found that the capturing probability scales with the number of G bases in the single-stranded oligomers and depends on their clustering level. Using two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy, we find that, once <b>captured,</b> the <b>electrons</b> do not reside on the bases. Rather, the state of the <b>captured</b> <b>electrons</b> is insensitive to the sequence of the oligomer.

50|$|Although alpha, beta, and gamma {{radiations}} {{were most}} commonly found, {{other types of}} emission were eventually discovered. Shortly after {{the discovery of the}} positron in cosmic ray products, it was realized that the same process that operates in classical beta decay can also produce positrons (positron emission), along with neutrinos (classical beta decay produces antineutrinos). In a more common analogous process, called electron capture, some proton-rich nuclides were found to capture their own atomic electrons instead of emitting positrons, and subsequently these nuclides emit only a neutrino and a gamma ray from the excited nucleus (and often also Auger electrons and characteristic X-rays, {{as a result of the}} re-ordering of electrons to fill the place of the missing <b>captured</b> <b>electron).</b> These types of decay involve the nuclear capture of electrons or emission of electrons or positrons, and thus acts to move a nucleus toward the ratio of neutrons to protons that has the least energy for a given total number of nucleons.

40|$|Abstract. Constant-capacitance deep-level {{transient}} spectroscopy {{was carried}} out to characterize in detail interface states close to the conduction band edge in SiO 2 /SiC structures. The measured results are summarized as follows: (1) The <b>capture</b> of <b>electrons</b> by the interface states proceeds logarithmically with time. (2) The emission of electrons accelerates slightly with increasing density of <b>captured</b> <b>electrons.</b> The oxide trap model explains the logarithmic change in capture with time but not the phenomenon of accelerated emissions. This prompted us to formulate a new model that replicates the logarithmic capture process with time. In this model, we postulated the electron density at the interface decreases exponentially as the trapped electron density increases owing to {{the interaction between the}} trapped electrons and the free electrons. In this case, the capture process is almost the same as with the oxide trap model except for the definition of parameters. Further, we do not need {{to take into account the}} delay of the emission process caused by tunneling. The phenomenon of accelerated emissions may be explained by interactions among <b>captured</b> <b>electrons</b> in this model...|$|R
