5000|$|The key {{piece of}} {{physical}} evidence linking the Al-Shifa facility to production of chemical weapons was the discovery of EMPTA in a soil sample taken from the plant during a CIA clandestine operation. EMPTA, or O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid, is classified as a Schedule 2B compound under the Chemical Weapons Convention, meaning that while it is a <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>precursor</b> (it {{can be used to}} manufacture VX nerve agent), it also has legitimate small-scale applications outside of chemical warfare and so is permitted to be manufactured in small quantities. Although potential uses and patented processes using EMPTA existed, such as the manufacture of plastic, no known industrial uses of EMPTA were ever documented, nor were any products that contained EMPTA. It is, however, not banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, as originally claimed by the U.S. government. Moreover, the presence of EMPTA near (but outside) the boundary of Al-Shifa does not prove that it was produced in the factory; EMPTA could have been [...] "stored in or transported near Al-Shifa, instead of being produced by it", {{according to a report by}} Michael Barletta.|$|E
40|$|A {{chemical}} weapon {{is defined as}} a substance that is intended for use in military and non­ military operations to kill, seriously injure or otherwise incapacitate people, or to harm or destroy their habitat or economy. Chemical weapons can be made by toxic chemicals reaction. Chemical weapons misused may lead to terror, injury, death and environmental damage. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is an arms control agreement which outlaws the production, stockpiling and use of {{chemical weapon}}s. CWC is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction. This article describe how to identify chemical weapons, sign and symptom of their toxicity, impact and the chemical weapons convention, in order to handle and control chemical weapons release.   Key words: <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>precursor,</b> Chemical Weapons Convention</p...|$|E

50|$|Between 1992 and 1994 the Muthana {{site was}} the main {{collection}} and destruction site for <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> agents, <b>precursor</b> <b>chemicals,</b> and chemical production equipment. Between 1992 and 1994, the UNSCOM destroyed 30,000 pieces of ordnance, 480,000 liters of chemical agents, and more than 2 million liters of chemical precursors. Eventually, most of the facilities at the complex the Iraqi’s destroyed and sold for scrap.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} UNSCOM left Iraq in December 1998, it had {{eliminated}} {{a large portion}} of Iraq's <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> potential. UNSCOM had overseen the destruction or incapacitation of more than 88,000 filled or unfilled chemical munitions, over 600 tons of weaponized or bulk chemical agents, some 4,000 tons of precursor chemicals, some 980 pieces of key production equipment, and some 300 pieces of analytical equipment. Notwithstanding these extraordinary achievements, there remained important uncertainties regarding Iraq's holdings of <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> their <b>precursors,</b> and munitions.|$|R
50|$|Directly {{after the}} strike the Sudanese {{government}} {{demanded that the}} United Nations Security Council conduct {{an investigation of the}} site to determine if it had been used to produce <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> or <b>precursors.</b> Such an investigation was opposed by the U.S., which has also blocked an independent laboratory analysis of the sample allegedly containing EMPTA.

5000|$|Along with nerve agents such as tabun and VX, sarin {{can have}} a short shelf life. Therefore, it is usually stored as two {{separate}} precursors that produce sarin when combined. [...] Sarin's shelf life can be extended by increasing {{the purity of the}} precursor and intermediates and incorporating stabilizers such as tributylamine. In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in aluminium casings. In binary <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons,</b> the two <b>precursors</b> are stored separately in the same shell and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight.
