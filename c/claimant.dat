5|$|The <b>Claimant</b> was now bankrupt. In 1870 his {{new legal}} {{advisers}} launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, {{an issue of}} 1,000 debentures of £100 face value, the holders {{of which would be}} repaid with interest when the <b>Claimant</b> obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the <b>Claimant</b> to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that the <b>Claimant</b> hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E
5|$|After {{depositing}} {{his family}} in a London hotel, the <b>Claimant</b> called at Lady Tichborne's address and was told she was in Paris. He then went to Wapping in East London, where he enquired after a local family named Orton. Finding that they had left the area, he identified himself to a neighbour {{as a friend of}} Arthur Orton, who, he said, was now one of the wealthiest men in Australia. The significance of the Wapping visit would become apparent only later. On 29 December the <b>Claimant</b> visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes. The <b>Claimant</b> confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret. He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|Back in London, the <b>Claimant</b> {{employed}} a solicitor, John Holmes, {{who agreed to}} go with him to Paris to meet Lady Tichborne. This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille. As soon as she saw his face, Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the <b>Claimant</b> was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the <b>Claimant</b> an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E
40|$|Imposing {{financial}} penalties on <b>claimants</b> of unemployment insurance may incentivise labour market re-entry. However, sanctions may have differential effects {{depending on the}} work-readiness of the <b>claimants.</b> Here, I explore whether sanctioning disabled <b>claimants</b> is associated with greater labour market activity or inactivity among disabled people data on 346 British local authorities between 2009 and 2014. When the number of sanctioned disabled <b>claimants</b> rises (as a proportion of all <b>claimants),</b> the disability rate among economically inactive people becomes larger.

5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's {{insistence that}} the <b>Claimant</b> was her son, {{the rest of the}} Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the <b>Claimant</b> as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The <b>Claimant</b> was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the <b>Claimant,</b> who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember. The family believed that the <b>Claimant</b> had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the <b>Claimant</b> as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E

40|$|Many {{firms have}} filed for {{bankruptcy}} to manage mass tort liabilities, most notably asbestos producers. We model a bankruptchy procedure that optimally balances the liquidity needs of present <b>claimants</b> and an uncertain number of future <b>claimants.</b> We find that future <b>claimants</b> should receive greater awards in expectation than present <b>claimants</b> as compensation for bearing greater future claims risk. We also find that allocating more value to contractual creditors in bankruptcy makes an earlier filing more likely, which may increase overall welfare. Optimal risk-sharing implies that creditors should receive equity in a trust fund, with tort <b>claimants</b> receiving senior debtlike securities...|$|R

40|$|About 6, 000 refugees, {{asylum seekers}} and torture <b>claimants</b> (collectively “protection claimants”) are {{struggling}} to survive in Hong Kong. It is undoubted that they are an underprivileged and marginalized group in Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong is not the signatory of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, protection <b>claimants</b> do not enjoy legal status or formal rights to welfare services in Hong Kong. Without the right to work, protection <b>claimants</b> must survive on $ 1, 500 a month for accommodation and bags of food equivalent to $ 1, 200, or they may risk to work illegally in Hong Kong. This thesis examines how Hong Kong refugee policy affects the life of protection <b>claimants</b> in terms of right to work, food assistance and accommodation allowance. These factors are of paramount importance {{to the life of}} protection <b>claimants.</b> Drawing on qualitative participant-observations and in-depth interviews with protection <b>claimants,</b> it demonstrates the primary and secondary consequences that caused by the current refugee policy. Additionally, this thesis discovers how protection <b>claimants</b> react to the policy, revealing that the Hong Kong current refugee policy puts protection <b>claimants</b> into dilemma...|$|R
5|$|Arthur Orton, a butcher's son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping, {{had gone}} to sea as a boy and had been in Chile in the early 1850s. Sometime in 1852 he arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in the {{transport}} ship Middleton and later moved to mainland Australia. His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages. Thereafter he disappears; {{if he was not}} Castro, there is no further direct evidence of Orton's existence, although strenuous efforts were made to find him. The <b>Claimant</b> hinted that some of his activities with Orton were of a criminal nature and that to confound the authorities they had sometimes exchanged names. Most of Orton's family failed to recognise the <b>Claimant</b> as their long-lost kinsman, although it was later revealed that he had paid them money. However, a former sweetheart of Orton's, Mary Ann Loder, did identify the <b>Claimant</b> as Orton.|$|E

5|$|The jury retired {{at noon on}} Saturday 28 February, and {{returned}} to the court within 30 minutes. Their verdict declared that the <b>Claimant</b> was not Roger Tichborne, that he had not seduced Katherine Doughty, and that he was indeed Arthur Orton. He was thus convicted of perjury. The jury added a condemnation of Kenealy's conduct during the trial. After the judges refused his request to address the court, the <b>Claimant</b> was sentenced to two consecutive terms of seven years' imprisonment. Kenealy's behaviour ended his legal career; he was expelled from the Oxford circuit mess and from Gray's Inn, so that he could no longer practise. On 2 December 1874 the Lord Chancellor revoked Kenealy's patent as a Queen's Counsel.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a strong}} {{perception}} that Adjudicators are biased in favour of <b>claimants,</b> especially in the States using the 'East Coast' model of Security of Payment legislation. <b>Claimants</b> in these jurisdictions apply for adjudication of a payment dispute through an Authorised Nominating Authority rather than agree an Adjudicator with the respondent (as {{is the case in}} the 'West Coast' model).

Significant differences in personality traits were found between these groups of compensation <b>claimants.</b> Current compensation <b>claimants</b> displayed greater emotional instability and introversion compared with those less acutely involved in the compensation system. Current <b>claimants</b> also experienced clinically significant levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, and reported reduced social functioning, relative to previous and nonclaimants, respectively.

The article identifies the problems that <b>claimants</b> may face in alleging abuse of process in the liability insurance setting, but also indicates that recent trends {{in this area of}} law suggest that it may provide an effective, even if relatively limited, means of holding liability insurers accountable for the additional injury that they cause to third-party <b>claimants...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the <b>Claimant</b> was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the <b>Claimant</b> was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, {{including}} {{numbers from}} France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the <b>Claimant</b> was not Roger Tichborne {{or that he}} was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's. The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, the <b>Claimant</b> had provided the wrong name for Ospreys captain, and the names he gave for two of Ospreys crew were found to belong {{to members of the}} crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in Ospreys log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used. The defendant told the <b>claimant</b> (as a practical joke) {{that her husband had}} been seriously injured. As a result, the <b>claimant</b> suffered a nervous disorder and was thought to be suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and does so. The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E
40|$|Separate social {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} New Jersey and Illinois tested {{the effect of}} offering Unemployment Insurance (UI) <b>claimants</b> a cash bonus for rapid reemployment. The Illinois bonus was constant over time, while the New Jersey bonus declined over time, so that the bonus received was greater the earlier that reemployment occurred. This paper compares {{the effects of the}} bonus offers on the rate at which <b>claimants</b> exited UI. The New Jersey and Illinois bonus offers generated similar increases in the UI exit rate during the period in which <b>claimants</b> could qualify for the bonus. However, the declining New Jersey bonus had little impact on long-term <b>claimants</b> who exhausted their UI benefits. In contrast, the constant Illinois bonus had a substantial impact on long-term <b>claimants,</b> thereby reducing the rate at which <b>claimants</b> exhausted their UI benefits. This finding at least partly explains why the Illinois bonus had a larger impact on UI receipt than the New Jersey bonus. ...|$|R
