25|$|At the Berlin Radio Show in August 1931, Manfred von Ardenne gave {{a public}} {{demonstration}} {{of a television}} system using a CRT for both transmission and reception. However, Ardenne had not developed a <b>camera</b> <b>tube,</b> using the CRT instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film. Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on August 25, 1934, and for ten days afterwards.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} <b>camera</b> <b>tube</b> transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently {{to hold a}} demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV <b>camera</b> <b>tube</b> widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} <b>camera</b> <b>tube.</b> But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933 RCA {{introduced}} an improved <b>camera</b> <b>tube</b> that relied on Tihanyi's charge storage principle.

However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique [...] "multipactor" [...] device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. A problem with the multipactor, unfortunately, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.|$|E

2500|$|Philo Taylor Farnsworth (August 19, 1906 – March 11, 1971) was an American {{inventor}} {{and television}} pioneer. He made many contributions that were {{crucial to the}} early development of all-electronic television. He is {{perhaps best known for}} his 1927 invention of the first fully functional all-electronic image pickup device (video <b>camera</b> <b>tube),</b> the [...] "image dissector", as well as the first fully functional and complete all-electronic television system. He was also the first person to demonstrate such a system to the public. Farnsworth developed a television system complete with receiver and camera, which he produced commercially {{in the form of the}} Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation, from 1938 to 1951, in Fort Wayne, Indiana.|$|E
2500|$|Farnsworth {{worked out}} the {{principle}} of the image dissector in the summer of 1921, not long before his fifteenth birthday, and demonstrated the first working version on September 7, 1927, having turned 21 the previous August. A farm boy, his inspiration for scanning an image as series of lines came from the back-and-forth motion used to plow a field. In the course of a patent interference suit brought by RCA in 1934 and decided in February 1935, his high school chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, produced a sketch he had made of a blackboard drawing Farnsworth had shown him in spring 1922. [...] Farnsworth won the suit; RCA appealed the decision in 1936 and lost. Although Farnsworth was paid royalties by RCA, he never became wealthy. [...] The video <b>camera</b> <b>tube</b> that evolved from the combined work of Farnsworth, Zworykin and many others was used in all television cameras until the late 20th century, when alternate technologies such as charge-coupled devices started to appear.|$|E
2500|$|On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} <b>camera</b> <b>tube</b> transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver {{in another room}} of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, [...] "There you are — electronic television!" [...] The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a motor-generator; so the television system now had no mechanical parts. [...] That year Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images using his television system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Pem.|$|E
5000|$|Early video <b>cameras</b> using <b>tubes</b> (such as the Vidicon) {{suffered}} from severe [...] "ghosting" [...] {{due to the}} fact that the latent image on the target remained even after the subject had moved. Furthermore, as the system scanned the target, the motion of the scanning relative to the subject resulted in artifacts that compromised the image. The target in Vidicon type <b>camera</b> <b>tubes</b> can be made of various photoconductive chemicals such as antimony sulfide (Sb2S3), lead(II) oxide (PbO), and others with various image [...] "stick" [...] properties. The Farnsworth Image Dissector did not suffer from image [...] "stick" [...] of the type Vidicons exhibit, and so related special image converter tubes might be used to capture short frame sequences at very high speed.|$|R

50|$|Caesium is also {{important}} for its photoemissive properties, converting light to electron flow. It is used in photoelectric cells because caesium-based cathodes, such as the intermetallic compound , have a low threshold voltage for emission of electrons. The range of photoemissive devices using caesium include optical character recognition devices, photomultiplier <b>tubes,</b> and video <b>camera</b> <b>tubes.</b> Nevertheless, germanium, rubidium, selenium, silicon, tellurium, and several other elements can be substituted for caesium in photosensitive materials.|$|R
2500|$|In 1926, Hungarian {{engineer}} Kálmán Tihanyi {{designed a}} television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing {{the principle of}} [...] "charge storage" [...] within the scanning (or [...] "camera") tube. The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or [...] "camera" [...] tubes would be solved {{with the introduction of}} charge-storage technology by Kálmán Tihanyi beginning in 1924. His solution was a <b>camera</b> <b>tube</b> that accumulated and stored electrical charges ("photoelectrons") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed [...] "Radioskop". After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930, and so he applied for patents in the United States. Although his breakthrough would be incorporated into the design of RCA's [...] "iconoscope" [...] in 1931, the U.S. patent for Tihanyi's transmitting tube would not be granted until May 1939. The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October. Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval. Charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day.|$|E
