On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative.

5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation is <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E
5|$|A {{report that}} King Charles was very sick sent the Yorks back to England post-haste. They feared the King's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and {{commander}} of England's armed forces, might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence. The matter was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Monmouth enjoyed {{the support of}} the Exclusionists, who held a majority in the House of Commons of England. Charles survived but, feeling the Yorks returned to court too soon, sent James and Mary to Edinburgh, where they stayed on-and-off for the next three years. Lodging in Holyrood Palace, the Yorks had to make do without Ladies Anne and Isabella, who stayed in London on Charles's orders. The Yorks were recalled to London in February 1680, only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn; this time they went on a more honourable footing: James was created King's Commissioner to Scotland. Separated from Lady Isabella once again, Mary sank into a state of sadness, exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion bill in the Commons. Lady Isabella, thus far the only one of Mary's children to survive infancy, died in February 1681. Isabella's death plunged Mary into a religious mania, worrying her physician. At the same time as news reached Holyrood of Isabella's death, Mary's mother was falsely accused of offering £10,000 for the murder of the King. The accuser, a pamphleteer, was executed by order of the King.|$|E
5|$|The bishopric of Dunblane {{was a small}} diocese, {{essentially}} {{confined to}} the earldoms of Strathearn and Menteith. Size was a problem for providing the bishopric with adequate income, a problem <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Gille Brígte, Mormaer of Strathearn, had established Inchaffray Priory in 1200 (promoted to Abbey in 1221). In the 1440s, Bower wrote that Gille Brígte: Divided his earldom into three equal portions. One he gave {{to the church and}} bishop of Dunblane, the second to St John the Evangelist and the canons of Inchaffray, the third he kept for himself and his own needs. If this were not enough, much of the income not granted to Inchaffray had since been given to other religious institutions; some revenue was even controlled by the Bishop of Dunkeld. Dunblane had its origins in an older Gaelic monastic establishment, that is, in an institution with an abbot-bishop heading a relatively informal establishment of smaller cells with little geographical compactness. Dunblane emerged as a bishopric in 1155, probably, like bishoprics with a similar history (e.g. Brechin), having changed in little more than name. There was a community of Céli Dé at Muthill until at least the end of the 13th century, and the base for the archdeaconry of the diocese appears to have varied between there and Dunblane until the time of Bishop Clement. The bishopric itself appears to have been without a single base, although it was probably associated with both locations.|$|E

They showed no cytotoxic effects and the majority were predicted as CNS-permeable compounds. In human neuroblastoma cells they displayed good neuroprotective properties against mitochondrial oxidative stress which, in many cases, almost reached the full protection (> 90 %) when compounds were incubated with cells 24 h before the addition of toxic stressors. In co-incubation conditions these figures were smaller, although some compounds maintained an interesting level of neuroprotection, higher than 50 %. Four selected compounds (2, 5, 8, and 11) {{were found to be}} effective antioxidant agents by sequestering mitochondrial radical oxygen species (ROS).

40|$|Cationic {{surfactants}} {{are being}} used in many applications in industrial manufacture and medical technologies. Pyridinium salts come {{under the category of}} cationic surfactants. Surfactants have two distinct regions in their chemical structure, one of which is water-linking or hydrophilic and the other of which water-avoiding or hydrophobic. These molecules are referred to as amphiphilic or amiphipathic molecules or simply as surfactants or surface active agents. Depending on their charge the characteristics of the surface-active molecules may be anionic, cationic, zwitterionic (ampholytic) or non-ionic. These surfactants are used less for their wetting abilities than for their pronounced germicidal properties and their ability to adsorb on the surface of skin, hair, and fabrics. The cationic surfactants represent a broad family of commercial compounds whose position has been raised from specialty chemicals to bulk industrial chemicals, which {{are being used}} as antistatic agents, corrosion inhibitors, textile softeners, foam depressants, flotation chemicals, asphalt, and petroleum additives. These kind of cationic surfactants are a class of compounds having at least one hydrophobic group attached directly or indirectly to a positively charged nitrogen atom. Surfactants can be unsaturated heterocyclic compounds having different functional group present either on pyridine ring or at nitrogen atom. ^ This research focuses on the design and synthesis of new amphiphilic molecules having a lipid hydrophobic chain and a hydrophilic head and an ability to bind transition metals via directional coordination bonds. The ability for surfactants to bind metals confer many self-assembly properties to these materials. For example, in Chapter 2, we demonstrate that Silver (I) ions direct the self-assembly of the new surfactants into single-molecule nanoscale micelles. In addition, in Chapter 3, we demonstrate a novel methodology towards 4 -aminopyridinum surfactants, these are quaternary pyridinium <b>compounds</b> characterized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that contain a hydrophobic part and are linked to the charged head group. ...|$|R

High levels of female illiteracy and a strong sense of traditionalism in many rural areas further compound these challenges. Despite educational campaigns undertaken by various governmental and non-governmental actors (often supported by donor nations such as EU member states), levels of awareness about the reforms remain low, especially in many rural areas, where misinformation about the details of the changes has often filled the knowledge gap. Many supporters of the reforms believe that lack of awareness of the law is the primary barrier to its implementation, with a lack of legal literacy <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that many Moroccans speak a Berber dialect rather than the formal Arabic in which the law is actually written.|$|E
40|$|It is not {{news that}} {{medicine}} {{and other health}} care areas are changing. In recent years, physicians have been confronted with the challenge of the exponential increase in medical knowledge, as approximately two million articles are published annually in close to 23, 000 biomedical journals. It is estimated that a general physician has to read 19 articles a day for 365 days each year to keep abreast with his field. 1 The challenge is <b>compounded</b> further <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that much of the published knowledge is of controversial value. That paradox set the way for the foundation of the recent concepts of evidence-based medicine (EBM). This has been defined by David L. Sackett, a founder of the EBM movement, as “the judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. ” 2 In a recently published article in the Annals of Saudi Medicine, Stewart elegantly introduced the readers to the new approach. 3 This editorial is intended to provide practical guidance for practicing physicians, physicians primarily involved in academic medicine, and also for health care policymakers in how to apply EBM. Searching for evidence traditionally takes the following steps: 1) precisely formulating the question; 2) designing a search strategy; 3) identifying search resources; 4) critically appraising search results; 5) refining the search if dictated; and 6) applying the findings and making a decision about an individual patient or a medical controversy.

5000|$|Part of the puzzlement here {{is because}} of the {{limitations}} of imagination: influenced by his Princeton colleague, Saul Kripke, Nagel believes that any type identity statement that identified a physical state type with a mental state type would be, if true, necessarily true. But Kripke argues that one can easily imagine a situation where, for example, one's C-fibres are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair. (A parallel argument does not hold for genuine theoretical identities.) This argument that there will always be an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is <b>compounded,</b> Nagel argues, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that imagination operates in two distinct ways. When asked to imagine sensorily, one imagines C-fibres being stimulated; if asked to imagine sympathetically, one puts oneself in a conscious state resembling pain. These two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap, {{whether or not this is}} the case.

40|$|AbstractUnderivatized and permethylated gangliosides {{have been}} studied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} (MALD) ionization technique. The samples investigated included commercially available and highly purified gangliosides from the human brain containing up to five sialic acid residues. Several permethylated gangliosides have also been studied, and MALD has proven successful in analyzing multicomponent mixtures of glycolipids with different fatty acyl residues. During the studies a variety of matrix and wavelength combinations have been tested in both {{the positive and negative}} ion modes. The best results have been obtained with the matrices 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydrazinobenzoic acid, 1, 5 -diaminonaphthalene, and 6 -aza- 2 -thiothymine. Negative ion mass spectra of the underivatized gangliosides have always been of better quality than the positive ion mass spectra, exhibiting better signal-to-noise ratio, better resolution, less fragmentation, and less adduct formation with Na+ and K+. With increasing number of sialic acid substituents the molecular ion region became less and less resolvable, leading to broadened peaks even in the negative ion mode. Fragmentation could frequently be observed in the negative ion mode, and it was pronounced in the positive ion mode. The major fragmentation pathways corresponded to loss of sialyl group(s) and to decarboxylation of one of the sialyl residues. For underivatized gangliosides the typical sample amount used was 10 – 20 pmol. Permethylation led to a significant improvement in sensitivity (two orders of magnitude); the detection limit of permethylated gangliosides was about 10 fmol. The higher stability of the permethylated <b>compounds</b> was indicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that positive ion mass spectra exhibited only a marginal extent of fragmentation...|$|R

25|$|The Bengal {{soil profile}} {{impacted}} the famine in two ways. First, {{the soil in}} eastern Bengal, in combination with abundant irrigation from monsoon rains, was unique {{for its ability to}} grow large amounts of high quality jute. This gave Bengal an effective monopoly on a cash crop. Jute of lesser quality was grown in smaller quantities in western Bengal, but eastern Bengal was the clear-cut center of jute production. During the famine, jute-producing districts suffered higher mortality rates. Second, the sandy soil of eastern Bengal and the lighter sedimentary soil of the Sunderbans tended to drain more rapidly after the monsoon season than the laterite or heavy clay regions of western Bengal. As a rule, malaria epidemics lasted approximately one month longer in the areas with slower drainage. This problem was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that soil exhaustion created the need for large tracts in western and central Bengal to be left fallow; eastern Bengal had far fewer fallow fields. Flooded fallow fields are one key breeding place for malaria carrying mosquitoes, which was the biggest killer during the famine.|$|E

Several doubtful stories of cannibalism entered the chronicle records. as well as routine enslavings and killings of churchmen, women and infants. Henry of Huntingdon wrote that the Scots: “cleft open pregnant women, {{and took out the}} unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery”. By February, King Stephen had mustered an army which marched north to deal with David. The two armies avoided each other, and Stephen was soon on the road back into the south. In the summer, David split his army into two forces, sending William fitz Duncan to march into Lancashire, where he harried Furness and Craven. On 10 June, William fitz Duncan was met by force of knights and men-at-arms. A pitched battle took place, the battle of Clitheroe, and the result was that the English army was routed.|$|R
40|$|In {{the era of}} globalization, {{countries}} {{compete with}} each other for attention, respect and trust of potential consumers, investors, tourists, media and governments of other nations. Branding is the most powerful tool that a nation can utilize for effective differentiation strategies and for creating competitive advantage over other nations. Unfortunately, not every nations or destination marketers have a broad understanding of the concept of branding and how a country can be successfully branded. Hence, this study has proposed a model that {{could be used as a}} valuable guide for country branding. Also the model is recommended for countries struggling with image crisis; on the mission to improve the image internationally. Nigeria is a good example of countries with image crisis; it is one of the most populated countries in the world with a population of about 160 million inhabitants and growth rate of 2. 553 percent annually. Despite the abundant resources (e. g. coal, petroleum, natural gas etc.) that the nation is endowed with, it is quite disappointing that the population below poverty line is still at the alarming rate of 70 percent of the total population. The mismanagement and poor leadership of <b>the</b> nation characterised <b>by</b> corruption, fraud, embezzlement of public fund etc. has culminated into serious image crisis that is slowing down the potential for investment and economic growth. However, there has been series of image rebranding campaigns but no tangible achievement has been recorded. It is quite questionable though, if image rebranding will provide the kind of future that Nigeria envisaged, considering the socio-political situation and <b>the</b> economic imbalance; <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> obvious <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> nation has no known brand. Therefore, this paper argues that there is need to redirect the effort invested on image rebranding to the creation of a unique and competitive brand for the country. It was established from the study that a nation’s brand is capable of improving the reputation of the nation as well as stimulate the expectation of the target audience. However, it was also established from the study that a wrong approach to branding could mislead the target audience and attract negative publicity. Hence, as a contribution of the study to the field of branding, a model was proposed as a functional guide for country branding. Also, considering the abysmal performance of Nigeria’s image in the international community and to strengthen the argument that brand creation is required for the country; an experimental application of the proposed model was conducted using Nigeria as the case country. The first phase of the model suggested a major improvement in the society; this is required to further enhance the strengths of the country and to motivate the much needed community participation and confidence in the brand creation. It is the conclusion of the study that a strong nation brand can offset the image problem if it is built on something concrete, genuine, and uniquely identifiable with the country, capable of connecting to the cognitive psychology of the target audience...|$|R
50|$|After these exploits, he {{is given}} command of HMS Sutherland, a seventy-four gun ship of the line. His {{feelings}} are disturbed {{during this period}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that his commander, Admiral Leighton, has recently married Lady Barbara, thereby apparently ending any hope that she and Hornblower might act on their feelings for one another. Hornblower is tormented by jealousy of Leighton, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> admiral's dismissive treatment of him; this treatment is due in fact to Leighton's rightly suspecting his wife's attraction to the famous captain, and feelings of inferiority towards Hornblower, but naturally the self-doubting captain is incapable of realizing this.|$|R
