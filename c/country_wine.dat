25|$|The wine {{regions in}} Germany usually {{referred}} to are the 13 defined regions for quality wine. The German wine industry has organised itself around these regions and their division into districts. However, {{there are also}} a number of regions for the seldom-exported table wine (Tafelwein) and <b>country</b> <b>wine</b> (Landwein) categories. Those regions with a few exceptions overlap with the quality wine regions. To make a clear distinction between the quality levels, the regions and subregions for different quality level have different names on purpose, even when they are allowed to be produced in the same geographical area.|$|E
25|$|Chickpea {{cultivation}} {{dates back}} to the Bronze Age (3300 – 1200 BCE) and grapes and olives became important crops in the hill <b>country.</b> <b>Wine</b> and oil were traded for wheat with the cities on the coastal plain, and for meat and skins with semi-nomadic herders. Wine and carobs were also exported to Egypt during this period. At Arad in the northern Negev, the remains of wheat, barley and legumes have been found, along with stone lined storage pits for grain from this period. Pottery was imported from Cyprus and Mycenae in Greece for the first time, probably for use as good quality tableware. After the Bronze Age collapse of urban culture, there was an increase in herding and the disappearance of smaller agricultural communities.|$|E

25|$|The Cistercian monks {{set about}} proﬁtably using {{the land they}} had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and {{versatile}} way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting of vines {{on the slopes of}} the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of orchards, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe-making, the setting-up of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, grain growing, timber rafting and ﬁshing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the Köppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep slope vineyards between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the Middle Ages, the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad Kösen and Roßbach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in wine making, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (<b>country</b> <b>wine,</b> around 1340).|$|E
2500|$|The {{communities}} in Greater Austin hold many annual events. In Austin {{two of the}} most well known festivals are the South by Southwest Music and Film Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival, which draw artists and spectators from around the world. [...] Many other Austin festivals take place including the Old Pecan Street Festival, Blues on the Green, and the Laguna Gloria Art Museum Fiesta. The Texas Hill <b>Country</b> <b>Wine</b> and Food Festival is centered in Austin but takes place at restaurants and venues in multiple communities.|$|E
2500|$|Wines {{from other}} fruits, such as apples and berries, are usually {{named after the}} fruit from which they are {{produced}} combined with the word [...] "wine" [...] (for example, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine or <b>country</b> <b>wine</b> (not {{to be confused with}} the French term vin de pays). Other than the grape varieties traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either sufficient fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably one of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent by far than other types, and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined to regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons.|$|E

60|$|Making his way {{round to}} the back of the houses, he {{approached}} one of the cottages in the rear. He lifted the latch of the door and opened it a little. All was still. With his drawn sword he entered. The room was empty; a fire burned on the hearth, and on the table were some loaves which had evidently been just baked. Malcolm fell upon one of them and speedily devoured it, and, taking a long draught of rough <b>country</b> <b>wine</b> from a skin hanging against the wall, he felt another man.|$|E
60|$|These {{are things}} that I recall with interest; but what my memory dwells upon the most, I have been all this while withholding. It was a sport {{peculiar}} to the place, and indeed to {{a week or so}} of our two months' holiday there. Maybe it still flourishes in its native spot; for boys and their pastimes are swayed by periodic forces inscrutable to man; so that tops and marbles reappear in their due season, regular like the sun and moon; and the harmless art of knucklebones has seen the fall of the Roman empire {{and the rise of the}} United States. It may still flourish in its native spot, but nowhere else, I am persuaded; for I tried myself to introduce it on Tweedside, and was defeated lamentably; its charm being quite local, like a <b>country</b> <b>wine</b> that cannot be exported.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{there are}} {{numerous}} wine regions in Hungary, producing quality and inexpensive wines as well, comparable to Western European ones.

6000|$|The trussing, {{for which}} the demipique saddle of the day afforded {{particular}} facility, is alluded to in the text; and the author, among other nickcnacks of antiquity, possesses a leathern flask, like those carried by sportsmen, which is labelled, [...] "King James's Hunting Bottle," [...] with what authenticity is uncertain. Coke seems to have exaggerated the King's taste for the bottle. Welldon says James was not intemperate in his drinking; [...] "However, in his old age, Buckingham's jovial suppers, when he had any turn to do with him, made him sometimes overtaken, which he would the next day remember, and repent with tears. It is true he drank very often, which was rather out of a custom than any delight; and his drinks were of that kind for strength, as Frontiniack, Canary, high <b>country</b> <b>wine,</b> tent wine, and Scottish ale, that had he not {{had a very strong}} brain, he might have been daily overtaken, though he seldom drank at any one time above four spoonfuls, many times not above one or two."--Secret History of King James, vol. ii., p. 3.

60|$|Within {{seventeen}} hours I had {{got them}} all aboard the Cape boat, {{and had seen}} the women safely collapsed into sea-sickness. The next few weeks were for me, as for the invalids, a low delirium, clouded with fantastic memories of Portuguese officials trying to tax calves'-foot jelly; voluble doctors insisting that true typhoid was unknown in the island; nurses {{who had to be}} exercised, taken out of themselves, and returned on the tick of change of guard; night slides down glassy, cobbled streets, smelling of sewage and flowers, between walls whose every stone and patch Attley and I knew; vigils in stucco verandahs, watching the curve and descent of great stars or drawing auguries from the break of dawn; insane interludes of gambling at the local Casino, where we won heaps of unconsoling silver; blasts of steamers arriving and departing in the roads; help offered by total strangers, grabbed at or thrust aside; the long nightmare crumbling back into sanity one forenoon under a vine-covered trellis, where Attley sat hugging a nurse, while the others danced a noiseless, neat-footed breakdown never learned at the Middlesex Hospital. At last, as the tension came out all over us in aches and tingles that we put down to the <b>country</b> <b>wine,</b> a vision of Mrs. Godfrey, her grey hair turned to spun-glass, but her eyes triumphant over the shadow of retreating death beneath them, with Milly, enormously grown, and clutching life back to her young breast, both stretched out on cane chairs, clamouring for food.|$|E
6000|$|In {{other ways}} I was content with my position. It seemed no disgrace to be confounded with my company; for I {{may as well}} declare at once I found their manners as gentle and {{becoming}} as those of any other class. I do not mean that my friends could have sat down without embarrassment and laughable disaster at the table of a duke. That does not imply an inferiority of breeding, but a difference of usage. Thus I flatter myself that I conducted myself well among my fellow-passengers; yet my most ambitious hope is not to have avoided faults, but to have committed as few as possible. I know too well that my tact {{is not the same}} as their tact, and that my habit of a different society constituted, not only no qualification, but a positive disability to move easily and becomingly in this. When Jones complimented me--because I [...] "managed to behave very pleasantly" [...] to my fellow-passengers, was how he put it--I could follow the thought in his mind, and knew his compliment to be such as we pay foreigners on their proficiency in English. I dare say this praise was given me immediately on the back of some unpardonable solecism, which had led him to review my conduct as a whole. We are all ready to laugh at the ploughman among lords; we should consider also the case of a lord among the ploughmen. I have seen a lawyer in the house of a Hebridean fisherman; and I know, but nothing will induce me to disclose, which of these two was the better gentleman. Some of our finest behaviour, though it looks well enough from the boxes, may seem even brutal to the gallery. We boast too often manners that are parochial rather than universal; that, like a <b>country</b> <b>wine,</b> will not bear transportation for a hundred miles, nor from the parlour to the kitchen. To be a gentleman is to be one all the world over, and in every relation and grade of society. It is a high calling, to which a man must first be born, and then devote himself for life. And, unhappily, the manners of a certain so-called upper grade have a kind of currency, and meet with a certain external acceptation throughout all the others, and this tends to keep us well satisfied with slight acquirements and the amateurish accomplishments of a clique. But manners, like art, should be human and central.|$|E
