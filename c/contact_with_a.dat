5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} the Temple must be {{affiliated}} with a pylon, and thus membership is by application, requiring <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Setian priestess or priest followed by an evaluation period. The participation of non-initiated in the Temple's rituals are forbidden, due {{to the belief that}} their rituals would be dangerous in the wrong hands.|$|E
5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E

5|$|Cranmer's first <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Continental {{reformer}} {{was with}} Simon Grynaeus, a humanist based in Basel, Switzerland, and {{a follower of}} the Swiss reformers, Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius. In the summer of 1531, Grynaeus took an extended visit to England to offer himself as an intermediary between the king and the Continental reformers. He struck up a friendship with Cranmer and after his return to Basel, he wrote about Cranmer to the German reformer Martin Bucer in Strasbourg. Grynaeus' early contacts initiated Cranmer's eventual relationship with the Strasbourg and Swiss reformers.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, Chaoyong and Yangwei {{continued}} to operate together.

During the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Chaoyong remained with the fleet and was supporting troop transports when they made <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Japanese fleet on the morning of 17 September.|$|E
5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light comes in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near {{the area of}} histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} histamine.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gate.|$|E

5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these come into <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rooting medium.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{bacteria}} {{that cause the}} disease can be spread by both direct and indirect <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> affected person's eyes or nose. Indirect contact includes through clothing or flies that have come into <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> affected person's eyes or nose. Children spread the disease more often than adults. Poor sanitation, crowded living conditions, and not enough clean water and toilets also increase spread.|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{contacts}} like SININ and SINIS with dielectric barriers I.

The I(V) characteristics are found for the SININ <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> length exceeding the correlation length-xi. It is shown that in <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high transmittance of the SIN interface an excess current I(exc) > 0 appears at high voltages. In <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low transmittance a deficit current I(def) < 0 at high V and a peak in the conductance at low V exist.

5|$|On 31 August boats from Alceste put {{the party}} ashore at Ostia, near Rome, where they made <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{representative}} of the Vatican who agreed {{to speak to the}} Pope but failed to return. When it was deemed necessary to travel to Rome to re-establish contact, the priests refused to go. Maxwell sent them back to Palermo in Acorn, which returned a week later with another volunteer of Drummond's. Landed on the night of 19 September, the envoy was captured and shot as a spy the following day. Consequently, the entire plan was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{recommended}} that the FAA revise the procedures for ATC facilities {{in the area to}} facilitate the process for VFR traffic that wishes to transit Class B airspace. This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct pilots to self-announce on the VFR corridor frequency if they are unable to immediately enter Class B airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding pilots to use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that pilots are provided with traffic advisories if they are in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> controller.|$|E

5|$|There {{are eight}} {{distinct}} call types made by Sunda slow loris adults, {{which can be}} divided into two categories: contact and contact-seeking calls such as whistles and short keckers (a social play and attention-seeking call), and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers, screams, snarls and grunts. Because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators, they do not make alarm calls. Infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed. During estrus, females make whistle calls when in visual <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> male. When exploring new environments and during handling, it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not been in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials {{in the past two decades}} (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube, boron nitride nanomesh).|$|E
