The resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commander-in-chief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of SEATO requesting assistance. Johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary US goal remained the preservation of South Vietnamese independence through material and advice, as opposed to any US offensive posture.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a platform for}} experimental analysis of social gaze in avatar-mediated <b>communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> on two studies demonstrating the person perception effects of varying durations of directed gaze. The avatar platform allows to transmit nonverbal behaviour in real-time and to replace particular components by simulated data. Study 1, conducted with gender homogeneous female dyads, used two variations of directed gaze (2 vs. 4 seconds). Consistent with the literature the longer gaze duration was found to cause significantly better evaluations of the interaction partner {{and higher levels of}} co-presence. Study 2, conducted with mixed-sex dyads, included two more variations of gaze duration (8 and 16 seconds). Prior effects in evaluation and co-presence could not be reproduced. However significant effects occurred with respect to the attribution of personality traits. These effects were nonlinear. Consistent with the literature female observers responded more sensitively to the gaze variations of the male partners...|$|E
40|$|The current asylum and {{migration}} debate in the European Union is distinguished by the growing importance of somehow integrating asylum {{and migration}} issues into the Union's relations with third countries. The external dimension of {{asylum and migration}} policy is more than ever salient and is gradually leaving the stage of declarations of intent. Now work is being made of the implementation and the financial implications of this new policy area. However, {{this seems to be}} quite problematic. The difficulty-as well as the challenge-lies in the fact that coordination of asylum and migration policy and the Union's external affairs is inherently cross-pillar. To start with, this paper will briefly sketch the emergence and evolution of the external dimension of EU asylum and migration policy by means of an overview of the programs of the consecutive EU Presidencies, the <b>Communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>Reports</b> from the Commission and the Conclusions of the European Councils. Then, based on theories of governance and securitisation, we will outline a theoretical framework that aims at providing an explanation for the emergence of this new policy dimension. Finally, in an attempt to narrow down, four case studies of the external dimension will be introduced: the High-Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration, clauses and agreements on migration management and readmission, cooperation with the Balkans on asylum and migration, and temporary protection of displaced persons in case of a mass influx...|$|E

40|$|To {{track and}} detect {{continuous}} natured objects in wireless sensor networks, {{large number of}} sensor nodes are involved. These continuous objects like bio-chemical diffusions, forest fires, oil spills usually spread over larger area. Phenomena sensing nodes need {{to communicate with each}} other for information exchange and also send sensing information to sink, possibly by passing through many intermediate nodes. The process consumes a lot of communication overhead and waste of sensors scarce energy. In this paper, we proposed an optimized approach to reduce number of <b>communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>report</b> data size to the sink. Sensors locally broadcast their sensing status to one-hop neighbors, and suppress any transmission that contains any trivial data. Intermediate nodes further suppress the report data by applying data aggregation and filtering.
