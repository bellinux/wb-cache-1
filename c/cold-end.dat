40|$|The growing {{popularity}} {{of the use of}} cellular steel beams in composite floors comes {{at the same time as}} an increasing attention to fire safety engineering design. The recommendation for their design in fire limit states remains very primitive and this is due to the lack of general research in this area. A total of six simply-supported and restrained composite cellular floor beams subjected to elevated temperatures, were tested at The University of Ulster. The first three beams conducted were simply-supported of 4. 5 m span lengths, with main variables, different steel geometries and opening shapes. The beams were subjected to single and two point loadings represented by load ratio of 0. 3 determined from the pre-design and finite element modelling of the sections at ambient temperature for the evaluation of the failure loads. Deflections were recorded using linear variable differential transducers (L VDT) during the fire tests, and temperatures were measured using thermocouples located along the length of the steel beams and the composite slabs. The main failure modes in two tests were the web post buckling associated with Vierendeel bending; whereas the latter was the main failure mode in the symmetric composite cellular beam with two elongated web openings. Similar failure modes were observed in the finite element modelling at ambient temperature. The experimental results have been compared against the results obtained by DIANA software for finite element modelling and were in good agreement. The capability of the model demonstrated excellent prediction for the three tests in terms of temperature distribution, deflection behaviour and failure mode after improvements were made to the models. A parametric study has been conducted using the analytical based web-post failure characterized by the failure of the critical section for the evaluation of temperature and time of failure. The results were also compared with the experimental data and were found in good correlation when using the appropriate effective length subjected to buckling, which is different from one beam to another beam. However, it was found that the formula of shear buckling capacity of the web post at elevated temperatures provided in the SCI [22] documentation, which is expressed in terms of longitudinal shear needs to be adjusted in order to predict accurate effective length of post web buckling for cellular beams, with different geometries and cross sectional dimensions. The second phase of fire tests was restrained cellular beams with longer span lengths of 7. 5 m. Different parameters were investigated by varying the depths of composite slabs and shape of steel decking compared to the tests of simply-supported beams. The beams were also pre-designed first at ambient temperature in order to evaluate the failure loading and 0. 3 of this load was considered in the three tests. The finite element modelling at cold temperature showed that the beams considered as simply-supported failed due to flexural bending accompanied with Vierendeel mechanism at different load levels. Similar instruments and equipment have been used as in the tests of simply-supported beams, and the difference is represented by the restraint frame that was positioned around the furnace where the specimens were axially restrained and subjected to heating. In addition, strain gauges were used at different locations in the <b>cold-ends</b> of the cellular beams, top of the slabs and the frame for the measurement of strains. The failure modes in the tests were flexural bending associated with initial stage of Vierendeel bending and the buckling of the web posts. There was no occurrence of lateral buckling as expected due to the low degree of restraint and type of end-condition used. The web post buckling was the main failure mode in composite beam with the smallest depth of composite slab, a sudden change occurred at the last stage when compressive forces changed into tensile force that can lead to the development of catenary action and the occurrence of lateral buckling of the bottom flange. The effect of restraint on cellular beams has been carried out first using finite element mode ling before the fire tests where asymmetric and symmetric composite cellular beams with circular web-openings have been studied under high and low restraint factors at ambient and elevated temperatures. At ambient temperature, the main failure modes were web-posts buckling for both sections in case of low restraint factor as in the case of simply-supported beams; whereas web-posts buckling occurred and followed by lateral torsional buckling in case of high restraint factor. In both sections, compressive forces increase with the increase in loading, and the load-carrying capacity is significant in case of high restraint factor compared to low restraint factor due to high compressive force developed from composite slab and the catenary action allowing the section to experience maximum deflection before failure. At elevated temperature, the web-posts buckling was the main failure mode for a low degree of restraint; whereas, a severe web-posts buckling followed by lateral torsional buckling were the main failure modes for a high restraint factor. The restrained beams tested have been modelled using the model developed and all the data gathered during the tests in terms of temperatures recordings and axial stiffness. The model showed a good correlation with the tests results and was next extended beyond the limit of the experimental fire tests by considering the full fire exposed lengths of the cellular beams; by investigating the influence of different degrees of restraint conditions and depths of composite slabs having different shapes of steel decking.

40|$|A {{major issue}} in {{long-term}} operation of micromachined Joule-Thomson coolers is the clogging of the microchannels and/or the restriction due to the deposition of water molecules present in the working fluid. In this study, we present {{the performance of a}} microcooler operated with nitrogen gas with different moisture levels. Relatively low-purity nitrogen gas (5. 0) is supplied from a gas bottle and led through a filter to control the moisture level. The filter consists of a tube-in-tube counter flow heat exchanger (CFHX) and a heat exchanger that is stabilized at a certain temperature by using a Stirling cooler. The set-point temperature determines the moisture level at the exit of the heat exchanger. It is found that the moisture level has influence on the mass-flow rate during the cool down. Once the microcooler reaches the set <b>cold-end</b> temperature, the main deposition area shifts into the CFHX and the moisture level at the restriction is almost independent on the inlet moisture level of the microcooler. The moisture level at the restriction increases with the increasing <b>cold-end</b> temperature when the <b>cold-end</b> temperature is lower than the saturation temperature of the water in the nitrogen gas.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A resonantly-coupled α-Stirling (RCAS) cooler was {{designed}} and constructed. Tests on air and helium were performed with constant driving displacement over a range of frequencies. The effects of changing driving amplitude and charged pressure were studied. The use of stainless steel bellows in place of pistons eliminated the problem of piston seals and relaxed the construction tolerances. The fatigue life of the bellow is, however, a problem. The experimental optimization based on Taguchi methods was performed on regenerator mass, regenerator wire diameter, vibrating mass, and damping coefficient. Driven by a voice coil actuator, the characteristic phase shift of the Stirling cycle cooler was demonstrated where the hot-end displacement led the <b>cold-end</b> displacement. The 90 ° phase shift {{was selected as the}} natural frequency. The pressure-volume diagrams for each working space were plotted and the indicated powers were determined. The compression powers in the hot and cold-ends show maximum values near the natural frequency. The mechanisms are different. At the hot-end where the displacement was kept constant, operation near the natural frequency gave a maximum pressure ratio and also maximized the compression power. The phase shifts in the <b>cold-end</b> were, however, relatively constant. The maximum pressure ratio and amplitude gave the maximum expansion power near the natural frequency. The expansion powers in the <b>cold-end</b> as indicators of cooling potential were approximately 2 - 4 watts for the air case, and 3 - 7 watts for the helium case. In both air and helium tests, the value of the parasitic losses reached 12 watts. The temperature difference developed across the regenerator is considered an indication of the cooling capacity. Good correlations were found between the indicated cooling capacity in the expansion space and the temperature difference. For a given size of cooler, the use of helium offered higher cooling capacity due to smaller pressure drop loss and smaller amplitude ratio. Higher cooling performance was also attained from helium at elevated pressures...|$|E

40|$|A {{design of}} a highly {{efficient}} and lightweight space magnetic cooler has been developed that can continuously provide remote/distributed cooling at temperatures {{in the range of}} 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K. The innovative design uses a cryogenic circulator that enables the cooler to operate at a high cycle frequency to achieve a large cooling capacity. The ability to provide remote/distributed cooling not only allows flexible integration with a payload and spacecraft, but also reduces the mass of the magnetic shields needed. The active magnetic regenerative refrigerator (AMRR) system is shown in the figure. This design mainly consists of two identical magnetic regenerators surrounded by their superconducting magnets and a reversible circulator. Each regenerator also has a heat exchanger at its warm end to reject the magnetization heat to the heat sink, and the two regenerators share a <b>cold-end</b> heat exchanger to absorb heat from a cooling target. The circulator controls the flow direction, which cycles in concert with the magnetic fields, to facilitate heat transfer. Helium enters the hot end of the demagnetized column, is cooled by the refrigerant, and passes into the <b>cold-end</b> heat exchanger to absorb heat. The helium then enters the cold end of the magnetized column, absorbing heat from the refrigerant, and enters the hot-end heat exchanger to reject the magnetization heat. The efficient heat transfer in the AMRR allows the system to operate at a relatively short cycle period to achieve a large cooling power. The key mechanical components in the magnetic cooler are the reversible circulator and the magnetic regenerators. The circulator uses non-contacting, self-acting gas bearings and clearance seals to achieve long life and vibration- free operation. There are no valves or mechanical wear in this circulator, so the reliability is predicted to be very high. The magnetic regenerator employs a structured bed configuration. The core consists of a stack of thin GGG disks alternating with thin polymer insulating films. The structured bed reduces flow resistance in the regenerator and therefore the pumping work by the cryogenic circulator. This magnetic cooler will enable cryogenic detectors for sensing infrared, x-ray, gamma-ray, and submillimeter radiation in future science satellites, as well as the detector systems in the Constellation-X (Con-X) and the Single Aperture Far-Infrared observatory (SAFIR). Scientific ap p - lica tions for this innovation include cooling for x-ray micro calorimeter spectrometers used for microanalysis, cryogenic particle detectors, and superconducting tunnel junction de tectors for biomolecule mass spectrometry.

A thin-film heat flux sensor was used to directly measure heat input to an ASC. The effort succeeded in designing and fabricating unique sensors, which were integrated into a Stirling convertor ground test and exposed to test temperatures exceeding 700 C in air for 10, 000 hr. Sensor measurements were used to calculate thermal efficiency for ASC-E (Engineering Unit) # 1 and # 4. The post-disassembly condition of the sensors is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{sorption}} compressor cell basically {{consists of}} a container that is filled with an adsorbent. When such a cell is thermally cycled, a pressure difference is created by the subsequent adsorption and desorption of the gas. As a consequence, a single sorption compressor cell inherently provides an intermittent flow. A Joule–Thomson expansion stage requires {{a more or less}} continuous flow. The standard way to obtain a continuous flow out of a sorption compressor is to use three or more compressor cells that are operated out of phase. This paper presents an alternative compressor concept that uses only one compressor cell, two buffer volumes and two check valves. Such a compressor is easier to construct and to operate and has a higher reliability at the expense of a slight variation in the cooler’s <b>cold-end</b> temperature. The principle was demonstrated using a sorption compressor cell that is filled with Maxsorb [The Kansai Coke & Chemicals Co. Ltd., 1 - 1 Oh-Hama, Amagasaki, Japan 660] activated carbon, is equipped with a gas-gap heat switch, and uses xenon as the working fluid. A flow of 0. 52 mg/s was achieved with a low pressure of 1. 39 bar and a high pressure of 17. 0 bar, giving a theoretical cooling power of 42 mW at 172 K. A sensitivity analysis on several control parameters has been performed experimentally. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{fission reactor}} {{combined}} with a free-piston Stirling convertor {{is one of many}} credible approaches for producing electrical power in space applications. This study assumes dual-opposed free-piston Stirling engines/linear alternators that will operate nominally at 825 K hot-end and 425 K <b>cold-end</b> temperatures. The baseline design options, temperature profiles, and materials of construction discussed here are based on historical designs as well as modern convertors operating at lower power levels. This notional design indicates convertors primarily made of metallic components that experience minimal change in mechanical properties for fast neutron fluences less than 10 (sup 20) neutrons per square centimeter. However, these radiation effects can impact the magnetic and electrical properties of metals at much lower fluences than are crucial for mechanical property integrity. Moreover, a variety of polymeric materials are also used in common free-piston Stirling designs for bonding, seals, lubrication, insulation and others. Polymers can be affected adversely by radiation doses as low as 10 (sup 5) - 10 (sup 10) rad. Additionally, the absorbing dose rate, radiation hardness, and the resulting effect (either hardening or softening) varies depending {{on the nature of the}} particular polymer. The classes of polymers currently used in convertor fabrication are discussed along possible substitution options. Thus, the materials of construction of prototypic Stirling convertor engines have been considered and the component materials susceptible to damage at the lowest neutron fluences have been identified...|$|E
40|$|A pair of helical {{coils of}} the large helical device is the largest pool-cooled superconducting magnet. The first {{excitation}} test up to 1. 5 T was carried {{out at the end}} of March, 1998. In the first trial to charge up to the design value of 3 T, wide propagation of a normal-zone was induced at 11. 45 kA, and the quench detection system acted. It was revealed that a normal-zone could propagate below the <b>cold-end</b> recovery current by additional heat generation due to the slow current diffusion into the thick pure aluminum stabilizer. In these six years 2 ̆ 7 operation, propagation of a normal-zone has been observed 17 times at almost the same current. The normal-zones were recovered within several seconds except for the wide propagation. By a detection system of the propagation with pick-up coils along the helical coils, it was disclosed that the recovered normal-zones propagated in only one side. In order to attain plasma experiments near 3 T, higher excitations were tried by the current grading method, in which the current of the innermost block is decreased and those of the other two blocks are increased. The average current of 11. 67 kA was attained. The excitation tests up to the highest currents have been carried out after each cool-down. Degradation is not observed in the coil performance, and the stable operation has been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{experimental study}} on GM-type pulse tube refrigerator (PTR). In a PTR, the pulse tube is only filled with working gas and there exists secondary flow {{due to a}} large temperature difference between <b>cold-end</b> and warm-end. The stability of secondary flow is affected by orientation of cold-head and thus, the cooling performance is deteriorated by gas mixing due to secondary flow. In this study, a single stage GM-type pulse tube refrigerator is fabricated and tested. The cooing performance of the fabricated PTR is measured as varying cold-head orientation angle {{and the results are}} used as reference data. Then, we divided interior space of pulse tube into three segments, and fixed the various size of screen mesh at interface of each segment to suppress the performance degradation due to secondary flow. For various configuration of pulse tube, no-load test and heat load test are carried out with the fixed experimental condition of charging pressure, operating frequency and orifice valve turns. From experimental results, the fine screen mesh shows the effective suppression of performance degradation for the large orientation angle, but the use of screen mesh cause the loss of cooling capacity rather than the case of no insertion into pulse tube. It should be compromised whether the use of screen mesh in consideration of the installation limitation of a GM-type pulse tube refrigerator...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of antenna systems increases with increasing active area, but decreases at higher noise {{figure of the}} low-noise amplifier (LNA). Cooling the LNA locally results in significant improvement in the gain and in lowering the noise figure of the LNA. Micromachined Joule-Thomson (JT) coolers can provide a cryogenic environment to the LNA. They are attractive {{because they have no}} cold moving parts and can be scaled down to match the size and the power consumption of LNAs. The performance of a LNA mounted on a JT microcooler with dimensions of 60. 0 × 9. 5 × 0. 72 mm 3 is reported in this paper. The microcooler is operated with nitrogen gas and the <b>cold-end</b> temperature is controlled at 115 K. The measured net cooling power of the microcooler is about 43 mW when the LNA is not operating. The power dissipation of the LNA is 26 mW, with a supply voltage of 2 V. At room temperature the noise figure of the LNA is 0. 83 dB and the gain lies between 17. 9 and 13. 1 dB, in the frequency range of 0. 65 and 1. 05 GHz. Upon cooling to 115 K, the noise figure drops to 0. 50 dB and the increase in gain varies in the range of 0. 6 – 1. 5 d...|$|E
