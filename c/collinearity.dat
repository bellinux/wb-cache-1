25|$|In the {{geometries}} {{where the}} concept of a line is a primitive notion, as may be the case in some synthetic geometries, other methods of determining <b>collinearity</b> are needed.|$|E
25|$|The plane {{may also}} {{be viewed as an}} affine space, whose isomorphisms are {{combinations}} of translations and non-singular linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but <b>collinearity</b> and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Edward B. Lewis (B.S. '39) {{received}} the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for {{discovery of the}} <b>collinearity</b> principle in fruit flies, which revealed that the linear arrangement of genes on a chromosome corresponds {{to the development of}} body segments. The finding was later confirmed in humans.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years, ACAR was mainly used to {{investigate}} the physics of the electron-positron annihilation process. In the 1930s several annihilation mechanism were discussed. Otto Klemperer could show with his angular correlation setup that the electron-positron pairs annihilate mainly into two gamma quanta which are emitted anti-parallel. In the 1950s, it was realized that by measuring the deviation from <b>collinearity</b> of the annihilation radiation information about the electronic structure of a solid can be obtained.|$|E
500|$|Lemoine {{has been}} {{described}} by Nathan Altshiller Court as a co-founder (along with Henri Brocard and Joseph Neuberg) of modern triangle geometry, a term used by William Gallatly, among others. In this context, [...] "modern" [...] is used to refer to geometry developed from the late 18th century onward. Such geometry relies on the abstraction of figures in the plane rather than analytic methods used earlier involving specific angle measures and distances. The geometry focuses on topics such as <b>collinearity,</b> concurrency, and concyclicity, as they do not involve the measures listed previously.|$|E

40|$|This paper clarifies the {{invariance}} {{issue of}} deletion choice arising in singular systems of linear regression equations, where the singularity {{is caused by}} exact linear restrictions on the endogenous variables, adding-up to a predetermined aggregate. In a quite general context allowing for additional exogenous restrictions, <b>collinearities</b> and generalized adding-up, we propose an estimator which circumvents the need for generalized inverses...|$|R

2500|$|The {{concept of}} line generalizes to planes and higher-dimensional {{subspace}}s. A subspace, AB…XY may thus be recursively {{defined in terms}} of the subspace AB…X as that containing all the points of all lines YZ, as Z ranges over AB…X. <b>Collinearity</b> then generalizes to the relation of [...] "independence". A set {A, B, …, Z} of points is independent, [...] if {A, B, …, Z} is a minimal generating subset for the subspace AB…Z.|$|E
2500|$|Angular [...] Correlation of Electron Positron Annihilation Radiation (ACAR or ACPAR) is a {{technique}} of solid state physics to investigate the electronic structure of metals. It uses positrons which are implanted into a sample and annihilate with the electrons. In the majority of annihilation events, two gamma quanta are created that are, in the reference frame of the electron-positron pair, emitted in exactly opposite directions. In the laboratory frame, {{there is a small}} angular deviation from <b>collinearity,</b> which is caused by the momentum of the electron. Hence, measuring the angular correlation of the annihilation radiation yields information about the momentum distribution of the electrons in the solid.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{which is}} a combination of 2 basic steps, principal component method and multidimensional mapping (PCMM) is described. The method minimizes <b>collinearities</b> and still yields test series of sufficient high data variance. The variance coeff. VS and the determinant of the correlation matrix DS were used. The method was applied to a series of monosubstitutions and the results compared well with other QSAR methods as tools to rationalize drug design...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} any bounded zero-angular {{momentum}} {{solution for the}} Newtonian three-body problem must suffer infinitely many eclipses, or <b>collinearities,</b> provided {{that it does not}} suffer a triple collision. Motivation for the result comes from the dream of building a symbolic dynamics for the three-body problem, one whose symbols 1, 2, 3 representing the three types of eclipses. The proof involves the conformal geometry of the shape sphere. Comment: 14 pages. See also [URL]...|$|R

We {{show how the}} red and green `Euler lines' and `nine-point circles' of a triangle interact with the usual blue ones, and how the three orthocenters form an associated triangle with interesting <b>collinearities.</b> This is developed {{in the framework of}} rational trigonometry using quadrance and spread instead of distance and angle. The former are more suitable for relativistic geometries. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures (colour...|$|R
2500|$|When a {{positron}} is implanted into a solid it {{will quickly}} lose all its kinetic energy and annihilate with an electron. By this process two gamma quanta with [...] each are created {{which are in}} the reference frame of the electron positron pair emitted in exactly anti-parallel directions. In the laboratory frame, however, there is a Doppler shift from [...] and an angular deviation from <b>collinearity.</b> Although the full momentum information about {{the momentum of the}} electron is encoded in the annihilation radiation, due to technical limitations it cannot be fully recovered. Either one measures the Doppler broadening of the [...] annihilation radiation (DBAR) or the angular correlation of the annihilation radiation (ACAR).|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} lateral <b>collinearity</b> expands on this {{traditional}} view, and refers to <b>collinearity</b> between explanatory and criteria (i.e., explained) variables.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{to define}} a {{distance}} again uses a graph-theoretic notion in a related structure, this time the <b>collinearity</b> graph of the incidence structure. The vertices of the <b>collinearity</b> graph are the points of the incidence structure and two points are joined if there exists a line incident with both points. The distance between two points of the incidence structure can then be defined as their distance in the <b>collinearity</b> graph.|$|E
40|$|Near <b>collinearities</b> among explicative {{variables}} in a regression model have unwanted {{effects on the}} least squares estimator. They inflate the variances of least squares regression coefficient estimates and introduce a lack of fiability for this estimator. In this paper, we define precisely the notion of multicollinearity, then we show why a minimax shrinkage estimator cannot bring any significant improvement over the LSE in the estimation of the components responsible for multicollinearity. In the last part, we propose a generalization of the principal components estimators which performs rather well in a bounded neighborhood of 0. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a well-justified {{synthetic}} approach of the projective space. We define the concepts of plane and space of incidence and also the Gallucci's axiom as an axiom to our classical projective space. To this purpose we prove from our space axioms, the theorems of Desargues, Pappus, the fundamental theorem of projectivities, and the fundamental theorem of central-axial <b>collinearities,</b> respectively.

40|$|We give a {{complete}} symbolic dynamics {{description of the}} dynamics of Euler's problem of two fixed centers. By analogy with the 3 -body problem we use the <b>collinearities</b> (or syzygies) of the three bodies as symbols. We show that motion without collision on regular tori of the regularised integrable system are given by so called Sturmian sequences. Sturmian sequences were introduced by Morse and Hedlund in 1940. Our main theorem is that the periodic Sturmian sequences are in one to one correspondence with the periodic orbits of the two center problem. Similarly, finite Sturmian sequences correspond to collision-collision orbits. Comment: 28 pages, 16 figure...|$|R
40|$|Regression {{analysis}} {{has been applied}} to examine the structure-toxicity relationships regarding the acute toxicity to various freshwater and estuarine organisms (fish, algae, crustacea, bacteria) for a series of substituted aromatic compounds. Linear relationships between the toxicity and the log P sub ow partition coefficient have been obtained for nonreactive chemicals. Increased partitioning into lipophilic phases of the biosystem enhances the toxic effect. The structure-toxicity relationships are evaluated with regard to species differences. Multivariate procedures reveal <b>collinearities</b> in the response of several aquatic organisms to aromatic compounds. Analysis of interspecies correlations demonstrates coinciding toxicity ranking with different aquatic test systems for chemicals acting by a uniform mode of action...|$|R

40|$|A new {{transformation}} is proposed that gives orthogonal compo-nents with a one-to-one {{correspondence between the}} original vectors and the components. The aim is that each component should {{be close to the}} vector with which it is paired, orthogonality imposing a con-straint. If the vectors have been normalized, then the transformation minimizes the sum of the squared correlations between each vector and its associated component. The transformation has a strong dilu-tion property: duplicating a vector, perhaps several times, has no ef-fect on the orthogonal components that correspond to non-duplicated vectors. Properties of the transformation give it varied uses, notably as a diagnostic tool for identifying <b>collinearities</b> and as a method of choosing Bayesian prior weights for model averaging. These applica-tions are described and we also discuss regression and experimental design, broader contexts in which the transformation should prove useful. 1. Introduction. Suppos...|$|R
40|$|Two transformations are {{proposed}} that give orthogonal components with a one-to-one {{correspondence between the}} original vectors and the components. The aim is that each component should {{be close to the}} vector with which it is paired, orthogonality imposing a constraint. The transformations lead to a variety of new statistical methods, including a unified approach to the identification and diagnosis of <b>collinearities,</b> a method of setting prior weights for Bayesian model averaging, and a means of calculating an upper bound for a multivariate Chebychev inequality. One transformation has the property that duplicating a vector has no effect on the orthogonal components that correspond to nonduplicated vectors, and is determined using a new algorithm that also provides the decomposition of a positive-definite matrix in terms of a diagonal matrix and a correlation matrix. The algorithm is shown to converge to a global optimum...|$|R
