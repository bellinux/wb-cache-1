40|$|Malabsorption {{syndrome}} is usually {{defined as the}} complex of symptoms secondary to maldigestion and/or malabsorption, realizing when {{the extension of the}} disease exceeds the ability of intestine compensation. Several conditions have been recognized as being responsible for this syndrome. Up to now, different criteria have been used to order them, but a definitive classification is still not available because of the complexity of the absorption process, the involvement of different organs and structures, and the coexistence of different mechanisms in some diseases causing malabsorption. We propose a new classification of diseases causing malabsorption syndrome according to the responsible etiopathogenetic mechanisms: (a) alteration of digestive processes; (b) alteration of uptake and transport caused by damage or reduction of absorption surface, and (<b>c)</b> <b>miscellaneous.</b> A comment about the mechanisms responsible for malabsorption is given for all the cited diseases. 2008 S.

40|$|Zymomonas mobilis is {{a unique}} {{microorganism}} in being both obligately fermentative and utilizing a Entner-Doudoroff pathway for glycolysis. Glycolytic flux in this organism is readily measured as evolved carbon dioxide, ethanol, or glucose consumed and exceeds 1 {micro}mole glucose/min per mg cell protein. To support this rapid glycolysis, approximately 50 % of cytoplasmic protein {{is devoted to the}} 13 glycolytic and fermentative enzymes which constitute this central catabolic pathway. Only 1 ATP (net) is produced from each glucose metabolized. During the past grant period, we have completed the characterization of 11 of the 13 glycolytic genes from Z. mobilis together with complementary but separate DOE-fimded research by a former post-dot and collaborator, Dr. Tyrrell Conway.

40|$|The need {{to prepare}} financially for {{retirement}} is clear as individuals live longer and increasingly take early retirement. In 1900, life expectancy at birth was 47 years; in 1993, it was 76 years. For those who reach age 65, average life expectancy of men {{is expected to rise}} from a current 81 years to 85 in 2040; for women, it's 85 and 88 ("The economics of aging, " 1994). Average age of retirement declined throughout the 1980 s and is now 62. One-third of all household heads currently leave their primary job before age 55 and one-half retire before reaching 60 (Ruhm, 1989). Those without pensions or sizable personal assets are likely to remain in the labor force longer than those with more resources (Bennett, 1994).

40|$|Gymnastics is an {{activity}} of ancient origins and modern tensions. Most large and medium size {{cities and towns}} have a private gymnastics school or offer gymnastics activities via a park district, public school, Turners, Sokol, or YMCA.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) among Asian patients and to determine their outcomes with different therapeutic modalities. Patients and Methods: Between 1990 and 2005, 37 patients with PCNSL were analyzed within 5 different treatment groups: radiotherapy alone (arm A), combined chemoradiation (arm B), chemotherapy alone with methotrexate (MTX) &# 8805; 1 g/m 2 (arm <b>C),</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> therapy (arm D), and best supportive care (arm E). Results: The median age at presentation was 59 years, and the majority of patients were male (68). All patients had aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The number of patients in arms A to E were 6, 16, 3, 8 and 4, respectively. The overall median survival was 7. 4 months, 54. 1 months, not reached, 8. 9 months and 0. 9 months, respectively. Use of MTX 1 - 2. 5 g/m 2 per cycle and an ECOG performance status of 0 - 2 were each associated with improved survival on univariate analysis (p = 0. 022 and p = 0. 049, respectively). Compared to radiotherapy alone, use of combined chemo-radiation was associated with a trend towards improved overall median survival (7. 4 vs. 54. 1 months, p = 0. 058). Conclusion: The clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in our Asian patients were comparable to those reported in Western series. Use of MTX 1 - 2. 5 g/m 2 per cycle and an ECOG performance status of 0 - 2 were associated with improved survival...|$|E

40|$|The genus of Marinobacter {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} in the global oceans and assumed to significantly impact various biogeochemical cycles. The genome structure and content of Marinobacter aquaeolei VT 8 was analyzed and compared with those from other organisms with diverse adaptive strategies. Here, we report the many “opportunitrophic” genetic characteristics and strategies that M. aquaeolei has adopted to promote survival under various environmental conditions. Genome analysis revealed its metabolic potential to utilize oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors, iron as an electron donor, and urea, phosphonate, and various hydrocarbons as alternative N, P, and <b>C</b> sources, respectively. <b>Miscellaneous</b> sensory and defense mechanisms, apparently acquired via horizontal gene transfer, are involved in the perception of environmental fluctuations and antibiotic, phage, toxin, and heavy metal resistance, enabling survival under adverse conditions, such as oil-polluted water.

40|$|Aims: The general {{clinical}} {{profile of}} European pacemaker recipients who require predominant ventricular pacing (VP) is scarcely known. We examined the demographic and clinical {{characteristics of the}} 1808 participants (out of 1833 randomized patients) of the ongoing Biventricular Pacing for Atrio-ventricular Block to Prevent Cardiac Desynchronization (BioPace) study. Methods and results: BioPace recruited patients between May 2003 and September 2007 predominantly in European medical centres. We analysed demographic data and described clinical characteristics and electrophysiological parameters prior to device implantation in 1808 enrolled patients. The mean age ± standard deviation (SD) of the 1808 patients was 73. 5 ± 9. 2 years, 1235 (68 %) were men, 654 (36 %) presented without structural heart disease, 547 (30 %) had ischemic, 355 (20 %) hypertensive, 146 (8 %) valvular, and 102 (6 %) non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 55. 4 ± 12. 3 %. The main pacing indications were (a) permanent and intermittent atrioventricular (AV) block in 973 (54 %), (b) atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular rate in 313 (17 %), and (<b>c)</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> bradyarrhythmias in 522 (29 %) patients.

40|$|In 2011, the Philippines ranked 7 th in {{the world}} in fish production. It {{produced}} 4. 97 thousand metric tons of fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and aquatic plants (seaweeds). The Philippines also ranked 11 th in aquaculture production with 1. 22 % of the world s aquaculture production of 62. 7 million metric tons (mt). Aquaculture in the Philippines generally depends on commercially-milled aquafeeds which in 2012 amounted to 61, 846 mt. Aquaculture feed is composed of 24. 3 % fish meal. Fish-by-catch is associated with trash fish. Utilization of trash fish in the country in each segment could be summarized as: (1) for human consumption; (2) for processing of fish sauce; (3) for production of fish meal; and, (4) as direct feed for aquaculture. In 2013, about 15 thousand mt (24. 3 %) of fish meal were used wherein 3. 97 thousand mt is imported while about 11 thousand mt is assumed to come from the local fish meal. The product lines of these plants are tuna and sardines based meal using heads, tails and whole fish rejected from tuna and sardine canneries. Local fish meal has around 50 - 55 % protein content. Due to limited production and high cost of fish meal, the use of alternative feed ingredients for aqua feed sources are being utilized which include: a) legumes; b) Ipil-ipil leaf meal; <b>c)</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> fodder plants, such as the leaves and other aerial parts of papaya, water hyacinth, Ipomea and sweet potato; d) roots and tubers like arrow roots (Maranta arundinacea), sweet potato(Ipomea batatas L.), cassava (Manihot escolenta Crantz), taro (Colocasia esculenta L.), and elephant yam (Amorphophallus campanulatus); e) cereals and cereal by-products like rice bran and maize and f) oil cakes and oil meals. For feeds of animal origin, African snail meal, Giant toad meal, fish silage, feather meal, maggot meal, mussel (tahong) meal, and Superworm, Zophobas morio are identified. To improve the efficiency of feeding, there are three (3) practices being used in the Philippines. These are a) biomass feeding, b) satiation or Ad Libitum, and c) the use of automatic and demand feeder. For organic aquaculture, azolla and lemna (duckweed) are being cultured in separate ponds or in hapas installed within the ponds and feeding is being done by scooping the plants out to feed the fish. In contrast, lab-lab, an association of microbenthic organism is grown in the ponds using organic fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with {{various aspects of}} the {{administrative}} system of Israel and Judah during the monarchic period. Its primary focus is the analysis of the titles and roles of civil officials and functionaries, including key ministers of the central government, regional administrators and palace attendants. The nineteen titles examined fall into three categories: status-related titles; function-related titles; and miscellaneous designations. Group A consists of titles associated with rank, derived from genealogy or membership in a special court circle, that characterizes the office-holders but is not specific to any one particular office. Group B, the largest category, is composed of titles that specify positions {{in the structure of the}} state organization and carry independent status that is not dependent on the personal status of office-holders. Group <b>C</b> encompasses <b>miscellaneous</b> designations that are more general and can be held by a variety of functionaries or describe a personal non-status-related trait. ^ In addition to defining the various civil titles and interpreting their roles in the bureaucracy, other issues, discernable primarily from the epigraphic material, are also evaluated. These include economic components of state-organization such as royal land-grants, supply networks and systems of accounting. The findings provide for a tentative, partial reconstruction of the Israelite governmental structures for different periods. A picture emerges of the major and minor positions that constituted the hierarchal organization, some of the interrelationships between the various officials and the network that connected the central authority to the local administrators. ^ A secondary focus of this inquiry is the assessment of the impact of foreign influence on the Israelite state-organizations. Evidence gleaned from non-Hebrew sources, primarily Akkadian, Ugaritic and Egyptian documents, reveals little concrete material to substantiate theories of modeling after a foreign prototype. Rather, many features of Israelite administration are explained best as basic elements characteristic of any monarchic structure of the ancient Near East that developed to satisfy the needs of an evolving local system. Other, seemingly foreign features have a long tradition in Canaan and probably were naturally assimilated. The process observable in the 2 ̆ 2 Israelitization 2 ̆ 2 of Egyptian hieratic for accounting purposes is revealing in evaluating foreign influence. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Selective {{thoracic}} fusion in type II curve {{has been}} recommended by King et al. since 1983. They suggested that {{care must be}} taken to use the vertebra that is neutral and stable so that the lower level of fusion is centered over the sacrum. Since then there has been the trend to do shorter and selective fusion of the major curve. This study was conducted to find out whether short posterior pedicle instrumentation alone could provide efficient correction and maintain trunk balance comparing to the anterior instrumentation. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was conducted during 2005 - 2007 on 39 consecutive cases with idiopathic scoliosis cases King 2 and 3 (Lenke 1 A, 1 B), 5 <b>C</b> and <b>miscellaneous.</b> Only the major curve was instrumented unless both curves were equally rigid and of the same magnitude. The level of fusion was planned as the end vertebra (EVB) to EVB fusion, although minor adjustment was modified by the surgeons intraoperatively. The most common fusion levels in major thoracic curves were T 6 -T 12, whereas the most common fusion levels in the thoraco-lumbar curves were T 10 -L 3. Fusion was performed from the posterior only approach and the implants utilized were uniformly plate and pedicle screw system. All the patients were followed at least 2 years till skeletal maturity. The correction of the curve were assessed according to type of curve (lenke IA, IB and 5), severity of curve (less than 450, 450 - 890 and more than 900), age at surgery (14 or less and 15 or more) and number of the segment involved in instrumentation (fusion level less than curve, fusion level as of the curve and fusion more than the curve) Results: The average long-term curve correction for the thoracic was 40. 4 &#x 0025; in Lenke 1 A, 52. 2 &#x 0025; in Lenke 1 B and 56. 3 &#x 0025; in Lenke 5. The factors associated with poorer outcome were younger age at surgery (&# 60; 11 years or Risser 0), fusion at wrong levels (shorter than the measured end vertebra) and rigid curve identified by bending study. However, all patients had significant improved trunk balance and coronal hump at the final assessment at maturity. Two patients underwent late extension fusion because of junctional scoliosis. Conclusions: With modern instrumentations, the EVB of the major curve can be used {{at the end of the}} instrumentation in most cases of idiopathic scoliosis. In those cases with either severe trunk shift, younger than 11 years old, or extreme rigid curve, an extension of one or more levels might be safer. In particular situations, the concept of centering the lowest vertebra over the sacrum should be adopted...|$|R
