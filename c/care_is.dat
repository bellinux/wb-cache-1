5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the hospice {{philosophy}} is that the <b>care</b> <b>is</b> patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed <b>care</b> <b>is</b> integral and interwoven throughout the care which is provided. Related Medicare regulations reflect this philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Continuous <b>Care</b> <b>is</b> {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous <b>care</b> <b>is</b> similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous <b>care</b> <b>is</b> intended {{to be used for}} short periods of time.|$|E
5|$|National Health Services are {{provided}} by NHS North West and primary <b>care</b> <b>is</b> delivered by the NHS North Lancashire Primary Care Trust.

Secondary <b>care</b> <b>is</b> provided by the Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Acute medical cases are handled by Victoria Hospital in Blackpool and the North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health <b>care</b> <b>is</b> better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal <b>care</b> <b>is</b> significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E
5|$|In some species, {{both parents}} care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such <b>care</b> <b>is</b> the {{responsibility}} of only one sex. In some species, {{other members of the}} same species—usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young. Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, male parental <b>care</b> <b>is</b> rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class. Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.|$|E

5000|$|Bastardi, Uhlmann, and Ross (2011), {{showed the}} effects of wishful {{thinking}} when they presented parents with two fictional studies involving day care versus home care for their children. The parents who were conflicted (planned to use day care despite believing home <b>care</b> to <b>be</b> superior) more positively rated the [...] "study" [...] that claimed day care as superior and more negatively rated the study that claimed home <b>care</b> <b>was</b> better. The unconflicted parents (those that thought home <b>care</b> <b>was</b> superior to day care and planned to use only home care) rated the study that claimed home <b>care</b> <b>was</b> better more positively. The parents rated the studies that claimed what they actually planned for their children was the superior action, even though (in {{the case of the}} conflicted parents) the study may have been in opposition to their original beliefs. In a post-experiment evaluation, the conflicted parents changed their initial beliefs and claimed to believe that home <b>care</b> <b>was</b> no better than day care, and the unconflicted parents continued to claim home <b>care</b> to <b>be</b> superior, though to a lesser degree.|$|R

5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely {{interact}} {{with one another}} except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental <b>care</b> <b>is</b> to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of <b>care</b> <b>is</b> typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E
5|$|Physicians: Medical <b>care</b> <b>is</b> {{traditionally}} {{focused on}} curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice <b>care</b> <b>is</b> {{not seen as}} the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E

5|$|Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the {{majority}} of their time is taken up by foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal <b>care</b> <b>is</b> given. Some wasp species provide food for the young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning).|$|E
