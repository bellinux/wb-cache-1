5000|$|Frequently, a RAID {{controller}} is configured to [...] "drop" [...] a <b>component</b> <b>drive</b> (that is, {{to assume}} a <b>component</b> <b>drive</b> has failed) if the drive has been unresponsive for eight seconds or so; this might cause the array controller to drop a good drive because that drive has not been given enough time to complete its internal error recovery procedure. Consequently, using RAID for consumer-marketed drives can be risky, and so-called [...] "enterprise class" [...] drives limit this error recovery time to reduce risk. Western Digital's desktop drives {{used to have a}} specific fix. A utility called WDTLER.exe limited a drive's error recovery time. The utility enabled TLER (time limited error recovery), which limits the error recovery time to seven seconds. Around September 2009, Western Digital disabled this feature in their desktop drives (e.g. the Caviar Black line), making such drives unsuitable for use in RAID configurations. However, Western Digital enterprise class drives are shipped from the factory with TLER enabled. Similar technologies are used by Seagate, Samsung, and Hitachi. Of course, for non-RAID usage, an enterprise class drive with a short error recovery timeout that cannot be changed is therefore less suitable than a desktop drive. In late 2010, the Smartmontools program began supporting the configuration of ATA Error Recovery Control, allowing the tool to configure many desktop class hard drives for use in RAID setups.|$|E

We decompose the unemployment rate into three main components: (1) a <b>component</b> <b>driven</b> by changes in labor demand [...] movements along the Beveridge curve and shifts in the Beveridge curve due to layoffs [...] (2) a <b>component</b> <b>driven</b> by changes in labor supply [...] shifts in the Beveridge curve due to quits, movements in-and-out {{of the labor force}} and demographics [...] and (3) a <b>component</b> <b>driven</b> by changes in the efficiency of matching unemployed workers to jobs. We find that cyclical movements in unemployment are dominated by changes in labor demand, but that changes in labor supply due to movements in-and-out of the labor force also play an important role. Further, cyclical changes in labor demand lead cyclical changes in labor supply. Changes in matching efficiency generally play a small role but can decline substantially in recessions. At low-frequencies, labor demand displays no trend, and changes in labor supply explain virtually all of the secular trend in unemployment since 1976. Unemployment...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{emergence}} of {{social networking sites}} (SNSs), the marketing landscape has changed dramatically. The SNS is empowering customers {{as a result of}} online consumption activities such as generating contents, participating in review discussions, and sharing with other customers to influence decision-making. Accordingly, consumers’ online activity in SNSs has paid growing attention as the importance of effective marketing communication has become more clear. However, exploring the psychological aspects of sharing restaurant experiences in SNSs has been largely ignored. To provide deeper insights into the SNS phenomenon in the foodservice industry, the current study proposed a conceptual framework to capture restaurant customers’ online activities in SNSs. Using a strong foundation of uses and gratification theory, this study took a psychological approach to understanding SNS phenomena. This study first addressed the questions of what psychological needs trigger the gratifications consumers sought from sharing their dining experiences. On the basis of the literature review, the study has identified four key psychological aspects: self-esteem, life satisfaction, need to belong, and narcissism. ^ The current study proposed that psychological needs, as the first <b>component,</b> <b>drive</b> consumers’ different motivations for SNS activity. Then, this study explored the effect of three salient motivations on restaurant experience sharing intention in SNSs: self-expression, social benefit, and status seeking. In addition, the potential influencing effect of gender was explored in the relationship between motivations and SNS sharing behavioral intention. ^ To test the hypothesized relationships, structural equation modeling was assessed. The study used multiple group analysis identify gender difference in the relationship between motivations and SNS sharing intention. The results of SEM showed that self-esteem, life satisfaction, need to belong, and narcissism were significant inner psychological factors leading to motivations for SNS sharing intention. The motivations of self-expression and social seeking were key drivers of SNS sharing intention. The findings of this study devote to the restaurant social media marketing literature by filling a gap that has not been studied previously. Such findings provide managerial implications for designing more effective social media marketing campaigns to strategically encourage customers to share their consumption experiences. ...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 99 - 108. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A successful space mission depends on the reliable operation of the spacecraft's electrical power system. For payloads requiring high power levels, various designs of space nuclear power systems (SNPS) are available. Designers have conducted limited spacecraft component reliability analysis and full-scale testing of SNPS is impractical. Therefore, a properly-designed reliability analysis, systematically applied, may provide an effective means for making judgments about the relative reliability of competing SNPSS. This work examines the applicability of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) techniques for estimating SNPS reliability from design studies. The nuclear electric power industry has used PRA techniques to accurately analyze the reliability of complex systems. However, these PRA techniques for nuclear power plants require modifications for SNPS reliability assessment. This study validates these modified PRA techniques by examining the reliability of the SP-I 00 and the Small Ex-core Heat Pipe Thermionic Reactor (SEHPTR). The present analysis focuses on the SNPS failure to produce nominal electrical power. Typical events threatening the reliability of the SNPS will consist of hardware failures, external events, and command errors or software deficiencies. This work involves the following systematic steps for each SNPS: e System familiarization ?Performance of a "failure modes and effects analysis" to deten-nine how the failures of components might cause a system failure ?Construction of system and component fault trees ?Reliability data estimation?Fault tree quantification (using CAFTA'O and UNCERT'O) 'Me reliability data estimation relies on occurrence probabilities for each component failure mode. Various methods for estimating failure rates from existing reliability databases or from engineering approximations were investigated. This work employs the Monte Carlo sampling technique to associate numerical uncertainty levels with the quantitative reliability estimates produced for each SNPS. The quantitative results estimate the reliability of the systems studied as 0. 9494 for the SP- 100 and 0. 9453 for the SEHPTR. The associated error factor is approximately 2. 0, corresponding to the system modeling and reliability data uncertainties. Importance measures and sensitivity analyses indicate that the fuel damage, sensor, electrical component, mechanical <b>component,</b> <b>drive,</b> and power conditioning, control, and distribution subsystem failures can be critical to the system's reliability...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} area of asset management and cost reduction for wind energy is increasing in importance as over 100, 000 turbine assets are currently installed worldwide. Such {{large numbers of}} turbine assets, with a growing offshore <b>component,</b> <b>drive</b> demand for research into improved decision support for wind farm planners and operators - as the operational risk for the assets is removed from OEMs (while under warranty) and is transferred to the power utility owners (post-warranty). The current and future demand for {{research in this field}} has thus been driven by the needs of owner/operators and central government policy formultation. The huge potential energy available from offshore wind in particular, is well known. The most crucial aspect of future deployment levels is the economic recovery of this potential energy. The long-term viability of the offshore wind power as a large scale energy solution hinges on reduction of the cost of energy, as a purely cost-based energy market would currently produce a gas- and coal- based system. The areas of research identified by the authors to aid this transition can be summarised into 3 key themes: 1. Asset and meteo-ocean modelling to support offshore operations and maintenance The first modeling innovation is in the advanced planning of logistics for offshore operations and maintenance. Research produced by Ernst and Young in 2009 has shown that far from reducing O&M costs through learning processes, the real and expected O&M spend for offshore wind has increased year on year: this is backed up by more recent anecdotal evidence. Wind farm owners - often utilities with no experience of offshore operations – whish to improve their knowledge of how to plan for the big risks such as vessel chartering for maintenance, spares provision and location/type of O&M service base. The unique blend of modeling methodologies utilized by the authors build on existing research on Markov chain reliability models applied to wind power assets, and with an increased focus on accurate statistical characterization of weather conditions (particularly working constraints such as wave heights and wind speeds). This advanced approach enables key questions regarding site accessibility in winter, jack up vessel strategy, and life cycle cost issues to be addressed in a way more comprehensive and innovative than any other approach in the literature. This work has far-reaching implications for utilities and offshore wind farm owners, representing a step change in modeling accuracy compared to existing industry standard tools. The future for this work stream will involve this work converging with research activity on condition based maintenance and decision support. 2. Analysis of wind farm maintenance data for asset life cycle optimization The second area of innovative research is analysis of wind turbine SAP and other work order and maintenance data to investigate possible links between failure events and weather conditions. Such analysis will also aid wind asset engineers in their anticipation of failure modes, traceability of faults via improved failure reporting, and calculation of risk exposure to specific failure mechanisms. Current analysis methods are primitive and ripe for improvement by porting data analysis methods from other sectors. Current research by the authors focuses on developing algorithms to mine these rich data sets and establish new understanding of failure patterns with respect to environmental conditions. Industrial interest in this area of work is growing as more assets exit 3 - 5 year warranty guarantees and the risk associated with serial defect, wear issues, and end of life ramping of failure rates becomes the responsibility of the wind farm owner/operator. Increased knowledge of asset deterioration and failure behaviour can also drive feedback to manufacturers, as well as providing a bargaining chip in 3 rd party O&M contract negotiations. Academic novelty is also apparent as most research to date has focused on analysis of turbine SCADA/ condition monitoring data streams: the potential of SAP-type systems to provide a rich source of data to calibrate failure models and understand the impact of environmental conditions on reliability has not been adequately explored. Although at a less advanced stage of maturity compared with the offshore logistics work, this work stream again {{has the potential to be}} fused with parallel work on condition monitoring and asset management. 3. Role of condition monitoring in decreasing OPEX As wind turbines increase in size and move offshore, operations and maintenance procedures need to be optimised to increase reliability, safety and maximise cost effectiveness. The true economic value of a condition based maintenance strategy for offshore wind farms has yet to be calculated. Many existing studies have focused on either the functionality of the turbine, or on the structural integrity, but not both. This theme involves closing the research gap which exists between reliability modelling of wind turbine functionality and modelling of structural integrity. The aim is to produce a comprehensive approach which will facilitate to quantify the overall economic benefits of condition monitoring. With a case study, the industrial application of the approach will be shown and the benefits will be demonstrated. This modelling allows operators to examine a condition based maintenance approach that theoretically allows reduced costs over both preventive and corrective maintenance strategies. There have been several studies into the possible benefits and cost advantages of using a condition based maintenance strategy. However, few have examined the implications of false alarms. Investigating false alarms or ignoring false positives in a remote offshore environment will incur costs that may alter the cost benefit of condition monitoring systems. Probabilistic models are used in the paper to determine the possible benefits of using condition monitoring systems and the detect that false positives and negatives have on the reliability of the system. The methods used include Markov chains, Monte-Carlo simulations and time-series modelling...|$|E

The sediment concentration includes a mean component, an M 2 <b>component</b> <b>driven</b> by bed erosion and an M 2 <b>component</b> <b>driven</b> by both bed erosion and inertial terms. Sediment availability is calculated by imposing a morphodynamic equilibrium condition.

Two types of sediment are separately considered, viz., fine silt and coarse silt. Residual advective transport of sediment by the lateral flow induces trapping of sediment over the left shoal (looking landward). Model results also show that the incorporation of M 4 tidal flow and spatial settling lag leads to a second sediment trapping region over the right shoal.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It first {{appeared}} from American Meteorological Society via [URL] equatorward shift of the zonal mean midlatitude tropospheric jet following a stratospheric sudden warming in a comprehensive, stratosphere-resolving model is found to be well quantified by a simple model, due to Lorenz and Hartmann, of the tropospheric eddy feedbacks. This permits a decomposition of the shift into a <b>component</b> <b>driven</b> by the stratospheric anomalies, and a <b>component</b> <b>driven</b> by tropospheric feedbacks. This is done by extending the simple model to include three effective forcing mechanisms by which the stratosphere may influence the tropospheric jet. These include (1) the zonally-symmetric adjustments associated with the mean meridional circulation, and direct influence of the stratospheric anomalies on (2) the tropospheric synoptic-scale or (3) the tropospheric planetary-scale eddies. Although the anomalous tropospheric winds are primarily maintained against surface friction by the synoptic-scale eddies, this response can be entirely attributed to the eddy-feedback term. The response of the planetary scale eddies, in contrast, is found to be directly influenced by the stratosphere. The zonally-symmetric tropospheric circulation associated with downward control is found to play little role in driving the tropospheric response. The prospects of applying this methodology to reanalysis data is also considered, but statistical limitations and the relatively weak projection of the vertically integrated composite wind anomalies onto the leading EOF preclude any conclusions from being drawn.
