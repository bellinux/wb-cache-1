25|$|The French army doctor Ambroise Paré, born in 1510, {{revived the}} ancient Greek method of tying off blood vessels. After {{amputation}} the common procedure was to <b>cauterize</b> the open {{end of the}} amputated appendage to stop the haemorrhaging. This was done by heating oil, water, or metal and touching it to the wound to seal off the blood vessels. Pare also believed in dressing wounds with clean bandages and ointments, including one he made himself composed of eggs, oil of roses, and turpentine. He {{was the first to}} design artificial hands and limbs for amputation patients. On one of the artificial hands, the two pairs of fingers could be moved for simple grabbing and releasing tasks and the hand look perfectly natural underneath a glove.|$|E

25|$|The first {{surgical}} {{techniques were}} developed to treat injuries and traumas. A combination of archaeological and anthropological studies offer insight into man's early techniques for suturing lacerations, amputating unsalvageable limbs, and draining and cauterizing open wounds. Many examples exist: some Asian tribes used a mix of saltpeter and sulfur that was placed onto wounds and lit on fire to <b>cauterize</b> wounds; the Dakota people used the quill of a feather attached to an animal bladder to suck out purulent material; the discovery of needles from the stone age seem to suggest they {{were used in the}} suturing of cuts (the Maasai used needles of acacia for the same purpose); and tribes in India and South America developed an ingenious method of sealing minor injuries by applying termites or scarabs who ate {{around the edges of the}} wound and then twisted the insects' neck, leaving their heads rigidly attached like staples.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} {{the expression of}} neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in a rat retina model of chronic glaucoma, which was produced by electrocauterization of the episcleral vessels. Western-blot analysis showed that nNOS expression was significantly increased in <b>cauterized</b> retinas. nNOS immunoreactivity was observed in the cells of both the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer. Double labeling of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) revealed that RGCs in the retina of <b>cauterized</b> rat was nNOS-immunopositive. Systemic administration of l-NAME (NG-nitro-l-arginine-methyl-ester), a non-specific NOS inhibitor, reduced RGC loss in <b>cauterized</b> rat retina, {{but there was no}} statistical significance (P =. 06).

V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Care, Moscow, for intoxication with <b>cauterizing</b> liquids. The parameters of general and biochemical blood analyses, the level of free plasma hemoglobin, and the blood and urinary concentrations of ethanol were analyzed. Results. The factorization of signs divided the symptom complex into 6 factors; the first four of them being of the greatest importance. Conclusion.

2500|$|Silver salts have {{antiseptic}} properties. In 1881 Credé {{introduced the}} use of dilute solutions of AgNO3 in newborn babies' eyes at birth to prevent contraction of gonorrhea from the mother, which could cause blindness. (Modern antibiotics are now used instead.) Fused silver nitrate, shaped into sticks, was traditionally called [...] "lunar caustic". It {{is used as a}} cauterizing agent, for example to remove granulation tissue around a stoma. General Sir James Abbott noted in his journals that in India in 1827 it was infused by a British surgeon into wounds in his arm resulting from the bite of a mad dog to <b>cauterize</b> the wounds and prevent the onset of rabies. Dentists sometimes use silver nitrate infused swabs to heal oral ulcers. Silver nitrate is also used by some podiatrists to kill cells located in the nail bed. Silver nitrate is also used to <b>cauterize</b> superficial blood vessels in the nose to help prevent nose bleeds.|$|E
2500|$|Because Tibetan Buddhism prohibits killing, {{mutilation}} {{and other}} extremely cruel punishments were widely used instead in old Tibet. The mutilation of top level Tibetan official Lungshar in 1934 gave an example. Tsepon Lungshar, an official educated in England, introduced {{reform in the}} 1920s; after losing a political struggle the reformist was sentenced to be blinded by having his eyeballs pulled out. [...] "The method involved the placement of a smooth, round yak's knucklebone {{on each of the}} temples of the prisoner. These were then tied by leather thongs around the head and tightened by turning the thongs with a stick on top of the head until the eyeballs popped out. The mutilation was terribly bungled. Only one eyeball popped out, and eventually the ragyaba had to cut out the other eyeball with a knife. Boiling oil was then poured into the sockets to <b>cauterize</b> the wound." [...] This was sufficiently unusual that the untouchables (ragyaba) carrying it out had no previous experience of the correct technique and had to rely on instructions heard from their parents. An attempt was made at anesthetizing the alleged criminal with intoxicants before performing the punishment, which unfortunately did not work well.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, while {{promoting}} his second solo album <b>Cauterize,</b> Mark Tremonti claimed {{in an interview}} with Kerrang that he [...] " [...] been a close friend of Scott's in 9 years". He said that Stapp believed that the other members would end Alter Bridge and perform solely with him in Creed, which they didn't wish to do, as they had established a unique foundation in that band. The other members did not speak to Stapp throughout the South American Tour in 2012 and plans for their fifth studio album were shelved, and they continued to work with Myles Kennedy in Alter Bridge. [...] In August 2015, Tremonti reiterated that there were no plans for Creed {{for at least the next}} few years, but he didn't rule out the possibility. [...] In September 2015, Stapp appeared on the Dr. Oz Show and recounted his history with depression and drug use, and how they contributed to mental health scare in November. [...] When asked about a Creed reunion, Stapp replied: [...] "I can tell you what, I sure hope so. I love the guys with all my heart and if they’re watching, 'Come on guys, let’s make a record.'" [...] He later doubled down on the statements by stating that Creed would [...] "definitely" [...] reunite and that he expected new material from the band within [...] "the next two years." [...] When asked about Stapp's statements, Tremonti clarified that he was still busy {{promoting his}} solo albums and that Alter Bridge would record and tour in 2016, making it unlikely for him to return to Creed within Stapp's proposed timeline.|$|E

60|$|The dreadful {{paroxysm}} of insensibility and seeming {{death in}} a case of apoplexy is supposed to be occasioned by a pressure of blood upon the brain, and the remedy, according to the practice of those days, was to bleed the patient immediately to relieve this pressure, and to blister or <b>cauterize</b> the head, to excite a high external action as a means of subduing the disease within. It was the law of England that such violent remedies could not be resorted to {{in the case of the}} sovereign without authority previously obtained from the council. They were guilty of high treason who should presume to do so. This was a case, however, which admitted of no delay. The attendants put their own lives at hazard to serve that of the king.

The queen was summoned, and came as soon as possible to the scene. She found her husband sitting senseless in a chair, a basin of blood by his side, his countenance death-like and ghastly, while some of the attendants were attempting to force the locked jaws apart, that they might administer a potion, and others were applying a red hot iron to the patient's head, in a desperate endeavor to arouse and bring back again into action the benumbed and stupefied sensibilities.

The <b>cauterized</b> collagen was extruded and was noted in the epidermal crust; minimal granulation tissue was present. Biopsies at later time periods showed formation of granulation tissue and retention of small amounts of necrotic collagen; the process of collagen extrusion was largely prevented by suturing.

40|$|Objective: {{to examine}} {{changes in the}} {{function}} of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in patients with intoxication with <b>cauterizing</b> liquids in relation to the condition of patients in order to early determine the prognosis of the disease. Subjects and methods. ANS was studied in 130 patients aged 15 to 82 years who had been poisoned by cauterants, treated at the Toxicological Unit, Voronezh Regional Hospital, and at the Center for Acute Intoxication Treatment, N. V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Care, Moscow, in 2004 — 2006. Cardiointervalographic parameters were analyzed in relation to the condition of patients, the time elapsed after intoxication prior to the patients&# 8217; admission to a specialized hospital, the presence of hemolysis and blood alcohol, the degree of upper gastrointestinal mucosal burn, and the pattern of poisoning (accidental or intentional). Results. Within the first hours after intoxication with <b>cauterizing</b> liquids, ANS was found to be impaired, which was associated with the development of hyper-sympathicotonia caused by the increased activity of its sympathetic part and the decreased tone of the parasympa-thetic one. The magnitude of hypersympathicotonia depends on the severity of poisoning, on the time elapsed after the onset of intoxication, on the presence of hemolysis, the blood content of alcohol, the degree of upper gastrointestinal burn, and the nature of poisoning. The preponderance of the tone of the ANS parasympathetic part suggests the disturbance of adaptive and compensatory mechanisms and a poor prognosis. Conclusion. Cardiointervalography is recommended for the objective evaluation of the severity of poisoning with <b>cauterizing</b> liquids and the efficiency of performed therapy and for the prediction of the outcome of the disease.
