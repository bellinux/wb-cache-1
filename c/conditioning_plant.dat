There were over 60 subcontractors. Kellex engaged another construction company, Ford, Bacon & Davis, to build the fluorine and nitrogen facilities, and the <b>conditioning</b> <b>plant.</b> [...] Construction work was initially the responsibility of Lieutenant Colonel Warren George, the Chief of the Construction Division of the Clinton Engineer Works. Major W. P. Cornelius became the construction officer responsible for K-25 works on 31 July 1943. He was answerable to Stowers back in Manhattan.

500|$|A {{meeting between}} the Manhattan District and Kellogg on 12 December 1942 {{recommended}} that the K-25 plant be operated by Union Carbide. This would be through a wholly owned subsidiary, Carbon and Carbide Chemicals. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was signed on 18 January 1943, setting the fee at $75,000 per month. This was later increased to $96,000 a month to operate both K-25 and K-27. Union Carbide {{did not wish to}} be the sole operator of the facility. Union Carbide suggested that the <b>conditioning</b> <b>plant</b> be built and operated by Ford, Bacon & Davis. The Manhattan District found this acceptable, and a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was negotiated with a fee of $216,000 for services up to the end of June 1945. The contract was terminated early on 1 May 1945, when Union Carbide took over the plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis was therefore paid $202,000. The other exception was the fluorine plant. Hooker Chemical was asked to supervise its [...] construction of the fluorine plant, and initially to operate it for a fixed fee of $24,500.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States Navy operates in seas {{such as the}} Arabian Gulf, where water temperatures can exceed 90 degrees and air temperatures surpass 95 degrees. An intuitive link exists between these higher operating temperatures and an increased demand on shipboard Air <b>Conditioning</b> (A/C) <b>plants.</b> Increased plant usage, in turn, causes higher A/C plant maintenance costs. To build an accurate cost model for shipboard Air <b>Conditioning</b> <b>plants,</b> this thesis examines the relationship between seawater temperature, A/C plant run-hours, and A/C plant maintenance costs. Data generated by the Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS) were used to test a correlation between these factors for TICONDEROGA, ARLEIGH BURKE, and OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class ships. The results indicate that although seawater temperature is a statistically significant factor in determining A/C plant use, plant use is not a statistically significant driver of maintenance costs. Although the findings discourage further research into this area, the methodology developed for using ICAS data may be applied to other shipboard systems. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
