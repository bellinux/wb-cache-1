2500|$|A Vietnamese map from 1834 also {{combines}} the Spratly and Paracel Islands into one region known as [...] "Vạn Lý Trường Sa", a feature commonly incorporated into {{maps of the}} era (...) ‒ that is, {{the same as the}} aforementioned Chinese island name Wanli Changsha. According to Hanoi, Vietnamese maps record Bãi Cát Vàng (Golden Sandbanks, referring to both the Spratly and Paracel Islands), which lay near the coast of the central Vietnam, as early as 1838. In Phủ Biên Tạp Lục (The Frontier Chronicles) by scholar Lê Quý Đôn, both Hoàng Sa and Trường Sa were defined as belonging to the Quảng Ngãi District. He described it as where sea products and shipwrecked cargoes were available to be collected. Vietnamese text written in the 17th century referenced government-sponsored economic activities during the Lê dynasty, 200years earlier. The Vietnamese government <b>conducted</b> several <b>geographical</b> <b>surveys</b> of the islands in the 18th century.|$|R
