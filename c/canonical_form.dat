In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a <b>canonical</b> <b>form</b> for the equivalence relation of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E

It have been found nomograms in space with coplanar points on which the equation can be nomographycally represented. The factors of anamorphosis are examined. For the equations with three variables, the <b>canonical</b> <b>forms</b> were completely studied by R. Soreau [5] and M. d'Ocagne. In the case of the equations with four and five variables some <b>canonical</b> <b>forms</b> were study by J. Wojtowicz [5], [7], N. Kazangapov [1]. M. Mihoc [2], [4], had in view the nomographic representation of these <b>canonical</b> <b>forms</b> both by the compound plane nomograms and the nomograms in space with coplanar points. This study is also extended to the other <b>canonical</b> <b>forms</b> for the equations with four and five variables, having in view their nomographic representation. We provide a classification of these <b>canonical</b> <b>forms</b> according to the genus of nomograms by which these equations (<b>canonical</b> <b>forms)</b> can be nomographically represented. In the aim of the nomographic representation of these <b>canonical</b> <b>forms,</b> we intend the possibility of bringing these forms to the Soreau equations, either directly or by the anamorphosis factors...|$|R

Such forms include all {{well-known}} families of AND/XOR <b>canonical</b> <b>forms</b> as special cases. A general mathematical treatment of these forms is presented. It is shown that utilizing linear group theory, many properties and classes of these <b>canonical</b> <b>forms</b> can be studied.

25|$|The {{converse}} question, {{whether the}} almost complex structure implies {{the existence of}} a complex structure is much less trivial, and not true in general. On an arbitrary almost complex manifold one can always find coordinates for which the almost complex structure takes the above <b>canonical</b> <b>form</b> at any given point p. In general, however, {{it is not possible to}} find coordinates so that J takes the <b>canonical</b> <b>form</b> on an entire neighborhood of p. Such coordinates, if they exist, are called 'local holomorphic coordinates for J'. If M admits local holomorphic coordinates for J around every point then these patch together to form a holomorphic atlas for M giving it a complex structure, which moreover induces J. J is then said to be 'integrable'. If J is induced by a complex structure, then it is induced by a unique complex structure.|$|E
