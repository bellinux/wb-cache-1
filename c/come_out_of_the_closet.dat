5|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{is elected}} {{president}} of the Troubletones, and tells Santana that she should play fair against New Directions from now on. Santana makes a rare apology to Finn in the school hallway, but her so-called apology consists of a series of insults. As she walks away, Finn retaliates by telling her to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> and calls her a coward for constantly tearing others down while not accepting herself and her relationship with Brittany. A couple of days later, Santana is told by Sue and Burt that the niece of one of their opponents in the election overheard the conversation between her and Finn, and said opponent is about to release an attack ad that criticizes Sue for choosing a lesbian as head cheerleader. Santana runs out of the office in tears, saying that her parents do not yet know she is gay. The episode concludes with the Troubletones' mash-up of Adele songs. The moment the performance ends, Santana jumps down from the stage, blames Finn for outing her to the world and slaps him in the face.|$|E

25|$|Constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos has {{questioned}} {{the notion that}} the legalisation of same-sex marriage in South Africa represents the pinnacle of the human rights struggle of members of the LGBT community. He argues that those who are not involved in long term monogamous relationships and those who cannot <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and get married because of the threat of victimisation may not see any benefit from the legislation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people who}} feel {{attracted}} by the situations usually compiled under the term BDSM {{reach a point where}} they decide to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> though many sadomasochists keep themselves closeted.

Other than a few artists and writers, practically no celebrities are publicly known as sadomasochists.|$|E
25|$|The SFGMC {{came into}} {{existence}} during the Gay Rights Movement, which rose to national prominence after the Stonewall Riots in New York City in 1969. In 1977, openly-gay candidate for San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk began traveling around the United States to present {{what came to be}} known as the Hope Speech. Speaking as an openly gay elected public official, he urged gay people to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> to oppose anti-gay efforts such as the Briggs Initiative and Anita Bryant's Save Our Children campaign. Sims responded by forming the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Marching Band and Twirling Corps, the world's first openly gay and lesbian performing arts group, early in 1978 and the SFGMC later that year. The chorus held its first rehearsal on October 30, 1978.|$|E

25|$|In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's {{observation}} that (in Marks's paraphrase) “it gets harder {{to claim that}} {{gay men and lesbians}} are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture—the Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples—is seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.” In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist Frank Rich cited Bawer's view that there existed “a gentlemen's agreement” among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: “They say 'We'll socialize with you and your significant other and we'll all be charming, as long as you don't mention it in public, and we get to say anything we want in public.'” A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, “Ellen,” on which her character would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. “People used to do courageous things without having a publicist around to tell the world,” he said.|$|E

Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer, the Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay, with Smithers at a million to one. PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on [...] "cartoon gaydar" [...] who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers. Jenny Stewart, the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll, [...] "We've never had such an avalanche of people voting in any of our polls as we did on The Simpsons." [...] It was Patty Bouvier who came out.|$|E

2500|$|Bruner {{has accused}} President Barack Obama of {{formerly}} being a drug-using gay prostitute, writing in October 2015: [...] "Obama has {{a soft spot}} for homosexuals because of the years he spent as a male prostitute in his twenties.

[...] "He has admitted he was addicted to drugs when he was young and he is sympathetic with homosexuals, but he hasn't <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> about his own homosexual/bisexual background."

[...] David Hauslaib of gossip blog Jossip.com stated, [...] "The rationale that he's doing this {{for the good of}} that gay community is tantamount to saying that there is a gay agenda.

2500|$|During {{his years}} with the Smiths, Morrissey professed to being celibate, which stood out {{at a time when}} much of pop music was {{dominated}} by visible sexuality. Marr said in a 1984 interview that Morrissey [...] "doesn't participate in sex at the moment and hasn't done so for a while". Repeatedly, interviewers asked Morrissey if he was gay, which he denied. In response to one such inquiry in 1985, he stated that [...] "I don't recognise such terms as heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and I think it's important that there's someone in pop music who's like that. These words do great damage, they confuse people and they make people feel unhappy so I want to do away with them." [...] As his career developed, there was increased pressure placed on him to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> although he presented himself as a non-practicing bisexual. In a 1989 interview, he revealed that he was [...] "always attracted to men and women who were never attracted to me" [...] and thus he did not have [...] "relationships at all". In 2013, he released a statement which said, [...] "Unfortunately, I am not homosexual. In technical fact, I am humasexual. I am attracted to humans. But, of course... not many." ...|$|E
