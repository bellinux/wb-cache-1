40|$|Malaria {{currently}} causes {{more harm}} {{to human beings}} than any other parasitic disease, and disproportionally affects low‑income populations. The ethical issues raised by efforts to control or eliminate malaria have received little explicit analysis, in comparison with other major diseases of poverty. While some ethical issues associated with malaria {{are similar to those}} that {{have been the subject of}} debate in the context of other infectious diseases, malaria also raises distinct ethical issues in virtue of its unique history, epidemiology, and biology. This paper provides preliminary ethical analyses of the especially salient issues of: (i) global health justice, (ii) universal access to malaria control initiatives, (iii) multidrug resistance, including artemisinin‑based combination therapy (ACT) resistance, (iv) mandatory screening, (v) mass drug administration, (vi) benefits and risks of primaquine, and (vii) malaria in the context of blood donation and transfusion. Several ethical issues are also raised by past, present and future malaria research initiatives, in particular: (i) <b>controlled</b> <b>infection</b> <b>studies,</b> (ii) human landing catches, (iii) transmission‑blocking vaccines, and (iv) genetically‑mod‑ ified mosquitoes. This article maps the terrain of these major ethical issues surrounding malaria control and elimina‑ tion.

30|$|Pyramiding of {{multiple}} R genes is often suggested {{as a strategy}} for durable and multiple pest resistance in crop plants. Tagging, mapping and cloning {{of several of the}} R genes conferring resistance against bacterial blight (BB), blast (BL) and gall midge (GM) in rice has led to identification of reliable molecular markers linked to the gene and gave a fillip to marker assisted selection and breeding for multiple pest resistance. Most often, Xa 21, xa 13, xa 5 conferring resistance to BB; Pi 1, Pi 2, Pi 9 and Pi 54 against blast and Gm 1, Gm 4 and gm 3 against gall midge are involved in such breeding projects (Sundaram et al. 2008; Sundaram et al. 2009; Basavaraj et al. 2010; Das and Rao 2015; Arunakumari et al. 2016; Balachiranjeevi et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2017; Ramalingam et al. 2017; Das et al. 2018). Specific gene based or closely linked PCR markers are available for these genes. Several popular elite rice lines have been ‘improved’ by incorporating some of these genes through Marker Assisted Backcross Breeding (MABB) involving both foreground and background selection (Kumar et al. 2017). Some of these studies have shown combined resistance to target pests like BB and BL or BB and GM (Kumar et al. 2017) in the gene pyramided lines under greenhouse <b>controlled</b> <b>infection</b> <b>studies.</b> It is assumed that pyramided genes act in unison and express combined resistance. Here we have examined this issue with greater clarity and with combination {{of multiple}} R genes against BB, BL and GM in ten gene pyramided lines developed in a common genetic background covering 14 defense related genes. We did not observe instances of distinct antagonism but recorded synergism among resistance pathways against these target pests.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Understanding the {{resistance}} patterns of bacteria and their sensitivity {{and attempting to}} find new compounds with broad effective spectrum would be significant in <b>controlling</b> <b>infection.</b> This <b>study</b> aimed at evaluating antibacterial potential of three honey samples produced in Golestan province, Iran, against Enterococcus faecalis strains. Material and Methods: After the isolation and identification of bacterial strains, their antibiotic resistance was determined using Kirby-Bauer method. Then, seven isolates of Enterococcus faecalis with multidrug-resistance were selected and antibacterial activities of honey samples assessed by disk-diffusion, well-diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration test (MIC). Results: The highest diameter of inhibition zone in disk-diffusion and well diffusion methods is 20 mm and 26 mm, respectively. Also the MIC is measured 62. 5 mg. ml for all samples. Conclusion: In prohibiting microbial growth, all three samples were successful and they could prevent growing bacterial infection in spite of remarkable resistance of Entrococcus.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Controlled</b> human <b>infection,</b> the {{intentional}} infection of healthy volunteers, allows disease pathogenesis {{to be studied}} and vaccines and therapeutic interventions to be evaluated in a controlled setting. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of countermeasures for influenza that used the experimental human infection platform was performed. The primary objective was to document the scope of trials performed to date and the main efficacy outcome in the trials. The secondary objective was to assess safety and identify serious adverse events. Methods: The PubMed database was searched for randomized controlled influenza human challenge studies with predetermined search terms. Review papers, papers without outcomes, community-acquired infections, duplicated data, pathogenesis studies, and observational studies were excluded. Results: Twenty-six randomized controlled trials published between 1947 and 2014 fit the study inclusion criteria. Two-thirds of these trials investigated antivirals and one-third investigated influenza vaccines. Among 2462 subjects inoculated with influenza virus, the incidence of serious adverse events was low (0. 04 %). These challenge studies helped to down-select three antivirals and one vaccine that were subsequently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Envelope-specific, major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted murine T-cell hybridomas were tested for responsiveness to splenic antigen-presenting cells exposed to HIV- 1 -infected GHOST cells. Interleukin- 2 assays showed that the presence of a peptide within HIV- 1 did not ensure the reactivation of peptide-specific T cells. Further experiments defined the impact of gamma interferon-induced thiol reductase and cysteine proteases on the processing of HIV- 1 peptides.

40|$|Decapod {{crustaceans}} are ecologically {{and economically}} valuable, yet {{are vulnerable to}} a variety of stressors in both natural and farmed environments. Immune biomarkers have been commonly used to assess host transcriptional response to infection and disease in Decapoda. Here, the transcription of various immune genes was quantified to assess the host response of the European lobster, Homarus gammarus (L.) and the shore crab, Carcinus maenas (L.) to a number of stress scenarios. Selected immune genes included carcinin, (C. maenas) and crustin (H. gammarus), antimicrobial peptides, peroxinectin, a cell adhesion molecule and osponin and the zymogen prophenoloxidase. Prophenoloxidase cleaves to form active phenoloxidase which is involved in the melanisation of many invading pathogens. The immune gene transcription was quantified using real-time PCR. The efficacy of this suite of biomarkers was tested in the context of either pathogen history, as a predictor of viral or bacterial challenge in decapods or in response to non-pathogen related stress (high stocking density). In H. gammarus, the predictive capacity of this ‘toolbox’ of immune genes was quantified in response to White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) infection, a viral pathogen with a wide host range and known to cause mortality, most notably in penaeid species. For C. maenas, the transcription of the immune genes was quantified to assess the host impact of different pathogen burdens in two distinct, wild populations. Further, the predictive capacity of the biomarkers was quantified in C. maenas in response to two <b>controlled</b> <b>infection</b> <b>studies</b> with either a Gram positive (Planococcus citreus) or Gram negative (Listonella anguillarum) bacteria. Lastly, the wider applicability of this suite of biomarkers was assessed as a general indicator of stress in C. maenas. Overall, the transcription of carcinin, peroxinectin and prophenoloxidase differed between C. maenas populations in response to pathogen assemblages and site-specific differences. In response to viral (H. gammarus) and bacterial (C. maenas) challenge and the non-pathogenic stress challenge (C. maenas), there was no significant change in peroxinectin and prophenoloxidase transcription. Interestingly, the transcription of crustin (H. gammarus) and carcinin (C. maenas) changed significantly in response to all of these challenges. This suggests a much wider role for these antimicrobial peptides as biomarkers in both viral and bacterial challenges and in response to stress associated with high stocking density. The efficacy of antimicrobial peptides in response to bacterial and viral pathogens and non-pathogen stressors should be assessed in other species to understand its applicability and limitations as a biomarker in the wider decapod community...|$|R

Incomplete understanding of mechanisms and correlates of protection against RSV mean that, {{for the time}} being, successful RSV vaccines must directly demonstrate efficacy, which necessitates large and costly clinical trials in naturally infected patients. To mitigate the risks inherent in progressing to these late-stage trials, experimental human RSV <b>infection</b> <b>studies</b> have recently been re-established, representing the interface between pre-clinical models and observational studies of patients. Not only can they be used for early proof-of-concept clinical trials to test vaccine efficacy, but human challenge studies also offer the potential to better understand protective immunity against RSV infection to improve vaccine design and delivery. In the past, <b>controlled</b> human <b>infection</b> <b>studies</b> with RSV have been instrumental in elucidating the influence of factors such as route of infection and type of inoculum on the course of disease.

To define the minimal requirements for both initial and long-term survival of i. d. infection, we characterized the nature of i. d. LVS infection in lymphocyte-deficient BALB/cByJ. scid (scid) mice. scid mice infected i. d. with strain LVS survived for about 20 days and then died from overwhelming disseminated infection. However, scid mice treated with monoclonal antibodies to gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or neutrophils-granulocytes all died within 1 week of infection, indicating that these were essential for early <b>control</b> of <b>infection.</b> <b>Studies</b> using GKO (gamma interferon knockout) mice emphasized that gamma interferon is absolutely required for initial survival of i. d.

40|$|Objectives: Upper {{respiratory}} virus {{infection is}} associated with the expression of symptoms and signs of illness, and with the development of complications in anatomically contiguous structures. In most epidemiological studies, the frequency of the various complications is expressed as a fraction of the total population judged to be ill by report, signs, or symptoms. Because not all infected subjects become ill and because infected non-ill subjects may develop complications, such risk estimates could be inaccurate. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the magnitude of the presentation bias during <b>controlled,</b> experimental <b>infections.</b> <b>Study</b> Design: This was a prospective, experimental study of the relationship between illness and otological complications during experimental upper respiratory virus infection in 316 adult volunteers. Methods: The data for illness and for abnormal middle ear underpressure in adult (18 – 54 y) volunteers experimentally infected with one of three viruses (rhinovirus type 39, rhinovirus strain hanks, influenza A virus) were analyzed and expressed as the relative frequencies of infected subjects reporting illness, developing abnormal middle ear pressure, and developing abnormal middle ear pressure in the absence of illness. Results: For all three viruses, illness was documented in approximately 50 % of the infected subjects. While the frequency of persons developing abnormal middle ear underpressure was greater in the infected-ill subjects, approximately one third of all infected subjects developing that complication did not report illness. Conclusions: These results support a large presentation bias in epidemiological surveys of viral upper respiratory infections, and infer that those surveys underestimate the true frequency of complications resulting from such infections...|$|R

As a research tool, WGS has provided insights into the origins of antibiotic-resistant strains, the genetic basis of virulence, the emergence and spread of lineages, and the population structure of S. aureus. As a frontline tool, WGS offers the prospect of a method {{that could be used to}} predict resistance, assess virulence, and type isolates at the highest possible resolution.

40|$|The use of {{metallic}} implants has revolutionised {{the practice}} of orthopaedic surgery. While the safety and biocompatibility of these devices are excellent, a small percentage becomes infected. These infections are due {{to the formation of}} a biofilm that harbours bacteria encased in a complex extracellular matrix. The matrix serves as a barrier to immune surveillance as well as limiting the biocidal effects of systemic and local antibiotics. The objective of the review is to describe a novel approach to <b>controlling</b> implant <b>infection</b> using an antibiotic that is linked to titanium through a self-assembled monolayer of siloxy amines. We show that the hybrid-engineered surface is stable, biocompatible and resists colonisation by bacterial species most commonly associated with implant-related <b>infections.</b> <b>Studies</b> with rodent bone infection models suggest that the engineered titanium surface prevents bone infection. Results of a very recent investigation utilising a sheep model of infection indicate that the titanium-tethered antibiotic <b>controls</b> <b>infection</b> without compromising bone formation and remodelling. From all of these perspectives, the tethered antibiotic holds promise of providing a novel and practical approach to reducing implant-associated infections...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{inform the}} {{development}} of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation guidelines on the care of infants with CF, we systematically reviewed the evidence for diagnosis and assessment of pancreatic and pulmonary disorders; management of pancreatic and pulmonary function; management of nutrition and nutritional disorders; and preven-tion and <b>control</b> of <b>infections.</b> <b>Study</b> design In May-June 2008, we searched The Cochrane Library for existing reviews; and MEDLINE, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the CF Foundation Clinical Practice Guidelines and Consensus Statements, and the UK CF Trust for existing guidelines. MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Liter-ature (CINAHL) and the Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) were searched for primary studies in January 2008. Bibliographies of eligible articles were searched and expert input was sought. We selected English-lan-guage articles of any study design that provided original data on any of our questions on infants up to 2 years of age. Results We identified 14 relevant guidelines and 3 Cochrane reviews. Fifty-nine articles (55 primary studies) were included. Only four of these were randomized controlled trials. Sample sizes of infants ranged from 2 to 768 study participants; the median sample size was 24. Of our 21 review topics, 5 topics had only one study while for 5 we identified no relevant studies. We identified one or no primary studies for 20 of 32 review questions. Conclusions There is a paucity of evidence on the care of infants diagnosed with CF. For several of the review questions no guidelines or primary studies were identified, but for other questions, studies limited by weak design and small sample sizeswere the only studies identified. With increasing numbers of infants with CF being diagnosed by newborn screening {{there is an opportunity}} to study the management of infants diagnosed with CF (J Pediat...|$|R
40|$|Background Dietary non-digestible {{carbohydrates}} {{stimulate the}} gut microflora {{and are therefore}} presumed to improve host resistance to intestinal infections. However, several strictly <b>controlled</b> rat <b>infection</b> <b>studies</b> showed that non-digestible fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) increase, rather than decrease, translocation of Salmonella towards extra-intestinal sites. In addition, it was shown that FOS increases intestinal permeability already before infection. The mechanism responsible for this adverse effect of FOS is unclear. Possible explanations are altered mucosal integrity due to changes in tight junctions or changes in expression of defense molecules such as antimicrobials and mucins. To examine the mechanisms underlying weakening of the intestinal barrier by FOS, a controlled dietary intervention study was performed. Two groups of 12 rats were adapted to a diet with or without FOS. mRNA was collected from colonic mucosa and changes in gene expression were assessed for each individual rat using Agilent rat whole genome microarrays. Results Among the 997 FOS induced genes we observed less mucosal integrity related genes than expected with the clear permeability changes. FOS did not induce changes in tight junction genes and only 8 genes related to mucosal defense were induced by FOS. These small effects are unlikely the cause for the clear increase in intestinal permeability that is observed. FOS significantly increased expression of 177 mitochondria-related genes. More specifically, induced expression of genes involved in all five OXPHOS complexes and the TCA cycle was observed. These results indicate that dietary FOS influences intestinal mucosal energy metabolism. Furthermore, increased expression of 113 genes related to protein turnover, including proteasome genes, ribosomal genes and protein maturation related genes, was seen. FOS upregulated expression of the peptide hormone proglucagon gene, in agreement with previous studies, as well as three other peptide hormone genes; peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide and cholecystokinin. Conclusion We conclude that altered energy metabolism may underly colonic barrier function disruption due to FOS feeding in rats...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanism}} of <b>infection</b> <b>control</b> in elite controllers (EC) may {{shed light on the}} correlates of control of disease progression in HIV infection. However, limitations have prevented a clear understanding of {{the mechanism}}s of elite <b>controlled</b> <b>infection,</b> as these <b>studies</b> can only be performed at randomly selected late time points in <b>infection,</b> after <b>control</b> is achieved, and the access to tissues is limited. We report that SIVagm infection is elite-controlled in rhesus macaques (RMs) and therefore can be used as an animal model for EC HIV infection. A robust acute infection, with high levels of viral replication and dramatic mucosal CD 4 (+) T cell depletion, similar to pathogenic HIV- 1 /SIV infections of humans and RMs, was followed by complete and durable control of SIVagm replication, defined as: undetectable VLs in blood and tissues beginning 72 to 90 days postinoculation (pi) and continuing at least 4 years; seroreversion; progressive recovery of mucosal CD 4 (+) T cells, with complete recovery by 4 years pi; normal levels of T cell immune activation, proliferation, and apoptosis; and no disease progression. This "functional cure" of SIVagm infection in RMs could be reverted after 4 years of <b>control</b> of <b>infection</b> by depleting CD 8 cells, which resulted in transient rebounds of VLs, thus suggesting that control may be at least in part immune mediated. Viral control was independent of MHC, partial APOBEC restriction was not involved in SIVagm control in RMs and Trim 5 genotypes did not impact viral replication. This new animal model of EC lentiviral infection, in which complete control can be predicted in all cases, permits research on the early events of infection in blood and tissues, before the defining characteristics of EC are evident and when host factors are actively driving the infection towards the EC status...|$|R
