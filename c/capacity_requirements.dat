40|$|A {{continuous}} and near instantaneous balance between generation supply and load demand {{must be maintained}} in power system operation. As a kind of regulation reserve, automatic generation control (AGC) is widely employed for maintaining system security and reliability, especially for controlling frequency deviation and supporting commercial transactions. In a competitive electricity market, AGC services are either contracted via negotiations between the market operator and generation companies concerned, or procured via a certain form of auction. A new framework to determine AGC <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> {{and to deal with}} regulation dispatch under uncertain demand in a competitive electricity market is presented in this paper. First, the stochastic characteristics of AGC <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> and services are analyzed. A stochastic optimization decision-making model for determining optimal AGC <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> is then developed, followed by a pricing analysis which reveals that a trade-off between economic efficiency and system security must be made by the market operator. Finally, an optimal AGC dispatch algorithm is suggested. A numerical study is given to further demonstrate the essential features of the proposed model and method.

25|$|Football is {{the most}} popular sport in the county, and the largest and most {{successful}} football club in the county is Kidderminster Harriers. Founded in 1877 as a running club and doubling as a rugby club from 1880, the football club was founded in 1886. In 1987, the club won the FA Trophy for the first time, and seven years later reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, also winning the GM Vauxhall Conference title in 1994 but being denied Football League status as their Aggborough Stadium did not meet <b>capacity</b> <b>requirements.</b> However, when the club next won the Conference title six years later, their stadium had been upgraded and promotion was granted, giving the county its first Football League members. However, the club's Football League membership was short-lived, as Harriers were relegated back to the Conference in 2005 after just five years in the Football League, and have yet to reclaim their status.|$|E
500|$|In November 1999, Arsenal {{examined}} {{the feasibility of}} building a new stadium in Ashburton Grove. Anthony Spencer, estate agent and club property adviser, recommended the area to director Danny Fiszman and vice-chairman David Dein having scoured over North London for potential areas. The land, [...] from Highbury was composed of a rubbish processing plant and industrial estate, 80% owned by the Islington Council, Railtrack and Sainsbury's. After passing the first significant milestone at Islington Council's planning committee, Arsenal submitted a planning application for a new-build 60,000 seater stadium in November 2000. This included a redevelopment project at Drayton Park, converting the existing ground Highbury to flats and building a new waste station in Lough Road. As part of the scheme, Arsenal intended to create 1,800 new jobs for the community and 2,300 new homes. Improvements to three railway stations, Holloway Road, Drayton Park and Finsbury Park, were included {{to cope with the}} increased <b>capacity</b> <b>requirements</b> from matchday crowds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new method of {{short-term}} <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> planning (CRP) {{from the viewpoint}} of “stability”. The term stability refers to the higher predictability of a released <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> plan (or a load plan), and also signifies the robustness of a manufacturing process against internal/external uncertainties. The objective of CRP mentioned in this study is to determine a stable allocation of each manufacturing resource to given operation orders with the aim of minimizing the probability that the resource requirement of each operation order exceeds the capacity of corresponding resource. Through some computational simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed CRP method is applicable as a short-term CRP method by applying it to a flexible job-shop manufacturing system...|$|R

40|$|Federated {{scheduling}} is {{a promising}} approach to schedule parallel real-time tasks on multi-cores, where each heavy task exclusively executes {{on a number}} of dedicated processors, while light tasks are treated as sequential sporadic tasks and share the remaining processors. However, federated scheduling suffers resource waste since a heavy task with processing <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> x + ϵ (where x is an integer and 0 < ϵ < 1) needs x + 1 dedicated processors. In the extreme case, almost half of the processing capacity is wasted. In this paper we propose the semi-federate scheduling approach, which only grants x dedicated processors to a heavy task with processing <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> x + ϵ, and schedules the remaining ϵ part together with light tasks on shared processors. Experiments with randomly generated task sets show the semi-federated scheduling approach significantly outperforms not only federated scheduling, but also all existing approaches for scheduling parallel real-time tasks on multi-cores...|$|R

40|$|Current {{mobile network}} {{architecture}} {{is facing a}} big challenge as the traffic demands have been increasing dramatically these years. Explosive mobile data demands are driving a significant growth in energy consumption in mobile networks, {{as well as the}} cost and carbon footprints [1]. In 2010, China Mobile Research Institute proposed Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) [2], which has been {{regarded as one of the}} most promising architecture to solve the challenge of operators. In C-RAN, the baseband units (BBU) are decoupled from the remote radio units (RRH) and centralized in one or more locations. The feasibility of combination of implementing the very tight radio coordination schemes and sharing baseband processing and cooling system resources proves to be the two main advantages of C-RAN compared to traditional RAN. More importantly, mobile operators can quickly deploy RRHs to expand and make upgrades to their networks. Therefore, the C-RAN has been advocated by both operators and equipment vendors as a means to achieve the significant performance gains required for 5 G [3]. However, one of the biggest barriers has shown up in the deployment of C-RAN as the novel architecture imposes very high <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> on the transport network between the RRHs and BBUs, which is been called fronthaul network. With the implementation of 5 G wireless system using advanced multi-antenna transmission (MIMO), the <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> would go further up, as well as the power consumption. One solution has been proposed to solve the problem is to have the baseband functions divided, partially staying with RRHs and other functions would be centralized in BBU pool. Different splitting solutions has been proposed in [4] [5] and [6]. In this thesis work, we choose four different splitting solutions to build four CRAN architecture models. Under one specific case scenario with the fixed number of LTE base stations, we calculate the transport <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> for fronthaul and adopt three different fronthaul technology. The power consumption is calculated by adding up the power utilized by RRHs, fronthaul network and baseband processing. By comparing the numerical results, split 1 and 2 shows the best results while split 2 is more practical for dense cell area, since split 1 requires large fronthaul capacity. The fronthaul transport technology can be decided according to different density of base stations. TWDM-PON shows better energy performance as fronthaul network when the <b>capacity</b> <b>requirement</b> is high, compared to EPON. However, for larger number of BSs, mm-Wave fronthaul is a better solution in terms of energy efficiency, fiber saving and flexibility...|$|R
