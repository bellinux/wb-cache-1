40|$|With the {{increasing}} frequency, magnitude {{and impact of}} disasters, there is growing focus on <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> {{as a tool for}} enhancing resilience. Yet, there is little empirical evidence that reflects on the practice of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> systems within the context of disaster risk reduction. This article explores the practice of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> in southern Africa, focussing on Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. A qualitative comparative analysis informed by fieldwork was used. The findings show that (1) there was a wide gap between theory and practice in <b>contingency</b> <b>planning,</b> (2) response activities rarely reflected projected scenarios and (3) resources were inadequate for effective <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> We conclude that unless these issues are addressed, <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> is likely o remain a theoretical rather than a practical tool for building disaster-resilient communities in southern African countries. Although a generalisation cannot be made on the status of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> and practice in southern Africa without a wider analysis of more examples, the findings may apply beyond the examined contexts and also offer insights into research gaps...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop {{guidelines}} for the formulation of strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> to assist school administrators and boards of school trustees during a teacher strike. The study was designed to secure and evaluate strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> items currently being utilized by school administrators as well as ideas suggested through published literature by authorities in the field. An initial survey was conducted to collect strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> and to determine teacher strike experience of 286 Indiana school superintendents and of superintendents throughout the nation identified as having experienced a teacher strike during August and September of 1975. Data collected were used to determine the number of strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> in existence in Indiana and in school districts outside Indiana included in the survey, and the experience level of Indiana superintendents in dealing with teacher strikes. The tactical ideas, suggestions, and guideline statements secured from the review of the literature and analysis of strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> material received in response to the initial survey were developed into a form for evaluating strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> items. The evaluation form was divided into six sections designed to elicit responses relative to strike <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> One hundred eighty-seven statement items relative to the board of education, superintendent, communication center, transportation, security, and building procedures were included. Superintendents were asked to indicate if the strike plan items should be included in a strike contingency plan- as well as to indicate the degree of importance of each strike plan item in maintaining the operational capacities of a school district during a teacher strike. Ten Indiana superintendents identified as having had experienced one or more teacher strikes and having developed a strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> for use should a strike situation develop served as evaluators. The findings of the study were developed into a set of guidelines for the development of a strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan.</b> Strike plan items were classified as items essential to every strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> and as items which should be considered for inclusion in a strike <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> while the strike plan is being developed.

40|$|The BLM’s goals {{under this}} program are to {{effectively}} manage hazardous materials {{on the public}} lands to protect {{the health and safety}} of public land uses and stewards, protect the natural and environmental resources, minimize future hazardous and related risks, costs and liabilities, and to mitigate physical hazards in compliance with all applicable laws, regulation, and policy. Listed below are several of the more common environmental laws in place. The BLM follows its national, state, and local <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> as they <b>apply</b> to emergency responses. These plans are also consistent with federal and state laws and regulations. Hazardous materials are generally defined as a usable product or substance that may cause harm to humans, natural resources, or the environment when spilled, released, or contacted. Hazardous materials are used in every day activities and may be in the form of a solid, liquid, or gas. Regardless of their physical state, hazardous materials may be toxic, flammable, combustible, reactive, and/or corrosive. When used and stored properly, associated risks are minimized or eliminated Hazardous wastes can be described as discarded, abandoned, inherently waste-like, released, and/or spilled hazardous materials or substances...|$|R

40|$|Any {{information}} technology(IT) {{system needs}} its computing resources to operate correctly (system integrity) and should maintain {{the value of}} its information (data integ-rity). Unfortunately, adverse events may damage data integrity or system integ-rity or both. <b>Contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for IT sys-tems focuses on preserving, enabling recovery, or the graceful degradation of system or data integrity. Unfortunately, contingency mechanisms that work in one adverse situation may be hopelessly inadequate in another. Consequently, different <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> types exist for different “disasters. ” The two pri-mary types are physical and logical event <b>plans.</b> Traditional IT <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> address physical events such as flood, fire, earthquake, war, or loss of power. Many sources discuss traditional con-tingency planning, which often empha-sizes replication and physical separation to guard against physical disasters. Such traditional planning does not consider logical events. A logical event (LE) strikes all sites that have similar information configura-tions (software, data, and firmware) —no matter how widely separated. The im-pacted system also may corrupt IT that is down the information flow stream. LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> has two subcat-egories: plans for incompletely under-stood systems and plans for well-under-stood systems. Because the Y 2 K problem is an LE, discussion of LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> is appropriate. LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> borrows from systems security principles, which include auditing, system modeling, input and output validation, and in-strumentation. This article outlines the properties that a <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> strives to preserve, suggests techniques for further investigation in Y 2 K LE <b>contingency</b> <b>planning,</b> and explains LE <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> with respect to tradi-tional plans. Y 2 K planning is about risk manage-ment. Risk management involves • Identifying risks (potential threats and vulnerabilities). • Analyzing risks by evaluating, cat-egorizing, and prioritizing them. • <b>Planning</b> for risks. <b>Contingency</b> <b>planning</b> reduces to • Creating mechanisms to identify the events that trigger contingency actions. • Defining what the contingency actions are (either automatic or manually executed actions). • Preparing the responsible parties by documenting who they are and by training them to be ready...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{consistent}} {{evidence for}} the positive impact of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for falls in older people, implementation of plans often fail. This is likely {{due to lack of}} recognition and knowledge about perspectives of older people about <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> The objective of this research was to explore the perspectives of older people living in the community about use of <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for getting help quickly after a fall. A systematic literature search seeking qualitative research was conducted in April 2014, with no limit placed on date of publication. Medline, EMBASE, Ageline, CINAHL, HealthSource- Nursing/Academic Edition, AMED and Psych INFO databases were searched. Three main concepts were explored and linked using Boolean operators; older people, falls and <b>contingency</b> <b>planning.</b> The search was updated until February 2016 with no new articles found. After removal of duplicates, 562 articles were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria resulting in six studies for the meta-synthesis. These studies were critically appraised using the McMaster critical appraisal tool. Bespoke data extraction sheets were developed and a meta-synthesis approach was adopted to extract and synthesise findings. Three themes of 'a mix of attitudes', 'careful deliberations' and 'a source of anxiety' were established. Perspectives of older people were on a continuum between regarding <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> as necessary and not necessary. Levels of engagement with the <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> process seemed associated with acceptance of their risk of falling and their familiarity with available <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> strategies. Avoiding a long lie on the floor following a fall is imperative for older people in the community but {{there is a lack of}} knowledge about <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> for falls. This meta-synthesis provides new insights into this area of health service delivery and highlights that implementation of plans needs to be directed by the older people rather than the health professionals...|$|R
