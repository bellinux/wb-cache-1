Specification 1. 6 of the WAPS, International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards Reporting for High Level Waste (HLW), requires that the ratio by weights of the following uranium and plutonium isotopes be reported: U- 233, U- 234, U- 235, U- 236, and U- 238; and Pu- 238, Pu- 239, Pu- 240, Pu- 241, and Pu- 242. Therefore, the complete list of reportable radionuclides must also include these sets of U and Pu isotopes - and the U and Pu isotopic mass distributions must be identified. The DWPF receives HLW sludge slurry from Savannah River Site (SRS) Tank 40. For Sludge Batch 7 a (SB 7 a), the waste in Tank 40 contained a blend of the heel from Sludge Batch 6 (SB 6) and the Sludge Batch 7 (SB 7) material transferred to Tank 40 from Tank 51. This sludge blend is also referred to as Macrobatch 8. Laboratory analyses of a Tank 40 sludge sample were performed to quantify the concentrations of pertinent radionuclides in the SB 7 a waste. Subsequently, radiological decay and in-growth were calculated over the time period from 2015 to 3115. This provided a basis for characterizing the radionuclide content of SB 7 a over time and for identifying the 'reportable radionuclides.

This report documents a method for adjusting the gamma exposure rate (mR/hr) reading used in dose-to-curie determinations when the far-field measurement equals the background reading.

An overview of the project execution strategy that was implemented is discussed along with the lessons learned, challenges and improvements to date associated with waste characterization, facility modifications, startup planning, and remediation activities. The legacy waste was generated from approximately 1970 through 1990 and originated both on site {{as well as at}} multiple US Department of Energy sites. Approximately two thirds of the waste was previously dispositioned from 2006 to 2008, with the remaining one third being the more hazardous waste due to its activity (<b>curie</b> <b>content)</b> and the plutonium isotope Pu- 238 quantities in the waste. The project strategy is a phased approach beginning with the lower activity waste in existing facilities while upgrades are made to support remediation of the higher activity waste. Five waste remediation process lines will be used to support the full remediation efforts which involve receipt of the legacy waste container, removal of prohibited items, venting of containers, and resizing of contents to fit into current approved waste shipping containers. Modifications have been minimized to the extent possible to meet the accelerated goals and involve limited upgrades to address life safety requirements, radiological containment needs, and handling equipment for the larger waste containers. Upgrades are also in progress for implementation of the TRUPACT III for the shipment of Standard Large Boxes to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, the US TRU waste repository. The use of this larger shipping container is necessary for approximately 20 % of the waste by volume due to limited size reduction capability.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a {{probabilistic safety assessment}} of radioactive doses as consequences from accident scenarios to complement the deterministic assessment presented in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Safety Analysis Report (SAR). The International Council of Radiation Protection (ICRP) recommends both assessments be conducted to ensure that ''an adequate level of safety has been achieved and that no major contributors to risk are overlooked'' (ICRP 1993). To that end, the probabilistic assessment for the WIPP accident scenarios addresses {{the wide range of}} assumptions, e. g. the range of values representing the radioactive source of an accident, that could possibly have been overlooked by the SAR. Routine releases of radionuclides from the WIPP repository to the environment during the waste emplacement operations are expected to be essentially zero. In contrast, potential accidental releases from postulated accident scenarios during waste handling and emplacement could be substantial, which necessitates the need for radiological air monitoring and confinement barriers (DOE 1999). The WIPP Safety Analysis Report (SAR) calculated doses from accidental releases to the on-site (at 100 m from the source) and off-site (at the Exclusive Use Boundary and Site Boundary) public by a deterministic approach. This approach, as demonstrated in the SAR, uses single-point values of key parameters to assess the 50 -year, whole-body committed effective dose equivalent (CEDE). The basic assumptions used in the SAR to formulate the CEDE are retained for this report's probabilistic assessment. However, for the probabilistic assessment, single-point parameter values were replaced with probability density functions (PDF) and were sampled over an expected range. Monte Carlo simulations were run, in which 10, 000 iterations were performed by randomly selecting one value for each parameter and calculating the dose. Statistical information was then derived from the 10, 000 iteration batch, which included 5 %, 50 %, and 95 % dose likelihood, and the sensitivity of each assumption to the calculated doses. As one would intuitively expect, the doses from the probabilistic assessment for most scenarios were found to be much less than the deterministic assessment. The lower dose of the probabilistic assessment can be attributed to a ''smearing'' of values from the high and low end of the PDF spectrum of the various input parameters. The analysis also found a potential weakness in the deterministic analysis used in the SAR, a detail on drum loading was not taken into consideration. Waste emplacement operations thus far have handled drums from each shipment as a single unit, i. e. drums from each shipment are kept together. Shipments typically come from a single waste stream, and therefore the curie loading of each drum can be considered nearly identical to that of its neighbor. Calculations show that if there are large numbers of drums used in the accident scenario assessment, e. g. 28 drums in the waste hoist failure scenario (CH 5), then the probabilistic dose assessment calculations will diverge from the deterministically determined doses. As it is currently calculated, the deterministic dose assessment assumes one drum loaded to the maximum allowable (80 PE-Ci), and the remaining are 10 % of the maximum. The effective average of drum <b>curie</b> <b>content</b> is therefore less in the deterministic assessment than the probabilistic assessment for a large number of drums. EEG recommends that the WIPP SAR calculations be revisited and updated to include a probabilistic safety assessment...|$|E

The DWPF will use this list and the activities as one of the inputs {{for the development of the}} Production Records that relate to the radionuclide inventory. This work was initiated through Task Technical Request HLW/DWPF/TTR- 2005 - 0034; Rev. 0 entitled Sludge Batch 4 SRNL Shielded Cells Testing 4. Specifically, this report details results from performing, in part, Subtask 3 of the TTR and, in part, meets Deliverable 7 of the TTR. The work was performed following the Technical Task and Quality Assurance Plan (TTQAP), WSRC-RP- 2006 - 00310, Rev. 15 and Analytical Study Plan (ASP), WSRC-RP- 2006 - 00458, Rev. 16. In order to determine the reportable radionuclides for Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4) (Macro Batch 5 (MB 5)), a list of radioisotopes that may meet the criteria as specified by the Department of Energy's (DOE) WAPS was developed. All radioactive U- 235 fission products and all radioactive activation products that could be in the SRS HLW were considered. In addition, all U and Pu isotopes identified in WAPS 1. 6 were included in the list. This list was then evaluated and some isotopes excluded from the projection calculations. Based on measurements and analytical detection limits, twenty-nine radionuclides have been identified as reportable for DWPF SB 4 (MB 5) as specified by WAPS 1. 2. The 29 reportable nuclides are: Ni- 59; Ni- 63; Se- 79; Sr- 90; Zr- 93; Nb- 93 m; Tc- 99; Sn- 126; Cs- 137; Sm- 151; U- 233; U- 234; Np- 237; U- 238; Pu- 238; Pu- 239; Pu- 240; Am- 241; Pu- 241; Pu- 242; Am- 242 m; Am- 243; Cm- 244; Cm- 245; Cm- 246; Cm- 247; Bk- 247; Cm- 248; and Cf- 251. The WCP and WQR require that all of radionuclides present in the Design Basis glass be considered as the initial set of reportable radionuclides. For SB 4 (MB 5), all of the radionuclides in the Design Basis glass are reportable except for three radionuclides: Pd- 107, Cs- 135, and Th- 230. At no time through the calendar year 3115 did any of these three radionuclides contribute to more than 0. 01 % of the radioactivity on a Curie basis. Two additional uranium isotopes (U- 235 and - 236) must be added to the list of reportable radionuclides in order to meet WAPS 1. 6. All of the Pu isotopes and other U isotopes (U- 233, - 234, and - 238) identified in WAPS 1. 6 were already determined to be reportable according to WAPS 1. 2 This brings the total number of reportable radionuclides for SB 4 to thirty-one. The radionuclide measurements made for SB 4 (MB 5) are the most extensive conducted to date. Some method development/refinement occurred during the conduct of these measurements, leading to lower detection limits and more accurate measurement of some isotopes than was previously possible. Continuous improvement in the analytical measurements will likely continue, and this in turn should lead to improved detection limit values for some radionuclides and actual measurements for still others...|$|E
