5|$|The kings {{exempted}} {{some communities}} from {{the jurisdiction of}} the voivodes. The Diploma Andreanum, a royal charter of 1224, placed the territory of the Saxons between Broos (Szászváros, Orăștie) and Barót (Baraolt) under the authority of the Count of Hermannstadt (Nagyszeben, Sibiu), who was appointed by and directly subordinate to the monarchs. Likewise, a special royal official, the <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Székelys, administered the Székely community from around 1228. In the latter case, the two offices were united by custom in 1462: from then on each voivode was also appointed <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Székelys.|$|E

5|$|Ferino {{commanded}} the southern-most wing of Army of the Danube in 1799, {{and participated in}} the battles of Ostrach and Stockach. Napoleon awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1804; in 1805, Ferino became a Senator, and in 1808, raised him to <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire.

5|$|Following the Prussian campaign, Napoleon {{appointed}} Klein {{as governor}} of the Imperial palace. In 1807, Klein was called to the Senate. In 1808, he was raised by letters of patent to a <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire and awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Bavarian Lion.

5|$|In 608, general Heraclius the Elder, Exarch of Africa, revolted, urged on by Priscus, the <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Excubitors and {{son-in-law}} of Phocas.

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{contemporary}} Thomas Tuscus's {{reference to the}} Romanians' conflict with the Ruthenians in 1277 suggests that Romanian political entities existed in northern Moldavia at that time. In 1345 Andrew Lackfi, the <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Székelys led an army over the Carpathians and occupied this region where a border province was organized by Louis I of Hungary.|$|E

5|$|The new triumvirate {{lasted for}} about 40 days. The three {{emperors}} soon appointed new leaders {{for the military}} services. Bardas Phokas the Elder was appointed as the new Domestic of the Schools, and Constantine Gongyles {{as head of the}} Byzantine navy. Stephen and his brother managed to reward their fellow conspirators. Peteinos became patrikios and Great Hetaeriarch, Argyros was appointed <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stable, Kourtikes a patrikios and droungarios of the Watch.|$|E
5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Saxon immigration, the Székelys –Hungarian-speaking free warriors {{cultivating}} communal lands– were transferred to the southeast of the province. From the 13thcentury they were governed independently from the voivode by a royal official, the <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Székelys. Besides the Saxons, the Cistercians became the agents of expansion in Transylvania. When their abbey at Cârţa was established in the early 13thcentury, Andrew II ordered that the strip of land running up to the mountains between the rivers Olt, Cârţişoara and Arpaş be transferred from the Romanians to the new monastery.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time rebellions began in Roman Syria and Palaestina Prima in the wake of Heraclius' revolt. In 609 or 610 the Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius II, died. Many sources claim that the Jews were {{involved}} in the fighting, though it is unclear where they were members of factions and where they were opponents of Christians. Phocas responded by appointing Bonus as comes Orientis (<b>Count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East) to stop the violence. Bonus punished the Greens, a horse racing party, in Antioch for their role in the violence in 609.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire, Flanders became part of the Merovingian realm of Neustria. In the 9th century it became part of West Francia, forming a pagus within the kingdom of Charles the Bald. In 864, Cassel passed into the hands of Baldwin Ironarm, who expanded his holdings to become the first <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> County of Flanders. At the time, the town was {{on the edge of a}} deep bay of the North Sea, making it vulnerable to raids by the Vikings, who attacked and destroyed it in the 9th century. It was rebuilt by Baldwin's grandson, Arnulf I, in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|From there, the Arabs turned west towards Nicaea, {{the chief}} city of Bithynia and {{capital of the}} {{powerful}} Opsician Theme. The Arabs arrived before the city in late July, with al-Battal's vanguard preceding the main army. The Byzantines, probably {{under the command of}} the <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Opsicians, Artabasdos, did not meet them in the field, but instead retreated behind the city's walls. The Arabs assaulted the city for forty days, employing siege engines which destroyed a part of the walls, but eventually failed to take it. In late August, they raised the siege and departed, taking along many captives and much booty. The 12th-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian claims that the city's inhabitants abandoned it and fled by ship through Lake Ascania, whereupon the Arabs destroyed Nicaea, but this is clearly an error.|$|E

5|$|In 1702, Swedish forces {{invaded the}} Commonwealth {{as part of}} the Great Northern War, which had begun in 1700 between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia. Augustus II, king of Poland and Elector of Saxony, was an ally of the Russian tsar Peter I. Augustus's forces were defeated, and the king himself was forced back to Saxony. He was {{replaced}} by Charles with Stanisław Leszczyński, a Polish nobleman and <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire. Poniatowski, serving as a negotiator between the Wielkopolska Confederation and Charles XII, took the side of Leszczyński and distanced himself from the Sapiehas, formerly his patrons.|$|E
5|$|In Besançon, {{the people}} called for Catholic Philip II of Spain {{to help fight}} all heresies in 1571. In {{response}} to this, the new archbishop, Claude de La Baume, demanded that anybody suspected of heresy be expelled from Besançon. Local authorities kept <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Protestants in the city, expelling fifty of them later. The outcast Protestants took refuge in Switzerland and Montbéliard. In the midst of increasing violence in the region after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572, the Protestant personae non gratae gathered in Montbéliard and Neuchâtel before marching to Besançon in 1575.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Robert forced Henry {{to leave}} Rouen, {{probably}} because Henry's {{role in the}} fighting had been more prominent than his own, and possibly because Henry had asked to be formally reinstated as the <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cotentin. In early 1091, William Rufus invaded Normandy with a sufficiently large army to bring Robert to the negotiating table. The two brothers signed a treaty at Rouen, granting William Rufus a range of lands and castles in Normandy. In return, William Rufus promised to support Robert's attempts {{to regain control of}} the neighbouring county of Maine, once under Norman control, and help in regaining control over the Duchy, including Henry's lands. They nominated each other as heirs to England and Normandy, excluding Henry from any succession while either one of them lived.|$|E
