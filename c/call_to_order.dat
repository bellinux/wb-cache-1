25|$|An {{unveiling}} {{ceremony was}} held on Tuesday, July 1, 1890. Three of the association's executive committee members Edward Hawkins, Noble C. Butler, and John A. Holman, served as the Committee of Arrangements; a General Reception Committee was named and consisted of approximately one hundred Indianapolis citizens and two or more from each Indiana county. Indianapolis streets and buildings were decorated with lavish display of flags and bunting. A large, canvas-covered amphitheater with a stage, five hundred chairs and a raised pavilion for a large chorus of school children and other spectators was erected across Tennessee Street. The structure was elaborately decorated with bunting; the monument, which stood a few steps away, was covered in flags. Benches {{in front of the}} amphitheater supplied ticket-holder seating. Special invitations were sent to President Benjamin Harrison and ex-President Grover Cleveland and their cabinets, senators and congressmen, federal judges, and governors of other states. Governors from New York, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana attended the event. The ceremonies began with a parade, followed by a program of activities: a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> by Alvin P. Hovey, governor of Indiana; an invocation by Rev. Joseph S. Jenckes, of St. Paul’s Church, Indianapolis; music; a historical statement by Frederick Rand, president of the monument association; unveiling of the monument by Eliza C. Hendricks; a nine-round salute from Indianapolis Light Artillery; a dedicatory poem by James Whitcomb Riley of Indiana, read by Rev. Dr. D. W. Fisher, president of Hanover College; and address by David Turpie, U. S. Senator from Indiana; and a benediction from Reverend Francis Silas Chatard, Bishop of Vincennes.|$|E

Woodwind and muted trumpets are prominent throughout the Introduction, which ends with a number of rising cadences on strings and flutes.

A loud repeated chord, which Berger likens to a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> announces the moment for choosing the sacrificial victim. The [...] "Glorification of the Chosen One" [...] is brief and violent; in the [...] "Evocation of the Ancestors" [...] that follows, short phrases are interspersed with drum rolls. The [...] "Ritual Action of the Ancestors" [...] begins quietly, but slowly builds to a series of climaxes before subsiding suddenly into the quiet phrases that began the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Călinescu was unimpressed by Zarifopol's [...] "rather belated" [...] satire {{of bourgeois}} mores, since [...] "the bourgeois {{is no longer}} that ridiculous {{conservative}} figure". Yet, Zarifopol was not entirely anti-middle class: he believed his type of [...] "cold lucidity" [...] was primarily an in-built antidote to the decay of the [...] "colossal civilization" [...] that was liberal society. He issued what Florian calls a [...] "passionate <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> of the bourgeoisie, still a bearer of cultural values." [...] Himself a conservative, Zarifopol expressed his nostalgia for old-regime social differentiation and division of labor, against [...] "the political type", and for the nuclear family of patriarchy, against the [...] "neutralization" [...] of fathers in modern society. He criticizes both Francophilia and Germanophilia, noting that, although competing, they each supported deindividuation: the former, through corporatism; the latter, through militarism. While targeting philistinism, Din registrul... is itself an antiintellectualist manifesto. Zarifopol contended that intellectuals were an illusory social class (no economic interest bound together [...] "a lawyer with a novelist"), but still collectively responsible for the failures of a society such as Romania's.|$|E

2500|$|Parsons {{maintains}} that the Haustafeln in Ephesians and Colossians are clearly written to those within the church, not those outside. Many believe that in the 2Corinthians passage, the apostle Paul is speaking to situations of, at a minimum, potential disorder in the churches—to include the breaking of all social order. Therefore, he believes {{the purpose of the}} New Testament Household Codes likely was a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> in an unruly church. But Parsons says whatever the overall purpose of each particular Haustafel might have been, it is certain that the paired relationships are explained by their relationship to Christ. [...] "Correspondingly new behavior is expected from Christian believers in each of those social situations. Each member of the three pairs is equal to the other 'in Christ', but they are not to presume on that new position and make it an excuse for behaving in any unchristian manner." [...] There is no room in an [...] "in Christ" [...] relationship for feelings of antagonism, of superiority and inferiority, or of dehumanizing pride.|$|E

[...] In a measure, they are owing--what good is in them--to the discovery of many lies, and the escape from the power of evil. Not to liberty, but to the deliverance from evil or cruel masters. Brave men have dared to examine lies which had long been taught, {{not because they were}} free-thinkers, but because they were such stern and close thinkers that the lie could no longer escape them. Of course the restriction of thought, or of its expression, by persecution, is merely a form of violence, justifiable or not, as other violence is, according to the character of the persons against whom it is exercised, and the divine and eternal laws which it vindicates or violates. We must not burn a man alive for saying that the Athanasian creed is ungrammatical, nor stop a bishop's salary because we are getting the worst of an argument with him; neither must we let drunken men howl in the public streets at night. There is much that is true in the part of Mr. Mill's essay on Liberty which treats of freedom of thought; some important truths are there beautifully expressed, but many, quite vital, are omitted; and the balance, therefore, is wrongly struck. The liberty of expression, with a great nation, would become like that in a well-educated company, in which there is indeed freedom of speech, but not of clamor; or like that in an orderly senate, in which men who deserve to be heard, are heard in due time, and under determined restrictions. The degree of liberty you can rightly grant to a number of men is in the inverse ratio of their desire for it; and a general hush, or <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> would be often very desirable in this England of ours. For the rest, of any good or evil extent, it is impossible to say what measure is owing to restraint, and what to license where the right is balanced between them. I was not a little provoked one day, a summer or two since, in Scotland, because the Duke of Athol hindered me from examining the gneiss and slate junctions in Glen Tilt, at the hour convenient to me; but I saw them at last, and in quietness; and to the very restriction that annoyed me, owed, probably, the fact of their being in existence, instead of being blasted away by a mob-company; while the [...] "free" [...] paths and inlets of Loch Katrine and the Lake of Geneva are forever trampled down and destroyed, not by one duke, but by tens of thousands of ignorant tyrants.|$|E

It is also used to keep the meeting itself calm and orderly.|$|E

According to Duca, the PM intended to partake in the putsch, but [...] "in the end got scared ... because they sensed that if the Russian revolutionaries are to stage a coup, it would not go in their favor". Diamandy, who was structurally a monarchist, printed a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> addressed to the Romanian proletariat. Afterward, the Laborites portrayed themselves as patriotic resisters, and Lupu even threatened to duel those who questioned his loyalty. The PM continued to have links with the revolutionary activist Ilie Cătărău, who was Lupu's emissary among the Romanian-speakers of the Russian Bessarabia Governorate. He contacted the National Moldavian Party, whose leader Pan Halippa dismissed the PM as irrelevant.|$|E
