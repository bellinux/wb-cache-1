50|$|The method with a {{flexible}} stretcher {{was inspired by}} the method used to change the sheets of an impotent patient at the hospital. The flexible stretcher is placed beside the casualty, and a sheet is put on it. The third of the stretcher that is the closest to the <b>casualty</b> <b>is</b> folded on the middle third. The <b>casualty</b> <b>is</b> first rolled away from the stretcher, and the stretcher is slid {{against the back of the}} casualty. Then the <b>casualty</b> <b>is</b> put on his/her back and rolled on the other side; the stretcher and the sheet <b>are</b> unfolded. The <b>casualty</b> <b>is</b> wrapped into the sheet, and can be lifted with the handles of the flexible stretcher.|$|R
5|$|<b>Casualties</b> <b>were</b> {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The <b>casualties</b> <b>were</b> transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E

5|$|In McPherson's sector, Logan's {{division}} {{made another}} thrust down the Jackson Road at about 2 p.m., but met with heavy losses and {{the attack was}} called off. McClernand attacked again, reinforced by Quinby's division, but with no success. Union <b>casualties</b> <b>were</b> 502 killed, 2,550 wounded, and 147 missing, about evenly divided across the three corps. Confederate <b>casualties</b> <b>were</b> not reported directly, but {{are estimated to be}} under 500. Grant blamed McClernand's misleading dispatches for part of the poor results of the day, storing up another grievance against the political general who had caused him so many aggravations during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Opequon, {{also known}} as the Third Battle of Winchester, began in the morning on September 19, 1864. Some historians {{consider}} this the most important battle of the Shenandoah Campaign. Philip Sheridan's Army of the Shenandoah defeated Jubal Early's Army of the Valley. Union <b>casualties</b> <b>were</b> about 5,000 out of 40,000 men, while Confederate <b>casualties</b> <b>were</b> about 3,600 out of 12,000 men. Generals and colonels on both sides were killed, including Confederate Colonel George S. Patton Sr.—grandfather of the famous World War II tank commander, General George S. Patton. Confederate General Robert E. Rodes was killed, and Confederate cavalry generals Fitzhugh Lee and Bradley Johnson were among the wounded.

5|$|The now-isolated Rangers fended off {{numerous}} counter-attacks {{from the}} German 914th Grenadier Regiment. The {{men at the}} point became isolated and some were captured. By dawn on D+1, Rudder had only 90 men able to fight. Relief did not arrive until D+2, {{when members of the}} 743rd Tank Battalion and others arrived. By then, Rudder's men had run out of ammunition and were using captured German weapons. Several men were killed as a result, because the German weapons made a distinctive noise, and the men were mistaken for the enemy. By the end of the battle, the Rangers <b>casualties</b> <b>were</b> 135 dead and wounded, while German <b>casualties</b> <b>were</b> 50 killed and 40 captured. An unknown number of French collaborators were executed.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} Iraqi {{account that}} the Assyrian <b>casualties</b> <b>were</b> sustained during a short battle with Kurdish and Arab tribes has been discredited by all historians.
