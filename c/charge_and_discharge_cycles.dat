An experimental setup to evaluate the thermal performance of Sunflower Oil during <b>charging</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharging</b> <b>cycles</b> is presented. Energy and exergy based experimental thermal performance parameters are evaluated. Energy, exergy, thermal gradient and exergy factor values are evaluated with experimental tests. High temperature charging {{is found to be}} the most viable option. This option results in higher energies, higher exergies, higher thermal gradients and higher exergy factors. For the <b>discharging</b> <b>cycles,</b> a high flow-rate results in a fast heat transfer rate. This fast rate of heat transfer destroys thermal stratification earlier but heats up water faster. The lower discharging flow-rate ensures that the <b>discharging</b> <b>cycle</b> can be carried out for a longer period. This is beneficial in utilizing the stored energy and exergy for a longer period, such that it can be used for cooking foods that take a longer time to cook. An optimal discharging flow-rate is also suggested. The optimal flow-rate comprises between fast heat transfer and using the stored energy more effectively. Exergy factor profiles during <b>charging</b> <b>and</b> <b>discharging</b> <b>cycles</b> show characteristic dips which correspond to the time when the thermal gradients begin to decrease.
