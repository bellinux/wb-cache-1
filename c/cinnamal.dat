Benzyl benzoate, <b>Cinnamal,</b> Eugenol, Limonene and Linalool {{were included in the}} labelling because they are among the ingredients covered by Directive 2003/15/EC. It is therefore possible that they were components of the original formula, rather than newly added ingredients.|$|E
5000|$|A similar test is the [...] "cinnamon challenge", {{in which}} a person must eat a {{tablespoon}} of cinnamon. Again, this is a small amount of a familiar food, but it quickly dries out the mouth's saliva, making the powder hard to swallow. Some who attempt this challenge report that the cinnamon is especially unpleasant, and that its dust is comparable to pepper spray. Furthermore, the presence of the aldehyde <b>cinnamal</b> in the essential oil of the cinnamon powder often irritates the skin and mucous membranes, adding further difficulty to the challenge.|$|E
40|$|Inhalation of the {{fragrance}} chemicals, isoeugenol and <b>cinnamal,</b> by mice resulted in immune reactions in the respiratory tract. This {{was observed in}} experiments performed by the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Enviroment) of which results indicate that inhalation of some fragrance chemicals could induce unwanted effects on the immune system. Fragrance chemicals are common ingredients in such consumer products as cosmetics and scented products. Several fragrance chemicals are known to cause allergy after skin exposure, but it is unknown whether inhalation of these fragrance chemicals can cause allergic reactions or other unwanted immune reactions. Till recently, {{it was assumed that}} inhalation of fragrance chemicals was harmless for humans, because there was no exposure via inhalation. However, applying fragrance chemicals in scented products used indoors, has changed this. RIVM investigated the effects of inhalation of isoeugenol and <b>cinnamal,</b> fragrance chemicals that can cause skin allergy. Mice were exposed to {{the fragrance}} chemicals via inhalation. Effects on the immune system were measured using a respiratory lymph node assay, which measures cell proliferation in lymph nodes of the respiratory tract. Inhalation of both isoeugenol and <b>cinnamal</b> resulted in stimulation of the immune system of the respiratory tract. The effects of isoeugenol were more pronounced than those of <b>cinnamal.</b> This is in contrast with results observed after skin exposure, after which both these fragrance chemicals were found equally potent in inducing skin allergy. This implies that effects of fragrance chemicals on the immune system depend on the route of exposure. Relevant routes of exposure should then be used to predict the hazard of inhaling these compounds: skin for cosmetics and the respiratory tract for scented products. To obtain more insight into the hazards of fragrance chemicals used in scented products, RIVM is advising assessment of more fragrance chemicals in the respiratory lymph node assay...|$|E
40|$|The European {{legislation}} {{on cosmetic products}} has recently required the declaration of 26 compounds (24 volatile chemicals and 2 natural extracts) on the label of final products when exceeding a stipulated cut-off level. In this work a rapid reliable and specific RP-HPLC method coupled with diode array detector (DAD) has been developed for the simultaneous determination and quantification of the 24 volatile chemicals: amyl <b>cinnamal,</b> benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, citral, eugenol, hydroxy-citronellal, isoeugenol, amylcinnamyl alcohol, benzyl salicylate, <b>cinnamal,</b> coumarin, geraniol, Lyral (hydroxy-methylpentylcyclohexene carboxaldehyde), anisyl alcohol, benzyl cinnamate, farnesol, Lilial (2 -(4 -tert-butylbenzyl) propionaldehyde) linalool, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, hexyl <b>cinnamal,</b> limonene, methylheptin carbonate, alpha-isomethyl ionone (3 -methyl- 4 -(2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -yl) - 3 -buten- 2 -one). The 24 analytes were appropriately separated over a running time of 40 min, on a C 18 column using a simple gradient elution (acetonitrile/water) with flow rate from 0. 7 to 1. 0 ml/min and UV acquisition at 210, 254 and 280 nm. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r 2 > 0. 99) within test ranges. The method was successfully applied to the qualitative and quantitative determination of the potential allergens in four commercial scented products, with satisfactory accuracy and precision. The results indicated that this simple and efficient method {{can be used for}} quality assessment of complex matrices such us cosmetic scented products...|$|E

40|$|Background: Petrolatum {{patch test}} {{preparations}} are for practical reasons often applied in test chambers in advance, several hours or even {{days before the}} patient is tested. As many fragrance compounds are volatile it may be suspected that petrolatum preparations applied in test chambers are not stable over time. Objectives: To investigate the stability of petrolatum preparations of the 7 chemically defined components in the fragrance mix (FM I) when stored in test chambers. Material and methods: Samples of petrolatum preparations applied in test chambers stored at room temperature and in a refrigerator between 4 and 144 h were analyzed using liquid chromatographic methods. Results: The concentration decreased by ≥ 20 % within 8 h in 4 out of 7 preparations stored in Finn chambers at room temperature. When stored in a refrigerator only the preparation of <b>cinnamal</b> had decreased by ≥ 20 % within 24 h. The stability of preparations of <b>cinnamal</b> stored in IQ chambers with a plastic cover was slightly better, but like the preparations applied in Finn chambers, the concentration decreased by ≥ 20 % within 4 h at room temperature and within 24 h in a refrigerator. <b>Cinnamal</b> and cinnamyl alcohol {{were found to be}} more stable when analyzed as ingredients in FM I compared to when analyzed in individual preparations. Conclusions: Within a couple of hours several fragrance allergens evaporate from test chambers to an extent that may affect the outcome of the patch test. Application to the test chambers should be performed as close to the patch test occasion as possible and storage in a refrigerator is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{widespread}} use, fragrances {{are among the}} most common causes of contact allergic dermatitis, second only to nickel. During a five-year period 3, 065 patients with contact dermatitis were patch tested using a specific mix of fragrances. 509 (16. 6 %) patients were allergic to the fragrance mix, while 258 (8. 4 %) patients exhibited an allergic reaction to Myroxylon pereirae (balsam of Peru). Between those 509 patients, 157 were patch tested with eight individual substances contained in the fragrance mix: <b>cinnamal,</b> cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol, isoeugenol, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, alpha-amyl <b>cinnamal</b> and Evernia prunastri (oak moss). The most frequent allergens were isoeugenol 57. 9 % (91 / 157), eugenol 55. 4 % (87 / 157), cinnamyl alcohol 34. 4 % (54 / 157) and Evernia prunastri (oak moss) 24. 2 % (38 / 157). There were 62 patients (39. 5 %) who exhibited an allergic reaction to both the fragrance mix and Myroxylon pereirae (balsam of Peru). The results prove the importance of avoiding allergens in daily life, especially in industrial and cosmetic products.

40|$|Currently, hazard {{characterization}} of skin sensitizers {{is based on}} data obtained from studies examining single chemicals. Many consumer products, however, contain mixtures of sensitizers that might interact {{in such a way}} that the response induced by a substance is higher than predicted in the hazard assessment. To assess interaction of skin sensitizers in a mixture, a dose-response modeling approach is applied. With this approach, it is possible to assess whether or not responses from mixtures of sensitizers can be predicted from the dose-response information obtained from individual chemicals using dose addition. We selected the skin sensitizers isoeugenol and <b>cinnamal,</b> frequently occurring together in consumer products, to be examined in an adjusted local lymph node assay (LLNA). Cell number and cytokine production (IL- 10 and IFN-c) of the auricular lymph nodes were measured as hallmarks of the skin sensitization response. We found that dose addition for these 2 skin sensitizers closely predicted the effects from mixtures of both chemicals across the broad dose range tested. Hence, isoeugenol and <b>cinnamal</b> show no synergistic effects in the LLNA. Therefore, hazard assessment and risk assessment of these substances can be performed without taking into account mixture exposure. Key words: skin sensitization; mixture; dose response; synergism; dose addition; LLNA. Allergic contact dermatitis is an adverse human health effec...|$|E
40|$|The most {{promising}} {{of a number}} of new addition type polyimides and polyaromatic melamine (NCNS) resins for use in high performance composite materials. Three different cure temperature ranges were of interest: 530 - 560 K (500 - 550 F), 475 - 530 K (400 - 500 F), and 450 K (350 F). Examined were a wide variety of polyimide precursors terminated with 5 norbornene groups and addition polymerized at 560 K similar to PMR- 15 and LARC- 160 polyimides. In addition, a number of lower curing <b>cinnamal</b> end capped polyimides and a bismaleimide were investigated but were not found promising.

30|$|These {{findings}} {{are in line}} with previous analyses and show that the situation {{does not seem to have}} improved in the last years: Rastogi and his coworkers had found that 91  % of natural cosmetics on the Danish market contained at least one of the allergenic fragrances [44]. Steinemann found that the composition of volatile organic compounds in ‘green’-labeled fragranced products was not significantly different from that of other fragranced products with regard to the number of hazardous chemicals as defined under U.S. federal law [45]. Dodson described, that most common natural fragrance chemicals included the allergenic terpenes limonene, hexyl <b>cinnamal,</b> and linalool [27]. The frequency of the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’ was analyzed also in the ingredient lists of conventional deodorants in a previous study where 76  % of the products contained at least one of the ‘ 26 fragrance allergens’ [46].|$|E
40|$|The aroma compositions, sensory attributes, {{and their}} {{correlations}} of various traditional Chinese sweet fermented flour pastes (SFFPs) were investigated. SFFPs, including LEEJ, LEEH, and XH 6, showed high overall acceptance scores of 8. 00, 8. 21, and 7. 50, respectively. Ninety-six volatile compounds were detected using solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped SFFPs into three clusters {{according to their}} concentrations and compositions of volatile components. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that volatile compounds, including ethyl phenylacetate, 5 -methyl furfural, amyl <b>cinnamal,</b> ethyl myristate, decyl aldehyde, 1 -phenylethyl acetate, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 3 -buten- 2 -ol, butanoic acid, and caproaldehyde, were highly negatively correlated with saltiness, sourness, and bitterness, while they were positively correlated with sweetness, umami, richness, and acceptance. The obvious correlation between flavor profiles and sensory attributes could help online monitoring of SFFPs’ flavor quality during production...|$|E
40|$|Axillary {{dermatitis}} is {{a common}} problem, particularly in individuals with contact allergy to fragrances. Many individuals suspect their deodorant to be the causal product of their fragrance allergy. It {{has been shown that}} deodorants containing cinnamic aldehyde (<b>cinnamal)</b> can elicit axillary dermatitis in patients sensitized to this substance. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the importance of hydroxycitronellal used in deodorants for the development of axillary dermatitis, when applied by individuals with and without contact allergy to this fragrance chemical. Patch tests with deodorants and ethanolic solutions containing hydroxycitronellal, as well as repeated open application tests (ROAT) with roll-on deodorants with and without hydroxycitronellal at different concentrations, were performed in 14 dermatitis patients, 7 with and 7 without contact allergy to hydroxycitronellal. A positive ROAT was noted only in the patients hypersensitive to hydroxycitronellal (P < 0. 001) and only in the axilla to which the deodorants containing hydroxycitronellal had been applied (P < 0. 001). Deodorants containing hydroxycitronellal in the concentration range of 0. 032 - 0. 32 % used twice daily on healthy skin in individuals hypersensitive to hydroxycitronellal can elicit axillary dermatitis in a few weeks. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background Fragrance mix I (FM I) and {{fragrance}} mix II (FM II) in the European baseline {{series are}} used as screening tools for fragrance contact allergy. In 2005 the European Union (EU) required labelling of 26 fragrances when present in cosmetic products. INCI nomenclature is obligatory for such labelling. Objectives To describe frequencies of contact allergy to these 26 fragrance substances, and to evaluate clinical relevance of these positive reactions. Methods Three hundred and twenty patients with eczema suspected of being contact allergy to fragrances or cosmetics were patch tested with the EU-declared fragrance chemicals, FM I and FM II. Results There were 76 positive reactions in 33 patients. Most reactions were to hexyl <b>cinnamal</b> and hydroxyisohexyl 3 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde in 3. 1 %, followed by Evernia furfuracea (2. 5 %) and cinnamyl alcohol (2. 5 %). Twelve reactions to FM I and II were not confirmed by separate ingredients. Clinical relevance of positive reactions to fragrances was certain in 20 / 33 (61 %). Conclusions 10. 3 % of the patients had positive patch tests in the EU-list. Hydroxyisohexyl 3 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, a component of FM II, was the most frequent allergen, followed by Evernia furfuracea. Since Evernia furfuracea {{is not part of}} FM I or FM II, relevant reactions can be missed when only the European baseline series is used...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fragrance mix I (FM I) and {{fragrance}} mix II (FM II) {{are included}} in the European baseline series as screening substances for fragrance contact allergy. Objectives: To investigate the frequency of allergic reactions to FM I, FM II and their ingredients in consecutively patch tested patients. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of data from 4430 patients patch tested between 2009 and 2015 was performed. Results: Of the patients, 6. 5 % were FM I-positive and 3. 2 % were FM II-positive. Forty-five per cent of FM I-positive patients did not have positive reactions to FM I ingredients. Thirty-five per cent of those who were FM II-positive did not have positive reactions to FM II ingredients. Twenty-seven per cent of those with positive reactions to {{one or more of the}} FM I ingredients were FM I-negative, and 36 % of those who had positive reactions to one or more of the FM II ingredients were FM II-negative. The allergens with the highest pick-up rates were Evernia prunastri (1. 8 %), <b>cinnamal</b> (1. 3 %), citral (1. 2 %), and hydroxyisohexyl 3 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde (1. 2 %). Significant differences were observed in the proportions of positive reactions to FM I, FM II, eugenol, isoeugenol, and farnesol when results from patch testing with materials from different suppliers were compared. Conclusions: There is a risk of missing fragrance contact allergy when testing with only the fragrance mixes is performed. The use of preparations from different suppliers may affect the patch test results...|$|E
