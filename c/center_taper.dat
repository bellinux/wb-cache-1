40|$|The sizing, criteria, cost analysis, and {{optimized}} taper of the Solar Power Satellite (SPS) {{transmitting antenna}} are discussed. The sizing parameters considered were a thermal limit of 23 kW/sq m in the antenna, a peak power density of 23 mW/sq cm in the ionosphere, and cost effectiveness. Cost schedules and equations are presented for the SPS, and four antenna tapers are analyzed and compared, including the reference 10 dB Gaussian taper. An even powered quadratic series is formulated to minimize electricity cost and stay within thermal and ionospheric power level limits. The optimized Johnson Space <b>Center</b> <b>taper</b> {{is found to}} display the lowest energy costs, 4 % below the 10 dB Gaussian, and can deliver 5. 69 GW at 45. 4 mills/kWh to the grid.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of cup centers. The {{woodworking}} variety is a variation of the traditional live center. This type of cup center has a central point like a normal live center and also has a ring surrounding it. The ring supports the softer material around the center point and prevents the wood from splitting under pressure from the central point. A different variety of cup center is used for metalworking. The metalworking variety of cup <b>center</b> has a <b>tapered</b> hole rather than a conical point. It supports the part by making contact with the outside diameter {{of the end of the}} part, rather than using a center hole.|$|R
5000|$|Shot, {{small and}} round and {{delivered}} without spin, is ballistically inefficient. As the shot leaves the barrel {{it begins to}} disperse in the air. The resulting cloud of pellets {{is known as the}} shot pattern, or shotgun shot spread. The ideal pattern would be a circle with an even distribution of shot throughout, with a density sufficient to ensure enough pellets will intersect the target to achieve the desired result, such as a kill when hunting or a break when shooting clay targets. In reality the pattern is closer to a Gaussian, or normal distribution, with a higher density in the <b>center</b> that <b>tapers</b> off at the edges. Patterns are usually measured by firing at a 30 in diameter circle on a large sheet of paper placed at varying distances. The hits inside the circle are counted, and compared to the total number of pellets, and the density of the pattern inside the circle is examined. An [...] "ideal" [...] pattern would put nearly 100% of the pellets in the circle and would have no voids—any region where a target silhouette will fit and not cover 3 or more holes is considered a potential problem.|$|R
40|$|This {{preliminary}} investigation introduces {{the use of}} the Regier number as a flutter constraint criterion for aeroelastic structural optimization.

An example problem for a low-speed, high-aspect-ratio, light-aircraft wing is presented.

40|$|The end-gun {{discharge}} of center pivots is {{expressed as a}} ratio of the discharge at the pivot. Using this ratio, equations are developed for the friction correction factor and pressure distribution factor. If end-gun discharge is reduced to zero, then these equations reduce to the well-established equation for the friction correction factor and pressure distribution factor. For an end-gun ratio of unity, the friction correction factor also becomes unity, reflecting that the lateral {{is in fact a}} pipeline without outlets. The pressure distribution factor becomes linear, reflecting that head loss varies linearly with length. For a lateral of constant diameter and typical end- gun discharge there is a significant increase in head loss due to friction. However, there is insignificant difference in the estimate using either this technique or the effective radius technique. The pressure distribution factor is slightly higher, indicating that in laterals with end guns the pressure head {{toward the center of the}} lateral is higher. The equations presented can be used to design center-pivot laterals with end guns or the first segment of a <b>tapered</b> <b>center</b> pivot lateral...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a sugar beet field at Collage of Agriculture Experimental Station, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. In order to describe the pattern of spatial variations and density of Chenopodium album, Solanum nigrum, Amaranthus sp., Portulaca oleracea, Echinochla crus-galli, and Convulvulus arvense as the main prevalent annual and perennial weeds of sugar beet fields, geostatistic methods were used. Samples were taken by systematic method from the corners of (7 m × 7 m) grids, using (0. 5 m × 0. 5 m) quadrates in three stages (before application of herbicides, after herbicide treatment, and before harvesting sugar beets). The integrity of spatial variation of variables was determined by using variogram functions and distribution maps of species. The variograms indicated that variations of all variables did not happen by chance. The maximum and minimum ranges of variation were observed in Solanum nigrum (by 142. 7 m) and Portulaca oleracea (by 1. 5 m), respectively. Both maximum and minimum ranges of variations were related to pre herbicide application. The highest and the lowest spatial correlations were related to Amaranthus sp. (in the third sampling treatment) and Solanum nigrum (in the first stage of sampling), respectively. The spatial distribution maps confirmed the patchiness distribution of the weeds. The patch of weed was constructed from a dense point at the <b>center,</b> gradually <b>tapering</b> toward the edges. The patches were skewed across the rows and irrigation channels. The structure of patches altered during the growing season. Any information on the distribution of weeds in the fields can be useful to improve decision makings in relation to applying the herbicides, selecting the herbicide type or applying the amount of herbicide. Also it can be useful to better design of weed control programs...|$|R

Two separate test specimens were used in this evaluation. Testing was performed in cold-gas and hot-fire environments, and under both static and dynamic pressurization conditions. Analysis of test results demonstrates safety factors against initiation of visually undetectable cracks in excess of 8. 0. The Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) forward segment is cast with PBAN propellant (TP-HI 148) to form T an 1 1 -point star configuration that transitions to a <b>tapered</b> <b>center</b> perforated bore (see Figure 1). The geometry of the transition region between the fin valleys and the bore causes a localized area of high strain during horizontal storage.

40|$|This work {{integrates}} existing structural geology {{data with}} new detailed geomorphic {{analyses of the}} fluvial network to characterize active and potentially seismogenic faults bordering the Lunigiana and Garfagnana basins in the northern Apennines of Italy. These two basins are NW–SE-oriented asymmetric grabens, bordered by several normal faults with a poorly known, but probable recent slip history. Several strong earthquakes (M 5. 0 – 6. 5) {{have occurred in the}} area in the last millennium, demonstrating {{that this is one of}} the most seismically active areas of the northern Apennines. However, the lack of reliable instrumental data for strong earthquakes, generally low deformation rates, and poor exposures of faulted Quaternary sediments render the characterization of active, seismogenic faults problematic. Here, we quantify the relationships between faults and watershed-scale geomorphology using 10 -m digital topography to extract channel and basin metrics, such as steepness, concavity, and stream length-gradient indices of modeled river longitudinal profiles. In particular, convex segments of longitudinal profiles (knickpoints) are investigated in the spatial context of suspected active faults. Several knickpoints arise locally from juxtaposed rock types of different erodibility; however, many others mapped along major normal faults have a clear tectonic origin. In fact, the height of the footwall knickpoints (the closest to the fault trace) varies along-strike the fault, increasing toward the fault <b>center</b> and <b>tapering</b> off toward the fault tips, mimicking the expected displacement profile of a fault. In these cases, we consider the knickpoint height as a proxy of the fault throw accumulated by the youngest fault activity, probably during the late Quaternary. The along-strike distribution of knickpoint heights helps in defining the likely segmentation pattern of the fault system. The identified active normal fault segments have lengths ranging from 9. 5 to 28. 5 km. The inferred late Quaternary throw rate ranges from 0. 3 to 0. 8 mm/a; however, the absence of any offset datable material limits our ability to assign precise numeric ages and rates of offset to the faulting...|$|R

The objectives of this work were to identify and characterize Colletotrichum species isolates responsible for anthracnose of mango in Southwest of Ethiopia. Samples of infected mango leaves, panicles and immature fruits were collected from home gardens of nine districts in Southwestern part of Ethiopia. Among them eight isolates of Colletotrichum species with distinct morphology on PDA were observed in each group. Colony color, shape and diameter of every culture were recorded, conidial size and shapes were computed from 20 conidia per isolate. The results showed that f Colletotrichum species isolates were grouped into three distinct morphological types: Colletotrichum gloeosporioide morph type I (37 %) with hyaline cylindrical conidia rounded both ends, Colletotrichum acutatum morphotype II (38 %) conidia mass in the <b>center</b> and fusiform <b>tapered</b> to a point in both ends, and Colletotrichum asianum morph type III (25 %) cylindrical conidia with obtuse to slightly rounded ends.

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1979, Morry Hummel, {{who worked in the}} Curtis Wright {{experimental}} department during World War II, purchased the plans for Gary Watson’s Windwagon and the development of the [...] "Hummel Bird" [...] began. Because of the weather in Hummel's state of Ohio, a canopy was needed. The horizontal stabilizer attach construction was redesigned. The seat back was raised 5 inches so a shoulder harness could be added, and the instrument panel was raised 2 inches, increasing fuel capacity and leg room. The wing was completely re-engineered. The dihedral break on the Windwagon was in the middle; Morry made the center wing section straight and put the dihedral break {{at the point where the}} outer wing panels bolt to the center section. The Hummel Bird spar is built up of 1/8 6061-t6 aluminum angle spar caps, with a [...]040, 2024-t3 spar web. The spar cap angles are doubled in the <b>center</b> section, and <b>tapered</b> in the outer panels. The number of ribs was increased, the thickness of the skin was reduced, and the skins get even thinner toward the tips. The ribs are now a two piece design with one in front of the spar(nose rib) and one between the spars(main rib). The skins are riveted to the spars leaving no bump where the one piece ribs previously pushed the skin up where it crossed the spar. Both the Teenie Two and the Windwagon had tricycle landing gear, however, Morry preferred conventional landing gear so taildragger gear became a popular option. There were other changes as well, compromising a significant improvement over the wind wagon. He finished his project in July 1980. In July 1982, the plane was featured in an article written by Jack Cox, of Sport Aviation. Jack dubbed Morry’s new creation the “Hummel Bird” and the name stuck.|$|R
