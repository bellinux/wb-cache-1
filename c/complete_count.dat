40|$|The linear {{complexity}} and the $k$-error {{linear complexity}} of a sequence {{have been used}} as important security measures for key stream sequence strength in linear feedback shift register design. By using the sieve method of combinatorics, the $k$-error linear complexity distribution of $ 2 ^n$-periodic binary sequences is investigated based on Games-Chan algorithm. First, for $k= 2, 3 $, the <b>complete</b> <b>counting</b> functions on the $k$-error linear complexity of $ 2 ^n$-periodic binary sequences with linear complexity less than $ 2 ^n$ are characterized. Second, for $k= 3, 4 $, the <b>complete</b> <b>counting</b> functions on the $k$-error linear complexity of $ 2 ^n$-periodic binary sequences with linear complexity $ 2 ^n$ are presented. Third, for $k= 4, 5 $, the <b>complete</b> <b>counting</b> functions on the $k$-error linear complexity of $ 2 ^n$-periodic binary sequences with linear complexity less than $ 2 ^n$ are derived. As a consequence of these results, the counting functions for the number of $ 2 ^n$-periodic binary sequences with the 3 -error linear complexity are obtained, and the <b>complete</b> <b>counting</b> functions on the 4 -error linear complexity of $ 2 ^n$-periodic binary sequences are obvious.

Compared with a control condition, who received only the <b>complete</b> <b>count,</b> participants in the balance condition gave ratings of the perceived agreement among the experts that did not discriminate as clearly between issues with and without strong expert consensus. Participants in the balance condition also perceived less agreement among the experts in general, and were less likely to think that there was enough agreement among experts on the high-consensus issues to guide government policy. Evidently, "false balance" can distort perceptions of expert opinion even when participants would seem to have all the information needed to correct for its influence...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dengue {{hemorrhagic fever}} {{is a major}} public health problem in several {{countries}} around the world. Dengue vector surveillance is an important methodology to determine when and where to take the control action. We used {{a combination of the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) /Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and the im-mature sampling count method to improve dengue vector surveillance. Both <b>complete</b> <b>count</b> and sampling count methods were used simultaneously to collect immature dengue vectors in all houses and all containers in one village in eastern Thailand to determine the efficiency of the sampling count technique. A hand-held GPS unit was used to record the location of surveyed houses. Linear regression indicated a high correlation between total immature populations resulting from the <b>complete</b> <b>count</b> and estimates from sampling count of immature stages. The immature survey data and the GPS coordinates of house location were combined into GIS maps showing distribution of immature density and clustering of immature stages and positive containers in the study area. This approach could be used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of dengue vector surveillance for targeting vector control. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a major public health problem in Thailand 1 and many tropical regions of the world. 2 Controlling the principal vector, Aedes aegypti (L.), is the only known method to reduce disease incidence.
