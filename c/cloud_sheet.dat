Regional modelling {{can be of}} particular use for this task, as this approach provides sufficient resolution to resolve {{the structure of the}} produced track including their meteorological environment whilst relying on the same formulations of parameterisations as many general circulation models. In this work we simulate a particular case of ship tracks embedded in an optically thin stratus <b>cloud</b> <b>sheet</b> which was observed by a polar orbiting satellite at 12 : 00 UTC on 26 January 2003 around the Bay of Biscay. The simulations, which include moving ship emissions, show that the model is indeed able to capture the structure of the track at a horizontal grid spacing of 2 km and to qualitatively capture the observed cloud response in all simulations performed. At least a doubling of the cloud optical thickness was simulated in all simulations together with an increase in cloud droplet number concentration by about 40 cm − 3 (300 %) and decrease in effective radius by about 5 μm (40 %). Furthermore, the ship emissions lead to an increase in liquid water path in at least 25 % of the track regions. We are confident in the model's ability to capture key processes of ship track formation. However, it was found that realistic ship emissions lead to unrealistic aerosol perturbations near the source regions within the simulated tracks due to grid-scale dilution and homogeneity. Combining the regional-modelling approach with comprehensive field studies could likely improve our understanding of the sensitivities and biases in ACI parameterisations, and could therefore help to constrain global ACI estimates, which strongly rely on these parameterisations...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol from biomass burning {{has been}} shown to {{strongly}} modify cloud microphysical properties and cloud lifetime through the so-called “indirect effect. ” However, {{in the case of a}} lack of wet scavenging, it stays suspended for days to weeks and can be transported to considerable distances within an elevated layer above low-level cloud tops with minimal aerosol–cloud interactions. The observations carried out during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI) 2000 dry season field campaign often revealed the presence of an elevated biomass-burning aerosol layer above a semi-permanent stratiform cloud deck off the southern African coasts. MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products were used to investigate the existence of an aerosol indirect effect on convective clouds. Results are presented documenting cloud effective radius and cloud radiative forcing variations due to the presence of the aerosol during the development of convective clouds. Radiative transfer simulations in the visible (0. 8 μm, VIS) and near-infrared (1. 6, 2. 1 and 3. 7 μm, NIR) wavelengths were instrumental in establishing the extent of the influence of a biomass-burning aerosol layer overlying a water <b>cloud</b> <b>sheet</b> on the MODIS satellite retrieval of cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius and the optical thickness. The radiative transfer simulations suggest that the presence of the aerosol induces a significant underestimation of the cloud optical thickness, whereas an underestimation of the retrieved effective radius is more pronounced in the retrieval that makes use of the 1. 6 μm waveband than the 2. 1 and 3. 7 μm wavebands. The MODIS cloud products of 3 days of the SAFARI 2000 campaign were analyzed to determine whether the aerosol induced biases evidenced by the simulations also affect the operational cloud property retrieval. Cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius, are usually employed as indicators of the occurrence of aerosol–cloud interaction according to the “indirect effect. ” However, these results highlight some of the difficulties associated with satellite retrievals of cloud properties and show the importance of an accurate sighting of the cloud and aerosol layer top and bottom heights in order to prevent erroneous detections of indirect effects...|$|E

40|$|Using self-gravitational hydrodynamical {{numerical}} simulations, {{we investigated}} {{the evolution of}} high-density turbulent molecular clouds swept by a colliding flow. The interaction of shock waves due to turbulence produces networks of thin filamentary clouds with a sub-parsec width. The colliding flow accumulates the filamentary <b>clouds</b> into a <b>sheet</b> <b>cloud</b> and promotes active star formation for initially high-density clouds. Clouds with a colliding flow exhibit a finer filamentary network than clouds without a colliding flow. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the density and column density can be fitted by lognormal functions for clouds without colliding flow. When the initial turbulence is weak, the column density PDF has a power-law wing at high column densities. The colliding flow considerably deforms the PDF, such that the PDF exhibits a double peak. The stellar mass distributions reproduced here {{are consistent with the}} classical initial mass function with a power-law index of $- 1. 35 $ when the initial clouds have a high density. The distribution of stellar velocities agrees with the gas velocity distribution, which can be fitted by Gaussian functions for clouds without colliding flow. For clouds with colliding flow, the velocity dispersion of gas tends to be larger than the stellar velocity dispersion. The signatures of colliding flows and turbulence appear in channel maps reconstructed from the simulation data. Clouds without colliding flow exhibit a cloud-scale velocity shear due to the turbulence. In contrast, clouds with colliding flow show a prominent anti-correlated distribution of thin filaments between the different velocity channels, suggesting collisions between the filamentary clouds.

5000|$|Throughout the 19th century {{nomenclatures}} and classifications {{of cloud}} types were developed, followed {{late in the}} century by cloud atlases. The first nomenclature ("naming", also [...] "numbering") of clouds in English, by Luke Howard, was published in 1802. [...] It followed a similar effort in French by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1801. Howard's nomenclature defined four fundamental types of clouds: cirrus or thread-cloud, cumulus or heap-cloud, stratus or flat <b>cloud</b> (level <b>sheet),</b> and nimbus or rain-cloud (see Classification of clouds). There followed {{a long period of}} development of the field of meteorology and the classification of clouds, leading up to 1896, the International Year of Clouds.

Both men died before the classification was settled, however. Ley wrote a book, Cloudland, that is well known to meteorologists. Abercromby contributed a number of papers on the subject, stressing the most important (and then novel) fact that clouds are the same everywhere in the world. He also wrote in collaboration with Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson a detailed classification of clouds. This was adopted in Hildebrandsson's 1890 Cloud Atlas.|$|R
40|$|Colliding {{supersonic}} bulk flows shape {{observable properties}} and internal physics of various astrophysical objects, like O-star winds, molecular <b>clouds,</b> galactic <b>sheets,</b> binaries, or gamma-ray bursts. Using numerical simulations, {{we show that}} the bulk flows leave a clear imprint on the collision zone, its mean properties and the turbulence it naturally develops. Our model setup consists of 3 D head-on colliding isothermal hydrodynamical flows with Mach numbers between 2 and 43. Simulation results {{are in line with}} expectations from self-similarity: root mean square Mach numbers (Mrms) scale linearly with upstream Mach numbers, mean densities remain limited to a few times the upstream density. The density PDF is not log-normal. The turbulence is inhomogeneous: weaker in the zone center than close to the confining shocks. It is anisotropic: while Mrms is generally supersonic, Mrms transverse to the upstream flow is always subsonic. We argue that uniform, isothermal, head-on colliding flows generally disfavor isotropic, supersonic turbulence. The anisotropy carries over to other quantities like the density variance - Mach number relation. Structure functions differ depending on whether they are computed along a line-of-sight perpendicular or parallel to the upstream flow. We suggest that such line-of-sight effects should be kept in mind when interpreting turbulence characteristics derived from observations.

5|$|Cirrocumulus <b>clouds</b> form in <b>sheets</b> or {{patches and}} do not cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of the}} cumuliform category, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|R

In this study, the formation of these banded structures is considered with a global, bounce-averaged model of electron transport, and it is concluded that this structure is a natural occurrence when plasma sheet electrons are captured on closed drift paths near the Earth. These bands do not appear unless there is capture of plasma sheet electrons; convection along open drift paths making open pass around the Earth do {{not have time to}} develop this feature. The separation of high-energy bands from the injection population due to the preferential advection of the gradient-curvature drift creates spikes in the energy distribution, which overlap to form a series of bands in the energy spectrograms. The lowest band is the bulk of the injected population in the sub-key energy range.

And Man said: 'There is a hidden purpose, could we but fathom it, and the purpose is good; for we must reverence something, and in the visible world there is nothing worthy of reverence.' And Man stood aside from the struggle, resolving that God intended harmony to come out of chaos by human efforts. And when he followed the instincts which God had transmitted to him from his ancestry of beasts of prey, he called it Sin, and asked God to forgive him. But he doubted whether he could be justly forgiven, until he invented a divine Plan by which God's wrath was to have been appeased. And seeing the present was bad, he made it yet worse, that thereby the future might be better. And he gave God thanks for the strength that enabled him to forgo even the joys that were possible.

Our results indicate that the dispersion relations for these two dimensional waves have similar forms for the two geometries considered here.

40|$|When {{subjected}} to sufficiently low pressures, water will eventually come apart. Gas-filled cavities {{appear in the}} water: {{it is said to}} cavitate. When the cavities collapse, they often do so quite vigorously, causing noise, vibrations and erosion. A well-known example of cavitation is that found on heavily loaded ship propellers. The wake flow at the propeller is seldom rotationally symmetric, so the resulting flow met by each propeller blade changes periodically as the propeller rotates. These variations of the inflow make the resulting cavitation significantly more destructive. This thesis deals primarily with the design and testing of a new type of flow equipment which, although it does not fully reproduce the flow around a propeller blade, still has attractive features compared with its precursors. The propeller is replaced by a single fixed wing, while the asymmetric wake is simulated by a train of gusts generated by a pitching wing located upstream of the fixed wing. During the course of testing, several mechanisms that play significant parts in the formation of erosive cavitation were studied. A mathematical model was formulated for the flow in the jets that sometimes re-enter sheet cavities from their downstream edge. In qualitative agreement with observations, this model was found to describe mechanisms that enable the re-entrant jet to pinch off part of the sheet cavity, which is known to trigger violent <b>cloud</b> cavitation. <b>Sheet</b> cavities that lose their hold on {{the leading edge of the}} wing, which means they could collapse quite symmetrically, can do so with great force. This type of collapse was easier to produce with the new equipment than with earlier set-ups. Observations led to the conjecture that the pressure pulse emanating from the collapsing sheet cavity could synchronise a concerted collapse of accompanying bubbly fragments, thereby enhancing the erosivity of them. A mechanism that may connect the collapse intensity of a cavity and the optical brightness of the consequent rebounding cloud, was suggested. It is based on the phenomenon that the spatial frequency of Rayleigh-Taylor instability fingers at the cavity interface becomes greater in more violent collapses; this produces a denser cloud with finer bubbles, which looks whiter...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} Antarctic {{in global}} climate is {{characterized}} by the continental ice sheet, surrounding sea ice and cloud cover. Radiative effects of the ice sheet, sea ice and clouds, which are also major determinants of the radiation budget, were examined as significant subjects of the Antarctic Climate Research (ACR) project (1987 - 1991). NOAA AVHRR data received at Syowa Station were analyzed for cloud amount and cloud radiative effects in East Antarctica, and the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) data were analyzed for the effects of <b>clouds,</b> ice <b>sheet</b> and sea ice on the radiation budget together with SSM/I, ISCCP data and ground surface observations at Antarctic stations. Cloud radiation was found to heat the surface throughout the year and strongly cool the atmosphere over Antarctica. At the top of the atmosphere the cloud effect was cooling by longwaves in winter in the interior of the continent and cooling by shortwaves in summer. The ice sheet is known to have a strong albedo effect; however, it also had a strong longwave radiation effect because of its high elevation, reducing the surface temperature and then the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and also reducing the atmospheric effect, making the radiation budget in both polar regions asymmetric. The OLR was reduced at the rate of 5 to 10 W/m^ 2 /km below 2 km; above 2 km, the rate was about 20 W/m^ 2 /km. Sea ice, which is a critical climate feedback factor, had a possible impact on radiation that was about equal to or less than that due to clouds. Between 60 °and 65 °S in October, the albedo {{at the top of the}} atmosphere was increased by about 0. 2 and the OLR was reduced by 7 to 10 W/m^ 2 by the effect of sea ice; this seems smaller than the cloud forcing, which increased the albedo by 0. 3 and reduced the OLR by 30 to 40 W/m^ 2.

In winter, the Russian coastal mountains and a surface-air temperature inversion typically block cold surface continental air from the Japan Sea. Instead, the adiabatic warming of coastal mountain lee-side air results in small air-sea temperature differences. Occasional outbreaks of very cold Siberian air eliminate the continental surface-based inversion and stability, allowing very cold air to push out over the Japan Sea for 1 - 3 days.
