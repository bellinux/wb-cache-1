Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy.

5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to <b>career</b> <b>advancement,</b> and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E

5|$|Promotion, and {{the extra}} income this would bring, now became a matter of {{considerable}} concern to Scott. In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for <b>career</b> <b>advancement</b> were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, {{he had a chance}} encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with the Discovery, {{under the auspices of the}} RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane. What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.|$|E

He graduated in June 1964, having earned a Master of Science in mechanical and aerospace engineering. He then returned to West Point {{to serve as an}} instructor in the Department of Mechanics.

5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, <b>career</b> <b>advancement</b> depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E

40|$|Turnover among direct-care {{workers in}} {{long-term}} care (LTC) facilities is high, {{and has a}} significant impact on residents, leaders, and owners of LTC facilities. The overall turnover costs are also substantial and constitute a significant financial burden in LTC facilities. This systematic review of the literature examined, retention strategies for direct-care workers in the LTC workforce. The information may be used to develop and provide practice recommendations that will help improve retention rates among direct-care workers in LTC facilities. The project design involved a systematic examination of English-only studies from 2001 - 2004, retrieved from 3 major databases: CINAHL with Medline simultaneous, ProQuest, and Ovid resources. The review led to the identification of 858 publications out of which 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. The manifested variables were critically analyzed and grouped into 8 categories: job training, management style, acknowledgement of accomplishments, <b>career</b> <b>advancements,</b> benefits, peer mentoring, competitive wages and work load. The findings from this systematic review of the literature suggest that several factors affect turnover rates in the LTC setting, including job training, management style, acknowledgement of accomplishments, <b>career</b> <b>advancements,</b> benefits, peer mentoring, competitive wages and work load. This project aims to provide insight to project developers, administrators, researchers, and policy makers concerning factors that affect retention.
