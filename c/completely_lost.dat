5|$|In the Bahamas, {{insurers}} and reinsurers estimated industry insured losses at about $300million (2004 dollars). All cool-season vegetable plantings, {{and the entire}} banana crop, were lost during Frances. The pineapple crop was significantly impacted by wind damage in Eleuthera, while the entire fruit crop was lost for similar reasons. The corn crop in Long Island and Cat Island was <b>completely</b> <b>lost.</b> Significant poultry losses were experienced.|$|E
5|$|In all {{butterflies}} (with {{the exception}} of male Euschemoninae) and in Bombycoidea moths (with {{the exception of}} the Sphingidae), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are <b>completely</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fair amount}} of {{isolated}} fragments and sculptures testify to the many lost works and those that reached us only incompletely, which were clearly of considerable artistic merit. None of these are mentioned in archival documents, apart from the sculptures that accompanied the Caprioli Adoration. On the other hand, the chapel in San Pietro de Dom, commissioned to Gasparo Cairano in 1504 is the only documented work of the sculptor that has been <b>completely</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E

5|$|Battering Aitutaki {{with wind}} gusts {{in excess of}} 185km/h (115mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78percent of homes were damaged, with 72structures destroyed. The {{electrical}} grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops <b>completely</b> <b>lost.</b> Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its {{population}} of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was {{the largest in the}} history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was <b>completely</b> <b>lost.</b> Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town {{can be found in the}} modern city.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of Broome, the maximum wind gust {{recorded}} was 153km/h (95mph), recorded at the Broome aerodrome, as well as recording 163.8mm (6.45in) of rain for the 24hours up to 9 a.m. WST (0100 UTC) on 20 April. Vegetation in this area were badly damaged, particularly the African Mahogany trees which were either snapped off or uprooted. Parts of Cable Beach were severely eroded. An area {{which used to be}} covered with sand was completely covered by rocks. The eastern side of Roebuck Bay had evidence of severe erosion of the coastal terrain. At Broome's only banana plantation, almost all crops were <b>completely</b> <b>lost,</b> with 10 out of 18,000 plants left surviving. Fortunately, most buildings in {{the town of}} Broome remained unharmed, although power supplies were cut to many parts of Broome for several days.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginning}} of the Thirty Years' War in the Duchy of Pomerania was marked by the Capitulation of Franzburg, which provided for the occupation of the duchy by Albrecht von Wallenstein's mercenary army. In the following, the town was devastated <b>completely.</b> Franzburg <b>lost</b> its weaveries and the mint. Only a century later, in 1728, Franzburg was resettled.|$|R
50|$|Suburban {{residential}} development {{began in the}} late 1970s and continued for over three decades. Lost Creek is almost <b>completely</b> built-out. <b>Lost</b> Creek also encompasses a commercial area bordering Bee Caves Road and Capital of Texas Highway. Businesses occupying these buildings include Capital One Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, and Apple Inc. Lost Creek was annexed by the City of Austin in December 2015.|$|R

5|$|Like {{many films}} from the silent era, The Carpet from Bagdad was {{believed}} <b>completely</b> <b>lost,</b> but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged {{a number of}} artifacts from {{the wreck of the}} RMS Lusitania, including one reel of film. With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward, the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from several feet of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on the Lusitania, this print of The Carpet from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, as was the case for several other films known to have been on board.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the final approach, the trim controlling links burned and the crew <b>completely</b> <b>lost</b> control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E
5|$|The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was {{the largest}} fire {{in the history of}} Copenhagen, Denmark. It began on the evening of 20 October 1728 and {{continued}} to burn until the morning of 23 October. It destroyed approximately 28% of the city (measured by counting the number of destroyed lots from the cadastre), left 20% of the population homeless, and the reconstruction lasted until 1737. No less than 47% of the section of the city, which dates back to the Middle Ages, was <b>completely</b> <b>lost,</b> and along with the Copenhagen Fire of 1795, it is the main reason that few traces of medieval Copenhagen {{can be found in the}} modern city.|$|E

5|$|As {{is often}} the case with huge ancient ruins, {{knowledge}} of the site was never <b>completely</b> <b>lost</b> in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} early Greek historiography and later Roman historiography, Felix Jacoby {{identified}} thirteen possible ancient historians {{who wrote about}} Macedonia in his Fragmente der griechischen Historiker. Aside from accounts in Herodotus and Thucydides, the works compiled by Jacoby are only fragmentary, whereas other works are <b>completely</b> <b>lost,</b> such as the history of an Illyrian war fought by Perdiccas III written by Antipater. The Macedonian historians Marsyas of Pella and Marsyas of Philippi wrote histories of Macedonia, the Ptolemaic king Ptolemy I Soter authored a history about Alexander, and Hieronymus of Cardia wrote a history about Alexander's royal successors. Following the Indian campaign of Alexander the Great, the Macedonian military officer Nearchus wrote a work of his voyage {{from the mouth of}} the Indus river to the Persian Gulf. The Macedonian historian Craterus published a compilation of decrees made by the popular assembly of the Athenian democracy, ostensibly while attending the school of Aristotle. Philip V of Macedon had manuscripts of the history of PhilipII written by Theopompus gathered by his court scholars and disseminated with further copies.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of teeth}} with age in Limusaurus {{is the most}} extreme case of tooth {{morphology}} changing with age among dinosaurs. In fact, Limusaurus {{is one of the}} only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are <b>completely</b> <b>lost</b> during ontogeny (the others are the red mullet and striped red mullet, several armored catfish, and the platypus). Its complicated pattern of losing teeth from both the front and the back is most {{similar to that of the}} avialan Jeholornis. The temporary halt in tooth replacement likely results from the replacement tooth buds regressing, as in the veiled chameleon. Combined with the retention of the developmental signal pathways necessary to induce tooth development in birds, the ontogenetic replacement of teeth by a beak in Limusaurus suggests that the development of beaks in other lineages of theropods, and indeed beaked animals in general, may be related to developmental changes that heterochronically alter the point at which tooth development halts.|$|E
