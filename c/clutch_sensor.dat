This may render the vehicle inoperable and possibly result in a crash.|$|E

This involved home-grown technology and {{first of its kind}} component development like Hall sensor based neutral and <b>clutch</b> pedal <b>sensors,</b> and later a joint venture with Bosch for common rail based vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Magnetorheological {{materials}} {{belong to}} the group of the so called intelligent materials. Their rheological properties can be changed in a large range using an external magnetic field. That is why they find ever growing application in modern technical equipment, among others in controlled dampers, <b>clutches,</b> <b>sensors</b> etc. In the paper, a numerical strength analysis of a magnetorheological material was presented. The influence of the volume fraction of carbonyl iron particles (the share of the carbonyl iron particles varied from 1. 5 to 33. 0 vol. %.) on the mechanical properties of the material were investigated, in particular on the Youngâ€™s modulus variation. Experimental tests were carried out for specimens made of pur e PU 70 / 30 elastomer with iron particles. They included uniaxial compression tests. In the former case, specimens were in a shape of a cylinder with a diameter of 20 mm and a height of 25 - 30 mm. The results of experimental tests carried out {{in order to determine the}} parameters necessary to build the numerical model were included in the paper. In the paper, an algorithm developed for determining the parameters for modelling the structure was presented. A fragm ent of the structure, containing several particles of iron and some quantity of elastomer, corresponding to the assumed volume fractions, was subjected to numerical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{and control}} of a hybrid {{electric}} vehicle is presented in this paper. A four wheel drive parallel hybrid electric vehicle is built by assembling an auxiliary electrical machine and battery group. Some preliminary instrumentation such as accelerator pedal, brake, <b>clutch</b> pedal position <b>sensors</b> and gear ratio estimation are realized to split torque demand into the two power sources. The first power source is {{the internal combustion engine}} and the second one is the permanent magnet electric motor. A rule-based control strategy is developed by setting transition rules between the two power sources. The control strategy is implemented on a proof-of-concept vehicle and road tested. In order to satisfy smooth transient switching between the two power sources, and in order not to disturb the driver by abrupt or retarded transitions, torque splitting is achieved by taking the power source dynamics and vehicle dynamics in the longitudinal direction into account. The internal combustion engine is not operated at its high emission and low fuel efficient regions. Regenerative braking is implemented to charge the electric motor battery pack during braking. 8 page(s...|$|R
