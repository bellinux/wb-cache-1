40|$|This {{paper is}} the first {{illustration}} of Late Ordovician- Early Silurian, Early Devonian and Middle Car­boniferous- Early Permian <b>calcareous</b> <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> from Uzbekistan. Chlorophyta are very prolific and diverse. They are associated with some cyanophytes and rhodophytes. Taxa have been previously recorded. The flora is typically Central Tethyan and compares easily with that of Central and Southern Urals. Most algae have a wide stratigraphie range, are facies sensitive, and thus have only local age significance...|$|E
40|$|Uptake, depuration, and {{metabolism}} of p-nitroanisole (PNA) and p-nitrophenol (PNP) {{were investigated}} in Halimeda, Padina, and Porolithon species, {{all of which}} are <b>calcareous</b> <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> found in tropical waters. The algae were exposed to filtered seawater solutions of either PNA or PNP in a static system for 24 hr (uptake period), then placed in clean water and allowed to release absorbed chemical and possible metabolites for 24 hr (depuration period). Concentrations of the chemicals were monitored spectrophotometrically, and the water at the end of uptake and depuration was extracted onto a column of Amberlite XAD- 4 resin, eluted sequentially with methylene chloride and methanol, and analyzed for metabolites by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results showed that the algae absorb PNA but not PNP. There was no indication that they were capable of metabolizing PNA, except inconsistently, to PNP. However, half of the absorbed PNA remained unaccounted for, and may either have been metabolized to undetected metabolites or bound to tissue macromolecules...|$|E
40|$|The <b>calcareous</b> <b>marine</b> haptophyte <b>algae,</b> the coccolithophorids, are {{of global}} {{environmental}} significance {{because of the}} impact of their blooms on the carbon cycle. The coccolithophorid, Pleurochrysis carterae was grown semi-continuously in paddlewheel-driven outdoor raceway ponds over a period of 13 months in Perth, Western Australia. The mean total dry weight productivity of P. carterae was 0. 19 g. L- 1. d- 1 with cell lipid and CaCO 3 contents of up to 33 % and 10 % of dry weight respectively, equivalent to an annual total biomass productivity of about 60 t. ha - 1. y- 1 and 21. 9 t. ha- 1. y- 1 total lipid and 5. 5 t. ha- 1. y- 1 total calcium carbonate production. Throughout the culture period there was little protozoan contamination or contamination by other algae. The pH of the growth medium increased to pH 11 during the day and was found to be a useful variable for monitoring the state of the culture. A comparison of the growth of P. carterae and Dunaliella salina in the raceway ponds showed no significant differences between these two species with regard to areal total dry weight productivity and lipid content...|$|R

40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>algae</b> have {{attracted}} {{a great deal}} of interest as excellent sources of nutrients. Polysaccharides are the main components in <b>marine</b> <b>algae,</b> hence {{a great deal of}} attention has been directed at isolation and characterization of <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> polysaccharides because of their numerous health benefits. In this review, extraction and purification approaches and chemico-physical properties of <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> polysaccharides (MAPs) are summarized. The biological activities, which include immunomodulatory, antitumor, antiviral, antioxidant, and hypolipidemic, are also discussed. Additionally, structure-function relationships are analyzed and summarized. MAPs’ biological activities are closely correlated with their monosaccharide composition, molecular weights, linkage types, and chain conformation. In order to promote further exploitation and utilization of polysaccharides from <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> for functional food and pharmaceutical areas, high efficiency, and low-cost polysaccharide extraction and purification methods, quality control, structure-function activity relationships, and specific mechanisms of MAPs activation need to be extensively investigated...|$|R

40|$|Brown <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> (BMA; Sargassum dentifebium) were {{collected}} from Jeddah {{on the shores of}} the Red Sea and sun dried at an average daily temperature of 40 °C until constant weight was obtained. Part of the sun dried brown <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> was subsequently processed by boiling (BBMA;boiled brown <b>marine</b> <b>algae)</b> in water and by autoclaving (ABMA; autoclaved brown <b>marine</b> <b>algae).</b> The SBMA, BBMA and ABMA were included in laying hen diet during weeks 23 - 42 of age at concentrations of 0. 0 %, 3. 0 % and 6. 0 %. The diets were given with or without enzyme supplementation. This resulted in 3 (preparation methods) × 2 (concentrations of supplemented BMA, i. e. 3 and 6 %) × 2 (with and without enzyme supplementation) diet programs plus two control groups (with and without enzyme supplementation) for a total of 14 treatments. Each treatment was represented by six replicates of five hens each. Sun dried or autocalved brown <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> at 3 % without enzyme supplementation in the laying hen diet could be fed to laying hens without any adverse effect on laying performance. However, enzyme supplementation to a diet containing 6 % autocalved brown <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> improved productive performance and eggshell quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{two main}} {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to test the viability of using <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> as a profound bio-filler for the production of plastic where the plastic produce will have the tendency to reduce usage of non-renewable recourse which contributes to severe ecological problems. The second objective is to characterize the plastic blend produced using <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> via physical, mechanical and thermal testing. In this study, <b>Marine</b> <b>algae</b> and Low density polyethylene is used as raw material and blended to produce plastic sample which later on was characterized using Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), Thermogravimetry Analyzer (TGA), and tensile tester as well as water absorption tests. The results concluded that these red <b>marine</b> <b>algae</b> are not suitable for plastic production without any modification.
