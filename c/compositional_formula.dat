He followed the Spanish tradition of Royal Portraits, initiated with the famous portrait of Charles V by Titian, a copy of which, made by Pantoja, is at the Escorial. Antonis Mor, Alonso Sanchez Coello and Pantoja himself continued the tradition. His art was severely criticised by historians who, were prejudiced against non-Italian portraiture and therefore dismissed him as an [...] "uninspired, dull" [...] though [...] "painfully hard-working" [...] painter at the court of Philip III. The <b>compositional</b> <b>formula</b> of Velázquez's state portraits derives from his Spanish predecessors, among them Pantoja de la Cruz.|$|E

40|$|Many figured {{scenes and}} motifs appear {{more than once}} in mosaics of the Hellenistic period and beyond. These {{repeated}} scenes are often interpreted as copies of famous paintings, identifiable from literary sources, and their transmission is usually explained by the movement of craftsmen or the circulation of hypothetical 'pattern-books'. This paper analyses some examples of repeated compositions, to show that the process of transmission was more complex than this. Some scenes probably were more-or-less exact copies of a specific original, although the prototype could be a sculpture or manuscript illustration rather than a painting. In other cases, however, the similarities between scenes are less close. Some appear to be generic works based on a common theme, which could be re-invented to suit the requirements and means of each customer. In addition, the artists seem to have had at their disposal a repertoire of stock figure-types and <b>compositional</b> <b>formulae,</b> shared with artists in other media, which they could combine in different ways to create an infinite variety of scenes.

Platon, Cratylos). By highlighting the processes of memory and association, the catalogue cumulates the examples which underlie inductive reasoning, i. e. “proceeding from the particular to the general” (Aristotel, Topica, 12, 105 a 13). The transition from pure dialectics to rhetorical argumentation was accompanied by the exploitation of the ethical and esthetical functions of the representative examples (parádeigma) in order to support an idea. Used as arguments of authority, as models of divine or human behaviour, of manifestations of nature etc., the examples thus catalogued acquire the attributes of rhetorico-stylistic devices (enumeratio, amplificatio, gradation etc.). From here to the actual discursive techniques (description, evocation, portrait etc.), and from the latter to the <b>compositional</b> <b>formulas</b> of scientific, didactic, juridical text, on the one hand, and literary text, on the other (genealogy, res gestae, eoiai.), and then to literary genres such as the metamorphoses, the diary, the catalogue-sonnet, the evolution was rapid.

40|$|Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) is an {{established}} formalism for reasoning about time periods. We investigate some simple kinds of ITL formulas which have application to compositional reasoning and furthermore are closed under conjunction and the conventional temporal operator known both as “box” and “always”. Such closures help us modularly construct formulas from simple building blocks {{in a way}} which preserves useful compositional properties. The most important class considered here is called the 2 -to- 1 formulas. They offer an attractive framework for analysing sequential composition in ITL and provide the formal basis for most of the subsequent presentation. A key contribution of this work concerns a useful and apparently new and quite elementary mathematical theorem that 2 -to- 1 formulas are closed under “box”. We also use a natural form of time symmetry with 2 -to- 1 formulas. This extends known facts about such formulas by looking at them in reverse. An important example involves showing that 2 -to- 1 formulas are also closed under a variant of “box” for prefix subintervals rather than suffix ones. We then apply the <b>compositional</b> <b>formulas</b> obtained with time symmetry to analyse concurrent behaviour involving mutual exclusion in both Peterson’s algorithm and a new and more abstract one. At present, our study of mutual exclusion mainly serves as a kind of experimental “proof of concept” and research tool to develop and illustrate some of the logical framework’s promising features. We also discuss how time symmetry sometimes assists in reducing reasoning in ITL to conventional linear-time temporal logic...|$|R

EDS showed that the elemental ratios were stoichiometric. An examination of the magnetic properties revealed an increase in saturation magnetization with increasing Zn concentration up to x= 0. 3 and a decrease thereafter. These results could be explained using Neel's collinear two-sub-lattice model and three-sub-lattice non-collinear model suggested by Yafet and Kittel. The magnetic cubic anisotropy constant determined by the law of approach to saturation decreased with increasing Zn content.
