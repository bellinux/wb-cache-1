5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by readers that include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one question in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E

25|$|Birgit Nilsson (17 May 1918 – 25 December 2005) was {{a celebrated}} Swedish {{dramatic}} soprano {{who specialized in}} operatic works of Wagner and Richard Strauss, though she sang the operas of many other composers, including Verdi and Puccini.

25|$|Aspects {{such as the}} 'fast-paced' rules {{system and}} {{developed}} fantasy background were highly praised, with negative criticisms reserved for the 'wordiness' {{of the text and}} that the images, rather than illustrating the text, were largely decorative. The main differences to the 2nd edition noted were the rules on routing, charging and less <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> the presentation, subsequently making the rules more complex to learn and use.|$|E

25|$|The anti-climatic {{nature of}} the eighth-century Irish tale then gains {{significant}} <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> {{the light of the}} relationship between a horned or antler-bearing deity, warrior, or progenitor, and the chthonic dwelling, treasure-guarding serpent that encircled the waist of the one it chose to protect. This universal Celtic concept comes down to us as a mere echo of its ancient self through centuries of the Christianization of Ireland. The Gaelic Cernunnos may now possibly only be found in the slight similarity of a name and the peculiarity of a single passage from a Middle Ages Irish epic.|$|E
25|$|In Flames' vocal {{style is}} {{characterized}} by the use of growled vocals or screamed vocals complemented at times by clean vocals. In more recent albums such as Come Clarity, the band makes more prominent use of clean vocals, especially during choruses. In Flames' lyrics have also varied during their career. In early albums such as The Jester Race and Whoracle, In Flames' lyrics focused on astrology, mankind, and other global themes. In later albums such as Soundtrack to Your Escape and Come <b>Clarity,</b> <b>In</b> Flames' lyrics focus more on personal issues, thoughts, and other introspective themes.|$|E
25|$|Russell and Moore {{were devoted}} to <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> {{arguments}} by breaking down philosophical position into their simplest components. Russell, in particular, saw formal logic and science as the principal tools of the philosopher. Russell did not {{think we should have}} separate methods for philosophy. Russell thought philosophers should strive to answer the most general of propositions about the world and this would help eliminate confusions. In particular, he wanted to end what he saw as the excesses of metaphysics. Russell adopted William of Ockham's principle against multiplying unnecessary entities, Occam's Razor, as a central part of the method of analysis.|$|E

25|$|While Gude was a student, two {{different}} trends in landscaping were developing at the Academy: a romantic trend and a classical trend. The romanticists depicted wild, untamed wildernesses with dark forests, soaring peaks, and rushing water {{to capture the}} terrifying and overpowering aspects of nature. They used rich, saturated colors with strong contrast of light and shadow. The classicists {{were more interested in}} recreating landscapes from the heroic or mythical past and often set them in the midst of religious or historical events. The classicists focused on lines and <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> their compositions. It was through Achenbach — Gude's first teacher upon arriving in Düsseldorf — that he was exposed to the romanticist tradition, while it was through his classes with and later time teaching for Schirmer that he was exposed to the classicist traditions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{backdrop}} of increasing awareness about employee behavior in service industry, this paper explores the relationship between Role <b>Clarity,</b> OCB <b>in</b> service organizations. The sample consisted of 198 Respondents from Indian organizations. On application of Regression Analysis, the results portrayed that: (a) Role Clarity {{was found to be}} significantly predicting OCB; (b) one of the interesting finding of the study was that Male gender highly moderated the positive relationship between Role <b>Clarity</b> and OCB <b>in</b> comparison with when Female gender was treated as moderator; (c) Also, it was found in the study that High experience level resulted in high positive relationship between role <b>clarity</b> and OCB <b>in</b> comparison with Low experience level.

Commentators note the lack of <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> the mix, which author Elliot Huntley attributes to the [...] "three-pronged piano attack" [...] and {{the low level of}} Harrison and Smith's vocals. At times during the sections featuring Smith's improvised dialogue, Harrison let both recorded takes run simultaneously, and he admitted to Gambaccini that he chose to mix the track in this way [...] "so people have to strain with headphones to hear what it is".|$|E

500|$|The second edition, {{published}} in 1985, included several {{changes such as}} 37 new species, 12 new plates of illustrations, the inclusion of endemic species of the Baja California Peninsula, and new common names chosen to enhance <b>clarity.</b> <b>In</b> his 1986 review, Sweet remarked on the frankness of imperfect knowledge: [...] "For {{the first time we}} have a field guide that indicates clearly which taxonomic interpretations are tentative and where distributions and life history features remain poorly known."

500|$|It is a {{requirement}} that the subject matter be certain — that the property intended {{to be in the}} trust be separated from other property, showing <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> what is intended to be trust property. If there is no clear separation, the trust will fail, as in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd. This point was illustrated by Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, where creditors of a bankrupt wine trading company argued that {{they should be able to}} claim the wine they had paid for. The problem was that these bottles were not individually identifiable, and Oliver J held that: [...] A sum of money, say 10,000, does not satisfy the requirement, rendering uncertainty.|$|E
500|$|Stravinsky {{said about}} the texts of his Symphony of Psalms that [...] "it is not a symphony in which I have {{included}} Psalms to be sung. On the contrary, it is the singing of the Psalms that I am symphonizing". This decision was as much musical as it was textual. Stravinsky's counterpoint required several musical voices to function simultaneously, independent melodically and rhythmically, yet interdependent harmonically. They would sound very different when heard separately, yet harmonious when heard together. To facilitate maximum <b>clarity</b> <b>in</b> this interplay of voices, Stravinsky used [...] "a choral and instrumental ensemble {{in which the two}} elements should be on an equal footing, neither of them outweighing the other".|$|E
