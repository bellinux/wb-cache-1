40|$|Women {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to crime despite occupying central position in shaping a society as the first teacher of children. In India too, having equal rights and constitutional safeguards, the incidences of <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> them are large and grave. In this context of <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women, especially rape has been increasing over time. This paper explores the spatial and temporal aspects of <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women in India with special reference to rape. It also examines the <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women with its spatial, socio-economic and demographic associates using related data obtained from the National Crime Records Bureau India, Indian Census and other government sources of the Government of India. The simple statistical, choropleth mapping and other cartographic representation methods {{have been used to}} see the crime rates, spatio-temporal patterns of crime, and association of crime with its correlates. The major findings are visible spatial variations across the country and are also in the rising trends in terms of incidence and rates over the reference period. The study also indicates that the geographical associations are somewhat observed. However, selected indicators of socio-economic factors seem to have no significant bearing on <b>crime</b> <b>against</b> women at this level...|$|R
