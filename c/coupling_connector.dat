To form a workable development system they require additional components, especially a serial TTL-to-USB adapter (sometimes called a USB-to-UART bridge) and an external 3.3 volt power supply.

Dephosphorylation of the tail reduces the coupling between the SH 2 and SH 3 domains in the simulations, as does replacement of connector residues with glycine. A mutational analysis of c-Src expressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe demonstrates that replacement of residues in the SH 2 -SH 3 connector with glycine activates c-Src.

40|$|When new coaxial {{interfaces}} become available, it {{is important}} to validate their performance. The best {{way to do this is}} by using a calibration kit that eliminates the effects of adapters in the measurement. This article discusses the design and implementation of a TRM calibration kit for a ZMA interface. The ZMA interface is a high <b>coupling</b> force bayonet <b>connector</b> used in microwave applications up to 12. 4 GHz. The calibration kit is designed for a frequency band of 0. 045 to 12. 4 GHz. The systematic errors and the effect of adapters in network measurements are reviewed. The steps used when designing the calibration standards for the ZMA interface using the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS ®) software from Ansoft Corp. are then described. One of the greatest challenges in characterizing new coaxial interfaces is to determine an accurate test configuration. When precision airlines are not available it is very difficult to obtain a true measurement of the device under test. It becomes necessary to design and implement calibration standards to eliminate the effect of adapters and validate the performance of the device. This article discusses the design of a TRM calibration kit for the ZMA interface. The design was performed with the aid of Ansoft HFSS simulation software to characterize and optimize the calibration standards. The ZMA interface is a high <b>coupling</b> force bayonet <b>connector</b> used in microwave applications. Although the ZMA connector can be optimized to work up to 22 GHz, current requirements ask for a calibration kit up to X-band. Its performance is comparable to an SMA connector up to 12. 4 GHz. 1 The TRM calibration is an alternative to the traditional two-port error correction that uses short, open, load and thru standards (SOLT). 2 The TRM offers equivalent accuracy and has the advantage that fewer and simpler standards are required. 2 – 3 The name TRM represents the three standards that are used in the calibration — thru, reflect and match. The TRM calibration technique establishes the 12 term error correction for each frequency point. ...|$|R
40|$|Component-based {{software}} development is {{an approach that}} has many benefits, such as improving application developer productivity, reducing costs and complexity by reusing of existing code. Programming in this approach is like assembling (i. e., composing software out of prefabricated components) rather than development, which reduces skill requirements and lets expertise focuses on domain problems. Component model {{is the cornerstone of}} any CBSD methodology, which defines what components are, how they can be constructed and specifies the standards and conventions that are needed to enable composition of independently developed components. The current component models focus on the specification and packaging of components but provide almost no support for the easy composition. Component composition techniques used in these models apply either direct or indirect message passing as connection schemes, which lead to tight coupling (i. e., components mix computation with control). Therefore, we propose the mediator connector which is similar to a communication hub.

The major contribution of this research is we have successfully defined no explicit connector and direct message passing between components and components are loaded into the framework dynamically during runtime based on the attachment.

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of the unloaded Q 0 factor of microwave resonators are necessary in many microwave applications. The most accurate values of Q 0 {{can be obtained by}} Q-circle fits from multifrequency S-parameter data. Practical measurement systems cause S-parameters of the resonators to be distorted from the circular ideal shape, rotated, and shifted from the origin resulting in errors in the Q-factor values. A novel Q-factor measurement method has been developed based on equations derived for resonators working in the transmission mode and fractional linear circle-fitting techniques.
