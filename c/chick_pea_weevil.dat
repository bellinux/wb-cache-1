40|$|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is a {{valuable}} foodstuff but unfortunately this legume is prone to insect attacks from the <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> (Callosobruchus chinensis L.). This serious pest damages the chickpea and causes decreases in the yield and in the nutritional quality. Biological control {{is being used to}} deal with this problem. We tried different doses of the essential oils of three new medicinal plants, namely Salvia verbenaca L., Scilla maritima L., and Artemisia herba-alba Asso to limit the damage of the <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> pest, and to protect consumer’s health. To determine the effect and efficiency of the oil, the tests were conducted using the different biological parameters of fertility, longevity, and fecundity, under controlled temperature and relative humidity (28 °C and 75 %). The effectiveness of organic oils was demonstrated. We tested these oils on the germination of seeds. The obtained results showed that the tested plant oils have a real organic insecticide effect. The essential oil of Artemisia proved most effective as a biocide; achieving a mortality rate of 100 %. A significant reduction in longevity was observed under the effect of 30 μl of S. maritima (1. 3 days) and S. verbenaca (2. 8, 4. 6 days), respectively, for males and females compared to 8 and 15 days for the control. For fecundity, an inhibition of oviposition was obtained using 30 μl of Salvia and Scilla essential oils. The test on the seed germination using different essential oils, showed no damage to the germinating seeds. The germination rate was 99 %. These findings suggest that the tested plants {{can be used as a}} bioinsecticide for control of the C. chinensis pest of stored products...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on mustard (Brassica juncea) and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> (Cicer arietinum) for their growth, yield, and yield attributes. Both the samples {{were divided into two}} groups. One group was remained as untreated and coded as control, while the other group (both seed and plot) was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment and referred as the treated. The result showed the plant height of mustard and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> was increased by 13. 2 and 97. 41 %, respectively in the treated samples as compared to the control. Additionally, primary branching of mustard and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> was improved by 7. 4 and 19. 84 %, respectively in the treated sample as compared to the control. The control mustard and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> crops showed high rate of infection by pests and diseases, while treated crops were free from any infection of pests and disease. The yield attributing characters of mustard showed, lucidly higher numbers of siliquae on main shoot, siliquae/plant and siliquae length were observed in the treated seeds and plot as compared with the control. Moreover, similar results were observed in the yield attributing parameters of <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> viz. pods/plant, grains/pod as well as test weight of 1000 grains. The seed and stover yield of mustard in treated plots were increased by 61. 5 % and 25. 4 %, respectively with respect to the control. However, grain/seed yield of mustard crop after biofield energy treatment was increased by 500 % in terms of kg per meter square as compared to the control. Besides, grain/seed yield of <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> crop after biofield energy treatment was increased by 500 % in terms of kg per meter square. The harvest index of biofield treated mustard was increased by 21. 83 %, while it was slight increased in case of <b>chick</b> <b>pea.</b> In conclusion, the biofield energy treatment could be used on both the seeds and plots of mustard and <b>chick</b> <b>pea</b> as an alternative way to increase the production and yield...|$|R
40|$|Neoplasm formation, a non-meristematic {{tissue growth}} on young field pea (Pisum sativum L.) pods is {{triggered}} {{in the absence}} of UV light and/or in response to oviposition by <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> (Bruchus pisorum L.). This trait is expressed in some genotypes (Np genotypes) of P. sativum and has the capacity to obstruct <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> larval entry into developing seeds. In the present study, 26 % of the tested accessions depicted the trait when grown under greenhouse conditions. However, UV light inhibits full expression of this trait and subsequently it is inconspicuous at the field level. In order to investigate UV light impact on the expression of neoplasm, particular Np genotypes were subjected to UV lamp light exposure in the greenhouse and sunlight at the field level. Under these different growing conditions, the highest mean percentage of neoplastic pods was in the control chamber in the greenhouse (36 %) whereas in single and double UV lamp chambers, the percentage dropped to 10 % and 15 %, respectively. Furthermore, when the same Np genotypes were grown in the field, the percentage of neoplastic pods dropped significantly (7 %). In order to enhance neoplastic expression at the field level, intercropping of Np genotypes with sorghum was investigated. As result, the percentage of neoplastic pods was threefold in intercropped Np genotypes as compared to those without intercropping. Therefore, intercropping neoplastic genotypes with other crops such as sorghum and maize can facilitate neoplasm formation, which in turn can minimize the success rate of <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae entry into developing seeds. Greenhouse artificial infestation experiments showed that <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> damage in neoplastic genotypes is lower in comparison to wild type genotypes. Therefore, promoting neoplastic formation under field conditions via intercropping can serve as part of an integrated <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> management strategy especially for small scale farming systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{for increasing the}} productivity {{and control of the}} <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> (Bruchus pisorum L.) in field pea (Pisum sativum L.) organic cultivation by the use of following bioproducts NeemAzal T/S and Pyrethrum FS-EC (insecticides), applied individually and in combination with Polyversum (growth regulator and fungicide) and Biofa (foliar fertilizer), as well as to evaluate the stability of the used mixtures were studied. Synthetic products Nurelle D and Flordimex 420 (alone and in combination) were used as a standard. The products were applied once (at budding stage) or twice (at budding and flowering stages). The results showed that forage pea productivity was influenced positively by the application of all organic products. The plants treated with the organic combinations formed an average yield of 3190. 2 kg/ha, which was only 4. 7 % lower than that for the synthetic combination of Flordimex+Nurelle D. The highest yield was produced under application of two mixtures: Biofa+Pyrethrum and Polyversum+Pyrethrum at budding and flowering stages (22. 0 and 21. 8 % above untreated control, respectively). These combinations were also distinguished for their most pronounced protective effect against the attack of the <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> and decrease in its numbers of 37. 0 and 38. 5 %, respectively. Pyrethrum was distinguished for a lower degree of damaged seeds and a toxic effect against the <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> in comparison with NeemAzal. Technologically the most valuable variant, which united high stability, productivity and protection against <b>pea</b> <b>weevil,</b> was the combination of Biofa+Pyrethrum applied twice. Further investigations are indispensible to expand the range of products (bioinsectides, biofertilizers and growth regulators), which provides good insect control and high productivity in pea organic farming conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>pea</b> <b>weevil,</b> Bruchus pisorum L. {{is a major}} {{insect pest}} of field pea, Pisum sativum L. {{worldwide}} and current control practices mainly depend {{on the use of}} chemical insecticides that can cause adverse effects on environment and human health. Insecticides are also unaffordable by many small-scale farmers in developing countries, which highlights the need for investigating plant resistance traits and to develop alternative pest management strategies. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine oviposition preference of <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> among P. sativum genotypes with different level of resistance (Adet, 32410 - 1 and 235899 - 1) and the non-host leguminous plants wild pea (Pisum fulvum Sibth. et Sm.) and grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.), in no-choice and dual-choice tests. Pod thickness and micromorphological traits of the pods were also examined. In the no-choice tests significantly more eggs were laid on the susceptible genotype Adet than on the other genotypes. Very few eggs were laid on P. fulvum and L. sativus. In the dual-choice experiments Adet was preferred by the females for oviposition. Furthermore, combinations of Adet with either 235899 - 1 or non-host plants significantly reduced the total number of eggs laid by the weevil in the dual-choice tests. Female <b>pea</b> <b>weevils</b> were also found to discriminate between host and non-host plants during oviposition. The neoplasm (Np) formation on 235899 - 1 pods was negatively correlated with oviposition by <b>pea</b> <b>weevil.</b> Pod wall thickness and trichomes might have influenced oviposition preference of the weevils. These results on oviposition behavior the weevils can be used in developing alternative pest management strategies such as trap cropping using highly attractive genotype and intercropping with the non-host plants...|$|R

40|$|Field pea (Pisum sativum L.) is an {{important}} source of protein in developing countries like Ethiopia. However, the production of field pea is hampered by invasive pests like the <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> (Bruchus pisorum L.). In this PhD project, {{more than a quarter of}} the field pea accessions available at the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute (EBI) have been screened for resistance against <b>pea</b> <b>weevils,</b> both under field and greenhouse conditions. The screenings led to the identification of a few relatively less susceptible accessions/genotypes. Repeated field and greenhouse trials revealed that locally released, high yielding varieties are highly susceptible to <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> infestation. The lack of strict quarantine systems in Ethiopia to prevent the spread of infested seeds is worsening the pest distribution within the country. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop locally adapted <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> resistance varieties. Developing such varieties is the most effective and cheapest approach which can be supported by other integrated pest management techniques like intercropping to minimize or possibly halt economic loss due to this pest. In the present study, we have also developed 15 new EST-SSR markers that could be used for various applications including genetic diversity assessments and genetic mapping as well as for marker assisted selection in P. sativum. Most of these markers are transferable to other taxa of the genus Pisum and related genera. Twelve of these newly developed EST-SSR markers were used to assay the genetic diversity among 46 accessions of P. sativum. This study revealed high genetic differentiation among the accessions which could be valuable for field pea breeding in the future. In addition, the findings could be used as an input for in-situ and ex-situ conservation strategies of the P. sativum and guide future collection missions...|$|R
