25|$|Low {{introductory}} {{credit card}} rates {{are limited to}} a fixed term, usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged. As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to bankruptcy. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed. In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases universal default may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This {{can lead to a}} snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. First Premier Bank at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate; however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.|$|E
25|$|At {{a number}} of Tube, DLR, London Overground and National Rail {{stations}} which lie in close proximity, or where interchange requires passengers to pass through ticket barriers, an Out-of-Station Interchange (OSI) is permitted. In such cases, the <b>card</b> <b>holder</b> touches out at one station and then touches in again before starting the next leg of the journey. The PAYG fares are then combined and charged as a single journey. Examples include transferring between the Jubilee line at Canary Wharf and the DLR where Oyster card holders must tap their card at the ticket barriers in the Tube station, and then touch in on the validator at the DLR station. Balham (National Rail) to/from Balham (Tube) is another OSI, as is Camden Town (Tube) to/from Camden Road (London Overground). Failure to touch in or out on the validators in these circumstances will incur a maximum fare which is deducted from PAYG funds. In some cases (e.g. at West Hampstead NR stations) the OSI replicates interchanges which have existed for several decades before {{the invention of the}} Oyster system but were generally used with season tickets rather than day tickets.|$|E
