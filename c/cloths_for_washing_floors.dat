40|$|In August, 1980 a rare {{serotype}} S. zanzibar {{was isolated}} in the North of Scotland from a man home on leave from Malaysia, whence he returned in November having been bacteriologically negative 2 months previously. In December however, S. zanzibar was isolated from a bulk milk sample taken at a nearby dairy farm. No illness occurred among milking cows which had been brought inside from pasture in mid-October. Since 1972 {{a variety of different}} salmonella serotypes had been identified in cattle, milk and other samples at this farm, with seagulls being implicated as the vector transmitting infection from the sewage of a local town on to farmland and an adjacent loch. Although water from this source has not been used in recent years for drinking by cattle, it is utilized <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> <b>floors</b> within the dairy premises.

40|$|A {{stratified}} {{random sample}} of Ohio dairy herds was studied to relate herd management and environmental conditions to the prevalence of intramammary infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci. Management and environmental conditions were assessed by investigator observation and by interview with the dairy producers. Separate analyses for each of 70 management and environmental independent variables identified many potential disease determinants. Analysis of covariance models were developed to predict the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The first model used 7 model degrees of freedom, had an Rsuperscript 2 of 0. 62, and included the following independent variables: use of a <b>cloth</b> <b>for</b> <b>washing</b> cows, use of a hypochlorite- or iodine-based post-milking teat dip, a population of milking cows less than 50, the amount of bedding provided, use of free stall housing, an interaction between a small herd size {{and the amount of}} bedding provided and an interaction between the use of free stalls and the type of post-milking teat dip. The second model had an Rsuperscript 2 of 0. 54 and was reduced to 5 model degrees of freedom by exclusion of the variables for use of free stalls and the interaction between free stalls and type of post-milking teat dip [...] RE: 27 ref.; SC: BE; VE; AG; CA; ZA; 0 I; EC; 0 V; 0 DSource type: Electronic(1) [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} which effects of <b>floor</b> eggs, <b>washed</b> <b>floor</b> eggs, and clean nest eggs were investigated on incubation characteristics and performance in later life of broiler chickens. In both experiments, a young and an older breeder flock were used in a 3 × 2 factorial design during incubation. In the second experiment, male and female chickens were reared separately until d 35 of age in floor pens. During this grow out trial, an extra group was created in which chickens obtained from clean nest eggs were mixed with chickens obtained from floor eggs, meaning that grow out period was set up as a 4 × 2 × 2 factorial design with 4 egg types, 2 breeder ages, and 2 sexes. In both experiments, fertility and hatchability of fertile eggs were lower in <b>floor</b> and <b>washed</b> eggs than in clean nest eggs (hatchability: experiment 1 : 74. 4 vs. 70. 6 vs. 92. 6 % <b>for</b> <b>floor</b> eggs, <b>washed</b> <b>floor</b> eggs and clean nest eggs, respectively, P < 0. 001; experiment 2 : 78. 3 vs. 81. 7 vs. 90. 2 %, respectively, P < 0. 001). In experiment 2, BW at d 0 of chickens obtained from clean nest eggs was {{higher than that of}} chickens from <b>floor</b> eggs and <b>washed</b> <b>floor</b> eggs (41. 5 vs. 40. 4 and 40. 3 g, respectively; P < 0. 001). This difference disappeared during the grow out period and was absent at slaughter age at d 35 of age. Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and mortality during the grow out period were not affected by egg type. Incidence and severity of hock burns and footpad dermatitis were not affected by egg type or breeder age. Litter friability at d 35 of age tended to be lower in pens with chickens obtained from <b>washed</b> <b>floor</b> eggs compared to clean nest eggs. We conclude that incubation of <b>floor</b> eggs or <b>washed</b> <b>floor</b> eggs resulted in lower fertility and hatchability compared to clean nest eggs, but that performance during the grow out period was not affected. </p...|$|R

He was the first to have two services on Sunday, though still the ante-Communion service was read from the desk, and he there pulled off his much iron-moulded surplice from over his gown and ascended the pulpit stair.
