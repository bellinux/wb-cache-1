40|$|We {{present a}} novel pruning method for {{context-free}} parsing that increases efficiency by disallowing phrase-level unary productions in CKY <b>chart</b> <b>cells</b> spanning a single word. Our work is orthogonal to recent work on “closing ” <b>chart</b> <b>cells,</b> which {{has focused on}} multi-word constituents, leaving span- 1 <b>chart</b> <b>cells</b> unpruned. We show that a simple discriminative classifier can learn with high accuracy which span- 1 <b>chart</b> <b>cells</b> to close to phrase-level unary productions. Eliminating these unary productions from the search can have a large impact on downstream processing, depending on implementation details of the search. We apply our method to four parsing architectures and demonstrate how it is complementary to the cell-closing paradigm, {{as well as other}} pruning methods such as coarse-to-fine, agenda, and beam-search pruning. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} classifying word positions by {{whether or not}} they can either start or end multi-word constituents. This provides a mechanism for “closing ” <b>chart</b> <b>cells</b> during context-free inference, which is demonstrated to improve efficiency and accuracy when used to constrain the wellknown Charniak parser. Additionally, we present a method for “closing ” a sufficient number of <b>chart</b> <b>cells</b> to ensure quadratic worst-case complexity of context-free inference. Empirical results show that this O(n 2) bound can be achieved without impacting parsing accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|We present {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the worst-case and typical-case complexity of a context-free parsing pipeline via hard constraints derived from finite-state pre-processing. We perform O(n) predictions to determine if each word in the input sentence may begin or end a multi-word constituent in <b>chart</b> <b>cells</b> spanning two or more words, or allow single-word constituents in <b>chart</b> <b>cells</b> spanning the word itself. These pre-processing constraints prune the search space for any chart-based parsing algorithm and significantly decrease decoding time. In many cases cell population is reduced to zero, which we term <b>chart</b> <b>cell</b> “closing. ” We present methods for closing {{a sufficient number of}} <b>chart</b> <b>cells</b> to ensure provably quadratic or even linear worst-case complexity of context-free inference. In addition, we apply high precision constraints to achieve large typical-case speedups and combine both high precision and worst-case bound constraints to achieve superior performance on both short and long strings. These bounds on processing are achieved without reducing the parsing accuracy, and in some cases accuracy improves. We demonstrate that our method generalizes across multiple grammars and is complementary to other pruning techniques by presenting empirical results for both exact and approximate inference using the exhaustive CKY algorithm, the Charniak parser, and the Berkeley parser. We also report results parsing Chinese, where we achieve the best reported results for an individual model on the commonly reported data set. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{automatic}} hexahedralization tool, {{based on a}} systematic treatment that removes some of the singularities {{that would lead to}} degenerate volumetric parameterization. Such singularities could be abundant in automatically generated frame fields guiding the interior and boundary layouts of the hexahedra in an all hexahedral mesh. We first give the mathematical definitions of the inadmissible singularities prevalent in frame fields, including newly introduced surface singularity types. We then give a practical framework for adjusting singularity graphs by automatically modifying the rotational transition of frames between <b>charts</b> (<b>cells</b> of a tetrahedral mesh for the volume) to resolve the issues detected in the internal and boundary singularity graph. After applying an additional re-smoothing of the frame field with the modified transition conditions, we cut the volume into a topologically trivial domain, with the original topology encoded by the self-intersections of the boundary of the domain, and solve a mixed integer problem on this domain for a global parameterization. Finally, a properly connected hexahedral mesh is constructed from the integer isosurfaces of (u, v, w) in the parameterization. We demonstrate the applicability of the method on complex shapes, and discuss its limitations.

This paper starts with a description of the most challenging specific requirements of an application schema and produc-tion system supporting the production of ENC <b>cells</b> and printed <b>charts</b> from one common database. The paper outlines possibilities to expand the S- 57 object catalogue by adding cartographic features and attributes which would enable presentation of the data according to the presentation requirements of printed charts.

Advances in navigation technology have set new demands on accuracy, reliability and the form of nautical charts. The positional accuracy of the chart should meet the increased accuracy of the positioning systems.

For the same model, using a variational approximation for the free energy, we compute both macroion and microion contributions to the osmotic pressure. Within a spherical cell model, which neglects macroion correlations, we solve the nonlinear PB equation to compute microion distributions and osmotic pressures.

N 0 neck was defined with contrast enhanced computed tomography scan. Occult neck disease rate was 12. 5 %, involvement per level was: 47. 6 % at level II, 38. 1 % at level III, 9. 5 % at level IV.

In conclusion, selective neck dissection of levels II-IV is effective in N 0 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma; posterior limits of surgical resection are missing therefore if post-operative radiation is required, the field should be extended beyond the dissected levels. The low incidence of occult neck disease indicates the need to refine treatment strategy, restricting elective neck dissection only to supraglottic T 2 with epilaryngeal involvement, supraglottic T 3 - 4 and glottic T 4 tumours, and considering a "wait and see" protocol implemented with imaging techniques and cytological assessments for other lesions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Taking {{advantage}} of two transgenic lines, glast. DsRed and crx. gfp, that express fluorescent proteins in glial and photoreceptor cells respectively, we investigate {{the role of}} glast-positive glial cells (GPCs) in the survival/differentiation/proliferation of age-matched photoreceptor cells. Methods: Primary retinal cells were isolated from newborn transgenic mouse retina (glast. dsRed::crx. gfp) at postnatal day (P 0 /P 1) and propagated in defined medium containing epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (bFGF). By flow-sorting another population of pure GPCs was isolated. Both populations were expanded and analyzed {{for the presence of}} specific retinal cell markers. Notably, the primary cell culture collected from the transgenic line glast. dsRed::crx. gfp showed a conspicuous presence of immature photoreceptors growing on top of GPCs. In order to reveal the role of such cells in the survival/differentiation/proliferation of photoreceptors we set up in vitro cultures of retina-derived cells that allowed long-term time-lapse recordings <b>charting</b> every <b>cell</b> division, death and differentiation event. To assess the regenerative potential of GPCs we challenged them with compounds mimicking retinal degeneration (NMU, NMDA, Zaprinast). Mass spectrometry (MS), immunostainings and other molecular approaches were performed to reveal adhesion molecules involved in the relationship between glial cells and photoreceptors. Results: Both primary cell lines were highly homogenous, with an elongated morphology and the majority expressed Müller glia markers (MG) such as glast, blbp, glt- 1, vimentin, glutamine synthetase (GS), GFAP, cd 44, mash 1 and markers of reactive Müller glia such as nestin, pax 6. Conversely, none of them were found positive for retinal neuron markers like tuj 1, otx 2, recoverin. Primary cultures of GPCs show the incapability of glial cells to give rise to photoreceptors in both wild type or degenerative environment. Furthermore, primary cultures of pure GPCs challenged with different compounds did not highlight the production of new glial cell-derived photoreceptors. Adhesion molecules involved in the contact between photoreceptors and glial cells are still under investigation. Conclusions: Primary glia cells do not give rise to photoreceptor cells in wt and degenerative conditions at least in vitro. The roles of glial cells seem to be more linked to the maintenance/proliferation of photoreceptor cells...|$|R

40|$|Shared care is {{a concept}} born from the DoH National Plan 2000 and {{supported}} by the Standards for the Clinical Care of Adults with Sickle Cell Disease 2008. In the management of patients with sickle cell leg ulcers shared care translates to a multidisciplinary team approach with expertise in leg ulcer management. Patients with leg ulcers attending Whittington Hopsital for management of their SCD may initially receive full leg ulcer assessment from their community services via Practice Nurse, District Nurse with the appropriate training, or Community Tissue Viability Nurse (TVN). However, patients may self refer them-selves to hospital {{in the course of their}} routine clinic appointment or through Haematology Day Care. At which point patients are referred to the hospital TVN, Clinical Nurse Specialist or leg ulcer clinic for initial assessment and intermittent monitoring/dressings/treatment, than back to the appropriate community services for continuing care. Flow <b>Chart</b> of Sickle <b>Cell</b> Leg Ulcer Service at red cell disorders unit Leg ulcers occur in 10 to 20 % of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) between the ages of 10 - 50 years of age. Patients who experience their first sickle cell ulcer are likely to ulcerate again. The ulcers may be very painful and associated with cellulites and inguinal adenitis. Around 97 % of healed sickle cell ulcers will return in less than one year. Due to the intractable nature of these ulcers, patients may experience notable:-Disfigurement, Discolouration, Social Isolation, Loss of incom...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The C. elegans cell fate map, {{in which}} the lineage of its {{approximately}} 1000 <b>cells</b> is visibly <b>charted</b> beginning from the zygote, represents a developmental biology milestone. Nematode development is invariant from one specimen to the next, whereas in mammals, aspects of development are probabilistic, and development exhibits variation between even genetically identical individuals. Consequently, a single defined cell fate map applicable to all individuals cannot exist. Results To {{determine the extent to}} which patterns of cell lineage are conserved between different mice, we have employed the recently developed method of “phylogenetic fate mapping” to compare cell fate maps in siblings. In this approach, somatic mutations arising in individual cells are used to retrospectively deduce lineage relationships through phylogenetic and—as newly investigated here—related analytical approaches based on genetic distance. We have cataloged genomic mutations at an average of 110 mutation-prone polyguanine (polyG) tracts for about 100 cells clonally isolated from various corresponding tissues of each of two littermates of a hypermutable mouse strain. Conclusions We find that during mouse development, muscle and fat arise from a mixed progenitor cell pool in the germ layer, but, contrastingly, vascular endothelium in brain derives from a smaller source of progenitor cells. Additionally, formation of tissue primordia is marked by establishment of left and right lateral compartments, with restricted cell migration between divisions. We quantitatively demonstrate that development represents a combination of stochastic and deterministic events, offering insight into how chance influences normal development and may give rise to birth defects. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{test setup}} {{consists}} of four major elements: the programmable power supplies and load banks, the data acquisition and control system control computer, and the NiH 2 specimen test cells. A simplified block diagram of the test setup is shown. The test setup provides complete battery isolation should a fault occur, and fusing as necessary to protect the battery cells and other equipment. Front panel switches provide for power supply configuration and battery isolation. Front panel meters provide continuous real-time visual monitoring of the voltage and current for each pack of <b>cells.</b> A strip <b>chart</b> recorder provides a hard copy of the voltage and current profiles {{for each of the}} packs. The test operates continuously with minimal human interface, except during special tests. The two power supplies are controlled by resistance programming. A bank of resistors and relays was built which can be switched by the control computer to provide control over the charge current to the batteries. The load banks are controlled by the 3497 A. The 3497 A is equipped with a 0. 5 volt programmable power supply which is used to voltage program the load banks. A Hewlett-Packard Vectra 9000 running an HP Basic program is used as the control computer to remotely instruct the 3497 A (data acquisition and control) to scan the data channels and retrieve test data. The program then reads, calculates, and stores the data. If an anomaly occurs, the program will disconnect the cells and shut down the test to avoid damage to the cells or equipment...|$|R
