50|$|Some {{buildings}} including {{data centers}} are increasingly designed for 380 V DC power distribution, {{as a way}} of improving electrical efficiency. DC power distribution has resulted in the need to standardize a Low Voltage (LV) connector with an integral ground conductor, which is safe for use by untrained personnel. The tendency of DC connectors to spark when disconnected from an inductive load requires the <b>connector's</b> insulating <b>housing</b> to contain the plasma arc, in addition to normal requirements such as preventing accidental finger contact.

40|$|Abstract â In {{this study}} we {{describe}} a new concept for a sensor using fully distributed sensing along optical fibres designed especially for monitoring lateral movements in embankments and settlement areas, and deformations of excavation walls and tunnels. The sensor design includes four components: mass block housing, middle cylinder, <b>connector</b> <b>housing,</b> optical fibers and mass-block. The block housing is to hold the mass block and guide its sliding. Two blocks are designed to stretch sensing optical fiber when the block housing has inclination. The sensing optical fiber are required for performing sensing task in a ela range. One end of the whole pipe sensor is fixed to a pole, which was deeply embeded in soil of embankment dam. The permofmance of designed pipe sensor {{was carried out by}} a loading model of the dam settlement. DiTeSt-STA 202 is then adopted to read and determine the sensitivity of the pipe sensor, which is the most impotant parameter for a sensor. The sensor provides a useful and precise method to detect and mornitor inside change of the embankment dam, as well as to detect and mornitor the settlement of other structures...|$|E

Although {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "dongles", the alternative term [...] "Pig-tail" [...] is favoured by some in the IT industry, due to the appearance of a full-sized connection element, with a short, thin wire extending, somewhat reminiscent of the rear of porcine animals. The term is somewhat descriptive, and allows one to avoid using the word dongle except for its original meaning.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the Apple IIe, the Apple engineers realised that the video bandwidth doubling circuitry used to implement 80-column text mode could be easily extended to include the machine's graphics modes. Since the signal was present at the auxiliary slot <b>connector</b> which <b>housed</b> the Extended 80 Column Card, Annunciator 3 on the game port was overloaded to activate double resolution graphics when both 80 column video and a graphics mode was selected. Replacement motherboards (called the Revision B motherboard) were offered free of charge to owners of the Apple IIe to upgrade their machines with double resolution graphics capabilities. For this reason, machines with the original Revision A motherboard are extremely rare. Subsequent Apple II models also implement the double resolution graphics modes.|$|R
40|$|Faults in wiring {{systems are}} a serious {{concern for the}} {{aerospace}} and aeronautic (commercial, military, and civilian) industries. Circuit failures and vehicle accidents have occurred and {{have been attributed to}} faulty wiring created by open and/or short circuits. Often, such circuit failures occur due to vibration during vehicle launch or operation. Therefore, developing non-intrusive fault-tolerant techniques is necessary to detect circuit faults and automatically route signals through alternate recovery paths while the vehicle or lunar surface systems equipment is in operation. Electrical connector concepts combining dust mitigation strategies and cable diagnostic technologies have significant application for lunar and Martian surface systems, as well as for dusty terrestrial applications. The dust-tolerant intelligent electrical connection system has several novel concepts and unique features. It combines intelligent cable diagnostics (health monitoring) and automatic circuit routing capabilities into a dust-tolerant electrical umbilical. It retrofits a clamshell protective dust cover to an existing connector for reduced gravity operation, and features a universal <b>connector</b> <b>housing</b> with three styles of dust protection: inverted cap, rotating cap, and clamshell. It uses a self-healing membrane as a dust barrier for electrical connectors where required, while also combining lotus leaf technology for applications where a dust-resistant coating providing low surface tension is needed to mitigate Van der Waals forces, thereby disallowing dust particle adhesion to connector surfaces. It also permits using a ruggedized iris mechanism with an embedded electrodynamic dust shield as a dust barrier for electrical connectors where required...|$|E
40|$|Regolith {{is present}} on most {{planetary}} surfaces such as Earth's moon, Mars, and Asteroids. If human crews and robotic machinery are {{to operate on}} these regolith covered surfaces, they must face the consequences of interacting with regolith fines which consist of particles below 100 microns in diameter down to as small as submicron scale particles. Such fine dust will intrude into mechanisms and interfaces causing a variety of problems such as contamination of clean fluid lines, jamming of mechanisms and damaging connector seals and couplings. Since multiple elements must be assembled in space for system level functionality, it will be inevitable that interfaces will be necessary for structural connections, and to pass commodities such as cryogenic liquid propellants, purge and buffer gases, water, breathing air, pressurizing gases, heat exchange fluids, power and data. When fine regolith dust {{is present in the}} environment it can be lofted into interfaces where it can compromise the utility of the interface by preventing the connections from being successfully mated, or by inducing fluid leaks or degradation of power and data transmission. A dust tolerant, hand held "quick-disconnect" cryogenic fluids <b>connector</b> <b>housing</b> has been developed at NASA KSC which can be used by astronaut crews to connect flex lines that will transfer propellants and other useful fluids to the end user. In addition, a dust tolerant, automated, cryogenic fluid, multiple connector, power and data interface mechanism prototype has been developed, fabricated and demonstrated by NASA at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The design and operation of these prototypes are explained and discussed...|$|E
