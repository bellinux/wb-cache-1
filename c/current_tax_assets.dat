40|$|AbstractThe {{adoption}} of IASB’s standards has represented, in the European Union, an important effort of harmonization towards the financial reporting comprehensiveness, reliability, relevance and comparability. This paper seeks {{to highlight the}} importance of Information Compliance Indexes (ICI), based on the accounting standards, {{as a proxy for}} reporting quality awareness. This approach is evidenced through an illustrative example about disclosures on deferred taxes, as required by IAS 12. This standard prescribes the accounting treatment for <b>current</b> <b>taxes,</b> deferred <b>assets</b> and liabilities. These issues are usually perceived by stakeholders as indicators of companies’ continuity and potential future returns. Based on non-financial listed companies of Euronext Lisbon regulated market, with reference to the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2012, an information compliance index was performed, based on that accounting standard. Then, this index was regressed with a set of performance and control indicators.

The 2007 Spanish General Accounting Plan approved by Royal Decree 1514 / 2007, of November 16 th differentiates between the <b>current</b> income <b>tax</b> expense (income) and the deferred income tax expense (income). The total tax expense or income is the sum of these two items, which should nonetheless be quantified separately. On the one hand, the <b>current</b> income <b>tax</b> expense is the amount payable by the company as a result of income tax settlements for a given year. Conversely, the deferred income tax expense reflects in essence the recognition and settlement of deferred <b>tax</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities. A deferred <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> or liability represents the increase or decrease in taxes payable or refundable in future years as a result of temporary differences and any net operating loss or tax credit carry-forwards that exist at the reporting date. Its value is computed with reference to financial reporting standards for book income and tax rules for taxable income. For instance, deferred <b>tax</b> <b>assets</b> can be created by the tax authority recognizing revenues and/or expenses outside of the times set out in the accounting standards. In Spain “tax effect accounting”, which includes the concept of net <b>tax</b> deferred <b>assets,</b> was first introduced in fiscal year 2007.|$|R

Firms differ substantially in the composition of their deferred <b>tax</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities.

Using data from firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange during the period 1999 to 2005, we find evidence consistent with income-increasing earnings management when pre-tax earnings are below the median analyst forecast. Interestingly, we find that the potential existence of earnings management does not reduce the capacity of changes in unrecognised deferred <b>tax</b> <b>assets</b> from carry-forward losses to predict one-year-ahead performance, and to a much lesser extent, three-year ahead performance.
