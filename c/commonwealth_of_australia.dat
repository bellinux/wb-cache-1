5|$|In 1911 the Australia Station {{passed to}} the Commonwealth Naval Forces (initially {{under the command of}} RN officers) and the Australian Squadron was disbanded. The Station, now under nominal Australian command, was reduced to only cover Australia and its island {{dependencies}} to the north and east. In 1911, the Commonwealth Naval Forces was renamed the Royal Australian Navy, which in 1913 came under Australian command. The Royal Navy's Australia Station's Sydney based depots, dockyards and structures were gifted to the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia.</b> The Royal Navy continued to support the RAN and provided additional blue-water defence capability in the Pacific up to the early years of World War II.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, after {{pressure}} from the returned soldiers, a second competition was announced. Once again the budget was set at £25,000. As per the first competition, all entrants had to be South Australian British subjects, and all entries were to be judged anonymously, but {{this time there was}} to be only one assessor: John Smith Murdoch, the chief architect for the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia.</b> In deference to the previous competition, the top five entrants from 1924 were each given £75 upon the submission of a new design, and all of the designs were insured by the government for £100 each.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1901, Australia {{became a}} {{federation}} of six States, as the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia,</b> which on 1 March 1901 {{took over the}} defence forces from the States, to form the Commonwealth Naval Forces. The Australian and New Zealand governments agreed with the Imperial government to help fund the Royal Navy's Australian Squadron, while the Admiralty committed itself to maintain the Squadron at a constant strength. In 1902, {{the commander of the}} Australia Station was upgraded to the rank of Vice Admiral. The boundaries were again modified in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Section116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia</b> (i.e., {{the federal}} parliament) from making laws for {{establishing}} any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting {{the free exercise}} of any religion. Section116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia</b> {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 January 1901 {{as a result of}} the federation of the Australian colonies. Under the Constitution of Australia, defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government. The co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind federalism, and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result, while the Commonwealth Military Forces (early forerunner of the Australian Army) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the cyclone, the Australian government distributed financial and emergency aid, offering to provide assistance to hard-hit banana and sugar cane farmers in northern Queensland. Hundreds of State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers were deployed to restore electrical and water services, evacuate local citizens, provide food, and repair and protect structures. The Department of Social Security (DSS) sent employees to receive claims for damage, requests for financial aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia</b> initiated a three-year, $150million program to provide relief to damaged areas. Fund payments, however, were frequently incorrectly distributed, and in some cases, fraudulent. In the confusion in the days following the cyclone, looters stole possessions in areas within the vicinity of Innisfail, and relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms at Cairns. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) was subject to heavy criticism in the days following the storm's landfall, accused of not giving ample warning in advance of Winifred's approach; however, these concerns were later addressed in its report on the cyclone's impact. Due to the severity of the storm's damage, the name Winifred was retired after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1901, {{the colonies}} of Australia federated {{to form the}} <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia.</b> When Chauvel {{returned}} to Australia on 17 January, he found that during his absence he had become {{an officer in the}} newly formed Australian Army. A force of 14,000troops was assembled for the opening of the first Federal Parliament on 9 May 1901 in Melbourne; Chauvel was selected as brigade major of the mounted contingent, his first Federal posting. He became Staff Officer, Northern Military District, based at Townsville, Queensland, in July. In 1902, Chauvel was appointed to command of the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse, a unit newly raised for service in South Africa, with the local rank of lieutenant colonel. Departing from Brisbane on 17 May 1902, the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse arrived at Durban on 22 June, three weeks after the war ended. It therefore re-embarked for Brisbane, where it was disbanded. Chauvel remained in South Africa for a few weeks in order to tour the battlefields. On returning to Australia he became Staff Officer, Northern Military District once more. He was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1902.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the Heffrons {{moved to}} Melbourne, Victoria. That same year in Victoria, Heffron was {{appointed}} an organiser for the Federated Clothing Trades of the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia</b> and also joined the leftist Victorian Socialist Party. Later in 1921 {{he moved to}} Sydney, becoming {{the secretary of the}} New South Wales branch of the Federated Marine Stewards' and Pantrymen's Association of Australasia. As the union's state secretary, a role he would hold for ten years, he took a prominent role in maritime trade unionism in Sydney. In February 1924, when the Commonwealth and Dominion Line steamer Port Lyttelton was declared 'Black' by the Labor Council of New South Wales owing to various worker's disputes and the ship having been declared unseaworthy, Heffron and six other union representatives acted to advise members of the Seamen's Union to refuse to work on the Port Lyttelton. For this, in April the government of Sir George Fuller had Heffron and the six other unionists arrested on the charge of conspiracy to strike action. Although controversially refused bail by the trial judge, Heffron and his fellow defendants, represented by Richard Windeyer KC and H. V. Evatt, were found not guilty and released in July 1924 by the court, a verdict that had been returned by the direction of the judge. Later joining the Australian Labor Party, at the time he showed himself to be a supporter of party leader Jack Lang, supporting Lang's successful motion at the 1923 state conference to readmit James Dooley to the party.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Australia</b> {{was founded}} on 1 January 1901. On 1 March, 29,010 colonial soldiers, {{consisting}} of 1,544 professional soldiers, 16,105 paid militia and 11,361 unpaid volunteers, were transferred to the new Australian Army. However, the units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts. Major General Sir Edward Hutton, a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces, was appointed as the first commander of the Commonwealth Forces, assuming command in early 1902 with Army Headquarters subsequently formed at Victoria Barracks in Melbourne. The Defence Act 1903 brought all of the state units under one piece of legislation; although more significantly, it prevented the raising of standing infantry units, only allowing the establishment of permanent administrative and instructional staff for headquarters, garrison artillery, fortress engineers, submarine mining engineers, and service, medical and ordnance units. It also stipulated that the force could only be maintained by voluntary enlistment {{and that it could}} not serve outside Australia. In this it effectively established the pre-eminence of the Citizen Forces, ensuring that the Australian Army would primarily consist of part-time militia and volunteer forces, which would be supported by a small permanent force limited to filling staff, training and garrison roles. It equally ensured that any force sent overseas could only be done so on a voluntary basis.|$|E
