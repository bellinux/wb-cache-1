50|$|In 1991, {{the mine}} {{declared}} the Storke Level ore abandoned, no more ore could be extracted profitably, so the company redirected its focus to other things, such as open-pit reclamation, the haulage of open-pit waste to the tailings dam, and hydromulching, among others. Climax also started the reclamation {{of a particular}} highly acidic tailing pond {{at the head of}} the Eagle River drainage. It sold the water rights to a company from Vail and started the process of removing and neutralizing the acid tailings to convert the pond to a freshwater reservoir. To do this, they used a “hydrology mining” process to extract the tailings from the bedrock it had been sitting on for several decades. This process converted the compacted tailings to a water slurry that could be easily piped into a pond where it would be <b>chemically</b> <b>neutralized.</b>|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the role of asymmetric phosphate neutralization in DNA bending induced by proteins. We describe an experimental estimate of the actual electrostatic contribution of asymmetric phosphate neutralization to the bending of DNA by the Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP), a prototypical DNA-bending protein. Following assignment of putative electrostatic interactions between CAP and DNA phosphates based on X-ray crystal structures, appropriate phosphates in the CAP half-site DNA were <b>chemically</b> <b>neutralized</b> by methylphosphonate substitution. DNA shape was then evaluated using a semi-synthetic DNA electrophoretic phasing assay. Our results confirm that the unmodified CAP DNA half-site sequence is intrinsically curved by 26 ° in the direction enhanced in the complex with protein. In the absence of protein, neutralization of five appropriate phosphates increases DNA curvature to 32 ° (∼ 23 % increase), in the predicted direction. Shifting the placement of the neutralized phosphates changes the DNA shape, suggesting that sequence-directed DNA curvature can be modified by the asymmetry of phosphate neutralization. We suggest that asymmetric phosphate neutralization contributes favorably to DNA bending by CAP, but cannot account for the full DNA deformation...|$|R
40|$|Toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur worldwide. The blossoming algae produce biotoxins {{that cause}} health problems, devastate marine life, {{and result in}} {{significant}} economic loss. Karenia brevis (Kb), the alga causing Florida HABs (Kb HABs), produces a powerful neurotoxin called brevetoxin. The molecular binding properties of the amino acid derivative, cysteine methyl ester (CME), allow CME to <b>chemically</b> <b>neutralize</b> brevetoxin in vitro. This project evaluated the ability of CME in vivo to reduce bioaccumulation of brevetoxin in Mercenaria mercenaria clams. This clam was selected for testing because it is commercially relevant and is known to bioaccumulate dangerous levels of brevetoxin. The hypothesis was that CME treatment of the clams, prior to, and concurrent with, Kb exposure, would significantly reduce bioaccumulation of brevetoxin. It was further hypothesized that both CME pretreatment and concurrent treatment, of the clams exposed to Kb, would produce a shorter period of bioaccumulation of brevetoxin. After sufficient exposure to a simulated Kb bloom, ELISA test results demonstrated that CME pretreatment and concurrent treatment of the clams effectively reduced bioaccumulation of brevetoxin (P= 0. 0277) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cell wall}} of Bacillus subtilis {{is capable of}} binding {{different}} kinds of metal ions. The wall-ion complex appears {{to be dependent on}} both phosphoryl from teichoic acid and carboxylate from peptidoglycan. In the present study, cationized ferritin (CF) was used as a probe for charge distribution on the wall of B. subtilis 168. Detergent-extracted cell walls bound CF only on the outer wall face. Completed cell poles bound CF, but septa did not. When the walls were permitted to autolyze briefly, binding of CF occurred on both faces. In contrast, limited hydrolysis of the walls by egg white lysozyme resulted in the penetration of CF into the wall matrix. When walls were made teichoic acid-free, CF-binding asymmetry was preserved, suggesting that carboxyl groups were oriented toward the surface. Walls with carboxylates <b>chemically</b> <b>neutralized</b> also retained charge asymmetry. Phosphate-free and carboxyl-modified walls bound CF only poorly or not at all. These results indicate that negative charges contributed by both phosphate and carboxyl are responsible for the binding of CF and that the observed asymmetry in the distribution of the label is due to the orientation of teichoic acid and muramyl peptides toward the outside of the cell wall, above the plane of the glycan strands...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that {{a large proportion of}} upper digestive tract tumors are ascribable to heavy alcohol drinking and tobacco consumption. The cancer-promoting action of ethanol is mediated by acetaldehyde, its first metabolite, also derived from the bacterial oxidation of alcohol by the oral microflora, classified by the International Agency for the Research on Cancer as a carcinogen. Acetaldehyde {{is also one of the}} major components of tobacco smoke. These findings suggest two different strategies to decrease the risk of alcohol-related oral cancers: the reduction of the levels of alcohol-derived acetaldehyde in saliva and the reduction of oral bacterial flora. Therefore, the aim of our study was to develop and characterize some buccal tablet formulations containing both 20 [*]mg l-cysteine hydrochloride (able to <b>chemically</b> <b>neutralize</b> acetaldehyde) and 10 [*]mg chlorhexidine diacetate (well-known antiseptic compound active against a large spectrum of oral microbes). One of these formulations, chosen on the basis of its favourable delivery kinetics of the active principles, was demonstrated to be able to reduce acetaldehyde concentration in an in vitro system and to lower its salivary levels in volunteers after ethanol contact. Our findings support the hypothesis that the application of buccal devices containing cysteine and chlorhexidine could reduce salivary acetaldehyde levels and thus the incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer in drinkers and smokers...|$|R
40|$|The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} multilateral arms control instruments; it requires its 188 parties to refrain from producing, acquiring, retaining or using chemical weapons (CW) and to destroy their existing CW stockpiles by a fixed date. The United States and Russia declared the possession of the world’s largest CW inventories and have been working assiduously to incinerate, <b>chemically</b> <b>neutralize</b> or otherwise dispose of their respective caches. Unfortunately, neither country met the treaty’s April 29, 2012 final, non-extendable deadline. The United States managed to destroy 90 % of its CW stocks on time, but under current projections, it will not complete the process until 2023 –more than 11 years late. This article examines the causes of that default and analyzes its legal and policy consequences. It concludes that the United States stands in material breach of the CWC; that none of the putative legal excuses or justifications is adequate to absolve the violation; and that other parties may have recourse to remedies under the CWC, under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, or under general international law. Moreover, it concludes that the striking U. S. diplomatic success in largely finessing this issue through the CWC’s treaty implementation bodies is misguided–although it has allowed the United States to escape censure or punishment in this instance, that accomplishment deserves the true long-run U. S. interest in insisting upon the importance of strict compliance with arms control treaties and in validating the rule of international law more generally...|$|R
40|$|Harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur {{worldwide}} in {{bodies of water}} that range from ponds to oceans. A few species of algae produce and release lethal toxins that under certain conditions are sufficient to damage human health and marine life and severely impact coastal economies. HABs of Karenia brevis (“red tides”) can develop over hundreds of square miles of open water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, and their control can be challenging. To succeed, control methods for HABs {{must be based on}} sound theory, must address the toxic effects of the bloom, and must be applicable on a large scale. This project investigated a chemical approach for mitigating the effects of Florida Harmful Algal Blooms (FHABs) using the amino acid derivative, cysteine methyl ester (CME). Karenia brevis, the alga causing FHABs, releases powerful neurotoxic brevetoxins. CME was evaluated because it can <b>chemically</b> <b>neutralize</b> brevetoxins by molecular binding (Naar, et al, 2007). The specific objective of this research was to determine in vitro the length of time that a single CME treatment could neutralize brevetoxins at the typical Gulf of Mexico summer and winter temperatures of 29 °C and 18 °C. Sonicated Karenia brevis was combined with artificial seawater, treated with CME, and incubated. The incubated samples were processed using Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) to collect the resulting toxins and derivatives. SPE eluted products were analyzed for brevetoxin content using High Performance Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry. CME was found to be very effective in neutralizing brevetoxins. A single CME treatment remained 100 % effective for 37 days and partially effective for at least an additional seven days. Temperature in the range 18 °- 29 °C did not have a significant influence on how long a treatment was effective (P= 0. 0978) ...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy and {{electron microscopy}} of unstained specimens {{have been used}} to study the binding of chloropentaammineosmium(III) chloride to isolated walls of Bacillus subtilis. Native walls bound 0. 220 mumol of the osmium probe per mg (dry weight) of walls, whereas walls which were <b>chemically</b> treated to <b>neutralize</b> the available carboxylate groups of the peptidoglycan bound only 0. 040 mumol. Teichoic acid-depleted walls bound 0. 210 mumol. Thin sections of all wall types showed the osmium probe to be scattered throughout the wall matrix as a small staining deposit. The results support the idea that the metal ion-binding capacity of these walls is mediated by the available carboxylate groups in the wall fabric...|$|R
40|$|Carbonation of raw red mud {{produced}} by aluminium refineries and a <b>chemically</b> and physically <b>neutralized</b> red mud (Bauxsol™) {{has been carried}} out to study the capacity of these wastes to capture carbon dioxide. After only 5 min of carbonation of raw red mud, total alkalinity dropped 85 %. Hydroxide alkalinity was almost totally consumed, carbonate alkalinity dropped by 88 %, and bicarbonate alkalinity increased to 728 mg L– 1. After 24 min carbonation, the bicarbonate alkalinity reached its maximum value of 2377 mg L– 1, and hydroxide and carbonate alkalinity were virtually absent. After 30 and 60 min carbonation, bicarbonate alkalinity started to decrease slightly as the pH of the slurry increased. After 5 min carbonation of Bauxsol™, total and bicarbonate alkalinity dropped 89 % and 9 %, respectively. After 20 min carbonation, bicarbonate alkalinity dropped another 11 %, but after 30 min carbonation bicarbonate alkalinity increased 26 % to levels found in the original Bauxsol material, and pH was stable. Based on these experiments, a calculation of the amount of carbon dioxide that could be removed annually at aluminium refineries in Australia is potentially 15 million tonnes, and suggests that further studies are necessary to maximize this carbon removal process. Furthermore, carbonation produces a product, which can potentially be used in other industrial and agricultural activities to remove toxic metals and nutrients...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (FGF- 2) {{is important in}} development, wound healing and angiogenesis. The human plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha 2 -macroglobulin (alpha 2 M) binds to and regulates the biological activity of various growth factors, including FGF- 2. FGF- 2 binds specifically and saturably to native alpha 2 M and conformationally modified alpha 2 M (alpha 2 M*); however, the KD for FGF- 2 binding to alpha 2 M* is 10 -fold lower. This study investigates the biochemical nature {{of the interaction between}} FGF- 2 and alpha 2 M* and localizes a possible FGF- 2 binding site in the alpha 2 M subunit. FGF- 2 binding to alpha 2 M* was not affected by shifts in pH between 6. 5 and 10; however, increasing temperature decreased the KD for this interaction. The binding affinity of FGF- 2 for alpha 2 M* also increased with increasing ionic strength. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hydrophobic interactions predominate in promoting FGF- 2 association with alpha 2 M*. Consistent with this hypothesis, FGF- 2 bound to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 591 - 774 of the alpha 2 M subunit (FP 3) and to a hydrophobic 16 -amino-acid peptide (amino acids 718 - 733) within FP 3. Specific binding of FGF- 2 to the 16 -amino-acid peptide was inhibited by excess transforming growth factor-beta 1. When the 16 -amino-acid peptide was <b>chemically</b> modified to <b>neutralize</b> the only two charged amino acids, FGF- 2 -binding activity was unaffected, supporting the predominant role of hydrophobic interactions. FGF- 2 presentation to signalling receptors is influenced by growth factor binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which is electrostatic in nature. Our results demonstrate that the interactions of FGF- 2 with alpha 2 M* and HSPGs are biochemically distinct, suggesting that different FGF- 2 sequences are involved...|$|R
