40|$|This paper investigates {{nonlinear}} multi-mode {{interactions in}} subsea risers undergoing vortex-induced vibrations {{based on a}} computationally efficient reduced-order fluid-structure interaction model. Cross-flow responses {{as a result of}} a steady uniform current are considered. The geometrically nonlinear equations of riser motion are coupled with nonlinear wake oscillators which have been modified to capture the effect of initial curvatures of curved cylinder and to approximate the space-time varying hydrodynamic lift forces. The main objectives are to provide new insights into the vortex-induced vibration characteristics of risers under external and internal resonances and to distinguish nonlinear dynamic behaviors between <b>curved</b> <b>catenary</b> and straight toptensioned risers. The analyses of multi-mode contributions, lock-in regimes, response amplitudes, resonant nonlinear modes and curvatures are carried out and several interesting aspects are highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{techniques}} used in old buildings, as in suspension bridges, improved {{in the course}} of time, generating curved structures that minimize materials and maximize strength. Among the curves used there is the <b>catenary</b> <b>curve,</b> which is an excellent way of building with arches that are supported by the weight and provide stability, flexibility and strength to the structures. The <b>curves</b> <b>catenaries</b> offer better distribution of forces and tensions and its main advantage is that the forces applied in any curve point are divided equally by all her. As a result, structures built in this way have the maximum strength with the least possible use of material. In this work we studied an alternative use in hermetic compressors used in domestic refrigeration, with the objective of reducing material and better thermal efficiency and structural. The <b>catenary</b> <b>curves</b> are applied to the geometry of the cylinder block, keeping the other parts, piston, shaft and connecting rods in their original format. A preliminary study allowed the selection of a viable set of values for the two parameters that determine each catenary. A compressor model was created in the software Claim Space and several simulations were performed in Ansys software for catenary different selected. As criteria for the selection of alternatives sought to maximize the area of heat transfer and minimize th...|$|R

40|$|Changes {{in shape}} of the mandibular dental arch were {{demonstrated}} in a developmentally representative sample of human embryos. Each reconstructed arch was {{described in terms of}} a conformance to a reference geo-metric curve; ie, catenary. Cross-sectional sample trends showed that the initial dental lamina is anteroposteriorly flattened during the sixth week and begins a progressive elon-gation and conformance to the <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> in 8 1, -week embryos. There is no one reference standard that de-scribes the early prenatal development and subsequent changes in the {{shape of the}} post-natal human dental arch. Arch shape has been described qualitatively by using such geometric terms as semiellipsoid, paraboloid, U-shaped, rotund, and horseshoe-shaped. In a quantitative study, MacConaill and Scherl have suggested that the postnatal form of the dental arcade can be described by a <b>catenary</b> <b>curve.</b> Scott 2 concurs, and has stated that the arrangement of embryonic tooth germs and their parent dental lamina also conform to a <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> as they differentiate. In a refinement of Scott's observations, Burdi and Lillie 3 have supported this observation of prenatal catenary dental arch shape. They have reported that the maxillary dental lamina first appears late in the sixth week in utero as an anteroposteriorly flattened arch, and that it does not conform to a <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> until approximately 9 1 / 2 weeks in utero. Those who have used the <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> for descriptive purposes recognize that its choice as a reference standard is arbitrary.

His work was focused on approximating the look of cloth by treating cloth like a collection of cables and using Hyperbolic cosine (<b>catenary)</b> <b>curves.</b> Because of this, it is not suitable for dynamic models but works very well for stationary or single-frame renders. This technique creates an underlying shape out of single points; then, it parses through each set of three of these points and maps a <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> to the set. It then takes the lowest out of each overlapping set and uses it for the render.|$|R

40|$|In modern road surveys, hanging {{power cables}} {{are among the}} most commonly-found {{geometric}} features. These cables are <b>catenary</b> <b>curves</b> that are conventionally modelled with three parameters in 2 D Cartesian space. With the advent and popularity of the mobile mapping system (MMS), the 3 D point clouds of hanging power cables can be captured within a short period of time. These point clouds, similarly to those of planar features, can be used for feature-based self-calibration of the system assembly errors of an MMS. However, to achieve this, a well-defined 3 D equation for the <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> is needed. This paper proposes three 3 D <b>catenary</b> <b>curve</b> models, each having different parameters. The models are examined by least squares fitting of simulated data and real data captured with an MMS. The outcome of the fitting is investigated in terms of the residuals and correlation matrices. Among the proposed models, one of them could estimate the parameters accurately and without any extreme correlation between the variables. This model can also be applied to those transmission lines captured by airborne laser scanning or any other hanging cable-like objects. 1...|$|R
