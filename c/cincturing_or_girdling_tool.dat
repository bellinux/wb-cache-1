2500|$|In the sacristy, before vesting, {{all three}} sacred ministers (priest celebrant, deacon, and subdeacon) wash their hands. The sacred ministers recite certain prayers while they place on each vestment. First, the amice (a {{rectangular}} cloth of linen with long strings for tying) is kissed (if it is embroidered with a cross) and then placed {{on top of}} the head briefly while reciting one of the prayers during vesting. Then it is tied around the shoulders {{on top of the}} cassock (or on top of the habit, if the sacred ministers belongs to a religious order with one). Next the alb (a long linen tunic with sleeves) is put on. The cincture (in Latin, cinctura), a long cloth cord also called a girdle, is then tied around the waist. The subdeacon then completes his vesting by placing the maniple (an embroidered piece of fabric, folded in half, with a cross in the middle) on his left arm (provided there is no Asperges or other liturgical ceremony before Mass begins), securing it either with pins or with the ribbons or elastic inside, and then the tunicle (an embroidered tunic with short sleeves) over all. The deacon places his stole (a long narrow embroidered piece of cloth, similar to the maniple but of greater length) over his left shoulder and binds it in place, at his right hip, with the <b>cincture</b> <b>or</b> <b>girdle.</b> He then puts on the maniple and his dalmatic (similar to the tunicle). The priest celebrant does the same except that he crosses his stole in front of him at the waist, binding it with the <b>girdle</b> <b>or</b> <b>cincture.</b> After the maniple he puts on a cope (a long, heavy embroidered cape) if the Mass is preceded by the Asperges (sprinkling the congregation with holy water). [...] Following the Asperges, the celebrant, assisted by the acolytes, removes the cope and puts on the chasuble (similar to the tunicle, but without sleeves and usually with an embroidered cross or image on the back).|$|R
40|$|Even {{though the}} {{practice}} of <b>girdling</b> <b>or</b> scoring pear trees goes back more than 2000 years, many questions still remain about the physiological reasons for the observed responses. The phenological stage at which the technique is used {{and the intensity of}} application (scoring, <b>cincturing,</b> <b>girdling</b> <b>or</b> notching) determines the type of response that is obtained. Amongst the most well known responses are a decrease in shoot growth, an increase in fruit set, an increase in return bloom and an increase in fruit size. A number of hypotheses have been presented, either leaning towards a change in carbohydrate levels or with more emphasis placed on endogenous hormone levels resulting in the response to the treatment. Most of these however, do not distinguish between the different techniques (e. g., girdling vs. scoring), time of application of the technique or whether trees are evergreen or deciduous.

40|$|The {{persimmon}} (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) cultivar Triumph {{is prone}} to poor fruit set, particularly in young orchards, in both Israel and South Africa where it is mostly grown. Two applications of 20 mg·L- 1 gibberellic acid (GA 3) at 30 % and 70 % full bloom (FB) are recommended as the industry norm to increase fruit set, but results obtained are often unsatisfactory. We conducted experiments during the 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07 seasons in a young orchard (less than 5 years old) and a full-bearing orchard to determine the efficacy of GA 3 application and scoring <b>or</b> <b>girdling</b> during FB to increase fruit set and yield in 'Triumph' persimmon. We also established the effect of 2005 - 06 treatments on return bloom in 2006 - 07. Although GA 3 treatments were ineffective in increasing fruit set and reduced cumulative yield over the two seasons {{as a result of}} a reduction in return bloom, scoring increased the cumulative yield by 50 % compared with the untreated control and by 92 % compared with GA 3 application in the young orchard. In the full-bearing orchard, scoring <b>or</b> <b>girdling</b> increased the cumulative yield over the 2005 - 06 and 2006 - 07 seasons by 52 % compared with the industry standard GA 3 application and by 22 % compared with trees that received scoring/girdling in addition to GA 3. Hence, scoring <b>or</b> <b>girdling</b> did not entirely offset the negative effect of GA 3 application on return bloom. The increase in fruit numbers in response to fruit set treatment brought about a reduction in fruit mass. In conclusion, the ineffectiveness of GA 3 in increasing fruit set and its negative effect on return bloom do not justify its further use to improve fruit set in young or full-bearing 'Triumph' orchards in South Africa. Either scoring <b>or</b> <b>girdling</b> can be used to increase yield but will need to be accompanied by pruning and thinning strategies to achieve adequate fruit size and to prevent the onset of alternate bearing resulting from overcropping.
