25|$|State of New South Wales v Shaw the NSW Court of Appeal {{held that}} the {{statutory}} and industrial regime which regulated the former teachers' employment contracts meant it was not necessary, to give the contracts effective operation, that a general term of good faith be implied, nor {{as an adjunct to}} the exercise of other <b>contractual</b> <b>rights.</b> The Court of Appeal also rejected that there would have been any breach of a term of good faith.|$|E

25|$|KTVU {{has also}} served as the market's primary {{official}} television broadcaster of the San Francisco 49ers since 1994, when Fox assumed the <b>contractual</b> <b>rights</b> to air games from the National Football Conference (NFC). The station airs most of the team's regular season and playoff games {{that do not have}} rights held by other broadcast networks (primarily those involving the 49ers' in-conference opponents), as well as other 49ers-related programming during the NFL season including the pre-game show 49ers Pre Game Live (on Sunday mornings), the weekly station-produced sports program KTVU Mercedes-Benz Sports Weekend (on Saturday evenings), magazine program 49ers Total Access (which follows Sports Wrap on Sunday evenings) and the 49ers Red & Gold Specials (comprising four programs focusing on the 49ers' history that air on either KTVU or KICU during the team's training camp and/or preseason).|$|E
25|$|KDFW began {{serving as}} the primary {{television}} station for the Dallas Cowboys as a CBS affiliate in 1962, when the network obtained the television rights to the pre-AFL merger National Football League. The station carried most regional or national Cowboys game telecasts aired by CBS until its <b>contractual</b> <b>rights</b> to the National Football Conference concluded in 1993. To date, the one-year interruption in game coverage after that season, due to the transfer of NFC telecast rights from CBS to Fox, is the only break in network coverage of the team by the station since 1962; for the 1994 season, the team's over-the-air game telecasts aired instead on lame-duck Fox O KDAF. Channel 4 resumed its status as the Cowboys' primary local broadcaster two months after it joined Fox, in September 1995; incidentally, that year's NFL season saw the Cowboys compete in Super Bowl XXX (which aired locally on NBC affiliate KXAS-TV), in which they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 27-17, to win the championship title.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, on 26 June, Arsenal {{announced}} that 11 players were to depart the club upon their contract expiration on 30 June. The most notable players leaving {{that were not}} previously documented included Nicklas Bendtner, who made 169 appearances during his nine-year stint at the club, scoring 47 goals, including the winner against Ipswich Town that took the Gunners to the 2011 League Cup Final and the sole Arsenal goal in a 4–1 loss at the Camp Nou against Barcelona. In addition, Park Chu-young left the club having made seven appearances in three years that included two year-long loans spells to Celta de Vigo and Watford. He scored a single goal for the club in a League Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers. Emiliano Viviano and Kim Källström both departed the club following the expiration of their loan deals, returning to parent clubs Palermo and Spartak Moscow respectively. Lastly, Real Sociedad confirmed Arsenal had sold their remaining <b>contractual</b> <b>rights</b> on Carlos Vela for a fee believed to be around £12million. This enabled Real Sociedad to have full control over the player's contract, relinquishing any ability for Arsenal to buy Vela for a pre-determined fee.|$|E

25|$|In April 1959 Iran {{altered the}} legal status of the strait by {{expanding}} its territorial sea to 12-nautical-mile (22km) and declaring that it would recognize only transit by innocent passage through the newly expanded area. In July 1972, Oman expanded its territorial sea to 12nm by decree. Thus, by mid-1972, the Strait of Hormuz was completely “closed” by the combined territorial waters of Iran and Oman. During the 1970s, neither Iran or Oman attempted to impede the passage of warships through the strait, but in the 1980s, both countries asserted claims that were different with customary (old) law. Upon ratifying UNCLOS in August 1989, Oman submitted declarations confirming its 1981 royal decree that only innocent passage is permitted through its territorial sea. The declarations further asserted that prior permission was required before foreign warships could pass through Omani territorial waters. Upon signing the convention in December 1982, Iran entered a declaration stating “that only states parties to the Law of the Sea Convention shall be entitled to benefit from the <b>contractual</b> <b>rights</b> created therein”, including “the right of transit passage through straits used for international navigation”. In May 1993, Iran enacted a comprehensive law on maritime areas, several provisions of which conflict with UNCLOS provisions, including a requirement that warships, submarines, and nuclear-powered ships obtain permission before exercising innocent passage through Iran’s territorial waters.The United States does not recognize any of the claims by Oman and Iran and has contested each of them.|$|E
500|$|Authors {{can still}} {{rely on the}} old common law rights which remain in force; they act as {{alternate}} forms of relief if a claim under dedicated moral rights is dubious, or is seen as unlikely to succeed. Similarly, an author can sometimes rely on <b>contractual</b> <b>rights,</b> as in Frisby v BBC, where the claimant was allowed to block modifications to his work by virtue of a contractual clause prohibiting the BBC from making [...] "structural" [...] changes to his script. Originally these were the only forms of relief for injured authors, although Section 43 of the Copyright Act 1956 created a [...] "tort of misattribution". With the 1988 Act, however, four distinct moral rights were recognised: {{the right to be}} identified as the author (the right of paternity), the right to object to derogatory treatment (the right of integrity), the right to object to false attribution, and the right to privacy in private films and photographs. Because moral rights are personal rights attached to the author, rather than economic rights attached to the work, they cannot be transferred or assigned, but they can be waived.|$|E
