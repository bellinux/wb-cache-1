25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> third guy ready.|$|E

[...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great crew and they're well trained, but there's also a little luck involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Avery {{recorded}} a video for the New Yorkers for Marriage Equality campaign, {{in support of}} same-sex marriage. Avery {{was believed to be}} the first athlete in New York to publicly voice his support for same-sex marriage. In an interview with the New York Times, he stated, [...] "I certainly have been surrounded by the gay community. And living in New York and when you live in L.A., you <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of gay friends." [...] Avery also traveled to Albany, New York, to lobby politicians prior to the July 2011 legalization of same-sex marriage in New York State.|$|E

2500|$|Brooke {{believed}} {{that the lack of}} a unified command of the three services was [...] "a grave danger" [...] to the defence of the country. Despite this, {{and the fact that the}} available forces never reached the numbers he thought were required, Brooke considered the situation far from [...] "helpless" [...] in case the Germans invaded. [...] "We should <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> desperate struggle and the future might well have hung in the balance, but I certainly felt that given a fair share of the fortunes of war we should certainly succeed in finally defending these shores", he wrote after the war. But in the end, the German invasion plan was never taken beyond the preliminary assembly of forces.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2010, Wyden voted against the financial bailouts backed by the Bush administration. He did not vote on the automobile industry bailout, though {{he said he would}} have voted for cloture if he had been present. Wyden added, [...] "While I continue to have concerns about ensuring that taxpayers are protected if this loan is to occur, I believe that if the President can unwisely provide $750 billion of taxpayer money for the investment banks who took horribly unacceptable risks and helped trigger an economic collapse, we <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> duty to attempt to preserve a cornerstone domestic industry and the jobs {{of hundreds of thousands of}} working people whose personal actions are in no way responsible for the current economic crisis." ...|$|E
2500|$|The musical {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} but was praised {{for being a}} fun and upbeat production. Ben Brantley, reviewing the musical in The New York Times, wrote that the show was a [...] "high-energy, empty-calories, and expensive-looking hymn to the glories of girlishness"; he praised Laura Bell Bundy saying, [...] "she sings and dances flawlessly, and she delivers silly lines as if she meant them." [...] Clive Barnes, in his New York Post review, wrote that he loved the [...] "effervescent and radiant Bundy" [...] {{as well as others}} in the cast, and that the [...] "dances <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> slick snap, crackle, and pop". Elysa Gardner in the USA Today wrote that the musical was an [...] "ingratiating trifle", and the [...] "game cast ensure that the proceedings, however patronizing, aren't irritating." [...] Jeremy McCarter in New York Magazine lamented that the musical [...] "doesnâ€™t summon memories of Tracy Flick, the steely student-council campaigner that Reese Witherspoon played in Election before starring in Legally Blonde", writing that the [...] "Flickish manic drive" [...] in Witherspoon's Legally Blonde performance had been his favorite part of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "while failing to {{transform}} the classic film into an engrossing interactive experience, the game does shine when it doesn't {{have to rely on}} the film license to pull it along." [...] GameSpy's William Abner scored the PC version 3 out of 5, and was critical of the use of the license; [...] "where the original movie was full of political intrigue, wicked subplots and occasional gratuitous violence, the game is all about the violence." [...] He wrote [...] "Being a Godfather game, you'd expect things to be a bit less [...] "insane" [...] than your run-of-the-mill Grand Theft Auto clone. But there's more gunplay, more Blues Brothers-inspired car chases, and more thuggery in general, in 30 minutes of the game than in the entire movie trilogy." [...] He concluded [...] "if you can {{think of it as a}} generic gangland-themed game without constantly comparing it to the films it borrows its license from, you can <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good time. That said, it's hard to play The Godfather without thinking that this was a missed opportunity." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored the Xbox version 6 out of 10, calling it [...] "way too short, far too easy, too damned repetitive and far too in awe of Grand Theft Auto to be held up as anything other than a rather lightweight copycat offering." [...] Although he was critical of the length of the game's story in relation to the extortion gameplay, he felt the combat went some way to redeeming the game; [...] "the one main saving grace is that the combat is actually fun enough to nullify the overwhelming repetition." [...] He argued the game [...] "offers a decent amount of fun, with great combat, occasionally inspired set-pieces, but sub-par driving and a half-baked story mode with barely enough variety to fill a long evening." ...|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, Marilla {{lifted her}} candle and looked scrutinizingly at Anne's hair, flowing in heavy masses down her back. It <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very strange appearance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we are <b>certainly</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> {{night of}} it," [...] remarked Dave, after the fun had quieted {{down for a}} moment. He spoke to Roger.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{saw that}} His Majesty was right, and shall {{stay here for}} a short time longer. It would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bad effect, were we to seem to run away and hide {{ourselves}} in the provinces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is very restful," [...] he remarked. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{very busy}} day. The inside of electioneering may be disenchanting, but it's jolly hard work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> very mysterious power, that man. A {{great deal}} of his sermon was what I expected; but once I was strangely moved--I sobbed with the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd <b>certainly</b> <b>'ave</b> <b>a</b> {{run over}} to Boulogne," [...] said Pierce, [...] "and look about a bit. I'm {{going to do that}} next Easter myself, anyhow--see if I don't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lovely day {{for your}} wedding, Anne," [...] said Diana, as she slipped a voluminous apron over her silken array. [...] "You couldn't {{have had a}} finer one if you'd ordered it from Eaton's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{right to}} be sore," [...] the judge admitted. [...] "But it ain't no boy's job, {{cleaning}} up our little burg. It's going to be good, stiff work. I don't know who to put into it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, he {{has such}} a spirit," [...] she said, [...] "and I've no doubt he's {{suffering}} now more from Mr. Kenby's kindness than from his own sickness he had one of these giddy turns in Carlsbad, though, and I shall <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> doctor to see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I've not yet {{smoked a}} pipe with Hawkeye, neither have I seen Muskrat, but I <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pretty long chat with one o' my old friends," [...] {{answered}} Jasper, while a quiet smile played on his face.|$|R
2500|$|So Spinoza <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> use for {{the word}} 'freedom', but he equates [...] "Freedom of Mind" [...] with [...] "blessedness", a notion which is not {{traditionally}} associated with freedom of the will at all.|$|R
