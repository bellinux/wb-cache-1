5|$|It {{was over}} {{a year before the}} 2nd Division came {{together}} as a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> and, during the interim period between formation and arrival in the United Kingdom, many changes to its organization were made. The first brigade concentrations took place in May and June 1940, until which time all units had trained in their own garrisons. The 4th Brigade assembled at Camp Borden in Ontario, the 5th at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and the 6th at Camp Shilo in Manitoba. The divisional artillery was concentrated at artillery training centres at Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and at Shilo.|$|E
5|$|The {{reformed}} band {{worked at}} a prolific pace, rehearsing, and touring France before recording three new albums in just 12 months, beginning with Godbluff (October 1975). Unlike the earlier work with John Anthony at Trident, the sessions were produced by the band themselves, and both the Melody Maker and Sounds thought they were a tighter and more <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> than previously. The album in particular saw Hammill making significant use of the Hohner clavinet keyboard. Still Life followed on 15 April 1976. Banton considers this album one of his favourites by the group.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} {{under the weight of}} imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. And finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A more {{complete}} definition describes them as “Areas of relatively homogeneous species composition, clearly distinct from adjacent systems” dominated by “a {{small number of}} ecosystems and/or a distinct suite of oceanographic or topographic features”.

50|$|A {{memorial}} {{statue of}} Sir Thomas Blamey {{stands on the}} corner of Government House Drive and Birdwood Avenue. It was sculptured from granite and bronze by Raymond B. Ewers and presented to the city in February 1960. It recognises Australia’s first Field Marshal and his insistence to the British command that Australian forces remain as <b>cohesive</b> <b>units</b> under Australian command.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, the Soviet army {{began to}} rely on smaller and more <b>cohesive</b> <b>units,</b> a {{response}} to mirror mujahideen tactics. A decrease in unit size, while solving organizational issues, promoted field leaders to head more violent and aggressive missions, promoting Soviet desertion. Often, small forces would engage in rapes, looting, and general violence beyond what higher ranks ordered, increasing negative sanctions in undesirable locations.|$|R
5|$|Caesar then {{increased}} the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters. Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to more tightly link the other provinces of the empire into a single, <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit.</b> This process, of ossifying the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus. When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, he raised the senate's membership to 900. While the Roman assemblies continued to meet, Caesar submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment, which caused the assemblies to become powerless and unable to oppose him. To minimize the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him, Caesar passed a law which subjected governors to term limits. Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own Consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all Consuls and Tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the Dictator, and robbed the popular assemblies of much of their remaining influence.|$|E
25|$|Soldering is the {{preferred}} joining method where strong, watertight joints are required, such as for internal gutters, roofing, and flashing applications. A soldered seam joins two pieces of copper into a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> that expands and contracts as one piece. Well-soldered seams are often stronger than the original base material and provide many years of service.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the band began having {{increasing}} trouble working {{together as a}} <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit.</b> According to Gene Simmons' book Kiss and Make-Up, Van Halen approached Simmons in 1982 about possibly joining Kiss to replace Ace Frehley, chiefly because of his personality conflicts with Roth. Simmons and Alex persuaded Eddie to remain in Van Halen, while Kiss replaced Frehley with Vinnie Vincent.|$|E
50|$|The plan aims {{to bring}} 250,000 new {{residents}} to the Negev over ten years. Toward that goal, {{the project has}} sought to direct Anglo (English-speaking) immigration to the Negev and has compiled a database (currently containing some 10,000 names) of current Israeli citizens interested in relocating to the Negev. After the Disengagement together with the Or Negev settlement movement, the JNF was instrumental in helping Gaza evacuees find new homes in the Negev as <b>cohesive</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|Re-formed on 1 April 2006 as an EAW, the Wing {{is led by}} the Station Commander of RAF Marham, {{supported}} by his Station management team. The deployable elements of the RAF Marham form the core of the EAW, reinforced by assigned Capability-based Module Readiness System (CMRS) personnel and elements of the Air Combat Support Units (ACSUs). EAWs enable the RAF to train as <b>cohesive</b> <b>units</b> of Air Power which are prepared and capable of transitioning quickly from peacetime structures and deploying swiftly on operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{demands of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom {{required}} an accelerated training schedule which crammed as many warfighting skills as possible into a forty-one-day period. This was the 98th's first substantial {{exposure to the}} asymmetric battlefield, requiring training in counterinsurgency techniques and preparing to face an opponent who did not fight along traditional fronts. The 98th made full use of the 33,000 acres at Camp Atterbury and marched everywhere. It was at Camp Atterbury that the advisory support teams (later renamed military training teams), {{the heart of the}} FA-TRAC mission, transformed to <b>cohesive</b> <b>units</b> in long days.|$|R
25|$|While many of {{the unique}} Art Deco buildings, such as the New Yorker Hotel, were lost to {{developers}} {{in the years before}} 1980, the area was saved as a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> by Barbara Capitman and a group of activists who spearheaded the movement to place almost one square mile of South Beach on the National Register of Historic Places. The Miami Beach Architectural District was designated in 1979.|$|E

40|$|A {{far-reaching}} {{and influential}} view in evolutionary biology claims that species are <b>cohesive</b> <b>units</b> {{held together by}} gene flow. Biologists have recognized empirical problems facing this view; after sharpening {{the expression of the}} view, we present novel conceptual problems for it. At the heart of these problems is a distinction between two importantly different concepts of cohesion, what we call integrative and response cohesion. Acknowledging the distinction problematizes both the explanandum of species cohesion and the explanans of gene flow that are central to the view we discuss. We conclude by tracing four broader implications for the study and conceptualization of species...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a robust {{statistical}} semantic tagging model trained on completely unannotated data. The approach relies mainly on prior domain knowledge to counterbalance {{the lack of}} semantically annotated treebank data. The proposed method encodes longer contextual information by grouping strongly related semantic concepts together into <b>cohesive</b> <b>units.</b> The method is based on hidden Markov model (HMM) and offers high ambiguity resolution power, outputs semantically rich information, and requires relatively low human effort. The approach yields high-performance models that are evaluated on two different corpora in two application domains in English and German. 1...|$|R
25|$|With the Zulus nearly at the station, the {{garrison}} now numbered between 154 and 156 men. Of these, only Bromhead's company {{could be considered}} a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit.</b> Additionally, up to 39 of his company were at the station as hospital patients, although only a handful of these were unable to take up arms. With fewer men, Chard realised the need to modify the defences, and gave orders that biscuit boxes be used to construct a wall through the middle of the post in order to make possible the abandonment of the hospital side of the station if the need arose.|$|E
25|$|Mourinho {{is highly}} renowned for his {{tactical}} prowess, game management and adaptability to different situations. A usual feature of his teams {{is playing with}} three or more central midfielders, as Mourinho has stressed midfield superiority as crucial in winning games. As a Porto manager, Mourinho employed a diamond 4–4–2 formation, with his midfield – consisting of Costinha or Pedro Mendes as defensive midfielder; Maniche and Dmitri Alenichev as wide central midfielders; and Deco on the tip – acting as a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> rather than a collection of individuals, providing Porto with midfield superiority while allowing the full-backs to move forward.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} modern {{building was}} created in 1973 {{by a team of}} architects in Lincolnshire Council's building department. It would have been a flat-roofed building. Since then, there has been a series of extensions which are now fused to form a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit.</b> The most recent two projects on the site were designed by Wilson and Heath of Stamford, who built a covered courtyard and library at the school. This architectural firm has worked on Fishmongers' Hall in London and the University of Exeter, and has won a civic award in Stamford. Two more classrooms and a covered way are now being planned by the school, which is again using the same architects.|$|E
40|$|We {{argue for}} a new conventionalism about many kinds of {{evolutionary}} groups, including clades, <b>cohesive</b> <b>units,</b> and populations. This rejects a consensus, which says that given {{any one of the}} many legitimate grouping concepts, only objective biological facts determine whether a collection is such a group. Surprisingly, being any one kind of evolutionary group typically depends on which of many incompatible values are taken by suppressed variables. This is a novel pluralism underlying most any one group concept, rather than a familiar pluralism claiming many concepts are legitimate. Consequently, we must help biological facts determine grouphood, even when given a single grouping concept...|$|R
40|$|Spatially or {{chemically}} isolated functional modules {{composed of}} several cellular components and carrying discrete functions are considered fundamental {{building blocks of}} cellular organization, but their presence in highly integrated biochemical networks lacks quantitative support.

Within Escherichia coli the uncovered hierarchical modularity closely overlaps with known metabolic functions.

25|$|The {{buildings}} in the Tampico Historic District all have a uniform setback, save the neo-Colonial, 1970s era bank building. All {{but one of the}} district's buildings stand two stories, contributing to a uniform architectural rhythm and harmony. Most of the district's buildings have matching cornice lines and the two frame {{buildings in}} the historic district predate the incorporation of Tampico as a village. Land use within the district boundaries is strictly commercial and the architecture of the buildings reflect that use. The most architecturally significant structures in the district are part of an integrated, <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit.</b> Their significance is dependent upon each other, thus, the removal of any one of the buildings would reduce the integrity of the other buildings.|$|E
25|$|Gran Fury {{functioned as}} the {{anonymous}} art collective that produced {{all of the}} artistic media for ACT UP. The group remained anonymous because it allowed the collective {{to function as a}} <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> without any one voice being singled out. The mission of the group was {{to bring an end to}} the AIDS Crisis by making reference to the issues plaguing society at large, especially homophobia and the lack of public investment in the AIDS epidemic, through bringing art works into the public sphere in order to reach the maximum audience. The group often faced censorship in their proceedings, including being rejected for public billboard space and being threatened with censorship in art exhibitions. When faced with this censorship, Gran Fury often posted their work illegally on the walls of the streets.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Frusciante began {{recording}} {{his fourth}} album with Red Hot Chili Peppers, By the Way (2002); {{he considered the}} time to be among the happiest in his life. He relished the chance the album gave him to [...] "keep writing better songs". While working on By the Way, he also composed most of what would become Shadows Collide with People, as well as the songs created for the movie The Brown Bunny. His goal to improve his guitar playing on the album was largely driven by a desire to emulate guitar players such as Andy Partridge, Johnny Marr and John McGeoch; or as he put it, [...] "people who used good chords". The album marked Frusciante's shift to a more group-minded mentality within the Chili Peppers, viewing the band as a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> rather than as four separate entities.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like <b>cohesive</b> <b>units</b> and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|R
40|$|Built on {{the ruins}} of earlier cities, the Mughal Emperor Shahjahan founded Shahjahanabad in 1639. Cradling a fort, the city {{expended}} itself down the social/housing strata to a wall. This wall not only brought coherence to any one group but provided an interaction amongst them. These <b>cohesive</b> <b>units</b> formed neighborhoods called mohallahs, marked by religious, economic and social liaisons, their identity legitimizing the power of certain individuals and institutions.

500|$|The stage {{began with}} the largest {{successful}} breakaway of the Giro, 25 riders representing 18 teams. The only teams that missed the break were Milram, Ag2r, , and the team of the race leader, Rabobank. They worked together as a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> {{for much of the}} stage, gaining a maximum six-minute advantage over the peloton. Seven of the 25 broke free with [...] left to race, and they contested a final sprint for the stage win. The first rider to try to take the win was Dries Devenyns, but he was quickly overtaken by Félix Cárdenas, who was in turn passed by Danny Pate. Pate, however, had the breakaway's most experienced rider, Michele Scarponi, in his slipstream, and it was Scarponi who timed his sprint just right to take the stage win. The high-placed riders in the general classification all finished with the peloton, 3' 57" [...] behind the stage winner, so there was no change to the top ten overall.|$|E
500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And {{it has nothing to do}} with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit</b> rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
500|$|Ronnie Vannucci Jr. joined The Killers {{shortly before}} Neal's departure. Vannucci was {{well-known}} on the Las Vegas music scene, having played in numerous bands since a young age.

Ronnie's first show with the band was on August 30, 2002, at a club called The Junkyard. Playing bass for The Killers that night was Mark Stoermer, who {{was at this point}} the lead guitarist for local progressive rock band The Negative Ponies. The band were keen on Stoermer joining them on a permanent basis, but he was initially reluctant to commit. They had first approached him to be the second guitarist when they were considering turning the band into a five-piece, [...] "possibly more like the Strokes, with a keyboard". Stoermer mentioned later on that he could also play bass. The band had continued as a three-piece trying out other bassists until November 2002, when Stoermer eventually accepted the invitation to join. According to Ryan Pardey who booked many of the band's early shows [...] "They (The Killers) became a great band when Ronnie and Mark joined. That’s when they finally became a <b>cohesive</b> <b>unit.</b> What Ronnie did — he was the discipline — and Mark was just a solid musician".|$|E

50|$|The {{content of}} Questions and Replies differs {{strongly}} {{from the other}} six Military Classics. The armies that existed {{by the time of}} the Tang dynasty consisted of infantry, crossbowmen, and cavalry. The use of the chariot had long since ceased to have any military application, and weapons were exclusively made from iron and steel. Large number of local, <b>cohesive</b> <b>units</b> provided a great degree of flexibility to large-scale deployments. Professional units were supplemented by disciplined and well-armed conscript forces. Weapons and unit sub-types were highly specialized. The recognition of the military value of speed and mobility was widespread, with flanking and other indirect maneuvers preferred over direct, frontal engagements.|$|R
50|$|Marine {{ecoregions}} are: “Areas {{of relatively}} homogeneous species composition, clearly distinct from adjacent systems….In ecological terms, these are strongly <b>cohesive</b> <b>units,</b> sufficiently large to encompass ecological or life history processes for most sedentary species.” They have been defined by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) {{to aid in}} conservation activities for marine ecosystems. Forty-three priority marine ecoregions were delineated as part of WWF’s Global 200 efforts. The scheme used to designate and classify marine ecoregions is analogous to that used for terrestrial ecoregions. Major habitat types are identified: polar, temperate shelves and seas, temperate upwelling, tropical upwelling, tropical coral, pelagic (trades and westerlies), abyssal, and hadal (ocean trench). These correspond to the terrestrial biomes.|$|R
