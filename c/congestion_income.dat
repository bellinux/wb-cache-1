40|$|Unit Day Values (UDV) {{have been}} widely used in North America to {{estimate}} the recreational and related benefits from parks and similar non-market resources. In essence they rely upon expert assessments based on previous non-market valuations studies, with adjustments made to account for variations in park quality, location, <b>congestion,</b> <b>income,</b> or activities undertaken. The UDV approach can not replace non-market valuation tools in generating information on Willingness To Pay, but they do provide decision makers with an alternative method of gauging benefits from parks and similar resources when Contingent Valuation, Travel Cost, or Hedonic Price techniques are prohibitively costly. This paper discusses the use of UDV's, and demonstrates their use through an application to Auckland Regional Parks...|$|E

40|$|It is {{unlikely}} that roadway construction or vehicle automation {{will be able to}} alleviate most major urban congestion in the near future (5 - 15 years). What else can be done to reasonably reduce congestion? Several approaches to reducing congestion by capacity allocation are reviewed: laissez-faire allocation, allocation by passenger load, ramp metering, road and parking pricing, allocation by trip purpose, rationing, and mixed strategies. These approaches are qualitatively compared against four criteria: effectiveness at reducing <b>congestion,</b> economic efficiency, <b>income</b> distribution effects, and flexibility of access for urgent trips. Recommendations are made regarding capacity-allocation measures with potential to reduce congestion and to increase economic efficiency. The equity impacts of these measures are identified and methods for mitigating these effects are proposed. Congestion pricing, together with free but metered on-ramps at freeways for nonpayers or with subsidies for lower-income households at 1 are found to deserve further study and an incremental method of adoption is outlined...|$|R
40|$|In {{common with}} other {{developing}} regions, the current wave of globalization in East Asia {{has been associated}} with a concentration of economic activities in megalopolises. The price paid {{for the benefit of the}} agglomeration economies resulting from this urban concentration has been formidable <b>congestion</b> and pollution. <b>Income</b> inequality has also increased. Migrants, who typically find initial employment in the urban informal sector, generally receive wages that are much lower than those of workers employed in the formal sector, where labor is protected by labor codes and unions. The widening income disparities have been a major source of social and political instability, as epitomized by higher crime rates and the greater frequency of riots. A popular perception prevails that identifies these trends as an inevitable consequence of the integration of developing economies with the world economy as globalization progresses. However, globalization, which is characterized by the freer movement of goods and services across national borders, does not necessarily cause urban concentration and rural marginalization. Many industrial activities, especially labor-intensive manufactures such as cloth, garments, and standard electronic parts, which are characterized by weak economies of scale and modest transportation costs, need not be located in megalopolises...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the impact of}} daily travel on personal and societal well-being, measurement techniques that go beyond satisfaction-based measures of travel are used. Such metrics are increasingly important for evaluating transportation and land-use policies. This study examines commute well-being, a multi-item measure of how one feels about the commute to work, and its influences using data from a web-based survey that was distributed to Portland, Oregon, U. S. A. workers. Valid surveys (n= 828) were compiled from three roughly equally sized groups based on mode: bike, transit and car users. Average distances between work and home varied significantly among the three groups. Descriptive results show that commute well-being varies widely across the sample. Those who bike to work have significantly higher commute well-being than transit and car commuters. A multiple linear regression model shows that along with travel mode, traffic <b>congestion,</b> travel time, <b>income,</b> health, job satisfaction and residential satisfaction also play important individual roles in shaping commute well-being. While more analysis is needed, these results support findings in previous research that commuting by bike enhances well-being while congestion detracts from well-being. Implications for future research and sustainable transportation policy efforts are discussed...|$|R

Cost savings in terms of improved health, however, are often not cited yet represent another dimension of savings {{associated with}} reduced urban sprawl and gas prices. Cycling is a form of exercise that can also be used as a mode of transportation if the surrounding environment facilitates such use. According to the United States Department of Transportation, 73 percent of adults want new bicycle facilities such as bike lanes, trails, and traffic signals. Using data from the 1990, 1995, and 2001 waves of the Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey, in addition to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (1996 - 2000), I propose to analyze the effects of variations in the built environment in the form of urban sprawl and in real gasoline prices on cycling as a form of physical activity. Using bivariate probit and propensity score methods, I show how cycling can lead to improved physical health outcomes.

Metrics related Subjective Well-Being (SWB), defined as an evaluation of one 2 ̆ 7 s happiness or life satisfaction, are increasingly important for evaluating transportation and land-use policies. This dissertation examines commute well-being, a multi-item measure of how one feels about the commute to work, {{and how it is}} shaped. Data are from a web-based survey of workers (n= 828) in Portland, Oregon, U. S. A., with three roughly equally sized groups based on mode: bike, transit and car users. Descriptive analysis shows that commute well-being varies widely across the sample. Those who bike and walk to work have significantly higher commute well-being than transit and car commuters. A multiple linear regression model shows that along with travel mode, traffic <b>congestion,</b> travel time, <b>income,</b> health, attitudes about travel, job satisfaction and residential satisfaction also play important individual roles in shaping commute well-being. A structural equation model reveals a significant correlation between commute well-being and overall happiness, controlling for other key happiness indicators. This research helps expand existing theory by demonstrating (1) how commute well-being can be measured and modeled; (2) how accessibility, distance and travel time impact commute well-being; (3) how individual mode choices interact with attitudes to impact commute satisfaction and (4) commuting 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to overall well being...|$|R
40|$|These essays {{contribute}} towards {{our understanding}} of the economics of space. This dissertation is composed of three chapters. Chapter one—Is the rent too high? Aggregate implications of local land- use regulation: Highly productive U. S. cities are characterized by high housing prices, low housing stock growth, and restrictive land-use regulations (e. g., San Francisco). While new residents would benefit from housing stock growth due to higher incomes or shorter commutes, existing residents justify strict local land-use regulations on the grounds of congestion and other costs of further development. This paper assesses the welfare implications of these local regulations for <b>income,</b> <b>congestion,</b> and urban sprawl within a general equilibrium model with endogenous regulation. In the model, households choose from locations that vary exogenously by productivity and endogenously according to local externalities of congestion and sharing. Existing residents address these externalities by voting for regulations that limit local housing density. In equilibrium, these regulations bind and house prices compensate for differences across locations. Relative to the planner's optimum, the decentralized model generates spatial misallocation whereby high-productivity locations are settled at too-low densities. The model admits a straightforward calibration based on observed population density, expenditure shares on consumption and local services, and local incomes. Welfare and GDP would be 1. 4 % and 2. 1 % higher, respectively, under the planner??Ễs allocation. Abolishing zoning regulations entirely would increase GDP by 6 %, but lower welfare by 5. 9 % due to greater congestion. Chapter two—The impact of emerging climate risks on urban real estate price dynamics: In the typical asset market, an asset featuring uninsurable idiosyn- cratic risk must offer a higher rate of return to compensate risk-averse investors. A home offers a standard asset’s risk and return opportunities, but it also bundles access to its city’s amenities??Ẻand to its climate risks. As climate change research reveals the true nature of these risks, how does the equilibrium real estate pricing gradient change when households can sort into different cities? When the population is homogeneous, the real estate pricing gradient instantly reflects the “new news”. With population heterogene- ity, an event study research design will underestimate the valuation of climate risk for households in low-risk cities while overestimating the valuation of households in high-risk areas. Chapter three—Entrepreneurship, Information, and Growth: We examine the contribution to economic growth of entrepreneurial marketplace information within a regional endogenous growth framework. Entrepreneurs are posited to provide an input to economic growth through the information revealed by their successes and failures. We empirically identify this information source with the regional variation in establishment births and deaths. To account for the potential endogeneity caused by forward-looking entrepreneurs, we utilize instruments based on historic mining activity. We find that the information spillover component of local establishment birth and death rates have significant positive effects on subsequent entrepreneurship and employment growth for U. S. counties and metropolitan areas. A version of this article was previously published in the Journal of Regional Science as Bunten et al. (2015) ...|$|R
