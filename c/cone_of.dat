5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of the stomach and {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a bobbin, winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E

The aircraft, an Airbus A319-115, operated {{on a flight}} from Paro to Bangkok via Guwahati. While descending to Guwahati over the Garo Hills, hail stones damaged and punctured the nose <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft. A safe landing was made at Guwahati. No Fatalities were reported.|$|E

The elongated <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> P. banksiana have an asymmetrically reflexed cone base, while P. matthewsii are symmetrical and oval. <b>Cones</b> <b>of</b> P. matthewsii and P. contorta are also similar in structuring, however the combination of characters that are present in P. matthewsii are not found {{in any one of}} the subspecies of P. contorta.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} tangent <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> subsets of cartesian {{powers of}} a real closed field, generalising {{the notion of the}} classical tangent <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> subsets of Euclidean space. We then study the impact of non-archimedean stratifications (t-stratifications) on these tangent cones. Our main result is that a t-stratification induces stratifications of the same nature on the tangent <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> a definable set. As a consequence, we show that the archimedean counterpart of a t-stratification induces Whitney stratifications on the tangent <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> a semi-algebraic set. The latter statement is achieved by working with the natural valuative structure of non-standard models of the real field. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
5|$|Since {{the major}} {{eruption}} ~70,000 years ago, eruptions of smaller magnitude have also occurred at Toba. The small <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> Pusukbukit formed on the southwestern {{margin of the}} caldera and lava domes. The most recent eruption may have been at Tandukbenua on the northwestern caldera edge, suggested {{by a lack of}} vegetation that could be due to an eruption within the last few hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} considered other methods of recovering active {{material in the}} event of a dud explosion. One idea was to cover it with a <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> sand. Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment either. The CM-10 (Chemistry and Metallurgy) group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> weaker reflectivities.|$|E
50|$|Water levels or {{pressures}} can be contoured {{similar to}} elevation on topographic maps. Contour maps often show “bulls-eyes” around pumped wells {{that represent the}} <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> depression. In huge municipal wells, these <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> depression often can extend many miles from the pumped well. For many domestic wells, the <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> depression often {{are too small to}} even show up on such maps. Again, this really depends on the rate of pumping and the aquifer material.|$|R

5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSay that a cone is a {{commutative}} monoid {{in which}} x+y= 0 implies that x=y= 0. We show that cones (resp. simple <b>cones)</b> <b>of</b> many kinds order-embed or even embed unitarily into refinement cones (resp. simple refinement <b>cones)</b> <b>of</b> the same kind, satisfying in addition various divisibility conditions. We {{do this in}} particular for all cones, or for all separative cones, or for all cancellative <b>cones</b> (positive <b>cones</b> <b>of</b> partially ordered abelian groups). We also settle both the torsion-free case and the unperforated case. Most of our results extend to arbitrary commutative monoids...|$|R

5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eruptions of silica-rich {{rhyolite}} from 40,000 to 600 {{years ago}} built the Mono Craters. Black Point, {{today on the}} north shore of Mono Lake, is a flattened volcanic <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> basaltic debris that formed under the surface of a much deeper Mono Lake about 13,300 years ago, during the most-recent glacial period. Several eruptive episodes from 1,600 to 270 years before present in Mono Lake formed Negit Island. The magma reservoir feeding the Mono Lake Volcanic Field is unrelated to the Mono Craters magma reservoir.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 44hours before Hurricane Isabel made {{landfall}} on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm watch for the entire coastline of Delaware. The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane watch for the coastline. On September 17, 26hours before Isabel made landfall, the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings. While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a Category 5 hurricane, forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 155miles (250km) south-southeast of Lewes as a 115mph (185km/h) major hurricane. Though located within the <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty, all subsequent forecasts predicted a landfall on North Carolina with the hurricane passing {{to the west of}} the state.|$|E

5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E
5|$|Tehama started life some 600,000 years ago. At {{its peak}} activity, it reached {{approximately}} 3,350meters (11,000ft) high, with a basal diameter of approximately 12kilometers. Volcanic activity then declined 400,000 years ago, with other volcanic lava domes forming {{at the edges}} of Mount Tehama later on, the largest and best known of which is Lassen Peak. A combination of continued hydrothermal activity and erosion, particularly by glaciers during ice ages, removed the central <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> the volcano, leaving a large caldera, the northern edge of which can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|The present-day <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> Mount Baker is {{relatively}} young; {{it is perhaps}} less than 100,000years old. The volcano sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called Black Buttes, which was active between 500,000 and 300,000years ago. Much of Mount Baker's earlier geological record eroded away during {{the last ice age}} (which culminated 15,000–20,000years ago), by thick ice sheets that filled the valleys and surrounded the volcano. In the last 14,000years, the area around the mountain has been largely ice-free, but the mountain itself remains heavily covered with snow and ice.|$|E

5|$|At 13:10, the RAF {{formation}} {{flew over}} the mud flats {{to the west of}} Cuxhaven and Wesermünde and came under heavy ground fire from the German flak positions, 214, 244 and 264. As Kellett turned west towards the Jade Estuary and over Wilhelmshaven anti-aircraft units 212, 222, 252, 262 and 272 opened fire. Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and all the other naval ships in the dock opened fire in support. In the distance, at Schillig Point, the bombers could see German fighters taking off from a camouflaged airstrip. In a quick briefing, JG 1's commander had told his pilots to make a beam attack as it was a blind spot for the Wellington. A stern attack was dangerous, as the gunners could then target an attacking fighter with a coordinated and concentrated <b>cone</b> <b>of</b> fire. One weakness also noted was that early types of Wellingtons lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. This meant if the German fighters hit the wings, the bomber was liable to burn.|$|E
