50|$|After a {{suspected}} positive sample is detected during screening, {{the sample is}} tested using a <b>confirmation</b> <b>test.</b> Samples that are negative on the screening test are discarded and reported as negative. The <b>confirmation</b> <b>test</b> in most laboratories (and all SAMHSA certified labs) is performed using mass spectrometry, and is precise but expensive. False positive samples from the screening test will almost always be negative on the <b>confirmation</b> <b>test.</b> Samples testing positive during both screening and confirmation tests are reported as positive to the entity that ordered the test. Most laboratories save positive samples for some period of months or years {{in the event of}} a disputed result or lawsuit. For workplace drug testing, a positive result is generally not confirmed without a review by a Medical Review Officer who will normally interview the subject of the drug test.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Screening and <b>confirmation</b> <b>testing</b> {{for drugs}} of abuse in urine (DAU) {{represent}} areas for potential reduction of laboratory workload and attendant cost savings. Following a careful {{review of the}} clinical needs of the underlying veteran patient population served by 7 medical facilities in the Boston area, DAU test ordering frequencies, positive rates for several screening panels and the associated <b>confirmation</b> <b>tests,</b> DAU panel standardization, and <b>confirmation</b> <b>testing</b> only by request were introduced. These changes were all reviewed {{and approved by the}} clinician users of DAU testing at each institution before the changes were implemented. Before standardization of DAU screening panels, 59, 835 DAU screening requests were done at a cost of $ 216, 005; following standardization, there was 47 % decrease in DAU screening utilization (27, 876) and costs ($ 100, 633).

It evaluates the DSS for its completeness and accuracy. Set of <b>confirmation</b> <b>tests</b> such as interface integrity test, information content test and performance test were employed to determine the integrity of the individual sub system functions of a DSS (Turban et al., 2004). Interface integrity test first ensured the internal and external interfaces and then the integration of each module was incorporated into the DSS structure. Information content test was designed to reveal the errors associated with data base. The performance test was carried out to verify performance limits for the number of suppliers and number of criteria which were established during DSS design.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the blood}} samples are obtained, they are placed into tubes {{containing}} anticoagulants {{in order to}} stop the blood from clotting. If the blood sample was obtained at the site close to the placenta, a fetal blood <b>confirmation</b> <b>test</b> should be done to ensure no mixing of fetal and maternal blood occurred before the diagnostic tests are done on the blood. Fetal red blood cells (RBC) are usually bigger than maternal RBCs, and the average volume of RBCs, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), is one of the methods used {{to determine whether or not}} the fetal blood has been contaminated. Another method, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) determination, can detect maternal blood because maternal blood has high levels of hCG. [...] The hemoglobin alkaline denaturation test (Apt test) can detect the presence of maternal blood, which is indicated by a color change from red to brown when the sample is added to alkali reagent. [...] Blood typing would also detect maternal blood, as the I antigen only occurs in adults. [...] The Kleihauer-Betke test can detect very small amounts of maternal blood before the third trimester of pregnancy by monitoring hemoglobin elution in acid because adult and fetal hemoglobin elute differently in acid. [...] Finally, a white blood cell count can detect maternal blood in the sample, as fetal white blood cells are primarily leukocytes, while maternal white blood cells are mostly neutrophils. If amniotic fluid infiltrated the sample, then there would be a reduction in the volume of RBCs, white blood cells, and platelets in the sample.

The Full Factorial Design of Experiment (DOE) method with two-level was used to formulate the experimental layout, to analyze the effect of each parameter on the machining characteristics and to predict the optimal setting for each WEDM parameters such as pulse on (ON), pulse off (OFF), peak current (IP) and servo voltage (SV). <b>Confirmation</b> <b>tests</b> were also conducted for the optimum conditions for each machining characteristics, in order to verify and compared the results from the theoretical prediction (Design Expert) and experimental <b>confirmation</b> <b>tests.</b> In this investigation, the machining operation for tungsten carbide is performed using Sodick linear motor WEDM series AQ 537 L.

40|$|Adequate {{detection}} of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae {{is crucial for}} infection control measures and appropriate choice of antimicrobial therapy. This guideline aims to improve the {{detection of}} carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the routine setting of clinical microbiology laboratories. Detection of carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae includes a screening step followed by a genotypic and optional phenotypic confirmatory step. For all Enterobacteriaceae, the meropenem screening breakpoint to detect carbapenemases is set at >or= 0. 5 mg/L or a zone diameter of or= 2 mg/L or a zone diameter <or= 21 mm. Ertapenem is not advised as an indicator carbapenem as it has a lower specificity compared with imipenem and meropenem. On the first isolate from a patient with a positive carbapenemase screen test, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based test should be performed to detect carbapenemase genes. However, if genotypic confirmation is not immediately available, phenotypic <b>confirmation</b> <b>tests</b> should be performed to avoid delayed reporting of carbapenemase-producers to the clinic. Recommended phenotypic <b>confirmation</b> <b>tests</b> are the modified Hodge test as well as carbapenemase inhibition tests with boronic acid for Ambler class A carbapenemases and with ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) or dipicolinic acid for metallo-carbapenemases...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundIn Ethiopia a tiebreaker {{algorithm}} using 3 rapid {{diagnostic tests}} (RDTs) in series {{is used to}} diagnose HIV. Discordant results between the first 2 RDTs are resolved by a third `tiebreaker¿ RDT. Médecins Sans Frontières uses an alternate serial algorithm of 2 RDTs followed by a <b>confirmation</b> <b>test</b> for all double positive RDT results. The primary objective was to compare {{the performance of the}} tiebreaker algorithm with a serial algorithm, and to evaluate the addition of a <b>confirmation</b> <b>test</b> to both algorithms. A secondary objective looked at the positive predictive value (PPV) of weakly reactive test lines. MethodsThe study was conducted in two HIV testing sites in Ethiopia. Study participants were recruited sequentially until 200 positive samples were reached. Each sample was re-tested in the laboratory on the 3 RDTs and on a simple to use <b>confirmation</b> <b>test,</b> the Orgenics Immunocomb Combfirm® (OIC). The gold standard test was the Western Blot, with indeterminate results resolved by PCR testing. Results 2620 subjects were included with a HIV prevalence of 7. 7 %. Each of the 3 RDTs had an individual specificity of at least 99 %. The serial algorithm with 2 RDTs had a single false positive result (1 out of 204) to give a PPV of 99. 5 % (95 % CI 97. 3 %- 100 %). The tiebreaker algorithm resulted in 16 false positive results (PPV 92. 7 %, 95 % CI: 88. 4 %- 95. 8 %). Adding the OIC <b>confirmation</b> <b>test</b> to either algorithm eliminated the false positives. All the false positives had at least one weakly reactive test line in the algorithm. The PPV of weakly reacting RDTs was significantly lower than those with strongly positive test lines. ConclusionThe risk of false positive HIV diagnosis in a tiebreaker algorithm is significant. We recommend abandoning the tie-breaker algorithm in favour of WHO recommended serial or parallel algorithms, interpreting weakly reactive test lines as indeterminate results requiring further testing except in the setting of blood transfusion, and most importantly, adding a <b>confirmation</b> <b>test</b> to the RDT algorithm.
