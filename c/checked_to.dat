5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are <b>checked</b> <b>to</b> identify the thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged {{and free of}} cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be <b>checked</b> <b>to</b> ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives. When all obvious false positives were cleared, the science team used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to gather radial velocity measurements on the star. Collected data was then <b>checked</b> <b>to</b> see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star or that of a planet; it was found to be that of a planet, leading to the confirmation of Kepler-40b.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen <b>checked</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E

5|$|Shinanos launch on 8 October 1944, with Captain Toshio Abe in command, was {{marred by}} what some {{considered}} an ill-omened accident. During the floating-out procedure, one of the caissons {{at the end of}} the dock unexpectedly lifted as the water rose to the level of the harbor (no one had <b>checked</b> <b>to</b> ensure that all the caissons were properly ballasted with seawater). The sudden inrush of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E
5|$|In response, a 5 September news {{briefing}} at the Pentagon by Press Secretary Geoff Morrell {{stated that}} {{at no time}} was the public in any danger and that military personnel had custody of the weapons at all times. The USAF announced that {{within days of the}} incident, the USAF relieved the Minot munitions squadron commander of duty and eventually disciplined 25 airmen. USAF Major General Doug Raaberg was assigned by General Keys to lead an investigation into the incident. The USAF inventory of nuclear warheads was <b>checked</b> <b>to</b> ensure that all warheads were accounted for. In addition, the DoD announced that a Pentagon-appointed scientific advisory panel, called the Defense Science Board, would study the mishap {{as part of a larger}} review of procedures for handling nuclear weapons. On 28 September, the USAF announced that General Keys was retiring and would be replaced as ACC commander by General John Corley, effective 2 October.|$|E
5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be <b>checked</b> <b>to</b> confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E
