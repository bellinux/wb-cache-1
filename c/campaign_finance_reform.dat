5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his term}} as governor, Jones retired to Airdrie Stud. He started Commonwealth Broadcasting and joined with {{partners}} to purchase several radio and television stations in Kentucky and Tennessee. He remained a public advocate of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> and health care reform and was a supporter of posting the Ten Commandments in public schools.|$|E
5|$|Tillman was {{the primary}} sponsor of the Tillman Act, the first federal <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> law, which was passed in 1907 and which banned {{corporate}} contributions in federal political campaigns. Justice Clarence Thomas has suggested that Tillman's motivation in introducing this legislation was to reduce the power of corporations which tended to favor Republicans and African Americans.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Jones was {{the front-runner}} for the {{governorship}} {{for the entire}} gubernatorial campaign. The rivalry between Jones and Wilkinson had become so strong that Wilkinson's wife Martha was among Jones' challengers in the Democratic primary; she ended her candidacy 18days before the primary. Advocating <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform,</b> Jones garnered 184,703 votes in the primary, enough to best a field including Scotty Baesler (149,352 votes), Dr. Floyd Poore (132,060 votes), and Gatewood Galbraith (25,834).|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2000, {{after failing}} to win any of the first 20 {{primaries}} and caucuses in the election process, Bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed Gore; he ruled out the idea of running as the vice-presidential candidate and did not answer questions about possible future runs for the presidency. He {{said that he would}} continue to speak out regarding his brand of politics, calling for <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform,</b> gun control, and increased health care insurance.|$|E
5|$|The scandal was {{followed}} by a number of attempts to adopt campaign finance reform—spearheaded by U.S. Sen. David Boren (D-OK)—but most attempts died in committee. A weakened reform was passed in 1993. Substantial <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> was not passed until the adoption of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. Bennett would later write that the Keating Five investigation did make a difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less likely to intercede with federal investigations on behalf of contributors.|$|E

50|$|Pine {{called for}} <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> {{including}} public <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> and for <b>campaign</b> donations under $1000 to be tax-deductible. His campaign was mostly self-financed. Pine criticized opponent Gina Papan for accepting a $365,000 campaign contribution {{from her father}} Lou Papan, which included $17,500 from tobacco companies, $1,500 from accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and $750 from former energy giant Enron.|$|R

5|$|While {{generally}} {{adhering to}} American conservatism, McCain established {{a reputation as}} a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues. In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam. His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, McCain won {{re-election}} {{to a third}} Senate term; he {{prevailed in}} a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office. In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction. Later in 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform,</b> although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.|$|E

40|$|Proposed <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> and {{critiques of}} current <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> {{jurisprudence}} are incomplete because <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reformers overlook social and historical realities related to race. This Article uses race as an analytical factor {{to develop a}} more comprehensive understanding of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance.</b> Past state-sanctioned discrimination has contributed to current racial disparities in property. Under the current <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> system, these disparities in property shape the racial distribution of political influence no less than poll taxes, literacy tests, or at-large electoral districts. Further, seemingly neutral <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> doctrine threatens to lead to future racial disparities in the political distribution of societal resources. The consideration of race also allows for an examination of other critical issues ignored by reformers, such as racially selective enforcement of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> regulations and the adverse impact of some reform provisions on minority political participation...|$|R
5000|$|Frieman's local {{activism}} {{has drawn}} {{the wrath of}} the local newspaper, the Marin Independent Journal, who in a 2012 editorial called him [...] "disrespectful" [...] for his act of political satire regarding a local politician. The newspaper has also reported on Frieman's efforts against political campaigns, including the failed campaigns of Joe Nation, former Marin Supervisor Cynthia Murray, and Bob Marcucci. [...] Frieman has also written op-ed pieces for the Marin Independent Journal, including a 2009 critique of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters who had proposed <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> <b>reform</b> that Frieman stated had [...] "big loopholes." ...|$|R
5|$|In late April, Brown {{still held}} a 20 {{percentage}} point lead {{in public opinion}} polling. However, as Beshear began to slip in the polls, Wilkinson moved up. By Memorial Day weekend, he was polling second among the candidates. Brown largely ignored Wilkinson until {{a week before the}} election, when he began running ads questioning the amount of money Wilkinson claimed would be generated by a state lottery. Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the primary campaign. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark opined that Wilkinson's lavish spending during the campaign prompted the legislature to adopt <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> measures.|$|E
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|During an {{unsuccessful}} senatorial bid in 1914, Stanley assumed an anti-prohibition stance. This issue would dominate {{his political career}} {{for more than a}} decade and put him at odds with J. C. W. Beckham, the leader of the pro-temperance faction of the state's Democratic Party. In 1915, Stanley ran for governor, defeating his close friend Edwin P. Morrow by just over 400 votes. It was the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history. Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's administration the apex of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. Among the reforms adopted during his tenure were a state antitrust law, a <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> law, and a workman's compensation law. In 1918, Stanley was chosen as the Democratic nominee to succeed the recently deceased senator Ollie M. James. Stanley was elected, but did not resign as governor to take the seat until May 1919 and accomplished little in his single term. He lost his re-election bid to Frederic M. Sackett in the 1924 Republican landslide and never again held elected office. He died in Washington, D.C. on August 12, 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Green Party Leader Elizabeth May spoke {{against the}} attempt to {{eliminate}} the per-vote subsidy, saying that doing so would once again concentrate influence {{in the hands of}} those with deeper pockets, instead of giving voters a voice, and she stated her belief that the 2004 <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> that introduced the per-vote subsidy are the [...] "one area we've gotten really right" [...] compared with the United States. Liberal deputy leader Ralph Goodale stated: [...] "Mr. Harper’s position is, essentially, let the big and the wealthy and the most privileged run the show and all the other voices should simply be silenced." ...|$|R

40|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} many routes by which <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws may impact turnout. For instance, laws restricting campaign spending may decrease mobilization, resulting in lower turnout. Alternatively, such laws might increase {{the competitiveness of}} elections, resulting in higher turnout. Existing studies {{tend to focus on}} only one causal pathway, ignoring the net effects of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> on voter turnout. We exploit the variation in state <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws from 1950 to 2000 in order to estimate the reduced-form relationships between reform and turnout. Using both aggregate and individual-level data, we find that <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws on net have little impact on turnout in gubernatorial elections. There are two exceptions to this finding: Limits on organizational contributions are shown in an individual level analysis to increase turnout prior to a sea change in <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> ushered in by the Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976, while public financing laws are shown to have an equally large negative impact on turnout in the post-Buckley era. These results strengthens the existing literature, which finds similarly perverse effects of public financing on the “quality of democracy,” and demonstrates the advantages of reduced-form analysis for understanding the influence of laws on behavior...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{questionable}} corporate political <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> {{practices and}} foreign corrupt {{practices in the}} mid-1970s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Congress enacted <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> law <b>reforms</b> and the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) which criminalized transnational bribery and required companies to implement internal control programs. In response, the Treadway Commission, a private-sector initiative, was formed in 1985 to inspect, analyze, and make recommendations on fraudulent corporate financial reporting.|$|R
50|$|The 2004 {{election}} {{was the first}} to be affected by the <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> mandated by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the McCain-Feingold Bill for its sponsors in the United States Senate). Because of the Act's restrictions on candidates' and parties' fundraising, a large number of so-called 527 groups emerged. Named for a section of the Internal Revenue Code, these groups were able to raise large amounts of money for various political causes {{as long as they do}} not coordinate their activities with political campaigns. Examples of 527s include Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, MoveOn.org, the Media Fund, and America Coming Together. Many such groups were active throughout the campaign season (there was some similar activity, although on a much lesser scale, during the 2000 campaign).|$|R
50|$|The Natural Law Party for {{a second}} time {{nominated}} scientist and researcher John Hagelin for President and Mike Tompkins for Vice President.

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} the U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in McConnell v. FEC {{illustrates}} three important lessons about judicial review in the distinct context of campaign finance: (1) precedent counts; (2) pragmatism beats platitudes; and (3) legislative judgments deserve respect. According to early critics of McConnell, the Court abdicated its responsibilities in upholding the major provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Critics claimed that the Court did not sufficiently explain its decisions, abandoned free speech principles, and ignored the self-entrenching motives of incumbents who passed the law. This Essay responds to these claims and asserts {{that they must be}} balanced against the gains that stem from tight language that emphasizes precedent, pragmatic consideration of competing interests and context, and congressional expertise in the political landscape of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance.</b> In light of the limited competence and authority of judges to address political questions unique to <b>campaign</b> <b>finance,</b> adherence to precedent in deciding <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> cases enhances judicial credibility and provides legislatures a more stable framework for lawmaking. At the same time, however, <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> features evolving political practices, coalitions, organizations, and technologies that courts often cannot anticipate. When Congress identifies emerging practices that threaten democracy, a court should apply past cases pragmatically to the facts before it and avoid sweeping dogma that may grow dated and contribute to bad results in future cases. <b>Campaign</b> <b>finance</b> is a complex area that involves competing considerations rather than absolutes. As a result, textured and multifaceted judicial review of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> is preferable to review that is either one-dimensionally deferential or one-dimensionally skeptical...|$|R
5000|$|Kōmeitō {{joined the}} Hosokawa and Hata anti-LDP {{coalition}} cabinets in 1993 and 1994.

The other group, Kōmei (公明), continued to exist as a separate party. After the dissolution of the NFP in December 1997, former Kōmeitō members from the NFP founded two new groups: the [...] "New Peace Party" [...] (Shintō Heiwa) and the [...] ("Dawn Club") in the House of Councillors, but some ex-Kōmeitō politicians such as Shōzō Azuma followed Ichirō Ozawa into the Liberal Party.
