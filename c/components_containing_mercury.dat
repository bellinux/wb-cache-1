40|$|Argonne National Laboratory, {{with support}} from the Office of Technology in the US Department of Energy (DOE), has {{developed}} a new process employing novel, chemically bonded ceramic materials to stabilize secondary waste streams. Such waste streams result from the thermal processes used to stabilize low-level, mixed wastes. The process will help the electric power industry treat its combustion and low-level mixed wastes. The ceramic materials are strong, dense, leach-resistant, and inexpensive to fabricate. The room-temperature-setting process allows stabilization of volatile <b>components</b> <b>containing</b> lead, <b>mercury,</b> cadmium, chromium, and nickel. The process also provides effective stabilization of fossil fuel combustion products. It is most suitable for treating fly and bottom ashes...|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the ELV Directive, {{requirements}} for the physical treatment of vehicles and ubiquitous prerequisites for treatment facilities were introduced by drafting the Annex I to the ELV Directive as an enclosure. Annex I describes minimum technical requirements any treatment facility need to adhere to. These are standards on buildings, premises and installations primarily designed to avoid fluids to be released to the soil. The second part covers the physical treatment procedure. Annex I distinguishes between operations for de-pollution and treatment operations to promote recycling. The first one, obligates treatment facilities to drain the ELV from all fluids, to remove components which are marked as being hazardous e.g. <b>components</b> identified to <b>contain</b> <b>mercury,</b> and explosive <b>components</b> e.g. seatbelt tensioners or air bags.The second one mandates the removal of certain components e.g. catalytic converter, tires, glass as well as other metal parts containing copper, aluminum or magnesium and large plastic components if these materials are not segregated in the shredding process.|$|R
5000|$|All {{fluorescent}} lamps <b>contain</b> <b>mercury,</b> {{and at this}} time, no suitable replacement has been found. Many US states have banned disposal of lamps <b>containing</b> <b>mercury,</b> and have established regulations requiring that lamps <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> are identified as such. This has not caused problems for manufacturers, however, as lamps are not produced locally, and often not in the US. There have been several efforts to label all lamps that <b>contain</b> <b>mercury</b> with a universally accepted symbol, Hg. [...] Old lamps should be handled as would be any hazardous material in your locality, and persons should take special precautions when dealing with broken lamps to avoid contact with mercury. This is particularly true for pregnant women. [...] These laws and guidelines are not unique to tanning lamps, and apply to all {{fluorescent lamps}}, other lamps that <b>contain</b> <b>mercury,</b> {{as well as other}} products that <b>contain</b> <b>mercury</b> with the exception of pharmaceuticals.

30|$|Cosmetic {{preparations}} <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> for bleaching {{purpose is}} an old practice (Al-Saleh and Al-Doush 1997). Mercury is a toxic metal but found usefulness in many cosmetic preparations targeted at skin lightening by suppression of melanin production by the skin (Bourgeosis et al. 1986). Cosmetic products <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> {{in the form of}} inorganic mercury are mainly used by dark skinned people mostly in developing countries (Barr et al. 1973). Mercury is a volatile element and is harmful to the skin when used in an effort to lighten the skin. However, chronic exposure of the body to mercury at very low concentration can cause long-lasting neurological and kidney impairment (Hutson et al. 1999). Mercury in bleaching preparations can be absorbed through the skin and accumulates in body organs giving rise to severe toxicity (Sah 2012). A study conducted on Tanzanian gold miners who use mercury for amalgamation and people not engaged in gold mining activities revealed that the mercury found in their blood and urine was derived from cosmetic soaps and creams <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> (Kahatano et al. 1998). Glahder and Appell (1999) also reported high levels of mercury in imported soaps and creams bought in Tanzanian shops. An investigation of Kenyan women with damaged kidney also revealed that they suffered severely from higher incidence of nephritic syndrome, which was attributed to the use of creams <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> (Barr et al. 1973).|$|R

50|$|The farming {{of aquatic}} organisms, known as aquaculture, often {{involves}} fish feed that <b>contains</b> <b>mercury.</b> A study by Jardine has found no reliable connection between mercury in fish food affecting aquaculture organisms or aquatic organisms in the wild.

In China, farmed fish species, such as bighead carp, mud carp, and mandarin fish, carried 90% of total mercury content {{in all of the}} measured fish in a study by Cheng. This study also concluded that mercury bioaccumulates through food chains even in controlled aquaculture environments.
