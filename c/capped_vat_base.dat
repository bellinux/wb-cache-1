40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to assess Croatia’s fiscal {{capacity}} in 2007 by means of the National Accounts Supply and Use Tables (SUT) approach and its harmonisation with EU regulations. National fiscal capacity is important for assessing an EU member country’s contribution to the EU budget. Based on theoretical considerations and EU regulations, Croatia’s GDP expenditure components for 2004 were used for the approximation of Croatia’s theoretical value added tax (<b>VAT)</b> <b>base</b> and a weighted average VAT rate (WAVR). The harmonisation of Croatia’s intermediate <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> with EU regulations was carried out using cash receipts from the Tax Authority, gross national income (GNI) and WAVR. If the theoretical <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> of any EU member country is under 50 % of GNI then it is used as a base for the calculation of country contribution to EU budget, otherwise it is capped at 50 % of GNI. The results of this assessment show that Croatia’s harmonised 2007 <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> is in the zone of capping and that Croatia’s WAVR is bigger than those of all but one of the 12 new EU member states, while a comparison of theoretical VAT to VAT net cash receipts indicates that there is room for upward revisions of GDP/GNI...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the reform}} of value added tax (VAT) in Zambia. It does so by firstly, empirically establishing who pays VAT and secondly by investigating {{the economic impact of}} broadening the <b>VAT</b> <b>base.</b> Two options on reforms to broaden the <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> are considered using a computable general equilibrium model which specifies a VAT with rebates. These are: (a) broadening the <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> to all sectors and (b) broadening the <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> to the agricultural sectors except the maize sector which {{is the source of the}} country’s staple. The results in general suggest that VAT is mildly regressive. However, the VAT burden is borne more heavily by urban households compared to rural households. In particular, VAT paid on food is borne more heavily by urban households. The results also suggest that in the short-run broadening the <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> to all sectors has the ability to raise additional revenue but has adverse effects on the economy, particularly on household welfare. Nevertheless, the adverse effects are muted if VAT broadening is accompanied by reduction in the VAT rate. Furthermore, results on the reform that extends the <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> to the agricultural sectors except the maize sector, has minimal effects on the macro economy, raises some additional revenue and adversely affects the welfare of urban households compared to rural households. At sectoral level, results reveal that in the short-run broadening the <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> engenders a resource allocation within value-added that is beneficial to the mobile factor, labour due to the impact of rebates on relative prices of intermediate inputs. In addition to this, results show the importance of a well functioning rebate system on the economy. The imperfections in the rebate system are likely to affect the welfare implications of changes to VAT. Results suggest that welfare losses from broadening the <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> fall with an improvement in the functioning of the rebate system. The conclusions and recommendations from the foregoing are as follows. Given that that the burden of VAT is largely borne by urban households who are relatively better off compared to the rural households, VAT can be extended to cover some of the currently exempted items at low welfare cost. This would create fiscal space to undertake more activities as envisaged in the Fifth National Development Plan. Secondly, extending the VAT coverage to all sectors with very minimal or no exclusions should be accompanied with reductions in the VAT rate. Furthermore, contrary to the widely held view in the debate on VAT reform in Zambia, extending the VAT coverage to agricultural sectors apart from maize sector is not likely to hurt the worse-off socio-economic groups. The short-run welfare losses of such a reform appear to be more disproportionately borne by the urban households whose incidence of poverty is low compared to the rural households. Therefore, bringing more agricultural commodities under VAT coverage provides one of the viable options to reforming VAT in Zambia...|$|R

Changes in public spending and the tax rate generate a reallocation from underground to the regular economy which contributes to obscure the spending and tax effect on total GDP. In this setup the spending multiplier shows large long-run effects, considerably stronger than those registered in a model with no attention paid to unreported production. The drop in regular output, after an increase in the effective tax rate, tends to be considerable after one year, producing long-lasting effects and a significant increase in unreported production and tax evasion. fiscal policy, VECM, fiscal multipliers, unreported GDP, tax ratio, effective tax rate...|$|R

40|$|Under {{the current}} VAT system {{defined in the}} Sixth VAT Directive, Member States are {{required}} to have a single VAT rate of at least 15 % and may have a maximum of two reduced VAT rates set no lower than 5 %. Annex H of the 6 Directive outlines {{the list of the}} goods and services to which reduced rates could apply. However, this basic structure which applies to all Member States is complicated by the numerous individual temporary derogations granted to particular Member States. Most of these specific rates (zero rate, super reduced rates, parking rate and so on) are to be found under the title XVI Transitional provisions Article 28 of the 6 Directive and most have been granted until the entry into force of the "definitive system" of <b>VAT</b> <b>based</b> on taxation in the Member State of origin. The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on the application of the current VAT system to both <b>VAT</b> <b>bases</b> and rates among Member States. For the <b>VAT</b> <b>bases,</b> our indicators demonstrate the share of the base to which a specific VAT rate applies relative to the whole taxable <b>base.</b> For the <b>VAT</b> rates, focusing on the statutory standard VAT rate is not satisfactory. To take into account the existence of different VAT rates, we compute implicit VAT rates. These implicit VAT rates give an indication on the VAT burden. Our analysis shows that the standard VAT rate is far from applicable to the whole taxable base. In the year 2000, on average for the EU- 15, 69 % of the VAT taxable transactions value was taxed at the standard VAT rate. Moreover for some Member States, only around half of the taxable transactions were actually taxed at the standard VAT rate. Therefore, non-standard VAT rates are not the exception as they should be. Taking into account all VAT rates in force gives us an implicit VAT rate that is up to 30 % lower than the standard rate in force in the Member States. In the year 2000, the EU- 15 average for the statutory standard VAT rate was 19. 4 % with a minimum (compulsory) of 15 % and a maximum of 25 %. In contrast, the implicit VAT rate for the EU- 15 was 15. 9 % with a larger volatility. VAT, European Union, Taxation, effective tax rates...|$|R

Using this formulation, {{we are able to}} provide numerical examples of welfare worsening <b>VAT</b> <b>base</b> broadening, which expands the tax base from market based manufactures, in which there are few (or no) non taxed supply possibilities, to all goods and services where such possibilities exist.

We provide a calibrated version of the model, which captures Canadian base broadening accompanying the introduction of the Canadian VAT (GST) in 1990.

40|$|The {{design of}} heat exchangers, {{which has always}} been important, has become {{increasingly}} critical in today's world and has also become closely coupled with optimization. The commonly used optimization methods, such as design of experiment (DOE), genetic algorithm (GA), etc., require a large population of design points/individuals to be evaluated. To shorten the optimization process, the evaluation of these large number of design points/individuals should be fast, which has precluded the use of time-consuming evaluation methods, such as direct numerical simulations (DNS) due to the significant computational costs of performing the flow and heat transfer in such heterogeneous (and porous), hierarchical devices with conjugate effects included, nor experimental evaluation that requires {{a large number of}} different heat exchangers be fabricated which is not only time-consuming but also expensive. This makes population-based optimization quite difficult if combined with system level CFD or experimental evaluation. To enable these optimization methods, a fast-running solver is necessary to perform an evaluation of the many needed design points/individuals. Breakthroughs in the modeling of transport phenomena in heterogeneous media with Volume Averaging Theory (VAT) have allowed engineers to fully simulate flow and heat transfer in thermal devices in seconds, in comparison with hours or days it takes to do so with system level CFD simulation over one single design of a heat exchanger. VAT is a hierarchical modeling method that includes mathematical description on two different levels. The lower level is flow and heat transfer at the pore scale for individual subscale elementary volume, which is described by the point-wise Navier-Stokes and thermal energy equations. The upper level is for the whole heat transfer device, described by the VAT-based mass, momentum, and thermal energy transport equations. The two levels are rigorously connected by mathematical scaling procedures, yielding additional integral and differential terms which need to be evaluated. Proper evaluation of these extra terms is called the closure problem of the <b>VAT</b> <b>based</b> model, which has been the primary measure of advancement and for measuring success in research on transport in porous media. A method to obtain closures of the <b>VAT</b> <b>based</b> governing equations by CFD evaluation is developed. The procedure of the closure evaluation consists of eight main steps: 1) select the representative elementary volume correctly, which is simply the periodic unit cell in the case of periodic media; 2) define a proper characteristic length scale; 3) select a proper numerical method according to the flow condition; 4) discretize the computational domain carefully and conduct validation and verification of the adopted numerical method; 5) determine the number of REVs needed to obtain reasonable fully developed local values; 6) conduct numerical simulation over the selected REVs; 7) extract the macroscopic hydrodynamic and thermal characteristics from the microscopic results by evaluating the closures over the REV; 8) collect the evaluated results for friction factor and heat transfer coefficient and develop the corresponding correlations. Since the closure evaluation is conducted by carrying out direct numerical experiments at the pore scale of the representative elementary volume (REV) which usually has a quite small computational domain, therefore the computation load is much lower than simulation at the device scale. With the closure correlations, the upper-level governing equation set is relatively simple and allows a nonlocal description of transport phenomena in heterogeneous thermal devices, with the morphology directly incorporated into the field equations and conjugate effects fully treated. The simplicity of the <b>VAT</b> <b>based</b> governing equations makes it possible for them to be solved discretely and a rapid evaluation of the design points to be performed. With a fast-running solver being developed, the population based optimization methods can be exploited to guide the design to its optimal configuration. To demonstrate how the <b>VAT</b> <b>based</b> solver can be combined with commonly used optimization methods, a fin-and-tube heat exchanger is optimized using genetic algorithm and a heat sink with scale-shaped surface roughness is optimized using design of experiment. It {{should be noted that the}} development of the optimization algorithms is not the focus of the present work.

The value-added tax (VAT) in China has the unusual feature that capital goods are included in the <b>VAT</b> <b>base.</b> In addition, most services are subject to the business tax, which is not creditable against VAT, but which accrues to local governments, and operates as a turnover tax. On grounds of economic efficiency, it would be desirable to eliminate these distortions so that domestic producers are not increasingly placed at a disadvantage as China dismantles tariff and nontariff barriers on competing goods. Reforming indirect taxation would however generate considerable revenue losses for local governments and, {{in the absence of any}} compensatory mechanisms, there would be significant impediments to the needed reforms. This paper focuses on the extent of revenue losses, their distribution across provinces, and possible options for compensation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} fiscal policy in Italy by defining a regular GDP measure constructed as GDP net of government expenditure and evaded <b>VAT</b> <b>base.</b> Within aVECframework, two alternative approaches are used {{in order to identify}} fiscal policy shocks: on the one hand, the standard Cholesky identification, and on the other hand, the “agnostic sign restriction” approach. The results reveal that we cannot rely upon the estimates of fiscal policy multipliers in countries with a sizeable unreported production, unless the dynamics of the hidden and regular components of the GDP are disentangled. Changes in public spending and the tax rate generate a reallocation from underground to the regular economy which contributes to obscure the spending and tax effect on totalGDP. In addition, the restrictive policy harms economic growth for the perverse effects that impinge on the regular–irregular dynamics of the GDP, highlighted by our model. Finally, the interaction between regular and unreported production demonstrates that the link between the two sectors is very harmful in the long term, since there is strong evidence that shocks to the unreported production have long-lasting negative effects for the regular economy...|$|R
