Sensors are calibrated with OECD synthetic wastewater. Linear range in <b>calibration</b> <b>solution</b> for Ps. p. and Ps. fl. sensors is BOD 0 - 50 mg/L and 0 - 65 mg/L, respectively.

In linear range the error is only 1. 2 – 13 %. For Ps. fl. the error in linear range is 17 – 55 %. Preconditioning in phenol solution (BOD = 5 mg/L) increases sensor’s sensitivity to phenol considerably (52 %).

40|$|The main {{sources of}} {{uncertainty}} encountered during {{the analysis of the}} mass concentration of metals in ambient air as part of the operation of the UK Heavy Metals Monitoring Network are presented. It is observed that the uncertainty contribution from possible variation in the isotopic composition of the sample depends on the element in question, but can be significant (e. g., for Pb, Cd, and Hg). The working curve method for the ICP-MS analysis of metals in solution, with a low resolution, high throughput instrument measuring at one m/z ratio per element, relies on the relative abundance of the isotopes under consideration being the same in both the sample and the <b>calibration</b> <b>solution.</b> Calculation of the uncertainty in this analysis assumes that the isotopic composition variation within the sample and <b>calibration</b> <b>solution</b> is limited to a defined range.

The subframe model has 250, 440 degrees-of-freedom and the calibration is made for 16 uncertain model parameters. The efficiency of the calibration procedure under these conditions is reported. With model calibration being a cornerstone of the finite element validation procedure, the calibration problem is normally characterized as being a large scale optimization problem with many model parameters to solve for and with deviation metric that are nonlinear in these parameters.

40|$|Model {{calibration}} is {{a cornerstone}} of the finite element verification and validation procedure, in which {{the credibility of the}} model is substantiated by positive comparison with test data. The calibration problem, in which the minimum deviation between finite element model data and experimental data is searched for, is normally characterized as being a large scale optimization problem with many model parameters to solve for and with deviation metrics that are nonlinear in these parameters. The calibrated parameters need to be found by iterative procedures, starting from initial estimates. Sometimes these procedures get trapped in local deviation function minima and do not converge to the globally optimal <b>calibration</b> <b>solution</b> that is searched for. The reason for such traps is often the multi-modality of the problem which causes eigenmode crossover problems in the iterative variation of parameter settings. This work presents a calibration formulation which gives a smooth deviation metric with a large radius of convergence to the global minimum. A damping equalization method is suggested to avoid the mode correlation and mode pairing problems that need to be solved in many other model updating procedures. By this method, the modal damping of a test data model and the finite element model is set to be the same fraction of critical modal damping. Mode pairing for mapping of experimentally found damping to the finite element model is thus not needed.

In time-division duplexing systems, channel reciprocity has been commonly put forth to justify the convenient use of the CSI already acquired from the uplink, in the calculation of the transmit-MRC weights.

40|$|Surface {{contamination}} from methamphetamine in meth labs {{continues to}} be a problem. We had previously developed a lateral flow assay cassette for field detection of methamphetamine contamination that is commercially available and has been used by a number of groups to assess contamination. This cassette uses the complete disappearance of the test line as an end point for detection of 50 ng/ 100 cm 2 of methamphetamine contamination for surface sampling with cotton swabs. In the present study, we further evaluate the response of the cassettes using an electronic lateral flow reader to measure the intensities of the test and control lines. The cassettes were capable of detecting 0. 25 ng/ml for <b>calibration</b> <b>solutions.</b> For 100 cm 2 ceramic tiles that were spiked with methamphetamine and wiped with cotton-tipped wooden swabs wetted in assay/sampling buffer, 1 ng/tile was detected using the reader. Semi-quantitative results can be produced over the range 0 - 10 ng/ml for <b>calibration</b> <b>solutions</b> and 0 - 25 ng/tile for spiked tiles using either a 4 -parameter logistic fit of test line intensity versus concentration or spiked mass or the ratio of the control line to the test line intensity fit to concentration or spiked mass. Recovery from the tiles was determined to be about 30 % using the fitted curves. Comparison of the control line to the test line was also examined as a possible visual detection end point and {{it was found that the}} control line became more intense than the test line at 0. 5 to 1 ng/ml for <b>calibration</b> <b>solutions</b> or 1 to 2 ng/tile for spiked tiles.
