5|$|On August 26, 1940, {{a preview}} of the highway was {{organized}} by <b>commission</b> <b>chairman</b> Jones. It began the previous night with a banquet at The Hotel Hershey and proceeded west along the turnpike, stopping at the Clear Ridge cut before lunch at the Midway service plaza. The preview ended with dinner and entertainment at the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh. That month, a military motorcade traveled portions of the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{run by the}} Federal Council of Churches in America sought {{issuance of}} a half dollar to mark the anniversary, and the bill passed through Congress without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding. Sketches were prepared by <b>commission</b> <b>chairman</b> Rev. John Baer Stoudt and converted to plaster models by the Mint's aging chief engraver, George T. Morgan. The models were initially rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts, which required revisions {{under the supervision of}} Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{groundbreaking}} {{was held}} on October 27, 1938, near Carlisle; <b>Commission</b> <b>Chairman</b> Walter A. Jones thrust the first shovel into the earth. Turnpike construction was on a tight schedule, since completion of the road was originally planned by May 1, 1940. After the groundbreaking, contracts for finishing the former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels, grading the turnpike's right-of-way, constructing bridges and paving were awarded. By July 1939, {{the entire length of}} the turnpike was under contract.|$|E

5|$|The highway was {{considered}} a yardstick by which limited-access highway construction would be measured. <b>Commission</b> <b>chairman</b> Jones called for more limited-access roads to be built across the country for defense purposes, and the turnpike was {{a model for a}} proposed national network of highways planned during World War II. The Pennsylvania Turnpike led to the construction of other toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and (eventually) the Interstate Highway System. It has been designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{announced}} a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in Doha. According to the report, there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded {{that it would have been}} impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the start time of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety <b>commission</b> <b>chairman</b> Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was unfeasible.|$|E

25|$|The NHL, led by Commissioner Gary Bettman, {{attempted}} to convince players {{to accept a}} salary structure linking player salaries to league revenues, guaranteeing the clubs what the league called cost certainty. According to an NHL-commissioned report prepared by former U.S. Securities and Exchange <b>Commission</b> <b>chairman</b> Arthur Levitt, prior to 2004–05, NHL clubs spent about 76 percent of their gross revenues on players' salaries– a figure far higher than those in other North American sports– and collectively lost US$273million during the 2002–03 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} mass repressions was {{recognized}} before the speech. The speech itself was prepared {{based on the}} results of a special party <b>commission</b> (<b>chairman</b> Pyotr Pospelov, P. T. Komarov, Averky Aristov, and Nikolay Shvernik), known as the Pospelov Commission, arranged at the session of the Presidium of the Party Central Committee on 31 January 1955. The direct goal of the commission was to investigate the repressions of the delegates of the 17th Congress, in 1934, of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The protests {{led to a}} {{strengthened}} {{role for}} the state. In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also {{a blow to the}} 'separation of powers' model established by the 1982 Constitution and by convention, whereby the President was a symbolic position (figurehead), and the real centres of power of the General Secretary of the Communist Party, the Premier of the State Council and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission were intended to be different people, to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule. However, when President Yang Shangkun asserted his reserve powers with his post of Vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and openly split with general secretary Zhao Ziyang over the use of force to side with Premier Li Peng and Central Military <b>Commission</b> <b>chairman</b> Deng Xiaoping, official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. In 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military <b>Commission</b> <b>Chairman</b> and President were all consolidated into the same office, reverting to the previous Maoist distribution of power that had previously existed since 1972.|$|E

25|$|In October 2010, a {{draft report}} from the Civil Rights Commission was posted on the {{political}} website TPM Muckraker, stating that political officials had been extensively involved {{in the decision to}} dismiss the case, and that the Department of Justice had attempted to conceal their involvement. Civil Rights <b>Commission</b> <b>chairman</b> Gerald A. Reynolds confirmed the draft was authentic, but claimed it was not the most current version of the draft, and declined to immediately release the newest version or describe what revisions had been made to it. The Justice Department denied the allegations in the report.|$|E
25|$|The {{reported}} cost {{of campaigning}} for president has increased significantly in recent years. One source reported {{that if the}} costs for both Democratic and Republican campaigns were added together (for the presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions), the costs {{have more than doubled}} in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004). In January 2007, Federal Election <b>Commission</b> <b>Chairman</b> Michael E. Toner estimated that the 2008 race would be a $1 billion election, and that to be taken seriously, a candidate would have needed to raise at least $100 million by the end of 2007.|$|E
25|$|As Oswald {{was killed}} {{before he was}} tried for either crime, President Lyndon B. Johnson {{commissioned}} a committee of U.S. Senators, Congressmen and elder statesmen to investigate the events surrounding the deaths of President Kennedy, Officer Tippit and Oswald {{in an effort to}} answer questions surrounding the events. President Johnson also hoped to quell rumors that arose after Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby that the assassination and subsequent shootings were part of a conspiracy. The committee, known as the Warren Commission (named for the <b>commission</b> <b>chairman,</b> Chief Justice Earl Warren), spent ten months investigating the murders and interviewing witnesses. On September 24, 1964, the Warren Commission released an 888-page report that concluded {{there was no evidence of}} a conspiracy and Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and Officer Tippit. The report also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.|$|E

25|$|Lieber {{convinced}} Goodrich, the {{new governor}} and close friend, {{to create a}} Department of Conservation to unite all the various state groups that were involved in various natural causes; the department was stopped from forming by the Democratic legislature in 1917, but the new Republican one of 1919 created it. As the Conservation <b>Commission</b> <b>Chairman</b> until 1933, he saw the creation of ten state parks and five state memorials. Little state money was used; Lieber {{had a knack for}} inspiring private citizens to obtain money to acquire park areas that would later be turned over for state park use. Attendance at Indiana state parks rose to 623,000 in 1932, up from 33,000 in 1919. In 1934, despite the lack of people and wealth compared to other states, it was rated as one of the three best state park systems by the National Park Service.|$|E
