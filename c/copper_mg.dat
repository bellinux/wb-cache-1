As the drivers in maintaining ecosystem functioning, the responses of soil microorganisms to long-term copper contamination in different soil ecosystems are still debated. This study investigated the impacts of copper gradients on soil bacterial communities in two agricultural fields with contrasting soil properties. Our results revealed consistent reduction in soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) with increasing copper levels in both soils, coupled by significant declines in bacterial abundance in most cases. Despite of contrasting bacterial community structures between the two soils, the bacterial diversity in the copper-contaminated soils showed considerably decreasing patterns when copper levels elevated. High-throughput sequencing revealed copper selection for major bacterial guilds, in particular, Actinobacteria showed tolerance, while Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi were highly sensitive to copper. The thresholds that bacterial communities changed sharply were 800 and 200 added <b>copper</b> <b>mg</b> kg- 1 in the fluvo-aquic soil and red soil, respectively, which were similar to the toxicity thresholds (EC 50 values) characterized by SMBC. Structural equation model (SEM) analysis ascertained that the shifts of bacterial community composition and diversity were closely related with the changes of SMBC in both soils. Our results provide field-based evidence that copper contamination exhibits consistently negative impacts on soil bacterial communities, and the shifts of bacterial communities could have largely determined the variations of the microbial biomass...|$|E

Patients who undergo the DS procedure are at risk for malabsorption, malnutrition, and nutrient deficiencies. Copper deficiency is a commonly reported long-term complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. However, data are limited on copper deficiency–associated complications and their treatment in DS patients. This article presents a case of a patient who developed hypocupremia with associated pancytopenia, myeloneuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy following DS and reviews the literature related to the pathophysiology of copper deficiency and copper replacement in bariatric surgery patients. When severe diarrhea was present, intravenous elemental <b>copper</b> 4 <b>mg</b> (as cupric chloride) /d in addition to daily oral copper gluconate was necessary to correct the hypocupremia and improve the hematologic indices and neurologic symptoms of copper deficiency. When diarrhea subsided, oral elemental <b>copper</b> 4 <b>mg</b> (as <b>copper</b> gluconate) 3 times daily maintained normal serum copper concentrations and avoided the relapse of severe neurologic dysfunction. Regular monitoring of serum copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations is recommended following DS surgery to detect any copper deficiency before irreversible neurologic damage occurs.

Worms were fed and maintained under ambient conditions in a flow-through seawater system and sampled at 3, 6 and 9 months. Using BCR sequential extraction, bioavailable metal concentrations in the sediment were assessed in addition to pore water and tissues metal concentrations. The induction of metallothionein (MT) activity, especially at month 6, revealed the detoxification potential of N. virens under metal stress conditions. Significant correlations were obtained between copper bioavailable concentrations in the sediment and MT levels at month 3 and between zinc bioavailable concentrations in the sediment and MT levels at month 6.

40|$|Copper {{content is}} of great concern among sugarcane-spirit producers. It is {{released}} from copper-made distillers, during the distillation process. Activated carbon {{has been used to}} remove copper. However, depending on the amount of carbon and the duration of reaction, it can also remove higher alcohols and esters, which are important in the final product. A sugarcane spirit with 9 mg L- 1 of copper was shaken with 2 to 26 g L- 1 of activated carbon, during 10 to 1440 minutes. Then, copper and organic compounds were measured. At least 12 g L- 1 of carbon and 60 min shaking time were necessary to decrease <b>copper</b> bellow 5 <b>mg</b> L- 1. However, other components of the product were also affected...|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of nutrient mixture Plant Care sprayed on foliage at different physiological growth stages of wheat. The composition of the nutrient mixture Plant Care was N 200 g, P 2 O 5 200 g, K 2 O 200 g, Zn 750 mg, Iron 1500 g, <b>Copper</b> 750 <b>mg,</b> Boron 300 mg, Manganese 750 mg, Magnesium 375 mg and Molybdenum 8 mg. The results indicated that there were non-significant differences in number of plants m 2, total number of tillers per plant and number of fertile tillers per plant. A significant improvement in number of grains per spike and 1000 grain weight was found when the nutrient mixture was sprayed on wheat foliage at three growth stages i. e. at tillering, booting and milking. Spraying micronutrients at tillering and/or booting and milking growth stage(s) increased the grain yield of wheat. The foliar spray of micronutrients at the same stages also gave maximum biological and straw yields. The values of harvest index were non-significant with each other. The maximum net profit was gathered in foliar spray of micronutrients at tillering+booting+milking growth stages of wheat. The booting stage appeared the most suitable physiological stage for foliar application of micronutrients. The other stage {{for the application of}} micronutrients might be tillering...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} and characterization of a cuproprotein, erythrocuprein, from normal human erythrocytes {{have been described}} recently (1 - 3). Preliminary studies indicated that normal human erythrocytes contain about 30 to 36 mg of erythrocuprein per 100 ml of packed cells (1). Since erythrocytes are known to hold about 100,ug of copper per 100 ml of packed cells (4), and since erythrocuprein carries 3. 4 /Ag of <b>copper</b> per <b>mg</b> of protein, we suggested that erythrocuprein accounts {{for most of the}} copper in erythrocytes. It became apparent in the course of further investigation that the anti-erythrocuprein serum used in the preliminary studies contained antibody to an erythrocyte component other than erythrocuprein and that the erythrocuprein concentrations reported were erroneously high. A modified technic for purification of erythrocuprein, as well as immunological evidence for the homogeneity of the purified product, are presented in this report. We shall also report studies of erythrocuprein in normal human erythrocytes and in those from patients with various diseases. Since erythrocuprein accounted for only about 60 per cent of the erythrocyte copper, observations are included on the preliminary separation of an additional erythrocyte copper component (s). METHODS Preparation of erythrocuprein. Erythrocuprein was prepared from normal human erythrocytes by a modification of the method described previously (1). The sub...|$|R
