50|$|In 2004, {{before being}} {{assembled}} for the Düsseldorf fair, Eurostar’s zero-g roll, the left turn {{up into the}} first block brake after the zero-g roll and the left hand turn after the first block brake, were replaced. The doweled joints in the vertical loop had holes drilled into them to reduce noise and oscillation. Modification of the track connections was also done. The lift had a <b>cover</b> <b>installed</b> that would slide over the saw-tooth profile of the anti-rollbacks, making the surface smooth and eliminating noise created as the anti-rollbacks jumped between teeth. The change in the safety system required a control system to ensure rides safety. The train's speed is controlled, and any variance in the speed causes the cover to be pulled aside to expose the saw-tooth, causing the anti-rollbacks to engage. Should the system fail, springs would push the cover aside to ensure the anti-rollbacks would engage in case an emergency would arise.|$|E

The new shield {{is made of}} a polycarbonate foil, which is coated by a thin film of nickel (only 50 nm in thickness) and by a 5 -μm thick layer of tin, and successively thermoformed. The innovative characteristics of such a high-technology shield are the extremely light weight, the high thermoformability, good shielding performance against both far-field and near field sources, low production costs, low installation costs, minimum occupied volume. The mechanical, chemical, and electromagnetic performance of the new shield has been characterized experimentally.

40|$|Preventive {{conservation}} requires {{monitoring and}} control of the parameters involved in the deterioration process, mainly temperature and relative humidity. It is important to characterise an archaeological site prior to carrying out comparative studies in the future for preventive conservation, either by regular studies to verify whether the conditions are constant, or occasional ones when the boundary conditions are altered. There are numerous covered archaeological sites, but few preventive conservation works that give special attention to the type of <b>cover</b> <b>installed.</b> In particular, there is no background of microclimatic studies in sites that are in the ground and, as in the Plaza de l’Almoina (Valencia, Spain), are buried and partially covered by a transparent roof. A large effect of the transparent cover was found by the sensors located below this area, with substantial increases in temperature and a decrease in the relative humidity during the day. Surrounding zones also have values above the recommended temperature values. On the other hand, the influence of a buried water drainage line near the site is notable, causing an increase in relative humidity levels in the surrounding areas. Multivariate statistical analyses enabled us to characterise the microclimate of the archaeological site, allowing future testing to determine whether the conservation conditions have been altered...|$|E
40|$|Coke, a {{by-product}} of petroleum extraction from oil sands, is considered a potential energy source and must be stored within the reclaimed landscape {{in a manner that}} allows it to be recovered in the future. Syncrude Canada constructed two instrumented watersheds at the Mildred Lake Settling Basin (tailings management facility) to study the effects of coke in the environment. The watersheds consisted of a “shallow” and a “deep” cover system with nominal thicknesses of 35 cm and 100 cm, overlying an approximate 5 m thick coke deposit. The two reclamation soil covers were constructed using peat-mineral mix placed over secondary (glacial till). The global objective of this research program was to evaluate the preliminary performance for each of the soil covers with respect to the available water holding capacity (AWHC). The specific objectives were to: a) install additional instrumentation to supplement the existing instrumented watersheds; b) characterize the properties of the covers on each watershed; and c) develop a preliminary, one-dimensional water balance for each watershed. Existing instrumentation on each <b>cover</b> (<b>installed</b> by others) included: a meteorological station; automated soil stations to monitor suction, water content and temperature; and, lysimeters to collect net percolation. Additional instrumentation was installed during this research program to track vertical and horizontal variations in soil conditions and included: access tubes for monitoring water content; temperature sensors; gas sampling points; and, standpipe piezometers to determine depth to the water table. The instrumentation generally performed well, {{with the exception of the}} lysimeters which did not appear to measure net percolation accurately. Through the measurement of soil parameters, interpretation of field monitoring data and laboratory testing, the covers were characterized for their relative ability to store water for plant growth. A water balance was determined for each watershed. Evaluation of the covers indicated that neither the deep nor the shallow covers were successful at storing sufficient water necessary for plant growth under dry conditions. However, the deep cover performed better than the shallow cover based on the overall cover performance, likely due to its higher AWHC...|$|E

The site {{is located on the}} Tonopah Test Range, approximately 225 kilometers northwest of Las Vegas, NV.

The trenches were excavated to receive solid waste generated in support of Operation Roller Coaster, primary the Double Tracks Test in 1963, and were subsequently backfilled. The Double Tracks Test involved use of live animals to assess the biological hazards associated with the nonnuclear detonation of plutonium-bearing devices.

40|$|Abstract. Molecular {{diffusion}} is {{an important}} mechanism for gas transport in various natural and man-made systems. This is particularly the case with soil <b>covers</b> <b>installed</b> on acid-generating mine tailings, where oxygen availability has to be controlled. One {{of the most important}} roles of such covers is to limit gas flux, which depends on the effective diffusion coefficient De of the cover materials. This paper presents an experimental procedure and results from oxygen diffusion tests performed on different types of materials, at various degrees of saturation. The determination of De in the laboratory from the test data is based on analytical and numerical solutions to Fick’s laws. The ensuing values of De are compared to values calculated from available models that relate De to basic material properties, including porosity and degree of saturation. Statistical indicators are used to evaluate the accuracy of selected models, individually and on a comparative basis. It is shown that modified versions of the Millington–Quirk (M-Q) and Millington–Shearer (M-S) models provide De values close to the measured data. A semi-empirical expression, ensuing from these models and measurements, is proposed as a simple means of estimating De...|$|R
