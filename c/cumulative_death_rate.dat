40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether initial medical therapy (MT) only or percutaneous coronary intervention plus medical therapy (PCI+MT) is better for patients with low-risk stable coronary artery disease (CAD) indicated for intervention in Japan. BackgroundSeveral multicenter {{studies have suggested that}} in the above patients, an initial management strategy of PCI+MT does not reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular events more effectively than initial MT only. MethodsWe conducted a randomized comparative study (JSAP [Japanese Stable Angina Pectoris] study) in the previously mentioned patients. ResultsThe patients were randomized to PCI+MT (n = 192) or initial MT only group (n = 192), and the patient characteristics were very similar in the 2 groups. During the 3. 3 -year follow-up, {{there was no significant difference}} in the <b>cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> between PCI+MT (2. 9 %) and MT (3. 9 %). However, the cumulative risk of death plus acute coronary syndrome was significantly smaller in PCI+MT. ConclusionsIn stable low-risk CAD, PCI+MT may improve long-term prognosis more effectively than MT...|$|E
40|$|Ebola virus (EBOV), of {{the family}} Filoviridae viruses, is a NIAID {{category}} A, lethal human pathogen. It is responsible for causing Ebola virus disease (EVD) that is a severe hemor-rhagic fever and has a <b>cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> of 41 % in the ongoing epidemic in West Africa. There is an ever-increasing need to consolidate and make available all the know-ledge that we possess on EBOV, {{even if it is}} conflicting or incomplete.

We assessed {{the prognosis of}} diabetic nephropathy during long-term antihypertensive treatment {{as compared to the}} prognosis during the natural history of this complication in a prospective study of all IDDM patients (N = 45) aged under 50 with onset of diabetes before the age of 31 who developed diabetic nephropathy between 1974 and 1978 at Steno Diabetes Center, and were followed until death or for at least 16 years [median 16 (4 to 21) years]. Antihypertensive treatment was started 3 (0 to 13) years after onset of diabetic nephropathy. Mean arterial blood pressure at start of antihypertensive treatment was 148 / 96 (SD 12 / 10) mm Hg and 143 / 86 (16 / 6) mm Hg during the whole interval of antihypertensive treatment (P < 0. 01). The <b>cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was 45 % (95 % C.

The median survival time in our study exceeded 16 years as compared to five and seven years in untreated patients in the past. Uremia was the main cause of death (12 patients; 55 %). In 1994 serum creatinine was 116 (74 to 311) µmol/liter in the 23 surviving patients.

40|$|Primary objective: Life {{expectancy}} may {{be substantially}} reduced {{for many years}} after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study investigated the patterns of the short- and long-term all-cause mortality and the rates of primary causes of death in patients with severe TBI. Subjects: This study was of 166 consecutive patients (6 – 82 years) with severe TBI admitted to Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, from 1999 – 2002. The control group consisted of 809 subjects from the community, matched to the TBI cohort for age, gender and postcode area {{at the time of}} the injury. Methods: Survival outcome and cause of death were ascertained 10 years after the injury from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare register. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and causes of death in cases and controls were compared. Results: The risk of death was increased for at least 10 years after severe TBI. The distribution of the causes of deaths differed between cases and controls in the first year of follow-up, but not between 1 -year survivors and controls. Conclusion: Further research will be required to determine how to improve treatment so as to lower late mortality among survivors of severe TBI...|$|R
40|$|Background-The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the long-term prognostic impact of procedure-related and spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) on cardiovascular mortality in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. Methods and Results-Five-year follow-up after procedure-related or spontaneous MI was investigated in the individual patient pooled data set of the FRISC-II (Fast Revascularization During Instability in Coronary Artery Disease), ICTUS (Invasive Versus Conservative Treatment in Unstable Coronary Syndromes), and RITA- 3 (Randomized Intervention Trial of Unstable Angina 3) non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome trials. The principal outcome was cardiovascular death up to 5 years of follow-up. Cumulative event rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method; hazard ratios were calculated with time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models. Adjustments were made for the variables associated with long-term outcomes. Among the 5467 patients, 212 experienced a procedure-related MI within 6 months after enrollment. A spontaneous MI occurred in 236 patients within 6 months. The <b>cumulative</b> cardiovascular <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was 5. 2 % in patients who had a procedure-related MI, comparable to that for patients without a procedure-related MI (hazard ratio 0. 66; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 36 - 1. 20, P= 0. 17). In patients who had a spontaneous MI within 6 months, the <b>cumulative</b> cardiovascular <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was 22. 2 %, higher than for patients without a spontaneous MI (hazard ratio 4. 52; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 37 - 6. 06, P < 0. 001). These hazard ratios did not change materially after risk adjustments. Conclusions-Five-year follow-up of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome from the 3 trials showed no association between a procedure-related MI and long-term cardiovascular mortality.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} effect of long term {{antihypertensive}} treatment on prognosis in diabetic nephropathy. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of all insulin dependent diabetic patients aged under 50 with onset of diabetes {{before the age of}} 31 who developed diabetic nephropathy between 1974 and 1978 at Steno Memorial Hospital. SETTING [...] Outpatient diabetic clinic in tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS [...] Forty five patients (20 women) {{with a mean age of}} 30 (SD 7) years and a mean duration of diabetes of 18 (7) years at onset of persistent proteinuria were followed until death or for at least 10 years. INTERVENTIONS [...] Antihypertensive treatment was started a median of three (0 - 13) years after onset of nephropathy. Four patients (9 %) received no treatment, and 9 (20 %), 13 (29 %), and 19 (42 %) were treated with one, two, or three drugs, respectively. The median follow up was 12 (4 - 15) years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Arterial blood pressure and death. RESULTS [...] Mean blood pressure at start of antihypertensive treatment was 148 / 95 (15 / 50) mm Hg. Systolic blood pressure remained almost unchanged (slope - 0. 01 (95 % confidence interval - 0. 39 to 0. 37) mm Hg a year) while diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly (0. 87 (0. 65 to 1. 10) mm Hg a year) during antihypertensive treatment.

40|$|ObjectivesOur aim was {{to assess}} {{clinical}} outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) performed with the 2 commercially available valves with 3 delivery approaches selected in a stepwise fashion. BackgroundLimited data exist {{on the results of}} a comprehensive TAVI program using different valves with transfemoral, transapical, and transaxillary approaches for treatment of severe aortic stenosis. MethodsWe report 30 -day and 6 -month outcomes of high-risk patients consecutively treated in a single center with either the Medtronic-CoreValve (MCV) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) or Edwards-SAPIEN valve (ESV) (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) delivered via the transfemoral or transaxillary approaches and ESV via the transapical approach. ResultsA total of 137 patients underwent TAVI: 107 via transfemoral (46 MCV and 61 ESV), 15 via transaxillary (12 MCV and 3 ESV), and 15 via transapical approach. After the transfemoral approach, the procedural success rate was 93. 5 %, and major vascular complication rate was 20. 6 %. No intra-procedural deaths occurred. The procedural success rates of transapical and transaxillary approaches were 86. 6 % and 93. 3 %, respectively. The 30 -day mortality rate was 0. 9 % in transfemoral group and 13. 3 % in transapical, and no deaths occurred after transaxillary access. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> at 6 months was 12. 2 % in transfemoral, 26. 6 % in transapical, and 18. 2 % in transaxillary groups.

40|$|In {{the past}} two centuries, despite — or is it because of? —economic growth and {{technological}} change, life threatening risks have one by one been reduced or eliminated in the world’s richer nations (Goklany 2007). The 20 th century saw the United States ’ population multiply by four, income by seven, carbon dioxide emissions by nine, material use by 27, and chemical use by more than 100. Yet people are living longer, and healthier. Life expectancy increased from 47 years to 77 years. The disability rate for seniors declined 28 percent between 1982 and 2004 / 2005 (Manton et al. 2006) and, despite quantum improvements in diagnostic tools, major diseases (e. g., cancer, and heart and respiratory diseases) now occur 8 – 11 years later {{than a century ago}} (Fogel 2003). Such improvements are a global phenomenon. The developing world’s population suffering from chronic hunger declined from 37 percent to 17 percent between 1970 and 2001, despite an 83 percent increase in population. That, supplemented by wider knowledge about basic hygiene, greater access to safe water, sanitation, vaccines, antibiotics, pasteurization, basic health services and new medicines, helped more than double average global life expectancy from 31 years in 1900 to 67 years today. Regarding the environment, death and disease from various water related ailments were reduced dramatically. During the 20 th century, partly due to chlorination, <b>cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> from typhoid, paratyphoid, dysentery and various gastrointestinal diseases dropped 99. 5 percent in the US. Malaria dropped 99 percent because of DDT spraying, better nutrition and draining of wetlands. Similarly, air quality in richer countries has improved steadily. Outdoor particulate matter and sulfur dioxide concentrations in US urban areas peaked in the 1960 s or earlier, while indoor concentrations—more relevant from the public health perspective because people {{spend most of their time}} indoors—have been improving since at least the 1940 s. In developing countries, however, many environmental indicators are deteriorating, but their performance is ahead of developed countries at equivalent levels of development largely due to globalization o...|$|E
40|$|Aim. Considerable {{controversy}} surrounds mortality from non-neoplastic diseases {{during the}} postoperative follow-up {{of patients with}} {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the incidence of mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory (CVR) causes in patients with COPD submitted to follow-up after lung resection for NSCLC, and identified preoperative and postoperative risk factors. Methods. A total of 398 patients with mild or moderate COPD were followed up in our department after lung resection for NSCLC (median follow-up 61 months). Statistical analysis of the data was carried out to determine the incidence and the prognostic factors of postoperative death from CVR causes. Results. Of the 398 resected patients, 186 survived without tumor recurrence; 24 / 186 (12. 9 %) died of CVR causes (acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute pulmonary edema, acute myocardial ischemia or stroke). These 24 patients had a higher frequency of pre-existing coronary artery disease or heart failure (P= 0. 0003), predicted postoperative FEV 1 < 1000 mL (P= 0. 0008), exertional dyspnea (P= 0. 0000), and 30 -day operative cardiopulmonary complications (P= 0. 001). Protective features were young age (< 40 years), early stage disease, and minor resection (lobectomy). Independently significant adverse prognostic factors were stage III-IV disease (<b>cumulative</b> CVR <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> 47 % at 5 - 10 years; P= 0. 028 vs. stage I-II) and completion pneumonectomy or partial resection of the other lung for a second primary tumor (<b>cumulative</b> CVR <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> 50 % and 57 %, respectively, at 5 - 10 years; P= 0. 0016 vs. all other resections). Older age and tumor histology were significant risk factors only in patients with advanced stage disease. Conclusion. The findings suggest that postoperative CVR death maybe expected in patients with COPD and advanced stage NSCLC or in those undergoing completion pneumonectomy or partial resection of the other lung for a second primary tumor. Other risk factors are previous coronary artery disease and/or heart failure, exertional dyspnea and predicted postoperative FEV 1 < 1000 mL...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} was to assess in patients with type 2 diabetes and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) whether the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events varied {{according to the presence}} or absence of angina and angina equivalent symptoms. BackgroundData on the prognostic value of symptoms in these patients are limited. MethodsPost-hoc analysis was performed in 2, 364 patients with type 2 diabetes and documented CAD enrolled in the BARI 2 D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) trial to determine the occurrence of death and composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke during a 5 -year follow-up according to cardiac symptoms at baseline. ResultsThere were 1, 434 patients with angina (A), 506 with angina equivalents (E), and 424 with neither of these (N). The <b>cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> (total 316) were 12 % in A, 14 % in E, and 10 % in N (p = 0. 3), and cardiovascular composite rates (total 548) were 24 % in A, 24 % in E, and 21 % in N (p = 0. 5). Compared with N, the hazard ratios adjusted for confounders were not different for death in A (1. 11; 99 % CI: 0. 81 to 1. 53) and E (1. 17; 99 % CI: 0. 81 to 1. 68) or for cardiovascular events in A (1. 17; 99 % CI: 0. 92 to 1. 50) and E (1. 11; 99 % CI: 0. 84 to 1. 48). ConclusionsWhatever their symptom status, patients with type 2 diabetes and stable CAD were at similar risk of cardiovascular events and death. These findings suggest that these patients may be similarly managed in terms of risk stratification and preventive therapies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Experimental studies {{support the}} anti-neoplastic effect of apo(a), but several {{clinical}} {{studies have reported}} contradictory results. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a low lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ] concentration is related to mortality from major causes of death, especially cancer. METHODS: The subjects were 10, 413 participants (4, 005 men and 6, 408 women) from a multi-center population-based cohort study in Japan (The Jichi Medical School cohort study). The average age at registration was 55. 0 years, and the median observation period was 4, 559 days. As the estimated hazard ratio was high for both the low and very high Lp(a) levels, we defined two Lp(a) groups: a low Lp(a) group [Lp(a) < 80 mg/L] and an intermediate-to-high Lp(a) group [Lp(a) ≥ 80]. Participants who died from malignant neoplasms (n = 316), cardiovascular disease (202), or other causes (312) during the observation period were examined. RESULTS: Cumulative incidence plots showed higher <b>cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> for the low Lp(a) group than for the intermediate-to-high Lp(a) group for all-cause, cancer, and miscellaneous-cause deaths (p< 0. 001, p = 0. 03, and p = 0. 03, respectively). Cox proportional hazards analyses with the sex and age of the participants, body mass index, and smoking and drinking histories as covariates showed that a low Lp(a) level was a significant risk for all-cause, cancer, and miscellaneous-cause deaths (p< 0. 001, p = 0. 003, and p = 0. 01, respectively). The hazard ratio (95 % CI) [1. 48, 1. 15 - 1. 92] of a low Lp(a) level for cancer deaths was almost the same as that for a male sex (1. 46, 1. 00 - 2. 13). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to describe the association between a low Lp(a) level and all-cause or cancer death, supporting the anti-neoplastic effect of Lp(a).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} {{recovering from}} an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), {{it is not}} clear whether the negative impact of stent thrombosis (ST) is different from a non-stent-related recurrent myocardial infarction (NSRMI). This study sought to assess the long-term incidence and prognostic impact of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI by comparing outcomes of ST versus NSRMI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2001 to 2007, 1025 patients undergoing PCI for STEMI were prospectively followed up. Patients with ST, with NSRMI, and those free from recurrent MI were compared regarding mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). RESULTS: Recurrent MI decreased from 37 events per 1000 person/months in the first month to 3. 3 events per 1000 person/months after the first year. The cumulative 5 ‑year incidence of ST and NSRMI was 5. 27 [*]% and 13. 2 [*]%, respectively. MACCE at 60 months after recurrence were not significantly different for patients with reinfarction but were significantly higher than for patients free from any recurrent MI (both log-rank p < 0. 001). However, the <b>cumulative</b> all-cause <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> did not differ between the three groups (27. 8 vs. 26. 7 vs. 23. 0 [*]%). Compared with ST occurring in the first 30 days after PCI for STEMI, early NSRMI was associated with a significantly reduced risk for all-cause death (HR, 0. 21; 95 [*]% CI, 0. 33 - 3. 30) but this association did not persist for recurrent MIs occurring in the late (HR, 1. 05; 95 [*]% CI, 0. 33 - 3. 30) or very late follow-up periods. CONCLUSION: Although ST was associated with a significant increase in adverse events in the early recovery period, in the long term, MACCE and all-cause mortality rates were comparable to those for NSRMI...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{efficacy}} of a rural community-based integrated intervention for early prevention and management of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in China. This 18 -year cluster-randomized controlled trial encompassing 15 villages included 1008 patients (454 men and 40 women in the intervention group [mean age, 54 ± 10 years]; 482 men and 32 women in the control group [mean age, 53 ± 10 years]) with confirmed COPD or at risk for COPD. Villages were randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group, and study participants residing within the villages received treatment accordingly. Intervention group patients took part in a program that included systematic health education, smoking cessation counseling, and education on management of COPD. Control group patients received usual care. The groups were compared after 18 years regarding the incidence of COPD, decline in lung function, and mortality of COPD. COPD incidence was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (10 % vs 16 %, < 0. 05). A decline in lung function was also significantly delayed in the intervention group compared to the control group of COPD and high-risk patients. The intervention group showed significant improvement in smoking cessation compared with the control group, and smokers in the intervention group had lower smoking indices than in the control group (350 vs 450, < 0. 05).

40|$|Forty-five {{patients}} with symptomatic (20 with transient ischemic attack, 25 with minor stroke) > 75 % stenosis of the cervical {{internal carotid artery}} had no endarterectomy and received only medical therapy because the surgical risks (severe cardiac disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension or diabetes with systemic complications, aortic aneurysm) {{were believed to be}} unaccept-able. During follow-up (mean 48 months), occlusion of the internal carotid artery developed without symptoms in two patients and with symptoms in three patients. The <b>cumulative</b> stroke and/or <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was 24 % at 2 years and 50 % at 6 years.

40|$|Aim: A complex {{interaction}} between several factors may influence {{and explain the}} variance in outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The overall aim of this thesis was to explore, in individuals with severe TBI, the impact of posttraumatic hypopituitarism (PTHP), a history of unemployment or sick leave, and care pathways on long-term global outcome. Further, to investigate short- and long-term all-cause mortality after severe TBI. Methods: The studies reported in this thesis included a total of 280 participants with severe TBI. In study I and II, a retrospective follow-up was performed of 51 consecutive individuals, age 16 – 65 years, who were admitted with severe TBI to Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, from 1999 to 2002. The impact of PTHP and of unemployment or sick leave before injury on functioning and health related quality of life (HRQL) was explored. Data {{from the time of}} injury were combined into a validated prognostic model to adjust for injury severity. Outcome was measured once, 2 - 11 years after trauma, and included hormonal testing, the Short Form- 36 Health Survey, the Glasgow Outcome Scale –Extended (GOSE), and a self-report questionnaire specifically designed for these studies. Data on sick leave and unemployment were gathered from the Swedish social insurance agency. Study III was a multi-centre, prospective, observational study of 114 individuals, age 18 - 65 years, with severe TBI from six neurosurgical centers in Sweden and Iceland, with a follow up one year after the injury. The study assessed the relationship between care pathways (length of stay in intensive care, time between intensive care discharge and rehabilitation admission), and global outcome (GOSE). A validated prognostic model was used to adjust for injury severity. In study IV, a comparison of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and causes of death between 166 individuals admitted to Sahlgrenska and a community control group, was conducted retrospectively at 10 years after the severe TBI. The data was ascertained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare register. Results: A history of sick leave or unemployment before severe TBI was found to predict a worse long-term global outcome, more problems with activities of daily living and reduced HRQL at follow-up. A higher body mass index and overweight at follow-up was partially explained by PTHP. Otherwise no significant correlation was found between PTHP, functioning and HRQL. A longer length of stay in intensive care, and longer time between discharge from intensive care and admission to inpatient rehabilitation, were both associated with a worse global outcome at one year after injury. The risk of death was increased from a variety of causes for at least 10 years after severe TBI. Conclusion: The participants with severe TBI reported lasting disability, and low HRQL, with a complex range of physical, cognitive, behavioral and emotional disturbance. This may increase risk for secondary medical morbidity and explain the increased risk of death for many years after the injury. The results of the studies should be considered when refining long-term outcome predictions and optimizing rehabilitation interventions (prevention, surveillance and treatment) and care pathways after severe TBI. These findings highlight the need to provide special interventions for individuals with a history of unemployment or sick leave before severe TBI and they indicate that screening for PTHP might be warranted to specific subgroups such as overweight individuals. Measures to establish well-timed rehabilitation admission may improve outcomes after severe TBI...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{present the}} 5 -year {{clinical}} outcomes according to treatment strategy with additional risk stratification of the ICTUS (Invasive versus Conservative Treatment in Unstable coronary Syndromes) trial. BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes may {{be relevant to}} decide treatment strategy for patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) and elevated troponin T. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1, 200 patients to an early invasive or selective invasive strategy. The outcomes were the composite of death or myocardial infarction (MI) and its individual components. Risk stratification was performed with the FRISC (Fast Revascularization in InStability in Coronary artery disease) risk score. RESULTS: At 5 -year follow-up, revascularization rates were 81 % in the early invasive and 60 % in the selective invasive group. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>death</b> or MI <b>rates</b> were 22. 3 % and 18. 1 %, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 29, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 00 to 1. 66, p = 0. 053).

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{present the}} 5 -year {{clinical}} outcomes according to treatment strategy with additional risk stratification of the ICTUS (Invasive versus Conservative Treatment in Unstable coronary Syndromes) trial. BackgroundLong-term outcomes may {{be relevant to}} decide treatment strategy for patients presenting with non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) and elevated troponin T. MethodsWe randomly assigned 1, 200 patients to an early invasive or selective invasive strategy. The outcomes were the composite of death or myocardial infarction (MI) and its individual components. Risk stratification was performed with the FRISC (Fast Revascularization in InStability in Coronary artery disease) risk score. ResultsAt 5 -year follow-up, revascularization rates were 81 % in the early invasive and 60 % in the selective invasive group. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>death</b> or MI <b>rates</b> were 22. 3 % and 18. 1 %, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 29, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 00 to 1. 66, p = 0. 053). No difference was observed in mortality (HR: 1. 13, 95 % CI: 0. 80 to 1. 60, p = 0. 49) or MI (HR: 1. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 90 to 1. 70, p = 0. 20).

40|$|Abstract Background Non-pharmaceutical {{interventions}} (NPI) are {{the first}} line of defense against pandemic influenza. These interventions dampen virus spread by reducing contact between infected and susceptible persons. Because they curtail essential societal activities, they must be applied judiciously. Optimal control theory is an approach for modeling and balancing competing objectives such as epidemic spread and NPI cost. Methods We apply optimal control on an epidemiologic compartmental model to develop triggers for NPI implementation. The objective is to minimize expected person-days lost from influenza related deaths and NPI implementations for the model. We perform a multivariate sensitivity analysis based on Latin Hypercube Sampling to study the effects of input parameters on the optimal control policy. Additional studies investigated the effects of departures from the modeling assumptions, including exponential terminal time and linear NPI implementation cost. Results An optimal policy is derived for the control model using a linear NPI implementation cost. Linear cost leads to a "bang-bang" policy in which NPIs are applied at maximum strength when certain state criteria are met. Multivariate sensitivity analyses are presented which indicate that NPI cost, <b>death</b> <b>rate,</b> and recovery rate are influential in determining the policy structure. Further <b>death</b> <b>rate,</b> basic reproductive number and recovery rate are the most influential in determining the expected <b>cumulative</b> <b>death.</b> When applying the NPI policy, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>deaths</b> under exponential and gamma terminal times are close, which implies that the outcome of applying the "bang-bang" policy is insensitive to the exponential assumption. Quadratic cost leads to a multi-level policy in which NPIs are applied at varying strength levels, again based on certain state criteria. Results indicate that linear cost leads to more costly implementation resulting in fewer deaths. Conclusions The application of optimal control theory can provide valuable insight to developing effective control strategies for pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of establishing a sensitive and timely surveillance system for pandemic preparedness. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Carotid artery stenting is {{now used}} as an {{alternative}} to surgical endarterectomy. This study was done to assess the feasibility, safety, and immediate and late clinical outcomes in patients undergoing carotid stenting. Methods: Between July 2008 and December 2009, a total of 40 patients (20 male, mean age: 65 ± 11 years, 19 symptomatic, and 90 % high risk for endarterectomy) underwent carotid artery stenting with different embolic protection devices and carotid stents. Thirty-seven patients had coronary artery disease. Technical success rate, stroke/death / myocardial infarction rate at 30 days, access-site complications, and contrast-induced nephropathy were assessed. For the evaluation of the influence of experience in carotid artery stenting on complications, the patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 included the first 20 treated patients and Group 2 comprised the remainder of the patients. Results: The overall technical success rate was 100 %. The <b>cumulative</b> in-hospital stroke <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was 7. 5 % (n = 3 : 2 deaths and 1 major stroke). Complications were more frequent in Group 1 (2 / 20, 10 %; 2 deaths) than in Group 2 (1 / 20, 5 %; 1 major stroke), but this was not statistically significant (p value = 0. 09). No access-site complications occurred, and mild contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 3 patients (7. 5 %). No major stroke or neurological deaths occurred during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Conclusion: Carotid stenting seemed feasible and relatively safe in our experience. Advanced experience in carotid arter...|$|R

Based upon data from 93 hospitals and 205, 000 admissions, we used a multiple regression model to adjust the hospitals crude <b>death</b> <b>rate.</b> The adjustment process used age, origin of patient from the emergency department or nursing home, and a hospital case mix index based on DRGs (diagnostic related groups). Before adjustment, hospital <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 0. 3 to 5. 8 per 100 admissions. After adjustment, hospital death ratios ranged from 0. 36 to 1. 36 per 100 (actual <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> divided by predicted <b>death</b> <b>rate).</b> Eleven hospitals (12 per cent) were identified where the actual <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> exceeded the predicted <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> by more than two standard deviations. In nine hospitals (10 per cent), the predicted <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> exceeded the actual <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> by a similar statistical margin.
