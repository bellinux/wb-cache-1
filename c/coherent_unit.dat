40|$|The {{definition}} of <b>coherent</b> derived <b>units</b> in the International System of Units (SI) is reviewed, {{and the important}} role of the equations defining physical quantities is emphasized in obtaining <b>coherent</b> derived <b>units.</b> In the case of the dimensionless quantity plane angle, the choice between alternative definitions is considered, leading to a corresponding choice between alternative definitions of the <b>coherent</b> derived <b>unit</b> - the radian, degree or revolution. In this case the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) has chosen to adopt the definition that leads to the radian as the <b>coherent</b> derived <b>unit</b> in the SI. In the case of the quantity logarithmic decay (or gain), also sometimes called decrement, and sometimes called level, a similar choice of defining equation exists, leading to a corresponding choice for the <b>coherent</b> derived <b>unit</b> - the neper or the bel. In this case the CGPM has not yet made a choice. We argue that for the quantity logarithmic decay the most logical choice of defining equation is linked to that of the radian, and is that which leads to the neper as the corresponding <b>coherent</b> derived <b>unit.</b> This should not prevent us from using the bel and decibel as units of logarithmic decay. However, it {{is an important part of}} the SI to establish in a formal sense the equations defining physical quantities, and the corresponding <b>coherent</b> derived <b>units.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Archaeologists and {{anthropologists have}} long {{recognized}} that different cultural complexes may have distinct descent histories, {{but they have}} lacked analytical techniques capable of easily identifying such incongruence. Here, we show how Bayesian phylogenetic analysis {{can be used to}} identify incongruent cultural histories. We employ the approach to investigate Iranian tribal textile traditions. Methods: We used Bayes factor comparisons in a phylogenetic framework to test two models of cultural evolution: the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis and the multiple <b>coherent</b> <b>units</b> hypothesis. In the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis, a core tradition of characters evolves through descent with modification and characters peripheral to the core are exchanged among contemporaneous populations. In the multiple <b>coherent</b> <b>units</b> hypothesis, a core tradition does not exist. Rather, there are several cultural units consisting of sets of characters that have different histories of descent. Results: For the Iranian textiles, the Bayesian phylogenetic analyses supported the multiple <b>coherent</b> <b>units</b> hypothesis over the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis. Our analyses suggest that pile-weave designs represent a distinct cultural unit that has a different phylogenetic history compared to other textile characters. Conclusions: The results from the Iranian textiles are consistent with the available ethnographic evidence, which suggests that the commercial rug market has influenced pile-rug designs but not the techniques or designs incorporated in the othe...|$|R
