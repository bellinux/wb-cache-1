METHODS: Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), 251 eligible respondents were identified for which cataract surgery was the last surgical procedure. The ROCS of ten countries were compared using logistic regression. The influence of the public expenditure on health as per cent of the total expenditure on health, of the number of acute care beds per 1, 000 population, and of the number of practicing physicians per 1, 000 population, was studied by multiple logistic regression. Additional information was obtained from <b>country-specific</b> <b>opinion</b> leaders in the field of cataract surgery. RESULTS: The ROCS differed significantly between the ten analysed European countries where Denmark had the highest (100 %) and Austria the lowest (0 %) rate of day care surgery. A decrease in the density of acute care beds (p < 0. 0000001) and in the density of practicing physicians (p < 0. 05) and an increase in the public expenditure on health as per cent of the total health expenditure (p < 0. 01) lead to an increase in the ROCS. According to the opinion leaders, regulations and financial incentives also have a strong influence on the ROCS. CONCLUSIONS: The outpatient rate of cataract surgery in the ten European countries was mainly influenced by the acute-care beds density, but also by the density of practicing physicians, and by the public expenditure on health...|$|E
40|$|Language Policy (LP) with {{language}} planning as its implementation {{is now a}} well-established field; yet, {{as evidenced by the}} scarcity of scholarly literature, seldom concerned with personal names. The paper looks at personal names (given names and surnames) and discusses {{the ways in which they}} can be perceived as objects of minority LP. Policies regarding personal names are analysed within the framework of the traditional division of language planning into status, corpus and acquisition planning. These policies are then further examined according to other dimensions: what the object of a LP is, who its agent is, what motivates a LP, what effects it exerts, and how a LP is carried out. Finally, the paper looks at EU minority legislation with reference to personal names,especially at the <b>country-specific</b> <b>opinions</b> which reflect the FCNM monitoring process, highlighting areas of controversy. In conclusion, it is shown how vital personal names are to personal and group identity and, consequently, how control over them helps the nation-state control a minority, although – it is argued – not every regulation constitutes a minority LP...|$|R
