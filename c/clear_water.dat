5|$|Eddy Creek has no named tributaries. However, a 1916 book {{stated that}} several small streams {{discharged}} into the creek in its upper reaches. At the time, these streams had <b>clear</b> <b>water,</b> but were {{dry in the}} summer.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from <b>clear</b> <b>water</b> habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E
5|$|Synchronous {{spawning}} is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn {{on the same}} night. This synchrony is essential so male and female gametes can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve temperature change, lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The spawning event can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually <b>clear</b> <b>water</b> with gametes.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} again appealed, {{this time to}} the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lord Templeman, Lord Goff, Lord Jauncey, Lord Lowry and Lord Woolf. The {{judgment}} was given by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993, and reinstated the decision of Kennedy J in the High Court of Justice; unlike the Court of Appeal decision, it directly {{addressed the issue of}} Rylands v Fletcher. Goff first addressed the Court of Appeal's use of Ballard v Tomlinson, stating that the decision there as based on the facts of the case, and did not establish either a rule that there was a right to <b>clear</b> <b>water,</b> nor that there was strict liability attached to that right.|$|E
5|$|Chavundaraya II, a Shaiva Brahmin (Brahmin {{devotee of}} the god Shiva) by faith and a protege of King Jayasimha II, wrote Lokopakara (c.1025) in the champu metre. It is the {{earliest}} available encyclopaedia in the Kannada language, written at times with a poetic touch. It comprises twelve chapters and has found popularity in later references as well. The work is on various topics such as daily life, astronomy, astrology and forecasting of events based on the Indian calendar (panchanga phala), sculpture, construction of buildings (vastu vichara) and reservoirs (udakargala), omens, divination of water, preparation of medicine from herbs and plants (vrikshayurveda), general medicine (vaidya), perfumery, cookery and toxicology (vishavaidya). Mentioned in this book is the popular South Indian dish Idli and its preparation by soaking Urad dal (black gram) in butter milk, grinding it to a fine paste, and mixing with spices and the <b>clear</b> <b>water</b> of curd.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{relatively}} shallow water {{in which she}} sank, the majority of bodies could not be recovered from Royal Oak. Marked by a buoy at , the wreck has been designated a war grave and all diving or other unauthorised forms of exploration are prohibited under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. In <b>clear</b> <b>water</b> conditions, the upturned hull can be seen reaching to within 5m of the surface. The brass letters that formed Royal Oaks name were removed as a keepsake by a recreational diver in the 1970s. They were returned almost twenty years later, and are now displayed in the Scapa Flow visitor centre in Lyness. Royal Oaks loss is commemorated in an annual ceremony in which Royal Navy divers place the White Ensign underwater at her stern.|$|E

5|$|On the east, {{the first}} {{impression}} is all of rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, cutting off a series of hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the south east of Nethermost Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove. Surrounded by crag on three sides, this corrie contains Hard Tarn, a small pool on a rock shelf. This {{is one of the}} most difficult mountain tarns to locate, and its black algal bed and <b>clear</b> <b>water</b> combine to give the false impression of great depth. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrial activity, with the remains of several underground mines and some shallow open workings visible near the Lodge.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with several scenes interspersing, {{starting}} with Carey underwater, while holding onto a dolphins fin, {{as well as}} Carey lying on a beach at night in a bikini. As the song's introduction plays, scenes of the Hawaii beaches are shown, as well as close-up glimpses of T.I. Carey then is shown inside a small cabana, singing to the camera and enjoying herself at a small party. Similar scenes of Carey in a gold bikini are shown, {{as well as more}} scenes of Hawaiian landscape. By the second verse, Carey, now in a black bikini, is shown {{at the bottom of a}} ravine by the beach staring at the sun, then altering to scenes of the party once more. As T.I.'s verse starts, he's shown behind a waterfall, in the midst of shrubbery outside, where Mariah then appears sitting in a large body of <b>clear</b> <b>water</b> with golden sand. She then lies in the water, as the scene then switches to her underwater with the dolphin again.|$|E
5|$|The {{species can}} hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp {{eyesight}} to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, {{a result of}} group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter, such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman. The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in <b>clear</b> <b>water.</b> Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Yellowstone {{experiences}} {{thousands of}} small earthquakes every year, virtually {{all of which are}} undetectable to people. There have been six earthquakes with at least magnitude 6 or greater in historical times, including the 7.5‑magnitude Hebgen Lake earthquake which occurred just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge landslide, which caused a partial dam collapse on Hebgen Lake; immediately downstream, the sediment from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as Earthquake Lake. Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs that normally have <b>clear</b> <b>water</b> turned muddy. A 6.1‑magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal.|$|E
