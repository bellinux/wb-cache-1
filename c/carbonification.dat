When concentrated sulfuric acid comes {{into contact with}} sucrose, slow <b>carbonification</b> of the sucrose takes place. The reaction is accompanied by the evolution of gaseous products {{that contribute to the}} formation of the foamy carbon pillar that rises above the beaker.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{microscopic}} algae dominate in source material {{of organic matter}} of black shales, and admixture of residues of organisms and terrestrial humic material is contained. The main direction of source material transformation during syngenesis and sedimentogenesis is associated with jellofication resulting to formation of organic matter of significantly sapropelic type. Low reflectance of vitrinite and alginite from organic matter refer to the primary and secondary lignite stages of its <b>carbonification.</b> Significantly sapropel type of organic matter and low stage of <b>carbonification</b> are reliable criteria for assigning black shales to the category of potential oil source strata...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSearching {{for some}} {{reliable}} evidences that can verify the <b>carbonification</b> of organic matters in marine shales {{is a major}} scientific issue in selecting shale gas fairways in old strata. To this end, based on core, logging and testing data, the electric property of two organic-rich shale layers in the Lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi Fm. and the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Fm. in the southern Sichuan Basin was compared to examine the <b>carbonification</b> signs of organic matters in the Qiongzhusi shale and its influence on gas occurrence in the shales. The following conclusions were reached: (1) the electric property experiment shows that the Qiongzhusi shale {{in the study area}} has had <b>carbonification</b> of organic matters. The low resistivity of dry samples from this highly mature organic-rich shale and ultra-low resistivity on downhole logs can be used to directly judge the degree of organic matter <b>carbonification</b> and the quality of source rocks; (2) in the Changning area, the Qiongzhusi shale shows low resistivity of dry samples and low to ultra-low resistivity on logs, indicating that organic matters are seriously carbonized, while in the Weiyuan area, the Qiongzhusi shale shows a basically normal resistivity on log curves, indicating its degree of graphitization between the Longmaxi Fm. and Qiongzhusi Fm. in the Changning area; (3) shale with medium-to-high resistivity is remarkably better than that with ultra-low resistivity in terms of gas generation potential, matrix porosity and gas adsorption capacity; (4) industrial gas flow has been tested in the organic shales with medium-to-high resistivity in the Jianwei–Weiyuan–Tongnan area in the north, where the Qiongzhusi shale is a favorable shale gas exploration target...|$|E
40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the general {{characteristics}} of lignite and its definitions as a material system. Lignite represents geologically the youngest type of coal, and belongs to kaustobiolites, which are masses {{with varying degrees of}} <b>carbonification</b> of the original phytomass. The degree of <b>carbonification</b> is roughly between peat and brown coal. Particular attention was paid to the application of lignite as a cheaper and more versatile sorbent to replace activated carbon and for the use of sorption of biologically active substances in biotechnology. The specific structure and composition give the lignite the natural sorption capability. In model experiments, polyphenols were used as significant microbial inhibitors for which lignite had a high sorption and for glucose, which lignite practically did not absorb. A model experiment was carried out with a hydrolyzate of a corn biomass, where the lignite showed optimal sorption...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolation}} of saturated hydrocarbons from free bitumen coal {{and also from}} bound bitumen coal {{in the region of}} Kosovo is descriled in this study. n-Alkanes from C 17 -C 21 to C 33 -C 35, with A 7 -C 29 being dominant, were identified by gaschromatographic analysis of the free bitumen. This distribution indicated the terrestrial origin of the coals and a low level of <b>carbonification.</b> The decreasing values of the CPI of the bound bitumen (1. 08 - 2. 77), composed to the CPI values of the free bitumen (2, 04 - 3, 90) and a shift of the dominant n-alkane (A 7 -C 29 -> A 7 -C 23) are a result of the higher "maturity" level of the n-alkanes in bound bitumen...|$|E
40|$|Creating a {{mechanism}} for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) in tropical developing countries has become, from 2005 onward, a central element in international climate protection discourse. The {{goal is to create}} financial incentives for forest protection by making avoided deforestation a tradable good that can be sold on the carbon market or to government funds. A discourse-analytical perspective on the process of commodification and market creation is developed in order to assess how avoided deforestation is being made tradable. Going beyond existing approaches, such a perspective enables us to highlight the contestedness and contingency of the commodification and market creation process. The extent to which on-going qualification and commensuration practices can result in a disentanglement of avoided deforestation as tradable good is discussed, and one of the consequences of a successful commodification of avoiding deforestation - the <b>carbonification</b> of forests is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the effects of low energy ion {{implantation}} (N and Ne) in the reduction and control of the degradation of pentacene organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) due to the exposure to atmosphere (i. e. oxygen and water). We have observed that a controlled damage depth distribution preserves the functionality of the devices, even if ion implantation induces significant molecular structure modifications, in particular a combination of dehydrogenation and <b>carbonification</b> effects. No relevant changes in the pentacene thin film thickness have been observed. The two major transport parameters that characterize OTFT performance are the carrier mobility and the threshold voltage. We have monitored the effectiveness of this process in stabilizing the device by monitoring the carrier mobility and the threshold voltage over a long time (over 2000 h). Finally, we have assessed by depth resolved X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy analyses that, by selectively implanting with ions that can react with the hydrocarbon matrix (e. g. N- 1), it is possible to locally modify the charge distribution within the organic layer...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} high {{resolution}} electron microscopy (dark field and lattice-fringe images) to describe short range order either in natural or synthetic chars, {{as well as}} long range order occurring during graphitization process. The chars contain stacks of 2 to 3 aromatic layers 3. 4 A to more than 8 A apart, with diameters from 5 to 8 A. Heat treatment leads for hard-carbons to a foam where crystallite growth is prevented by the geometry of the pore walls. On the contrary, graphitization occurs in carbons where parallel stacking is developed in large regions. In a natural environment organic matter included in sediments is progressively degraded by the combined action of pressure and temperature established during geological times. In the same way, organic matter heat-treated until 1, 000 °C in the laboratory is progressively degraded too. The last limit of either experimental transformations (carbonization) or natural ones (<b>carbonification)</b> is an almost pure carbon solid (coke) which may eventually be progressively transformed into graphite (soft carbons) when heat-treated until 3, 000 °C (graphitization). Any way, most of these cokes remain very far from the crystalline state (hard carbons) {{even when they are}} heat-treated until 3, 000 °C. At the beginning of their degradation, all these above defined natural or syntheti...|$|E
40|$|Vegetal remains are {{considered}} labile structures that quickly become decayed in ecosystems. However, certain lignified tissues (woody plants) can largely resist decomposition, becoming sometimes exceptionally well preserved. At the Upper Cretaceous site of ?Lo Hueco? (Cuenca, Spain), those woody remains (trunks and branches) with resinous {{material in the}} inner tracheids and parenchyma cells that were buried rapidly under anoxic conditions experienced a low degree of maturation, becoming exceptionally well preserved. Those woody remains deposited under oxic conditions (subaerial or sub-aquatic exposure) were more intensely biodegraded and subsequently carbonified, partially or completely mineralized in gypsum and covered by a ferruginous crust. These two modes of preservation are scarce, with silicification or <b>carbonification</b> processes much more common, and both {{can be considered as}} ?exceptional preservation?. Other vegetal remains, such as carbonified leaves, stems and roots, were collected in the site. The different modes of preservation depend directly on: depositional micro-environment (sandy distributary channel, muddy flood plain); and type (trunk, branch, stem, leave, root) and state (presence or absence of resinous material) of the material. The great abundance and diversity of fossils in ?Lo Hueco? identify it as Konzentrat-Lagersta¿tten, sequentially formed by alternated events of flooding and drying depositional events, but the exceptional quality and rarity of determinate vegetal macroremains preservation suggest that certain deposits of this site can be considered as conservation deposits...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Scalp and calvarial defects {{may result}} from trauma, thermal or {{electrical}} burns, resection of benign or malignant tumors, infections or radionecrosis. Reconstruction of large scalp defects is a demanding procedure. The reconstructive ‘‘ladder’’ are applicable to scalp and calvarial defects reconstruction. Case Outline. A 68 -year-old female was admitted to our clinic due to the nine-day old scalp burn wound, incurred under unclear circumstances. Third degree burn wound affected the left frontal-parietal, temporal {{and part of the}} occipital region with <b>carbonification</b> of the whole left ear lobe. The treatment was carried out in two stages. Radical full thickness necrectomy of the scalp was performed, the defect margins were curetted to the active bleeding, and the ear lobe was amputated. The defect sized 23 x 15 cm was reconstructed using the “banana peel” transposition galea-cutaneous flap from the remainder of the scalp, which was based only on the right occipital artery. Two months after the surgery the appearance was satisfactory, and all wounds were healed. Conclusion. Designing of large-scale flaps is very hazardous, especially in elderly people. Scalp reconstruction based on one artery has to be planned in detail and performed when the possibility of complication is reduced to minimum. Our case report underlines possible reconstruction as delayed procedure even with the exposed bone (second look procedure), as well as the reconstruction of half scalp with the local flap based on one pericranial artery.
