40|$|AbstractBackground and Aim: Using <b>cervical</b> <b>collars</b> {{is one of}} the {{treatment}} methods for releaving cervical pain. The effect of limb orthotics on proprioception and postural stability has been suggested. There is not sufficient studies about the effect of <b>cervical</b> <b>collars</b> on static and dynamic stability, and the effect of soft and hard collars have not been compared with one another. The objective of this study is investigating and comparing the immediate effect of soft and hard <b>cervical</b> <b>collars</b> on static postural stability in healthy young subjects. Methods & Materials: In standing position on firm surface with closed eyes, both soft and hard collars decreased the stability and there was not any significant difference among collars. In standing positions on soft surface with closed and opened eyes, using none of the soft and hard collars did not change the stability. This quasi experimental study through repeated measure method has been conducted on 65 healthy young male and female college students. Static stability was evaluated by modified Clinical Test for Sensory Interaction and Balance (CTSIB) in conditions without collar and by soft and hard <b>cervical</b> <b>collars</b> and were compared between the conditions. Results: Conclusion: Our results suggest that in static conditions, without vision, both collars decrease the stability in healthy young subjects. So considering the evaluation of stability and prevention of balance disturbance during the collar prescription seems to be necessary...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to compare four types of <b>cervical</b> <b>collars</b> regarding efficacy of immobilizing the neck, effect on jugular venous pressure (JVP), as a surrogate for possible effect on intracranial pressure, and patient comfort in healthy volunteers. The characteristics of four widely used <b>cervical</b> <b>collars</b> (Laerdal Stifneck(®) (SN), Vista(®) (VI), Miami J Advanced(®) (MJ), Philadelphia(®) (PH)) were studied in ten volunteers. Neck movement was measured with goniometry, JVP was measured directly through an endovascular catheter and participants graded the collars according to comfort on a scale 1 - 5. The mean age of participants was 27 ± 5 yr and BMI 26 ± 5. The mean neck movement (53 ± 9 °) decreased significantly with all the collars (p MJ > SN > PH). Stifneck and Miami J collars offered the most efficient immobilization of the neck with the least effect on JVP. Vista and Miami J were the most comfortable ones. The methodology used in this study may offer a new approach to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of neck collars and aid their continued development...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cervical</b> <b>collars</b> and braces in {{athletic}} brachial plexus injury and excessive cervical motion prevention: {{a review of}} the literature Dr. Kent Stuber, BSc, DC* A review of the literature was conducted to find publications relating to neck collars / rolls and prevention of sports injury, particularly burners and other cervical spine injuries, as well as in preventing excessive motion of the cervical spine. MEDLINE (1970 – 2005), Cinahl (1982 – 2005), Alt Health Watch (1990 – 2005), AMED (1995 – 2005), and the Index to Chiropractic Literature (1985 – 2005) databases were searched. To date there has been very little documented study into the ability of cervical collars/neck rolls to prevent excessive motion of the cervical spine or to prevent injury. Neck rolls/braces are capable of limiting cervical hyperextension under laboratory conditions, but the same can not be said for their ability to limit lateral flexion. Only one empirical study could be identified that looked at the ability of a collar to prevent burners and other neck injuries in athletes. Further laboratory and on-field studies are clearly needed.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the mechanical efficacy {{of a new}} “mobilising ” cervical support device. This device has been developed {{in response to the}} requirements of whiplash patients to overcome the problems of heat and immobilisation which can occur in patients wearing conventional wrap-around <b>cervical</b> <b>collars.</b> All planes of cervical range of motion of 21 volunteer subjects without current or past cervical dysfunction were measured actively and passively under two conditions (no support and with cervical support) using the cervical range of motion (CROM) instrument. The results show that the mobilising cervical support device restricts hyperextension effectively while allowing substantial movement in other planes of motion (flexion, rotation and lateral bending). This potential mobility keeps nearly all muscles in the neck fit and problems of muscle atrophy, weakness and contraction, which can occur in patients using conventional <b>cervical</b> wrap around <b>collars,</b> can be avoided. Regarding mechanical efficacy, the mobilising cervical support device can be useful in the (early) mobilisation phase in patients needing gentle neck support after a soft tissue hyperextension or whiplash injury...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Central venous {{access is}} often {{necessary}} for the administration of fluids, blood products, and medications. Several approaches to supraclavicular subclavian venous access have been described. This study examines the effectiveness of central venous catheter placement utilizing an alternative set of anatomic landmarks for supraclavicular subclavian vein access. METHODS: This was a two phase study. The first portion involved subclavian vein cannulation using a supraclavicular approach in 28 cadavers. The specific set of anatomic landmarks for the supraclavicular approach, termed the “pocket approach,” is described. Cadavers were subsequently dissected to verify appropriate line placement. The second portion was a chart review of Emergency Department (ED) patients who underwent attempted subclavian vein catheter placement utilizing the pocket approach. Charts were extracted following education of the ED faculty and resident staff to determine: 1) Success of subclavian line placement, 2) The incidence of pneumothorax, and 3) The use of supraclavicular subclavian access in the trauma setting, during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and in patients who had <b>cervical</b> <b>collars.</b> RESULTS: In 28 cadavers, the success rate of the pocket approach was 100 % (34 / 34; 95 % CI 90 % to 100 %). Chart review of the 68 patients revealed a success rate of 90 % (61 / 68; CI 80 % to 96 %). No pneumothoraces were recorded (0 / 68; CI 0 % to 5 %). The pocket approach was used successfully in 11 patients with <b>cervical</b> <b>collars,</b> (100 %, CI 72 % to 100 %) and in 15 of 16 patients undergoing CPR (94 %, CI 70 % to 100 %). In four fresh cadavers, the average distance from the posterior subclavian vein to the subclavian artery was 0. 40 cm, and {{the dome of the}} pleura was 1. 75 cm posterior to the vein. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the supraclavicular pocket approach to subclavian vein cannulation is a useful and safe method of adult central venous catheterization, with complication and success rates comparable to more common approaches. The anatomic advantage of a great vein that is closer to the skin and farther from the pleural dome makes this an approach worthy of further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{consequences}} of spinal injury {{as a result}} of trauma can be devastating. Spinal immobilisation using hard trauma boards and rigid <b>cervical</b> <b>collars</b> has traditionally been the standard response to suspected spinal injury patients even though the risk may be extremely low. Recently, adverse events due to the method of immobilisation have challenged the need for motion restriction in all trauma patients. International guidelines have been published for protection of the spine during transport and this article brings those guidelines into the South African context. Recommendations: Trauma patients need to be properly assessed using both an approved list of high and low risk factors, as well as a thorough examination. They should then be managed accordingly. Internationally validated assessment strategies have been developed, and should be used as part of the patient assessment. The method of motion restriction should be selected to suit the situation. The use of a vacuum mattress is the preferable technique, {{with the use of a}} trauma board being the least desirable. Conclusion: The need for motion restriction in suspected spinal injury should be properly evaluated and appropriate action taken. Not all trauma patients require spinal motion restriction...|$|R
