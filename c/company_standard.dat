5|$|Ultimate {{released}} {{the game for}} the ZX Spectrum at an above-average price to combat piracy. Its premium product packaging became a <b>company</b> <b>standard.</b> The developers had finished Sabre Wulf sequels in advance of its release but—in keeping with their penchant for secrecy—chose to withhold them for marketing purposes. The sequels were swiftly released later that year. Ultimate hired outside developers to port Sabre Wulf to other computing platforms: the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC. The game was later featured in compilations including the 2015 retrospective of games by Ultimate and its successor, Rare.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the <b>company),</b> <b>Standard</b> Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E

25|$|CADET used 324 {{point-contact}} transistors {{provided by}} the UK <b>company</b> <b>Standard</b> Telephones and Cables; 76 junction transistors {{were used for the}} first stage amplifiers for data read from the drum, since point-contact transistors were too noisy. From August 1956 CADET was offering a regular computing service, during which it often executed continuous computing runs of 80 hours or more. Problems with the reliability of early batches of point contact and alloyed junction transistors meant that the machine's mean time between failures was about 90minutes, but this improved once the more reliable bipolar junction transistors became available.|$|E
25|$|Charles K. Kao and George A. Hockham of the British <b>company</b> <b>Standard</b> Telephones and Cables (STC) {{were the}} first, in 1965, {{to promote the}} idea that the {{attenuation}} in optical fibers could be reduced below 20 decibels per kilometer (dB/km), making fibers a practical communication medium. They proposed that the attenuation in fibers available at the time was caused by impurities that could be removed, rather than by fundamental physical effects such as scattering. They correctly and systematically theorized the light-loss properties for optical fiber, and pointed out the right material to use for such fibers— silica glass with high purity. This discovery earned Kao the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{importance}} of consistency, most <b>companies</b> set <b>standards</b> unifying their various restaurant locations with a set of common rules and regulations. Parent companies often rely on field representatives to ensure that the practices of franchised locations are consistent with the <b>company's</b> <b>standards.</b> However, the more locations a fast food chain has, the harder it is for the parent company to guarantee that these standards are being followed. Moreover, it is much more expensive to discharge a franchisee for noncompliance with <b>company</b> <b>standards,</b> than it is to discharge an employee for that same reason. As a consequence, parent companies tend to deal with franchisee violations in a more relaxed manner.|$|R

2500|$|While most oil {{companies}} were switching to leaded gasolines en masse during the mid-to-late 1920s, American Oil chose to continue marketing its premium-grade [...] "Amoco-Gas" [...] (later Amoco Super-Premium) as a lead-free gasoline by using aromatics rather than tetraethyllead to increase octane levels, decades before {{the environmental movement}} of the early 1970s led to more stringent auto-emission controls which ultimately mandated the universal phase out of leaded gasoline. The [...] "Amoco" [...] lead-free gasoline was sold at American's stations in the eastern and southern U.S. alongside American Regular gasoline, which was a leaded fuel. Lead-free Amoco {{was introduced in the}} Indiana Standard marketing area in 1970. The Red Crown Regular and White Crown Premium (later Gold Crown Super Premium) gasolines marketed by parent <b>company</b> <b>Standard</b> Oil (Indiana) in its prime marketing area in the Midwest before 1961 also contained lead.|$|E

In 1929, Roy Larsen was also named a Time Inc. director and vice-president. J. P. Morgan retained a certain control through two directorates and a share of stocks, both over Time and Fortune.

Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates. The firm was attacked by journalists and politicians throughout its existence, in part for these monopolistic methods, giving momentum to the antitrust movement. By 1880, according to the New York World, Standard Oil was [...] "the most cruel, impudent, pitiless, and grasping monopoly that ever fastened upon a country." [...] To the critics Flagler and Rockefeller replied, [...] "In a business so large as ours..... some things are likely to be done which we cannot approve. We correct them as soon as they come to our knowledge." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, Jersey Standard and General Motors pooled its tetraethyllead-related {{patents and}} {{established}} the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation. [...] In 1927, Jersey Standard signed a 25-years cooperation agreement with IG Farben for the coal hydrogenation {{research in the}} United States. [...] Jersey Standard assumed this cooperation to be beneficial as it believed the United States oil reserves to be exhausted {{in the near future}} and that the coal hydrogenation would give an access for producing synthetic fuels. It erected synthetic fuel plants in Bayway, Baton Rouge, and Baytown (unfinished). The interest in hydrogenation evaporated after discovery of the East Texas Oil Field. [...] As a part of the cooperation between Jersey Standard and IG Farben, a joint <b>company,</b> <b>Standard</b> I.G. Company, was established with Jersey Standard having a stake of 80%. [...] IG Farben transferred rights to the hydrogenation process outside of Germany to the joint venture in exchange of $35million stake of Jersey Standard shares. [...] In 1930, the joint company established Hydro Patents Company to license the hydrogenation process in the United States. [...] The agreement with IG Farben gave to Jersey Standard access to patents related to polyisobutylene which assist Jersey Standard to advance in isobutolene polymerization and to produce the first butyl rubber in 1937. [...] As the agreement with IG Farben gave to the German company a veto right of licensing chemical industry patents in the United States, including patent for butyl rubber, Jersey Standard was accused of treason by senator Harry S. Truman. [...] In 1941, it opened the first commercial synthetic toluene plant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second time}} came in 1871. Rockefeller had long {{believed}} that overcapacity {{in the oil}} refining business would cause a crash {{in the price of}} refined oil. Anticipating the crash, on January 10, 1870, Rockefeller and his partners established a new joint-stock <b>company,</b> <b>Standard</b> Oil. Just 10,000 shares of Standard Oil were created. John and William Rockefeller, Flagler, Harkness, and Andrews took almost all the shares. A new investor, Oliver B. Jennings (William Rockefeller's brother-in-law), invested $100,000 in the new company and was given 1,000 shares. The old company of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler was given 1,000 shares as a reserve. The stock was set at a $100 per share par value ($ in [...] dollars), and Standard Oil paid a 105 percent dividend in 1870 and 1871. The overcapacity crash hit in 1871, and many refiners neared bankruptcy. In the fall of 1871, Rockefeller learned of a conspiracy being promoted by Thomas A. Scott (First Vice President of the Pennsylvania Railroad) and Peter H. Watson (then a director of the LS). On November 30, 1871, Rockefeller met with Scott and Watson at the St. Nicholas Hotel in New York City, where Scott outlined his plan: Using a vaguely-worded corporate charter he had obtained from the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, the Erie Railroad, Standard Oil, and a few small oil refining companies would create and invest in the South Improvement Company (SIC). The SIC's participating railroads would give the SIC's investor-refiners a 50 percent rebate on oil shipments, helping them to drive competitors out of business. Additionally, any time the SIC carried the oil of a non-participating refiner, the SIC would give a 40-cents-per-barrel payment ($ in [...] dollars) to the investor-refiners. The SIC would also provide the investor-refiners with information on the shipments of their competitors, giving them a critical advantage in pricing and sales.|$|E
