5|$|On 7 April 1986, {{a healthy}} hybrid kitten between a male serval {{and a female}} {{domestic}} cat was born; this kitten was larger than a typical domestic kitten and resembled its father in its coat pattern. It appeared to have inherited a few domestic traits, such as tameness, from its mother. The hybrid cat may have a doglike habit of following its owner about, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> swimmer. Over the years, savannah cats have gained popularity as pets.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{family dog}} {{while it has}} a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like {{to stay close to}} their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E

However, advances in interventions such as coiled tubing and tractors means that barefoot wells can be successfully produced.|$|E

25|$|Mushrooms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> dietary {{source of}} vitamin D2 if exposed to {{ultraviolet}} light. Mushrooms contain high concentrations of ergosterol (provitamin D2). Sunlight or ultraviolet radiation (UV) triggers conversion to viosterol (previtamin D2), which then turns into vitamin D2. Low values in mushrooms occur if {{there is little to}} no exposure to sunlight or UV light. When fresh mushrooms or dried powders are purposely exposed to artificial sunlight by use of an industrial ultraviolet lamp, vitamin D2 levels can be concentrated to much higher levels.|$|E

Similar to Western folklore, foxes {{are depicted}} as mischievous, usually tricking other people, {{with the ability to}} disguise as an attractive female human. However, there are other depictions of foxes as a mystical, sacred creature, that can either bring wonder or ruin. Nine-tailed foxes appear in Chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, in which, depending on the tale <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> or a bad omen. The motif was eventually introduced from Chinese to Japanese and Korean cultures.|$|E
25|$|The {{epipelagic zone}} is vast, {{and is the}} home for most pelagic fish. The zone is well lit so visual predators can use their eyesight, is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> habitat for algae to grow. However, it is an almost featureless habitat. This lack of habitat {{diversity}} results in a lack of species diversity, so the zone supports less than 2% of the world's known fish species. Much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish, so epipelagic fish tend {{to be found in}} coastal water above the continental shelves, where land runoff can provide nutrients, or in those parts of the ocean where upwelling moves nutrients into the area.|$|E

25|$|Reasonable {{exposure}} to ultraviolet {{radiation from the}} sun <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> source of vitamin D. One minimal erythemal dose of sunlight UV radiation provides {{the equivalent of about}} 20,000 IU of vitamin D2, taken as an oral supplement. If an adult's arms and legs are exposed to a half minimal erythemal UV radiation, it is the same as taking 3,000 IU of vitamin D3 through an oral supplement. This exposure of 10–15 minutes, on a frequency of two to three times per week will cause the adult's skin to produce enough vitamin D. It is not necessary to expose the face to the UV, as facial skin provides little vitamin D3. Individuals whose metabolism makes taking oral vitamin D ineffective are able, through {{exposure to}} an ultraviolet lamp that emits UV-B radiation, to achieve a 25 (OH) D blood level.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> citizen {{who is not a}} good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} {{screenplay}} for The Curse of the Black Pearl, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio envisioned Captain Jack Sparrow as a supporting {{character in the}} vein of Bugs Bunny and Groucho Marx. The producers saw him as a young Burt Lancaster. Director Gore Verbinski admitted, [...] "The first film was a movie, and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn't have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, {{and he kind of}} affects everybody else." [...] Sparrow represents an ethical pirate, with Captain Barbossa as his corrupt foil. His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable or evil depends on the audience's perspective. This acts as part of Will Turner's arc, in which Sparrow tells him a pirate <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man, like his father.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} not without its detractors. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's {{a measure of how}} the film {{operates}} that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims.... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did, however, describe it as [...] "the sort of nonsense that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of fun". Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that [...] "Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age.... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written." [...] Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws [...] "is eminently worth seeing for its second half", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was [...] "often flawed by its busyness". William S. Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as [...] "a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons" [...] and [...] "filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort"; Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a [...] "scare machine that works with computer-like precision.... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy". The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that [...] "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up", and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, [...] "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide stated that [...] "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster." ...|$|E

40|$|Accelerator {{control systems}} should be {{flexible}} and open for future improvements. The {{introduction of a}} field bus based I/O system <b>is</b> <b>a</b> step in this direction. At BESSY most of the accelerator devices are interfaced using the BESSY modular I/O system and the Controller Area Network (CAN), which provides excellent noise immunity and a sophisticated, reliable protocol together with low hardware costs. The rapid installation procedure of the BESSY II booster synchrotron and the experiences with the CAN installations show: <b>CAN</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> choice to achieve an easy supportable I/O system without restricting future options. Additional effort for installing a field bus based I/O level underneath a Standard Model Control System will be widely overcompensated by the robustness and flexibility of this approach. The growing market of CAN based industrial I/O with its increasing number of out-of-the-box interface solutions is yet another reason for choosing CAN for accelerator controls...|$|R
