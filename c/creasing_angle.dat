40|$|Thiolfunctionalization of Oligoglycidols: For a {{structure}} change in keratin fibres, like human hair or wool, {{it is necessary}} to cleave the disulfide bonds of the cystine residues with different reducing argents. Low molecular weight thiols are used for the cleavage of disulfide bonds. After the structure change, the new structure will be fixed by re-oxidation, e. g. with hydrogen peroxide. The result is a permanent structure change in the keratin fibre. Oligoglycidols: In this work, different microstructures of thiol functional oligoglycidols with hydrophilic and amphiphilic properties were synthesized. This is of interest for the application onto keratin fibres which contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. Polyglycidols are biocompatible [Kainthan 2006]. For the synthesis of linear oligoglycidols and to avoid branched molecules {{it is necessary to}} use protected glycidols, like ethoxy ethyl glycidyl ether (EEGE), tert. -butyl glycidyl ether (TBGE), n-butyl glycidyl ether (BGE) and 2 -ethyl hexyl glycidyl ether (2 -EHGE). Ethoxy ethyl glycidyl ether was mainly used, here. After successful polymerization and removal of the protecting groups under acidic conditions good yields were obtained. Co-Oligomers: Homopolymers obtain only one functionality which results in a limitation of their applications. Co-oligomers with various functionalized side-groups resulting in more functionalities were synthesized. For the treatment of keratin fibres, amphiphilic copolymers and co-oligomers with hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups can play an important role. Co-oligomers with less hydrophobic groups were synthesized to achieve good water solubility. For the synthesis of co-oligomers ethoxy ethyl glycidyl and n-butyl glycidyl ether were used preferentially. The acetal protective group of EEGE can easily be cleaved with hydrochloride, while the n-butyl glycidyl ether is stable under these conditions. Thiolfunctionalization: After cleavage of the protecting groups, the hydroxyl groups were functionalized by using different methods. Esterification was done by tin-(II) -catalysis, enzymatic catalysis, DCC-coupling and esterification with 3, 3 ´-dithiodipropionic acid chloride nucleophilic substitution. Another method is the esterification of gamma-thiobutyrolactone by tin-(II) -catalysis. Application to Keratin Fibres: The thiol-oligomers and thiol-co-oligomers were used in different concentrations for treatment of keratin fibres. All developed substances show good reductive effect in cleaving the disulfide bonds of keratin fibres. It is possible to change the structure of keratin fibres as confirmed in various experiments. To study the penetration of the thiol-oligomers into keratin fibres, the thiol groups of selected oligomers were treated with fluorescently marked substances in aqueous solution. The penetration depth of the labeled products into the keratin fibres was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy.

Nonetheless, I do have several questions {{in the areas of}} treatment protocols as well as evaluation of treatment effects, which are listed below: Q 1. Greater merits of the palatal mini-implants, compared with those placed on the buccal aspect of the posterior maxilla, have been previously recog-nized. It is interesting that the authors of this article chose 2 different sizes of miniscrews, one in 1. 8 mm in diameter and 6. 0 mm in length and the other in 2. 0 mm in diameter and 6. 0 mm in length, which were implanted right on the midpalatal suture as shown in Figure 2 A. Would the authors kindly provide the reasoning behind the selection of these particular dimensions of the miniscrews and their placement sites? Q 2. Failure of a midpalatal miniscrew is often asso-ciated with inflammation of its immediately sur-rounding tissue. Are there any specific regimens followed {{in order to keep the}} inflammation under control and maximize its healthy status during treat-ment? Also, if it is documented, what is the success rate of the midpalatal miniscrews used in this study? Q 3. In the headgear (HG) group the patients used high-pull HGs where straight-pull HGs could be more advantageous due to their more horizontal pos terior force vector. I am curious if there is any bio me-chanical advantage of this choice. In addition, since it is the high-pull HG that was used after all, wouldn’t it be important to evaluate its intrusive effects on the maxillary molars given that it could lead to an in <b>crease</b> in SNB <b>angle?</b> Finally, following the same logic, I feel it may be more informative to report the SNA, SNB, FMA angles separately before and after the treatment instead of just changes in effective ANB angles...|$|R
