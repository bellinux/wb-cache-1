40|$|More than 150 {{years into}} {{development}} {{of the doctrine of}} "fair use" in American copyright law, there is no end to legislative, judicial, and academic efforts to rationalize the doctrine. Its codification in the 1976 Copyright Act appears to have contributed to its fragmentation, rather than to its <b>coherence.</b> This <b>Article</b> suggests that fair use is neither badly conceived nor badly applied, but that it is too often badly understood. As did much of copyright law, fair use originated as a judicially-unacknowledged effort via the law to validate certain favored social practices and patterns. In the main, it has continued to be applied as such, though too often courts mask their implicit validation of these patterns in the now-conventional "case-by-case" application of the statutory fair use "factors" to the defendant's use of the copyrighted work in question. A more explicit acknowledgement of the role of these patterns in fair use analysis is consistent with fair use and copyright policy and tradition. Importantly, it helps to bridge the often-difficult conceptual gap between fair use claims asserted by individual defendants and the social implications of accepting or rejecting those claims. Finally, a pattern-oriented approach is normatively appropriate, when viewed in light of recent research by cognitive psychologists and other social scientists on patterns and creativity. In immediate terms, the approach should lead to a more consistent and predictable fair use jurisprudence. In the longer term, it should enhance the ability of copyright law to promote creative expression...|$|R

The literature defines policy diffusion as a process where policy choices are interdependent, and identifies several diffusion mechanisms that specify the link between the policy choices of the various actors.

We argue that the expected utility of a policy depends on both its effectiveness and the payoffs it yields, and we show that the various diffusion mechanisms operate by altering these two parameters. Each mechanism affects one of the two parameters, and does so in distinct ways. To account for aggregate patterns of diffusion, we embed our model in a simple threshold model of diffusion. Given the high complexity of the process that results, strong analytical conclusions on aggregate patterns cannot be drawn without more extensive analysis which {{is beyond the scope of}} this article. However, preliminary considerations indicate that a wide range of diffusion processes may exist and that convergence is only one possible outcome...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} <b>article.</b> <b>Coherence</b> in written {{discourse}} {{is a complex}} concept, involving both text-based and reader-based features. A reader-based theory of coherence asserts that a text alone cannot establish a standard understanding of coherence. There is disagreement among text-based theories regarding which features contribute more to coherence of a text, which indicates that a reader-based theory of coherence is likely to apply to an EFL context, where students’ writings are assessed. Therefore, this study investigated what coherence features the Turkish EFL teachers at the Department of Basic English (DBE) at Middle East Technical University (METU) consider while assessing student essays {{and the extent to}} which the teachers have a similar conception of coherence. The results of such a study were intended to form the basis of a discussion towards establishing a more standard specification of the term “coherence” at DBE, METU. Data were gathered through a survey administered to 59 teachers, who were asked to holistically rank-order six sample argumentative student essays in terms of coherence, and six interviews, specifying the coherence criteria the teachers employed. The findings suggested a low degree of agreement among the teachers in terms of their judgments of coherence and revealed that the teachers differed in their judgments mainly because they gave priority to either local or global coherence features. The results also revealed inconsistencies within individual raters in their application of the same coherence criterion. Ultimately, validating a reader-based theory of coherence in an EFL context, the findings implied caution towards a text-based understanding of coherence. Konyalı, FeyzaM. S...|$|R

Using a simple signaling model, I show that the political and operational circumstances that increase the probability of post hoc verification and punishment for privately motivated policy enhance the credibility of a leader s choices and transmit information on the benefits of action to the public. I derive several observable hypotheses from the informational model, linking the costliness of the signal, the presences of divided government, election years, active term limits, political insecurity, changes in freedom of information laws, and trust in government {{to the size of the}} rally in the United States.

40|$|Magister Artium (Psychology) - MA(Psych) It {{is often}} assumed that {{postgraduate}} students and neophyte academics {{have the capacity}} to conduct research independently. Thus, upon qualification, it is expected of postgraduate students and academics to conduct research independently, publish their findings, meet publication targets and to supervise student research towards completion. However, the transition from postgraduate student or clinician to academia is considered very challenging as they are often not prepared for the multiple changes they will embark on upon entry into the Higher Education sector. As a result, various programmes and frameworks have been introduced to assist new academics in enhancing their research capacity. Such strategies included but were not limited to, writing retreats, peer monitoring, and dedicated time. However, these interventions reported on in literature are from primary sources and fail to comment on either the methodological rigour or the quality of the studies investigating these interventions. Thus there exists a gap in the literature for filtered information that has been systematically evaluated for methodological rigour and coherence. The present study aimed to establish an empirical base (filtered evidence) of literature reporting on strategies or interventions aimed at addressing research productivity in new academics. The study incorporated a systematic review methodology to identify appropriate literature for inclusion, evaluate literature for methodological quality and provide a meta-synthesis of the findings of included studies. The review considered studies, reporting on strategies or interventions with new academics during the period of 2000 - 2013. The review was conducted along three levels. Firstly, identification of potential titles, whereby keywords were combined and a comprehensive search of databases available at the University of the Western Cape library was initiated. Published research was also retrieved through mining the reference list of all included reports and articles. Secondly, a pair of reviewers worked together by screening the abstracts which were retrieved based on the titles identified, and thirdly, the abstracts that were successfully screened moved forward to full text reading. These studies were evaluated for methodological quality using the critical appraisal tool. Eligibility for inclusion was determined by a threshold score of 61 %. As a result, the title search yielded a search result of 755, from these only 63 titles were selected for possible inclusion. The abstract screening resulted in the exclusion of 35 articles and 28 were included. After the critical appraisal, 15 articles were excluded. The findings of the present study revealed that there is good quality research on research capacity building for neophyte academics, as assessed on methodological rigour and <b>coherence.</b> Seven <b>articles</b> attained the threshold score (61 % and above) for inclusion in the final summation and meta-synthesis. Evidence suggested that there are various interventions which have been implemented successfully to enhance research capacity building.

These approaches were aimed at bridging that gap between research and teaching and developing competent researchers. The core feature that emerged from these approaches was that successful or effective strategies have to include numerous components such as individual characteristics (motivation), effective leaders and institutional characteristics (rewards, incentives and resources).

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{bioscience}} there is an ongoing explosive growth in discovery and information. Novel means in biotechnology {{as well as in}} medicines are introduced at an unseen rate. One of the aspects contributing to this development is the increased understanding of protein function and structure. Proteins have a role in almost every biological process. The function and structure of proteins are linked. Recent studies have discovered that the understanding of the protein structure has been biased. Namely, the studies have unearthed a previously dismissed protein structure state: intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In this highly dynamic state a protein is without a globular fold, but does not meet the requirements of a random coil either. Rapid transition between folds renders most of the established research techniques to be poor methods to study the IDPs. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a spectroscopy method, which enables the study of molecules at atomic resolution. The technique is based upon manipulation of the nuclear spins in specifically produced sample under strong magnetic field. In this method, spins of the system generate quantum coherence state(s), which is utilized to obtain information about the system. NMR is suitable for studying samples in solid and liquid mediums, but in case of biomolecules, water solution is preferable as it resembles in vivo environment. Highly mobile structure and chemical composition of IDPs cause many established NMR experiments to fail. Development of NMR pulse sequences is an obvious approach to solve the problem. This thesis presents a number of NMR pulse sequences, which are designed to improve acquisition of information from highly mobile sections of proteins. The key aspect is to utilize H atom instead of HN in coherence transfer. Additional improvements include limited residue specific identification and novel <b>coherence</b> transfer pathways. <b>Articles</b> I, II, and III present triple resonance experiments, which correlate protein backbone atoms. Combination of the spectra enables full sequential assignment. Article IV introduces an improved pulse sequence for measuring J couplings between nitrogen and amide proton. The experiments were subjected to experimental verification. Comparisons were drawn between established pulse sequences. In both globular proteins and IDPs the results show improvement over established pulse sequences. The proposed sequences yielded improved assignment coverage, resolution and sensitivity enhancement. Biotieteiden alalla on käynnissä räjähdysmäinen kehitys. Uusia tutkimusmetodeja ja tuloksia julkaistaan ennennäkemättömällä tahdilla.

40|$|The {{transformative}} use standard, {{which is}} {{an important aspect of}} copyright law’s fair use doctrine, has been confusing and uncertain since 1994 when it was first introduced by the United States Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music. To try to make some sense of this standard, this article extends the work of several scholars who have argued that the massive amount of fair use case law generally divides itself into categories, patterns or policy clusters which have their own internal <b>coherence.</b> This <b>article</b> contends that these observations apply as well to transformative use decisions more particularly, which similarly fit into a number of recurring distinct patterns. The analytic difficulty presented by the transformative use standard is that it is an ambiguous judicial construct layered on top of a pre-existing ambiguous and often criticized legislative construct in the Copyright Act. Section 107 codified the fair use doctrine with an illustrative list of uses which might be fair followed by four general factors to be examined when the fair use defense is raised by an alleged infringer. The determination of whether a particular use is transformative has been added to this multi-factored analysis. The challenge thus becomes relating this judicial construct to the statute’s factors in a meaningful way. Moreover, this standard’s relationship to other copyright law doctrines, especially the right to prepare derivative works, is not clear. After all, a derivative work by definition recasts, transforms, or adapts a preexisting work of authorship. Examining the vast case law in this area suggests initially that judicial results are largely, if not entirely, ad hoc and arbitrary. But lying beneath the chaos, as other scholars contend, is a taxonomy that brings some order. This article’s effort to identify these underlying connections is not, however, simply an effort to produce structure for the sake of structure. The analytic struggle presented by copyright law is of fundamental importance to our jurisprudence more generally because it illustrates the continuing conflict between two competing constitutional doctrines: on one hand, protecting intellectual property and ownership rights as an incentive to create; and, on the other, protecting freedom of expression including a creator’s ability to build upon the works of others. The purpose of copyright is “to encourage people to devote themselves to intellectual and artistic creation” and the philosophy undergirding copyright is the belief that “encouragement of individual effort by personal gain {{is the best way to}} advance public welfare through the talents of authors. ” At the same time, it has long been recognized that few things are “strictly new and original throughout” and that every work “in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known, and used before. ” Hence, there is a delicate balance between protecting copyrighted materials and allowing others to build upon those protected works, and it is important to understand how the transformative use standard affects this balance. This article first discusses fair use generally including Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music and the evolution of the transformative use standard. Next it defines the transformative use standard and its relationship to the right to prepare derivative works, and then discusses a dozen categories and subcategories of transformative and non-transformative uses. In some of these categories, such as parody, uses out of context and appropriation art, it finds that a court’s analysis and discussion of whether an unauthorized reproduction of a copyrighted work is transformative performs an important role in explaining why that particular use is or is not a fair use. However, the article suggests that in the fair use categories listed in section 107 ’s preamble, which were well-established before Campbell v. Acuff-Rose was decided such as criticism, comment, news reporting and copying for educational and research purposes, it is unnecessary for courts to turn to the transformative use standard. When it is relatively clear that the challenged use fits within one of those well-established categories, it would be better for the courts to stick with a straight forward analysis using section 107 ’s four factors. This is preferable to trying to twist and turn the transformative use standard to accommodate and explain a challenged use. Otherwise, the transformative use standard will become more presumption-like, implicitly amending section 107. This would also be counter to the Supreme Court’s explicit rejection in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose of using presumptions in fair use analysis. Moreover, in view of the subtle distinction between some allegedly transformative uses and derivative works, the standard’s evolution into a presumption risks undermining the right to prepare derivative works. The standard should not be allowed to eviscerate this right. Like the old productive/nonproductive use distinction discussed by the Supreme Court in the venerable Sony/Betamax decision, analyzing whether a particular use is transformative should be a helpful but not determinative consideration in assessing fair use...|$|R

Et tekst ei kodeeri tähendust ühemõtteliselt, nõnda et seda saaks de- ja rekodeerida, rakendab tõlkija tähenduse lahti tinglikust keelemärgist ja vormistab selle teisiti, toetudes tekstis ära tuntud tugipunktidele. Tõlge on tõlkija intentsionaalne lausung, mis sõltub tema teadmistest ja kognitiivsest filtrist. Teoreetilise tõlkepoeetika rakendamist praktikas kirjeldab tõlkija Miriam McIlfatrick-Ksenofontov Jaan Malini luuletuse „Keele meel“ tõlkimise näitel. S U M M A R Y The article {{describes}} the process of translation {{in the light of}} Henri Meschonnic’s suggestion that the poetic compatibility of source text and target text is of central significance, not the differences between the languages and cultures involved. Departing from the premise that no text is determined by its linguistic or social contin­gencies, the goal of translation is to produce a new text that does in the new language what the original text does in the original language. The linguistic and cultural information of a source text is subject to its poetics. In order to illustrate the practical implications of this approach, the article highlights translational solutions that cannot be explained in linguistic terms given that they attempt to maintain the specifics of the original. The translator proceeds by pretending to know what a text (and its author) is doing; it is the cognitive filter of the translator that gives the source text its meaning. In an account of her translation of Jaan Malin’s ”Keele meel“ into English, Miriam McIlfatrick-Ksenofontov begins with the analysis of the poem. This entails separating the whole into its component parts and identifying their relations. Reading with a view to translating unravels the texture of a poem, exposing the lexical, semantic and phonetic strands that constitute its <b>coherence.</b> The <b>article</b> then offers an account of how the translator experiences the original and navigates through it towards a new poem in translation, recognising that languages differ in what they can and must do. The latter, primarily a grammatical reality, is accompanied by a semantic one: the implications that stem from lexical connotations are inevitably different in the original poem and in the new poem. However, the supposed intent of the original is what a cognitive approach sees as a possibility of translation. This does not involve the transferral of isolated lexicalised items, but allows the translator to overcome the dilemma of retaining both form and content by adopting the role of writer, by working with language that is at no more at her disposal than it is for the writer of the original. The analysis of the original enables the translator to avoid seeing the poem as fixed language in a solid object or searching for a single invariant meaning. Between the reader and the poem a situation of dialogue is established that involves asking questions of the poem in order to find what meanings it insists on. Questions like what does this word (image, rhyme, comma, etc.) do in/to the poem? how would the poem be different if this word (rhyme, etc.) were replaced by another or removed altogether? give the translator an idea of all the features that constitute a text; thus the use or absence of metre, form, layout, punctuation, lineation, rhyme, diction and syntax, etc. in the translation can be settled. Questions have to be directed not only at the denser parts of the poem, but even at those places where there seems to be univalence of meaning or standard language usage. Any detail or device, singly or together with another element(s), may be a hinge on which the poem turns. The guiding principle is that any choice made by the writer inevitably involved the rejection of alternatives. The elements on the page are both more and less than any answer anyone (translator or reader) can give. The objective is to interact with the text rather than wander aimlessly through the space that is opened up by reading. In producing multiple drafts which explore and experiment with the devices employed in the original, the translator highlights the comprehensive set of values that account for its coherence. This, in turn, will test the translating language and its possibilities; the translating language may become subtly altered in the translation process, as the translator works {{under the influence of the}} syntactic and semantic systems of the original. There is an interdependence between imitation and creation in play here, which the translator explores. It is a process of synthesising, as the translator homes in on the most tenacious elements of the original and the expressive potential of her own language. Reading a text generates conjectures that are infinite in number, but ultimately they will have to be tested against the text’s coherence. Translating with a focus on stylistic features as mental constructs rests on the claim that the mind stands between a word and its referent. By aiming to translate the mind rather than linguistic expression, a translator can discover options and make textually relevant choices between them...|$|R
