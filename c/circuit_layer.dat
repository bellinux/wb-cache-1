40|$|In the {{presented}} thesis two planar {{high gain}} antenna arrays {{have been developed}} and realized. The antennas are intended for radio relay link applications in the range around 32 GHz. They can be used e. g. for the integration of base stations in WIMAX networks. The gain of the antennas is better than 30 dB. The polarization of the arrays are linear and circular, respectively. The base elements of the arrays are micro strip patches. In each case nine rectangular patches are combined into nearly square sub-arrays. The first version of the arrays consists of 64 such sub-arrays. To minimize the losses the array is fed on the back with a corporative waveguide network. The center elements of the sub-arrays are coupled by slots to the waveguide network. Short planar strip lines accomplish the further power partition within the sub-arrays. The waveguide network is milled out of a flat aluminum block. The antenna substrate serves thereby as cover for the waveguide structure. The optimization of the radiation of the sub-arrays, {{as well as the}} input reflection coefficient of the slot coupling is examined with the help of commercially available software (Method of Moments as well as Finit Element Methods). The choice of the distances of the sub-arrays between themselves and the choice of the excitation functions of the entire arrays are performed by modeled radiations. For the creation of non-constant excitation functions of the entire array new unsymmetrical power dividers with balanced transmission phases in waveguide technology have been developed and realized. With the second version of the high gain antenna the entire array is subdivided into two separate blocks, which consist in each case of 32 sub-arrays. Within one block all sub-arrays are rotated by 90 Â°, so that an orthogonal polarization occurs. Due to the new structure of the antenna the waveguide feeding network, which is arranged under the antenna, must be adapted. With this structure it is possible to excite two linear orthogonal polarizations. Thus with a superposition of the radiations four different polarizations can be produced (2 times linear and 2 times circular). The waveguide structure is resumed through the block of aluminum. Over an additional slot coupling a <b>circuit</b> <b>layer</b> on the backside of the antenna can be coupled. On this <b>circuit</b> <b>layer</b> a transmit/receive switch, phase shifters and power dividers are realized.
