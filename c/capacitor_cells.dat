Some constructive measures can have also {{a major impact on}} the electrical parameters of capacitors. Smaller ESR values can be achieved for example by parallel connection of several conventional <b>capacitor</b> <b>cells</b> in one case.

The BMS performs several functions concerning to the battery system, its key task being balancing the battery cells.

40|$|A {{proposed}} successive-approximation {{analog-to-digital converter}} (ADC) would contain a capacitively terminated chain of identical <b>capacitor</b> <b>cells.</b> Like a conventional successive-approximation ADC containing {{a bank of}} binary-scaled capacitors, the proposed ADC would store an input voltage on a sample-and-hold capacitor and would digitize the stored input voltage by finding the closest match between this voltage and a capacitively generated sum of binary fractions of a reference voltage (Vref). However, the proposed capacitor-chain ADC would offer two major advantages over a conventional binary-scaled-capacitor ADC: (1) In a conventional ADC that digitizes to n bits, the largest capacitor (representing the most significant bit) must have 2 (exp n- 1) times as much capacitance, and hence, approximately 2 (exp n- 1) times as much area as does the smallest capacitor (representing the least significant bit), so that the total capacitor area must be 2 (exp n) {{times that of the}} smallest capacitor. In the proposed capacitor-chain ADC, there would be three capacitors per cell, each approximately equal to the smallest capacitor in the conventional ADC, and there would be one cell per bit. Therefore, the total capacitor area would be only about 3 (exp n) times that of the smallest capacitor. The net result would be that the proposed ADC could be considerably smaller than the conventional ADC. (2) Because of edge effects, parasitic capacitances, and manufacturing tolerances, it is difficult to make capacitor banks in which the values of capacitance are scaled by powers of 2 to the required precision. In contrast, because all the capacitors in the proposed ADC would be identical, the problem of precise binary scaling would not arise...|$|E

Multi-bit data storage, defined here as storage of multiple bits in a single device cell, can potentially make higher density ferroelectric memory at a lower price. The idea is based on ferroelectric response with regard to ferroelectric film thickness. Two kinds of memory cells were fabricated to test the functionality and performance of the proposed concept. After optimizing the thermal nano-imprinting process to replicate periodicity micro-structure to a ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) film, we first fabricated the ferroelectric <b>capacitor</b> <b>cells</b> with the imprinted polymer film.

40|$|Double-layer {{capacitors}} {{are unique}} energy storage devices, capable of supporting large current pulses {{as well as}} a very high number of charging and discharging cycles. The performance of doublelayer capacitors is highly dependent {{on the nature of the}} electrolyte system used. Many applications, including for electric and fuel cell vehicles, back-up diesel generators, wind generator pitch control back-up power systems, environmental and structural distributed sensors, and spacecraft avionics, can potentially benefit from the use of double-layer capacitors with lower equivalent series resistances (ESRs) over wider temperature limits. Higher ESRs result in decreased power output, which is a particular problem at lower temperatures. Commercially available cells are typically rated for operation down to only 40 C. Previous briefs [for example, Low Temperature Supercapacitors (NPO- 44386), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 7 (July 2008), p. 32, and Supercapacitor Electrolyte Solvents With Liquid Range Below 80 C (NPO- 44855), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 1 (January 2010), p. 44] discussed the use of electrolytes that employed low-melting-point co-solvents to depress the freezing point of traditional acetonitrile-based electrolytes. Using these modified electrolyte formulations can extend the low-temperature operational limit of double-layer capacitors beyond that of commercially available cells. This previous work has shown that although the measured capacitance is relatively insensitive to temperature, the ESR can rise rapidly at low temperatures, due to decreased electrolyte conductance within the pores of the high surface- area carbon electrodes. Most of these advanced electrolyte systems featured tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEATFB) as the salt. More recent work at JPL indicates the use of the asymmetric quaternary ammonium salt triethylmethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMATFB) or spiro-(l,l') -bipyrrolidium tetrafluoroborate (SBPBF 4) in a 1 : 1 by volume solvent mixture of acetonitrile (AN) and methyl formate (MF) enables double-layer <b>capacitor</b> <b>cells</b> to operate well below - 40 C with a relatively low ESR. Typically, a less than twofold increase in ESR is observed at - 65 C relative to room-temperature values, when these modified electrolyte blends are used in prototype cells.
