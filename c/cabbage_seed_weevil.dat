40|$|The {{literary}} part of {{the thesis}} describes biology, economic importance and methods of chemical protection against pollen beetle, <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> and cabbage stem flea beetle. The resistance of these pests against zoocides in the Czech republic and {{in some parts of}} neighbour European countries is decribed and principles of antiresistance strategies are outlined. Each group of insecticides is describd and their active components are rated in the practical {{part of the}} thesis. Findings about pest resistance are summarized - resistance types and mechanisms in particular. Then monitoring of resistent populations of plant pests are described. New findings concerning the resistance of three oilseed rape pests were acquired using biological methods. For cabage seed weevil six areas were evaluated, for pollen beetle seven and for cabbage stem flea beetle two areas were evaluated. All the evaluated areas are in the Czech republic. The adult-vial test number 11, nr. 25, nr. 27 accordinng to IRAC methodology and topical aplication test were used to rate the resistance. The efficiency of five pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, tau-fluvalinate, cypermethrin), one organophosphate (chlorpyrifos - cabbage stem flea beetle only) and one oxadiazin (indoxacarb) in different concentrations were rated. The mortality of the pests was rated 24 hours after active component functioning for pollen beetle and <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> and after 48 hours for cabage stem flea beetle. Then lethal concentration LC 50 and LC 95 values were assessed. For ppollen beetle, the resistance against pyrethroids was confirmed with the exception, the effect of neonicotinoids was variable, acetamiprid and thiacloprid showed reduced efficiency in populations of some areas. Assessed populations of <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> and cabbage stem flea beetle were very sensitive to pyrethroids, but neonicotinoids showed insufficient efficiency. The indoxacarb sensitivity of pollen beetle and cabbage stem flea beetle was high...|$|E

Studies in the EU MASTER project show that carabid beetles can feed on larvae of oilseed rape pests (e. g. Piper & Williams, 2004), but to identify them as potential biocontrol agents it must be shown that significant numbers encounter the prey in the field. In this two-year study, the spatio-temporal {{relationships between}} carabids and cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala) have already been reported (Warner et al., 2003). Now, we compare carabid distributions with those of pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus), cabbage stem weevil (stem weevil) (Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus) and <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> (seed weevil) (Ceutorhynchus assimilis) larvae dropping to the soil to pupate...|$|E

Pollen beetle larvae, seed weevil larvae and cabbage moth larvae where all relatively easy infected while infections of pod midge larvae only were observed twice. The number of nematodes produced in the cadavers was positively related {{to the size of the}} insects. The recovery of D. brassicae and Meligethes spp. was further studied after exposure to entomopathogenic nematodes during the pupating process. The recovery of D. brassicae was almost unaffected by the nematodes whereas recovery of Meligethes spp. decreased with increasing number of nematodes. The susceptibility of oil seed rape insects to entomopathogenic nematodes was indirectly demonstrated under field conditions. Here soil grown with oil seed rape for three years was compared to soil grown with grain by baiting with Tenebrio molitor.

40|$|To {{understand}} the ecological role of secondary plant compounds in host location by phytophagous insects {{it is important}} to consider attraction at different scales in natural populations. The <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Ceutorhynchus assimilis, which lays eggs in pods of crucifers where the larvae feed on seed, is attracted to purified extracts of specific glucosinolate-derived volatiles. We considered the possibility that C. assimilis adults are attracted to and preferentially attack patches of plants and/or individual plants producing these volatiles. Using discrete natural populations of Brassica oleracea and Brassica nigra, we found that oviposition was highest in populations of B. oleracea producing high amounts of 3 -butenylglucosinolate. No links were found between the other glucosinolates, 2 -propenylglucosinolate, 2 -hydroxy- 3 -butenylglucosinolate, 1 -indolylmethylglucosinolate or 1 -methoxy- 3 -indolylmethylglucosinolate, and oviposition in B. oleracea. B. nigra, which contains only 2 -propenylglucosinolate, was not attacked by C. assimilis. Within populations of B. oleracea, neither oviposition nor the number of seeds eaten was related to the glucosinolate profiles of individual plants. We suggest that C. assimilis adults use 3 -butenylglucosinolate-derived volatiles to locate host populations, whereas other cues determine oviposition on individual plants. The consequences of these results for natural selection of glucosinolate phenotypes are discussed...|$|E

The latter group consists of a lot of members of order Hymenoptera. This work focuses on the evaluation of impact of white oilseed rape cultivation on the insect society in comparison with two yellow winter varieties. Newly bred winter oilseed rape line variety Witt was compared to two hybrid varieties of yellow rape; Sherpa and DK Sensei. The experiment {{was carried out in}} 2015 and its plots were placed at Ruzyně at Crop Reserach Institute (VÚRV, v. v. i.) and also at the Experimental Unit of Czech University of Life Sciences (ČZU) in Uhříněves. The insects were collected by sweeping net, soil larvae traps and soil emergence traps. The occurrence of serious pests (pollen beetle Brassicogethes aeneus, brassica pod midge Dasineura brassicae, <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> Ceutorhynchus obstrictus, stem flea beetle Psylliodes chrysocephalus and cabbage flea beetles Phyllotreta sp.) was recorded.

40|$|Winter oilseed rape, Brassica napus L., {{has become}} {{a vital part of}} cereal-based crop {{rotations}} in Europe. It is attacked by numerous insect pests and their control relies on the intensive use of insecticides (compared to other broad acre crops). The exclusive and continuous use of pyrethroid insecticides for almost twenty years led to an enormous selection pressure and facilitated the development of resistance in oilseed rape pests in Europe. Unsurprising three out of the five major pests of the order Coleoptera are reported to be pyrethroid resistant at present: the pollen beetle, Meligethes aeneus F.; the cabbage stem flea beetle, Psylliodes chrysocephala L. and the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Ceutorhynchus assimilis PAYK [...] An adult vial bioassay, which is based on insecticide coated glass vials, was used to monitor the spread and strength of pyrethroid resistance and to determine cross-resistance pattern in pollen beetle and cabbage stem flea beetle. Furthermore, baseline susceptibility towards lambda-cyhalothrin (a widely used pyrethroid) was also established for the <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil.</b> The vial bioassay methodology was adapted to thiacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, to determine baseline susceptibility and to provide a methodology to allow long-term susceptibility monitoring of pollen beetle and <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil.</b> Thiacloprid monitoring revealed that pollen beetle and <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> populations collected across Europe in 2009 - 2012 and 2012 respectively were highly susceptible to this insecticide class. Metabolism studies using native microsomal preparations as the enzyme source and deltamethrin as substrate revealed metabolism of deltamethrin with 4 -OH-deltamethrin being the major metabolite. Metabolite formation in vitro was correlated with the observed pyrethroid resistance level in vivo and was suppressible by PBO. A degenerate PCR approach was used to identify partial P 450 gene sequences from pollen beetle. qRT-PCR screening covering a range of pollen beetle populations differing in levels of pyrethroid resistance identified a single P 450, CYP 6 BQ 23, as significantly and highly overexpressed (up to ~ 900 -fold) in resistant strains compared to susceptible strains. The expression of CYP 6 BQ 23 was significantly correlated with both the level of resistance and with the rate of deltamethrin metabolism in microsomal preparations of these populations. Recombinant expression of this P 450 in an insect cell line demonstrated that it is capable of hydroxylating deltamethrin and tau-fluvalinate. The turnover of these pyrethroids by CYP 6 BQ 23 is in line with the observed moderate cross-resistant phenotype. Molecular modeling suggested a better fit of deltamethrin into the active site of CYP 6 BQ 23 compared to tau-fluvalinate also supporting the biochemical results. The occurrence of target-site resistance was investigated by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the para-locus encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) in insects. To achieve this goal a partial fragment (domain IIS 4 - 6) encoding an important region of the pyrethroid binding site was PCR amplified and screened for non-synonymous SNPs. One SNP was identified causing a leucine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid residue number 1014 (Musca domestica L. numbering), well known as knock down resistance (kdr) conferring an absolute cross-resistance to pyrethroids and DDT in various insect species. Sequencing of the very same gene region in the cabbage stem flea beetle also revealed the presence of the L 1014 F kdr mutation in pyrethroid resistant flea beetle populations, thus explaining the strong cross-resistance pattern observed in vitro. Most mechanistic studies of resistance have focused on elucidating the contribution of particular genes/gene families to pyrethroid resistance. To generate a comprehensive sequence resource and to elucidate global changes in gene regulation related to insecticide resistance in pollen beetle a de novo transcriptome was assembled from sequence pools generated by next-generation sequencing. RNA-sequencing of three pyrethroid resistant and one highly susceptible reference population allowed a global gene expression analysis by short read mapping against the generated transcriptome, as well as a SNP analysis. The implications of these results for resistance management in coleopteran pests in winter oilseed rape and opportunities for future work are discussed. Der Winterraps, Brassica napus L., hat sich in Europa zu einem festen Bestandteil der maßgeblich von Getreide dominierten Fruchtfolgen entwickelt. Winterraps wird von einer Vielzahl an Schädlingen befallen welche in der Praxis fast ausschließlich durch den Einsatz von chemischen Insektiziden (maßgeblich Pyrethroide) bekämpft werden. Der seit mehr als 20 Jahren wiederkehrende Einsatz von Pyrethroiden zur Kontrolle von Rapsschädlingen in Europa resultierte in einem enormen Selektionsdruck. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass drei Schädlinge der Ordnung Coleoptera gegenwärtig eine Resistenz gegen Pyrethroide aufweisen. Bei den drei coleopteren Vertretern handelt es sich um den Rapsglanzkäfer, Meligethes aeneus F., den Rapserdfloh, Psylliodes chrysocephala L. und den Kohlschotenrüssler, Ceutorhynchus assimilis PAYK [...] Mittels einem auf insektizidbeschichteten Glasröhrchen beruhenden Biotestsystem (adult vial tests) wurde die Ausprägung (Stärke und Kreuzresistenzmuster) sowie die geographische Verteilung der Pyrethroidresistenz bei Rapsglanzkäfern und Rapserdflöhen untersucht. Unter Verwendung des identischen Testsystems wurde die Baseline Susceptibility (Ausgangsempfindlichkeit) von Kohlschotenrüsseler gegen lambda-Cyhalothrin erfasst. Unter Verwendung von Thiacloprid, ein Wirkstoff der chemischen Klasse der Neonikotinoide, im Glasröhrchen Testsystem wurde die Baseline Susceptibility vom Rapsglanzkäfer und Kohlschotenrüssler erfasst. Der Metabolismus von Deltamethrin durch native mikrosomale Membranpräparationen des Rapsglanzkäfers wurde untersucht. Die Metabolismusrate von Deltamethrin zu 4 -OH-Deltamethrin in vitro war mit der erfassten Pyrethroidresistenz in vivo positiv korreliert und konnte mit PBO inhibiert werden. Mit einer PCR Strategie basierend auf degenerierten Oligonukleotiden wurden Genfragmente der P 450 Genfamilie aus Rapsglanzkäfern isoliert und deren Expression mittels qRT-PCR in Populationen mit verschiedenen Resistenzausprägungen quantifiziert. CYP 6 BQ 23 war in resistenten Populationen signifikant hochreguliert. Die Überexpression war signifikant korreliert mit der Resistenzausprägung in vivo und der Umsetzung von Deltamethrin in vitro. CYP 6 BQ 23 wurde in einer Insektenzellkultur rekombinant funktionell exprimiert und der CYP 6 BQ 23 abhängige Deltamethrinmetabolismus bewiesen. Darüber hinaus wurde gezeigt, dass CYP 6 BQ 23 auch tau-Fluvalinat umsetzt. Mithilfe eines Computermodels von CYP 6 BQ 23 wurde die Substratbindung simuliert und eine bessere Bindung für Deltamethrin im Vergleich zu tau-Fluvalinat prognostiziert. Der Einfluss von wirkortspezifischer Resistenz (target-site resistance) wurde ebenfalls untersucht. Vom para-locus, welcher den spannungsabhängigen Natriumkanal im zentralen Nervensystem der Insekten kodiert, wurde ein Genfragment (Domäne IIS 4 - 6) PCR-amplifiziert, sequenziert und auf Einzelnukleotidpolimorphismen (SNPs) untersucht. Ein SNP wurde identifiziert der in einem Aminosäureaustausch von Leucin zu Phenylalanin an Positon 1014 (Musca domestica L. Nummerierung) resultiert. Diese Mutation ist in einer Vielzahl von Insekten als knock down resistance (kdr) beschrieben und vermittelt eine Kreuzresistenz gegenüber Pyrethroiden und DDT. Im Rapserdfloh wurde die gleiche Region im orthologen Locus untersucht mit dem identischen Befund. Die L 1014 F kdr Mutation im Rapserdfloh ist korreliert mit Bekämpfungsproblemen von Rapserdflöhen beim Einsatz von Pyrethroiden. In den meisten Studien zur Aufklärung von Resistenzmechnismen wurde der Fokus auf eine spezielle Enzym-/Genfamilie gelegt. Um einen holistischeren Weg zu gehen wurde eine Transkriptomstudie beim Rapsglanzkäfer durchgeführt. Ziel war das Assemblieren des de novo Transkriptoms, die Isolierung von Genen die insektizide Wirkorte kodieren und deren Analyse auf SNPs sowie eine komparative Analyse der Genregulierung zwischen pyrethroidresistenten und sensitiven Populationen. Die Konsequenzen der Ergebnisse für ein nachhaltiges Resistenzmanagement in coleopteren Schädlingen in Winterraps and die Möglichkeiten für weiterführende Studien werden diskutiert...|$|E

The results showed that the sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> are sister taxa in a monophyletic clade. No significant relationships attributable to geographic barriers were found. Thirty-three unique mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences (haplotypes) were identified and the sequence divergence among haplotypes ranged from 0. 2 to 3. 68 %. Because more individuals per population could be collected for gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> than for red, a more detailed study of population structure was possible for this species. Most of the genetic variation observed in gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> resulted from variation within populations. Contiguous range expansion appeared to be the main mechanism for increased variability within the species. Significant differences were found in analyses of five polymorphic microsatellite loci in four geographically separated field populations from which multiple individuals could be collected. More genetic differences occurred among weevil populations collected from sunflowers along the East-West axis than among weevil populations collected on a North-South axis. The overall results are consistent with current theories concerning the origin of the sunflower.

40|$|There {{are four}} major insect pests attacking achenes of {{sunflower}} in the Great Plains of North America (Charlet et al., 1987); the red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Smicronyx fulvus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> S. sordidus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Cochylidae), and the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Identification of achenes damaged by larvae {{of these species}} is important for assessment of yield loss caused by each species (Peng and Brewer, 1995). Achenes infested by the gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> are easily identified because they are enlarged and protrude above the surrounding achenes on intact sunflower heads and the kernel is entirely consumed (Brewer, 1991). Descriptions of achenes infested by larvae {{of the other three}} species are similar (Carlson, 1967; Oseto and Braness, 1979; McBride and Charlet, 1991) except for the location of feeding/exit holes {{on the surface of the}} achenes infested by the red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> and banded sunflower moth (Charlet and Gross, 1990). The red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> oviposits in the developing achenes.

The banded sunflower moth and sunflower moth oviposit on the bracts and florets. Early instars feed on the pollen and florets, later instars penetrate into achenes and feed on the developing kernels (Charlet et al., 1987, Charlet and Gross, 1990).

Weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius), are effective in controlling the main insect pests in citrus, cashew and mango orchards. To determine whether weaver ants, which are usually abundant in non-sprayed mango orchards, have the potential to control the mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> field experiments together with regular monitoring programmes at six orchards in the Northern Territory of Australia were conducted from 2001 to 2003. Data from two conventional orchards showed that the treatment with weaver ants plus soft chemicals produced lower levels of downgraded fruits (< 0. 5 %) compared to the treatment with chemical insecticides (1. 4 - 2. 1 %). In three organic or insecticide-free orchards, fruits were much less damaged on trees with weaver ants (< 1 %) than on trees without the ants (2. 5 - 15. 7 %). In the sixth orchard, that had much higher mango <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> populations than the others, levels of downgraded fruits were lower on trees with abundant weaver ants than on trees with fewer weaver ants.

The highest efficacy was observed with Biscaya 240 (A. I. thiacloprid) and Mospilan 20 SP (A. I. acetamiprid). Results obtained in this study corroborated the low efficacy of the insecticid...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{species are}} {{reducing}} native biodiversity in many distinct regions across the globe. While {{biological control agent}}s have been effectively utilized to manage invasive plant species and preserve existing biodiversity, not all biological control agents are successful. The invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> (Rhinocyllus conicus) was originally introduced to America as a biological control agent to manage musk thistle (Carduus nutans), {{but it has been}} found to attack several species of native thistle. This study examined the movements of the invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> away from musk thistle into two different species of native thistle in the Colorado Front Range: wavyleaf thistle (Cirsium undulatum) and fringed thistle (Cirsium centaureae). Specifically, the proximity of invasive musk thistle to wavyleaf thistle was observed to see if it has any influence on thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> attack upon wavyleaf thistle. Additionally, fringed thistle was observed in three different habitat types in the Colorado Front Range (i. e. meadow, riparian, and tree line habitat) to see if the invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> has been moving up in elevation in response to climate change. The results indicate that the proximity between musk thistle and wavyleaf thistle had no significant effect on thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> abundance on the native thistle. Moreover, the invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> is still restricted to elevations below 3100 meters, meaning the tree line population of fringed thistle are protected from attack. Although both species of native thistle seem to have little risk of local extirpation due to the invasive <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil,</b> continued monitoring is advised to assess the indirect impacts of this invasive species through time and space...|$|R

40|$|Amendment of infested BVB NO. 4 {{peat moss}} medium with 2 % (w/v) tea seed pomace was {{significantly}} effective in inhibiting 68 % colonization of <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> by Rhizoctonia solani AG- 4. The results were observed first {{immediately after the}} amendment was applied and second on the 7 (superscript th) day after the treatment. In the greenhouse study, tea seed pomace amended {{at the rate of}} 1 % (w/v) was also able to obviously reduce the disease incidence of cabbage seedling damping-off by 40 % compared to untreated control. The pH values of BVB NO. 4 peat moss medium did not change significantly after tea seed pomace was amended at the rate of 1 % (w/v); however, tea seed pomace was able to stimulate the proliferation of microbial populations including fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes. The inhibition of <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> colonization was not significantly nullified in autoclaved BVB NO. 4 peat moss medium with tea seed pomace. The results suggest that the inhibition of <b>cabbage</b> <b>seed</b> colonization by the pathogen in the amended medium might be due to the presence of chemical compounds with antifungal activity in tea seed pomace. 採用種子誘釣法篩選具有抑制Rhizoctonia solani纏據甘藍種子效果的有機添加物，結果發現在BVB No. 4 泥炭苔中添加 2 % (w/v) 苦茶粕處理第 0 天（當天）即可降低種子纏據百分率達 68 %；處理一星期後，亦可得到類似的效果。栽培介質添加 1 %(w/v) 苦茶粕可顯著降低甘藍苗立枯病的發病率達 40 %。進一步，探討苦茶粕添加於BVB No. 4 泥炭苔中的其他效應，結果發現添加 1 %(w/v) 苦茶粕不會顯著改變BVB No. 4 泥炭苔的pH值，但却會提高微生物的族群量，其中細菌菌量增加 9 倍，真菌及放線菌則分別增加 2 ~ 3 倍。經高溫高壓滅菌後，去除BVB No. 4 泥炭苔及苦茶粕中的微生物，發現苦茶粕尚能降低R. solani AG- 4 纏據甘藍種子百分率達 30 %以上。本研究結果顯示苦茶粕的組成份中可能存在有抑菌化學物質，可有效抑制本病原菌纏據甘藍種子...|$|R
40|$|Researches concering the Iris <b>seeds</b> <b>weevil,</b> Mononychus punctum-album Hbst., {{continued}} in 1996, {{in the collection}} of Iris spp. from Botanic Garden of Cluj-Napoca. Using the direct collect of insects method from the capsules (fruits) of hostplants (Iris spp.), the following species were attacked: Iris haematophilus Fisch., Iris forrestis, Iris barleata L., Iris sikkinensis Dykes, Iris longipetalia Hersk., Iris brysozoba, Iris dichotoma Tall., Iris sibirica L., Iris milesii Baker, Iris aphila, Iris pallida Lam. Iris germanica L. was not attacked. The aspects of morphology and biology of Iris <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Mononychus punctum-album Hbst. are also described. This seminiphagous pest can reduce the subtances produced by seed at these ornamental plants and can produce difficulties concerning the change of seed between different botanic gardens. We recommand to protect the Iris collections by spreading insectiphuges or using a pyrethroid insecticide (Dacis 2. 5 EC - 0. 025 % or Meothrin 20 EC - 0. 025 %) ...|$|R
