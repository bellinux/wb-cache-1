5|$|Silicon carbide {{is used in}} <b>carborundum</b> printmaking – a collagraph printmaking technique. <b>Carborundum</b> grit {{is applied}} in a paste {{to the surface of}} an {{aluminium}} plate. When the paste is dry, ink is applied and trapped in its granular surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. The ink plate is then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for intaglio printmaking. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.|$|E
5|$|References to {{silicon carbide}} heating {{elements}} exist {{from the early}} 20th century when they were produced by Acheson's <b>Carborundum</b> Co. in the U.S. and EKL in Berlin. Silicon carbide offered increased operating temperatures compared with metallic heaters. Silicon carbide elements are used today in the melting of glass and non-ferrous metal, heat treatment of metals, float glass production, production of ceramics and electronics components, igniters in pilot lights for gas heaters, etc.|$|E
5|$|Titanium nitride (TiN) has a {{hardness}} {{equivalent to}} sapphire and <b>carborundum</b> (9.0 on the Mohs Scale), {{and is often}} used to coat cutting tools, such as drill bits. It is also used as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a barrier metal in semiconductor fabrication. Titanium carbide, which is also very hard, is found in cutting tools and coatings.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the <b>Carborundum</b> Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture and application of silicon nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) silicon nitride was in commercial production for thermocouple tubes, rocket nozzles, and boats and crucibles for melting metals. British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride. In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E
5|$|The {{escape route}} led {{up through a}} fan vent; the prisoners removed the fan and motor, {{replacing}} them with a steel grill and leaving a shaft large enough for a prisoner to enter. Stealing a <b>carborundum</b> abrasive cord from the prison workshop, the prisoners then removed the rivets from the grill. In their beds, they placed papier-mâché dummies made with human hair stolen from the barbershop. The escapees also constructed an inflatable raft over many weeks from over 50 stolen raincoats, which they prepared {{on the top of}} the cellblock, concealed from the guards by sheets which had been put up over the sides. They escaped through a vent in the roof and departed Alcatraz.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide (SiC), {{also known}} as <b>carborundum</b> , is a {{semiconductor}} containing silicon and carbon with chemical formula SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic silicon carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. Silicon carbide with high surface area can be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.|$|E
25|$|In 1893 Charles Street of Le Carbone {{discovered}} {{a process for}} making artificial graphite. Another process to make synthetic graphite was invented accidentally by Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856–1931). In the mid-1890s, Acheson discovered that overheating <b>carborundum</b> produced almost pure graphite. While studying the effects of high temperature on <b>carborundum,</b> he had found that silicon vaporizes at about 4,150°C (7,500°F), leaving the carbon behind in graphitic carbon. This graphite was another major discovery for him, and it became extremely valuable and helpful as a lubricant.|$|E
25|$|Other British {{attempts}} at countermeasures {{were not so}} effective. An early plan was to use 100,000 fans to disperse the gas. Burning coal or <b>carborundum</b> dust was tried. A proposal was made to equip front-line sentries with diving helmets, air being pumped to them through a 100ft (30 m) hose.|$|E
25|$|Galena (lead sulfide) was {{probably}} the most common crystal used in cat's whisker detectors, but various other types of crystals were also used, the most common being iron pyrite (fool's gold, FeS2), silicon, molybdenite (MoS2), silicon carbide (<b>carborundum,</b> SiC), and a zincite-bornite (ZnO-Cu5FeS4) crystal-to-crystal junction trade-named Perikon. Crystal radios have also been improvised from a variety of common objects, such as blue steel razor blades and lead pencils, rusty needles, and pennies In these, a semiconducting layer of oxide or sulfide on the metal surface is usually responsible for the rectifying action.|$|E
25|$|Ballard {{was born}} in Niagara Falls, Ontario, to Jessie Marguerite Mildred of the Rowntree's family in York and Archibald Hall Ballard of Staten Island, New York. His father studied {{electrochemical}} engineering at the University of Toronto and later specialized {{in the area of}} radiation. He was working at <b>Carborundum</b> Corporation when the lab director fell overboard from a boat during a party and was washed over Niagara Falls, so Archibald Ballard was promoted to lab director at a relatively young age in his mid-40s. He spent most of World War II at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, working on the atomic bomb.|$|E
25|$|A {{bench grinder}} is usually {{used to create}} the sparks, but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500–11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or <b>carborundum</b> often are employed. The test area should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E
25|$|De Forest {{eventually}} came {{into conflict with}} his company's management. His main complaint was the limited support he got for conducting research, while company officials were upset with de Forest's inability to develop a practical receiver free of patent infringement. (This problem was finally resolved with {{the invention of the}} <b>carborundum</b> crystal detector by another company employee, General H. H. Dunworthy). On November 28, 1906, in exchange for $1000 (half of which was claimed by an attorney) and the rights to some early Audion detector patents, de Forest turned in his stock and resigned from the company that bore his name. American DeForest was then reorganized as the United Wireless Telegraph Company, and would be the dominant U.S. radio communications firm, albeit propped up by massive stock fraud, until its bankruptcy in 1912.|$|E
500|$|Acheson {{patented}} {{the method}} for making silicon carbide powder on February 28, 1893. Acheson also developed the electric batch furnace by which SiC is still made today and formed the <b>Carborundum</b> Company to manufacture bulk SiC, initially {{for use as}} an abrasive. In 1900 the company settled with the Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company when a judge's decision gave [...] "priority broadly" [...] to its founders [...] "for reducing ores and other substances by the incandescent method". It is said that Acheson was trying to dissolve carbon in molten corundum (alumina) and discovered the presence of hard, blue-black crystals which he {{believed to be a}} compound of carbon and corundum: hence <b>carborundum.</b> It may be that he named the material [...] "carborundum" [...] by analogy to corundum, which is another very hard substance (9 on the Mohs scale).|$|E
500|$|With {{reactive}} metals, such as tungsten, carbon forms either carbides (C) or acetylides (...) to form alloys {{with high}} melting points. These anions are {{also associated with}} methane and acetylene, both very weak acids. With an electronegativity of 2.5, carbon prefers to form covalent bonds. A few carbides are covalent lattices, like <b>carborundum</b> (SiC), which resembles diamond. Nevertheless, even the most polar and salt-like of carbides are not completely ionic compounds.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, an {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} General Electric (GE), Norton and <b>Carborundum</b> companies to further develop diamond synthesis. They were able to heat carbon to about [...] under a pressure of [...] for a few seconds. Soon thereafter, the Second World War interrupted the project. It was resumed in 1951 at the Schenectady Laboratories of GE, and a high-pressure diamond group was formed with Francis P. Bundy and H.M. Strong. Tracy Hall and others joined this project shortly thereafter.|$|E

They weigh , {{and the total}} train weight is limited to [...] This also gives the trains a short length of [...] The trains had a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement. In addition to air brakes for the whole train, the locomotives are equipped with rheostatic brakes which is sufficiently powerful {{to allow for the}} 5.5 percent gradient. When braking, three of the motors are connected to the air-cooled resistance on the roof, while the last motor is connected to deliver magnetization current to the other three motors. The braking is regulated with 22 steps. As a backup, the units are equipped with a <b>carborundum</b> track brake {{on each side of the}} bogies.|$|E
500|$|Wide-scale {{production}} is credited to Edward Goodrich Acheson in 1890. Acheson was [...] attempting to prepare artificial diamonds when he heated {{a mixture of}} clay (aluminium silicate) and powdered coke (carbon) in an iron bowl. [...] He called the blue crystals that formed <b>carborundum,</b> believing {{it to be a}} new compound of carbon and aluminium, similar to corundum. [...] In 1893, Ferdinand Henri Moissan discovered the very rare naturally occurring SiC mineral while examining rock samples found in the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona. [...] The mineral was named moissanite in his honor. [...] Moissan also synthesized SiC by several routes, including dissolution of carbon in molten silicon, melting a mixture of calcium carbide and silica, and by reducing silica with carbon in an electric furnace.|$|E
500|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision grinding machines in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] The <b>Carborundum</b> Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|E
2500|$|The Cowles {{facility}} in England {{became part of}} British Aluminium in the late 1880s. In 1893, after Eugene's death, Maybery questioned a presentation that to him indicated the Cowles patents were infringed by the <b>carborundum</b> process of Edward Acheson (Acheson process). In 1900 Cowles received a $300,000 payment from the <b>carborundum</b> company. The judges' decision gave [...] "priority broadly to the Messrs. Cowles for reducing ores and other substances by the incandescent method".|$|E
2500|$|The Journal of Archaeological Science {{published}} a detailed {{study by the}} British Museum and the Smithsonian in May 2008. Using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a team of British and American researchers found that the British Museum skull was worked with a harsh abrasive substance such as corundum or diamond, and shaped using a rotary disc tool made from some suitable metal. The Smithsonian specimen had been worked with a different abrasive, namely the silicon-carbon compound <b>carborundum</b> (Silicon carbide) which is a synthetic substance manufactured using modern industrial techniques. Since the synthesis of <b>carborundum</b> dates only to the 1890s and its wider availability to the 20th century, the researchers concluded [...] "he suggestion {{is that it was}} made in the 1950s or later".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Smithsonian Skull", Catalogue No. A562841-0 in the {{collections}} of the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, was mailed to the Smithsonian Institution anonymously in 1992, and was claimed to be an Aztec object by its donor and was purportedly {{from the collection of}} Porfirio Diaz. It is the largest of the skulls, weighing [...] and is [...] high. [...] It was carved using <b>carborundum,</b> a modern abrasive. It has been displayed as a modern fake at the National Museum of Natural History.|$|E
2500|$|Areas where Mellon's backing created giant {{enterprises}} included aluminum, industrial abrasives ("carborundum"), and coke. Mellon financed Charles Martin Hall, whose refinery {{grew into}} the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa). He became the partner of Edward Goodrich Acheson in manufacturing silicon carbide, a revolutionary abrasive, in the <b>Carborundum</b> Company. He created an entire industry through his help to Heinrich Koppers, inventor of coke ovens which transformed industrial waste into usable {{products such as}} coal-gas, coal-tar, and sulfur. [...] He also became an early investor in the New York Shipbuilding Corporation.|$|E
2500|$|Stilwell {{is often}} remembered by his sobriquet, [...] "Vinegar Joe", which he {{acquired}} while a commander at Fort Benning, Georgia. Stilwell often gave harsh critiques of performance in field exercises, and a subordinate – stung by Joe's caustic remarks – drew {{a caricature of}} Stilwell rising out of a vinegar bottle. After discovering the caricature, Stilwell pinned it to a board and had the drawing photographed and distributed to friends. Yet another indication of his view of life was the motto he kept on his desk: Illegitimi non <b>carborundum,</b> a form of fractured Latin that translates as [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down." ...|$|E
2500|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{was first}} made by Edward Goodrich Acheson in 1891, who named it <b>carborundum</b> to {{reference}} its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between diamond (an allotrope of carbon) and corundum (aluminium oxide). He soon founded {{a company to}} manufacture it, and today about one million tonnes are produced each year. Silicon carbide exists in about 250 crystalline forms. The polymorphism of SiC {{is characterized by a}} large family of similar crystalline structures called polytypes. They are variations of the same chemical compound that are identical in two dimensions and differ in the third. Thus, they can be viewed as layers stacked in a certain sequence. It is made industrially by reduction of quartz sand with excess coke or anthracite at 2000–2500°C in an electric furnace: ...|$|E
2500|$|Yet another {{effort to}} clean the marbles {{occurred}} in 1937–38. This time the incentive {{was provided by the}} construction of a new Gallery to house the collection. The Pentelic marble, from which the sculptures are made, naturally acquires a tan colour similar to honey when exposed to air; this colouring is often known as the marble's [...] "patina" [...] but Lord Duveen, who financed the whole undertaking, acting under the misconception that the marbles were originally white probably arranged for the team of masons working in the project to remove discolouration from some of the sculptures. The tools used were seven scrapers, one chisel and a piece of <b>carborundum</b> stone. They are now deposited in the British Museum's Department of Preservation. The cleaning process scraped away some of the detailed tone of many carvings. According to Harold Plenderleith, the surface removed in some places may have been as much as one-tenth of an inch (2.5mm).|$|E

50|$|Citing {{a lack of}} {{patience}} and methodical ways, Goetz invented <b>carborundum</b> printmaking in the 1960s. In 1968, La gravure au <b>carborundum,</b> a treatise on <b>carborundum</b> printing, was published by the Maeght Gallery. It was prefaced by Joan Miró. Goetz created many abstract prints using this method. Other artists such as Antoni Clavé, Antoni Tàpies, and in particular, Joan Miró, employed <b>carborundum</b> printing in their work. The technique has since been used by printmakers around the world.|$|E
