5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never <b>came,</b> <b>and</b> on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result of Austria's defeat, Kaiser Franz Joseph was forced to accede to Hungarian demands for greater autonomy, and the country became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867. The two halves of the Dual Monarchy held veto power over the other, and Hungarian disinterest in naval expansion led to severely reduced budgets for the fleet. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E

5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale <b>came</b> <b>and</b> killed him.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on {{the cause of his}} illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never <b>came,</b> <b>and</b> he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors {{told him that he}} would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert.

Fevers <b>came</b> <b>and</b> went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E

Though former councillor William Harold Clark was urged to run by a group of citizens, Armstrong would be the only nominated mayoral candidate when nomination deadline day <b>came,</b> <b>and</b> thus he was acclaimed mayor; the first occurrence since Kenneth W. MacKenzie was acclaimed in 1900. Amongst his supporters for his candidacy were outgoing mayor Robert Lee and former mayor Charles May.|$|E

5|$|In 1968 a new {{committee}} was formed, {{under which the}} club emerged from the doldrums.

5|$|In 973, Dunstan's statesmanship {{reached its}} zenith when he officiated at the {{coronation}} of King Edgar.

This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle forms the basis of the present-day British coronation ceremony. There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an important step, as other kings of Britain <b>came</b> <b>and</b> gave their allegiance to Edgar at Chester. Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of Strathclyde, pledged their faith that they would be the king's liege-men on sea and land.|$|E

Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of London society, including Alexandra, Princess of Wales.|$|E

There is also a visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became home to Vietnamese people who left their war-torn country.

5|$|Merrick {{concluded}} that his only {{escape from the}} workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions. He knew of a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named Sam Torr. Merrick wrote to Torr, who <b>came</b> <b>and</b> visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided {{that he could make}} money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, {{he would have to be}} a travelling exhibit. To this end, he organised a group of managers for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Bonnet's crew {{represented}} him {{as being}} a leader, and it appears likely that, after his rescue of Blackbeard's marooned crewmen, he became at least a co-equal commander aboard the Royal James. He {{appears to have been}} entrusted with the company's treasure, and made most major command decisions such as the direction of the ship and what vessels to attack. Most significantly, at Delaware Bay he ordered two of his crew to be flogged for breaches of discipline. Pirates did not lightly submit to flogging, as they resented the frequent use of this punishment in the naval and merchant services from which most of them <b>came,</b> <b>and</b> thus only a leader who commanded the obedience of his crew could successfully order such penalties.|$|E
