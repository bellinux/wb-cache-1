25|$|A schema (pl. schemata) is {{the mental}} {{framework}} that is created as children {{interact with their}} physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret {{and respond to the}} same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.|$|E

500|$|Thome's {{friendly}} personality {{has been}} the subject of much attention. In a 2007 poll of 464 MLB players, he tied with Mike Sweeney for second-friendliest player, behind Sean Casey. After Thome hit his 600th home run, Twins closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "He is the world's nicest man." [...] Teammate Michael Cuddyer added, [...] "He is the nicest, gentlest, kindest guy you will ever meet... to everything except the baseball, he still hits that really hard." [...] His kindness <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> conversations with many MLB players. When he signed with the Phillies in the offseason before the 2012 season, Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. cited Thome's constant positive attitude as a main reason for his signing. As an exercise in remaining humble, he annually visited his high school prior to spring training. A Sports Illustrated article said that Thome frequently signs autographs for fans and that he is [...] "endlessly patient with requests". In a piece for Philadelphia magazine discussing Thome's Baseball Hall of Fame prospects, sportswriter Stephen Silver wrote, [...] A fan poll in The Plain Dealer in 2003 named him the most popular athlete in Cleveland sports history.|$|E

His successor, Pope Peter II becomes Pontifex Maximus of Enigma Babylon One World Faith, an amalgamation of all remaining world faiths and religions.|$|E

2500|$|Default {{reasoning}} and the qualification problem: Many {{of the things}} people know {{take the form of}} [...] "working assumptions". For example, if a bird <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} [...] "fictitious force" [...] <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Einstein's {{general theory of}} relativity. All fictitious forces are {{proportional}} to {{the mass of the}} object upon which they act, which is also true for gravity. [...] This led Albert Einstein to wonder whether gravity was a fictitious force as well. He noted that a freefalling observer in a closed box {{would not be able to}} detect the force of gravity; hence, freefalling reference frames are equivalent to an inertial reference frame (the equivalence principle). Following up on this insight, Einstein was able to formulate a theory with gravity as a fictitious force; attributing the apparent acceleration of gravity to the curvature of spacetime. This idea underlies Einstein's theory of general relativity. See Eötvös experiment.|$|E
2500|$|The name Baphomet <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{several of}} these confessions. Peter Partner states in his 1987 book The Knights Templar and their Myth, [...] "In {{the trial of the}} Templars one of their main charges was their {{supposed}} worship of a heathen idol-head known as a 'Baphomet' ('Baphomet' = Mahomet)." [...] The description of the object changed from confession to confession. Some Templars denied any knowledge of it. Others, under torture, described it as being either a severed head, a cat, or a head with three faces. The Templars did possess several silver-gilt heads as reliquaries, including one marked capud m,, et dicta ossa assimilabantur ossibus capitis parvi muliebris, et dicebatur ab aliquibus quod erat capud unius undecim millium virginum." [...] another said to be St. Euphemia, and possibly the actual head of Hugues de Payens. The claims of an idol named Baphomet were unique to the Inquisition of the Templars. Karen Ralls, author of the Knights Templar Encyclopedia, argues that it is significant that [...] "no specific evidence [...] appears in either the Templar Rule or in other medieval period Templar documents." ...|$|E

2500|$|A skew-symmetric graph may {{equivalently}} {{be defined}} as the double covering graph of a polar graph (introduced by , , called a switch graph by [...] ), which is an undirected graph in which the edges incident to each vertex are partitioned into two subsets. Each vertex of the polar graph corresponds to two vertices of the skew-symmetric graph, and each edge of the polar graph corresponds to two edges of the skew-symmetric graph. This equivalence is the one used by [...] to model problems of matching in terms of skew-symmetric graphs; in that application, the two subsets of edges at each vertex are the unmatched edges and the matched edges. Zelinka (following F. Zitek) and Cook visualize the vertices of a polar graph as points where multiple tracks of a train track come together: if a train enters a switch via a track that comes in from one direction, it must exit via a track in the other direction. [...] The problem of finding non-self-intersecting smooth curves between given points in a train track <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> testing whether certain kinds of graph drawings are valid [...] and may be modeled as the search for a regular path in a skew-symmetric graph.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to judge {{the degree to which}} ordinary people change to using metric in their daily lives. [...] In countries that have recently changed, older segments of the population tend to still use the older units. [...] Also, local variations abound in which units are round metric quantities or not. [...] In Canada, for example, ovens and cooking temperatures are usually measured in degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius. [...] Except for in cases of import items, all recipes and packaging include both Celsius and Fahrenheit, so Canadians are typically comfortable with both systems of measurement. [...] This extends to manufacturing, where companies are able to use both imperial and metric units, since the major export market is the U.S., but metric is required for both domestic use and for nearly all other export. [...] This {{may be due to the}} overwhelming influence of the neighbouring United States; similarly, many English Canadians (unlike most French Canadians) still often use non-metric measurements in day-to-day discussions of height and weight, and for clothing sizes, which are invariably measured in inches, though most driver's licences and other official government documents record weight and height only in metric (Saskatchewan driver licences, prior to the introduction of the current one-piece licence, indicated height in feet and inches but have switched to centimetres following the new licence format). [...] In Canadian schools, however, metric is the standard, except when it <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> recipes, where both are included, or in practical lessons involving measuring wood or other materials for manufacturing. [...] In the United Kingdom, degrees Fahrenheit are seldom encountered (except when some people talk about hot summer weather), while other metric units are often used in conjunction with older measurements, and road signs use miles rather than kilometres. [...] Another example is [...] "hard" [...] and [...] "soft" [...] metric. [...] Canada converted liquid dairy products to litre, 500mL, and 250mL sizes, which caused some complaining at the time of the conversion, as a litre of milk is slightly over 35 imperial fluid ounces, while the former imperial quart used in Canada was 40ounces. [...] This is an example of a [...] "hard" [...] metric conversion. [...] Conversely, butter in Canada is sold primarily in a 454g package, which converts to one Imperial pound. This is considered a [...] "soft" [...] metric conversion. [...] Such countries could be said to be [...] "semi-metric". [...] However, unlike in the rest of Canada, metrication in the Francophone province of Quebec has been more implemented and metric measures are more consistently used in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada.|$|E
