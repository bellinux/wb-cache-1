40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{contrast}} test has <b>been</b> done on <b>the</b> brake linings {{that have been}} made by water granulating technology. As a result, by contrast with the brake linings that have <b>been</b> done at <b>the</b> same material and producing technology, it was preliminary demonstrated that the apparent porosity of the brake linings that have <b>been</b> made by <b>the</b> granulating technology <b>could</b> <b>be</b> enhanced greatly, so on the hot-pressing process, products exhausting has <b>been</b> easy, <b>the</b> die cavity volume <b>could</b> <b>be</b> decreased, <b>the</b> hot-pressing time <b>could</b> <b>been</b> shorten, <b>the</b> production efficiency <b>could</b> <b>be</b> enhanced, <b>the</b> natural frequency of <b>the</b> braking lining <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reduced, <b>the</b> possibility of <b>the</b> braking noise <b>could</b> <b>be</b> decreased...|$|R

An alternative theory suggests that Beonna and Beornred may perhaps have been kinsmen from the same dynasty with ambitions to rule in both Mercia and East Anglia. No known member of the Wuffingas dynasty had a name commencing with B, but several Mercian rulers, including Beornred, used the letter.|$|E
