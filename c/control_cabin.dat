5|$|During 1958–1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward <b>control</b> <b>cabin.</b> Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E

25|$|A {{proof of}} concept {{prototype}} was built with a 4.02inch (102mm) barrel, but otherwise was as intended. It was mostly automatic, and could be operated by a single person sitting in a covered <b>control</b> <b>cabin</b> on the right hand side of the vehicle. However, the enormous power and ammunition requirements for the piece resulted in it having to have two trailers in support - one for power, and one for ammunition - and a crew with a small crane in order to reload the two ammunition drums. With only 28 rounds available in the drums, and an 80-90 rounds/minute fire rate, reloading was a frequent task. It took a crew between ten and fifteen minutes to reload.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September 1925, Shenandoah {{departed}} Lakehurst on {{a promotional}} {{flight to the}} Midwest that would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs. Testing of a new mooring mast at Dearborn, Michigan, {{was included in the}} schedule. While passing through an area of thunderstorms and turbulence over Ohio early in the morning of 3 September, during its 57th flight, the airship was caught in a violent updraft that carried it beyond the pressure limits of its gas bags. It was torn apart in the turbulence and crashed in several pieces near Caldwell, Ohio. Fourteen crew members, including Commander Zachary Lansdowne, were killed. This included every member of the crew of the <b>control</b> <b>cabin</b> (except for Lieutenant Anderson, who escaped before it detached from the ship); two men who fell through holes in the hull; and several mechanics who fell with the engines. There were twenty-nine survivors, who succeeded in riding three sections of the airship to earth. The largest group was eighteen men who made it out of the stern after it rolled into a valley. Four others survived a crash landing of the central section. The remaining seven were in the bow section which Commander (later Vice Admiral) Charles E. Rosendahl navigated as a free balloon. In this group was Anderson who—until he was roped in by the others—straddled the catwalk over a hole.|$|E
500|$|Northwich railway viaduct spans {{both the}} lock cut and the weir stream, and {{was built in}} the 1860s. It {{consists}} of 48 round arches, constructed of blue bricks and red sandstone, with iron spans over the channels. It is around [...] long, provides [...] of headroom over the navigation, and also crosses the River Dane. Hayhurst swing bridge carries the A5509 road over the navigation, and was manufactured by A Handyside and Co. Ltd., of Derby and London, in 1899. It is an asymmetric bowstring lattice girder bridge, and its timber-framed weatherboarded <b>control</b> <b>cabin</b> is also listed. This and Town bridge, which is located a little further downstream and is of a similar design, are believed to be the two earliest swing bridges in Britain to be powered by electricity. Both bridges were designed by J. A. Saner, who was the Navigation's engineer, and incorporate a sectional pontoon, which is immersed in the river and carries about 80 per cent of the weight of the bridge. Because of the risk of subsidence from the salt workings, the bridges are fitted with screw jacks which allow the deck level to be maintained. Hayhurst bridge was refurbished in 2004 at a cost of £33.5 million. Winnington bridge, the next downstream, was built between 1908 and 1909, to replace the first bridge which was built in 1901. The original design was flawed, and hence the bridge was replaced after only 7 years. A pedestrian walkway was later fitted on the downstream side of the new bridge.|$|E
25|$|After the disaster, airship hulls were strengthened, <b>control</b> <b>cabins</b> {{were built}} into the keels rather than {{suspended}} from cables, and engine power was increased. More attention was also paid to weather forecasting.|$|R

LZ 54 had two gondolas, a <b>control</b> <b>cabin</b> forward with a single engine and rear gondola mounting the other three engines.

[...] The bridge <b>control</b> <b>cabin</b> also functioned as an interlocking tower for the junction with the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway (located a short distance west of the bridge), as well as a crossover immediately west of the bridge, [...] the at-grade crossing of the Niagara, St. Catharines & Toronto Electric Railway (N, S & T), and sidings {{on both sides of the}} canal. [...] The N, S & T line was abandoned in the 1960s, but the other interlocking remained until the canal relocation in 1972/73. [...] Accordingly, the bridge would have needed to be manned year round - even when the canal was closed for the winter.|$|E
