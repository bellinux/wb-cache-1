25|$|In Section II, Kant {{starts from}} scratch and {{attempts}} to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the Groundwork by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that even when we take ourselves to be behaving morally, we cannot be at all <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves {{when it comes to}} evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they are acting merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the fact that we see ourselves as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.|$|E
500|$|To avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took {{a low-key}} {{approach}} to promoting In Utero; the company's {{head of marketing}} told Billboard before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy {{similar to that of}} Nevermind, and explained that the label would [...] "set things up, duck, {{and get out of the}} way". [...] The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. [...] In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Uteros singles commercially in the United States. [...] DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single, [...] "Heart-Shaped Box", to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio. [...] Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that In Utero would not be as successful as Nevermind. [...] Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, [...] "We're <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 31 July 2008, U.S. Navy {{acquisition}} {{officials told}} Congress {{that the service}} needed to purchase more s, and no longer needs the next-generation DDG-1000 class, Only the two approved destroyers would be built. The Navy said the world threat picture had changed {{in such a way}} that it now makes more sense to build at least eight more Burkes, rather than DDG-1000s. The Navy concluded from fifteen classified intelligence reports that the DDG-1000s would be vulnerable to forms of missile attacks. Many Congressional subcommittee members questioned that the Navy completed such a sweeping re-evaluation of the world threat picture in just a few weeks, after spending some 13 years and $10 billion on the development of the surface ship program known as DD-21, then DD(X), and finally DDG-1000. Subsequently, Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead cited the need to provide area air defense and specific new threats such as ballistic missiles and the possession of anti-ship missiles by groups such as Hezbollah. The mooted structural problems have not been discussed in public. Navy Secretary Donald Winter said on 4 September that [...] "Making <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have – I'll just say, a destroyer – in the '09 budget is more important than whether that’s a DDG 1000 or a DDG 51".|$|E

2500|$|After {{fighting}} {{in the spring and}} summer of 1800, the French army of Jean Victor Marie Moreau and Austrian army of Paul Kray signed an armistice on 15 July. On 12 November 1800, the French notified the Austrians that hostilities would start in 15 days. By this time, Moreau's army numbered 107,469 men and was flanked on the left by a 16,260-strong Franco-Dutch army and on the right by 18,602 French soldiers in Switzerland. Most of these troops were veterans led by experienced officers and operating in well-organized and well-equipped formations. Hardy wrote his wife, [...] "The army is superb... this time it is <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will not sheath our sword until peace is signed." [...] Unlike the usual French practice of having the soldiers live off the land, each division was trailed by a wagon train with seven days of food. Grenier's Left Wing consisted of three divisions, the 1st under Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand, the 2nd led by Ney and the 3rd commanded by Hardy. The 6,315-strong 3rd Division was made up of three battalions each of the 53rd and 89th Line Infantry Demi-brigades, three squadrons each of the 13th and 17th Cavalry Regiments and four squadrons each of the 2nd Dragoon and 23rd Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments. The division's 16 field pieces were manned by the 2nd Company of the 7th Horse Artillery, 4th Company of the 8th Horse Artillery and 15th Company of the 5th Foot Artillery.|$|E
