40|$|The {{patient is}} a {{previously}} healthy 52 -year-old woman who presented with dyspepsia for two months. Multiple imaging modalities including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) showed diffuse bile duct dilatation with an obstructive lesion of the distal extrahepatic biliary duct (EHD) {{as well as two}} masses in the peripancreatic area. The peripancreatic masses appeared cystic with posterior acoustic enhancement on ultrasound, low density on CT imaging, and high signal intensity on T 2 -weighted MRI. The lesion in the distal EHD exhibited similar characteristics on CT and MRI. A Whipple procedure was performed and histological specimens showed malignant cells with large mucin pools that was consistent with a diagnosis of <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the EHD with metastatic lymphadenopathies. <b>Colloid</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> also called mucinous carcinoma, is classified as a histologic variant of adenocarcinoma. Because the <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the biliary tree is exceedingly rare, the imaging characteristics and the clinical features of <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> remain relatively unknown.

40|$|<b>Colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> (pure mucinous carcinoma) is an {{uncommon}} variant of breast carcinoma with distinctive cytological and histological features.

The fine-needle aspiration cytology helps to subcategorize the tumor type, thereby enhancing the knowledge about the distinctive cytological features of special and uncommon variants of breast carcinoma, their course and prognosis. A distinctive micropapillary variant of pure mucinous carcinoma which is rarely described, is represented in one of the cases.

40|$|Intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are mucin producing cystic neoplasms of {{the pancreas}} histologically classified as having non-invasive and invasive components. The five-year survival rates for non-invasive and associated invasive carcinoma are 90 % and 40 %, respectively in resected IPMN lesions. Invasive carcinoma within IPMN lesions {{can be further}} classified by histological subtype into <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and tubular carcinoma. Estimated five-year survival rates following resection of <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> range from 57 %- 83 % and estimated five-year survival following resection of tubular carcinoma range from 24 %- 55 %. The difference in survival outcome between invasive colloid and tubular IPMN {{appears to be a}} function of disease biology, as patients with the tubular subtype tend to have larger tumors with a propensity for metastasis to regional lymph nodes. When matched to resected conventional pancreatic adenocarcinoma lesions by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center pancreatic adenocarcinoma nomogram, the <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> histological subtype has an improved estimated five-year survival outcome compared to conventional pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 87 % and 23 % (P = 0. 0001), respectively. Resected lesions with the tubular carcinoma subtype overall have a similar five-year survival outcome compared to conventional pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, when these groups were stratified by regional lymph node status patients with negative regional lymph nodes and the tubular subtype experienced significantly better survival than patients with a similar nodal status and ductal adenocarcinoma with estimated five-year survival rates of 73 % and 27 % (P = 0. 01), respectively...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ultrasound}} {{signs of}} breast masses are {{explained by the}} histopathological data. Ultrasound masses are classified according to their shape and margin. Round or oval masses are benign when their margins are circumscribed (fibroadenoma, intramammary lymph node); on the other hand, with non-circumscribed margins (microlobulated or irregular), masses that are round or oval may be cancers. Seven histological types of round cancers have been identified: grade III invasive ductal <b>carcinoma,</b> <b>colloid</b> or mucinous <b>carcinoma,</b> medullary carcinoma, intramammary metastases, intracystic papillary carcinoma, lymphoma and high-grade phyllodes tumors.

40|$|This paper {{underlines the}} interrelations between tumoral cells and the extra-cellular matrix in breast cancers with {{possible}} {{applications for the}} diagnosis and the prognosis. In mammary carcinomas, {{the first step of}} tumoral invasion is characterized by the loss of basement membrane components, particularly type IV collagen and laminin. Immunohistochemical detection of these disruptions of basement membrane is easy and useful for the diagnosis of "in situ" or microinvasive carcinomas. Laminin seems also to facilitate the adhesion of cancer cells to type IV collagen, and the dosage of its fragment P 1 in the blood serum may be a good marker for the follow up of the patients. Stromal reaction involves many intricate macromolecules of the extra-cellular matrix. Types I and III collagens are often present in non <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Rate, turn over of elastin and its prognostic value are still debated. Elastosis is related to well differentiated carcinomas and the presence of estrogen receptors. The stroma of the colloid form of breast cancer is rich in proteoglycans. Malignant and stromal cells, through the intermediary of cytokines, can synthesize these macromolecules. Hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are abundant in mammary carcinomas and form a favorable substrate for the growth and the migration of malignant cells. However, proteases decrease and limit their action. The presence of fibronectin, principally in the stroma, is difficult to interpret but fibronectin seems {{to play a role in}} tumoral retraction.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the cell-cell {{adhesion}} molecules P- and E-cadherin have shown that P-cadherin is not expressed in breast cancer. In contrast, the expression of E-cadherin is a normal event in these tumors, but {{a reduction in the}} levels of this molecule in neoplastic cells is associated with the histological type, high histological grade, greater tumor size, and metastasis. The expression pattern of P- and E-cadherin were immunohistochemically studied in tissue sections from normal breast tissue, benign breast lesions, and 57 infiltrating breast carcinomas. Cadherin expression was analyzed in parallel with pathological features and the immunohistochemical expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast carcinomas. P-cadherin was detected in the myoepithelial cells and E-cadherin in luminal epithelial cells from normal breast and benign breast lesions. P-cadherin expression was detected in 9 of 45 cases (20 %) of infiltrating ductal carcinomas of no special type; none of the special histological types that were analyzed (7 infiltrating lobular <b>carcinomas,</b> 3 <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and 2 infiltrating papillary carcinomas) expressed P-cadherin. In infiltrating ductal carcinomas, P-cadherin expression correlated significantly with a reduction in E-cadherin expression, histological grade (all cases were grade III tumors), and hormone receptor content (8 of 9 cases were estrogen and progesterone receptor negative). Although E-cadherin was not found in the 7 infiltrating lobular carcinomas, it was present in the remaining histological types and was preserved in 15 infiltrating ductal and 3 colloid and 2 papillary carcinomas and was reduced in 30 infiltrating ductal carcinomas. In addition, a reduction in E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with high histological grade and a lack of steroid hormone receptors in infiltrating ductal carcinomas. No apparent relationship was found between P- and E-cadherin expression and tumor size and axillary lymph node metastasis. The distinct patterns of P- and E-cadherin expression observed in this study strongly suggest a differential role for these cadherins in human breast carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Herein we {{describe}} the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 13 primary mucinous (<b>colloid)</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (MCs) of the lung, an uncommon and controversial tumor. The patients, 7 males and 6 females, {{ranged in age from}} 50 to 79 years (mean, 64. 5 years). All the tumors presented as a peripheral solitary nodule with gelatinous cut-surface and well circumscribed but lacking a complete fibrous wall. The size ranged from 1 to 5. 5 cm. Microscopically, they consisted of neoplastic elements floating in large mucin pools and focally lining the alveolar spaces. Eleven cases were predominantly composed of tall, columnar goblet cells (goblet cell-type MC), while 2 consisted of signet-ring tumor cells (signet-ring cell-type MC). Five tumors were incidentally discovered by chest radiographs, while the others were symptomatic. All patients underwent complete surgical resection (six lobectomies and seven wedge resections). Postoperative chemotherapy was performed in 3 cases. Overall, the median follow-up was 26 months (mean 33 months; range 9 - 95 months). All patients with goblet cell-type MC were alive and well, while the 2 patients with signet-ring cell-type MC died of disease. Immunohistochemically, all the 11 goblet cell-type MCs were strongly stained with CDX- 2 and MUC 2, 8 reacted with TTF- 1, 6 with cytokeratin 20 (CK 20), 9 with cytokeratin 7 (CK 7), and 2 with MUC- 5 AC. Conversely, the two signet-ring cell-type MCs were stained with TTF- 1, CK 7, and MUC 5 AC but were negative for CDX- 2, MUC 2, and CK 20. Surfactant apoprotein-A (SP-A) was positive in four goblet cell-type and one signet-ring cell-type MC. When compared with 10 mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (m-BAC), the latter reacted with CK 7, CK 20, MUC 5 AC, TTF- 1, SP-A, CDX- 2, and MUC 2 in 100 %, 90 %, 100 %, 30 %, 10 %, 0 %, and 0 % of the cases, respectively. In summary, MC of the lung represents an entity with two distinct clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic variants: 1) the goblet cell-type, presenting a more indolent clinical behavior and frequently co-expressing markers of intestinal and pulmonary differentiation; and 2) the more aggressive signet-ring cell-type, which retains only markers of pulmonary origin. On morphologic and immunohistochemical grounds, MCs are easily distinguishable from m-BAC. Since goblet cell-type MC strongly stains with CDX 2, MUC 2, and CK 20, differential diagnosis with metastatic colorectal carcinoma is very challenging and requires appropriate clinical correlation...|$|R

40|$|Flat-type âbiliary intraepithelial {{neoplasia}} (BilIN) â and papillary-type âintraductal papillary neoplasm of the {{bile duct}} (IPN-B) â are proposed as precursors of invasive, perihilar intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Three carcinogenetic pathways are proposed: BilIN progressing to tubular adenocarcinoma, and IPN-B progressing to tubular adenocarcinoma or to <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Carcinogenesis via BilIN {{was characterized by}} mucin core protein 2 -/cytokeratin 20 -(MUC 2 -/CK 20 -) with MUC 1 expression, while carcinogenesis via IPN-B leading to tubular adenocarcinoma was associated with MUC 1 expression or that to <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> with MUC 1 -negativity. In both the BilIN and IPNB series, the expression of p 21, p 53, and cyclin D 1 was upregulated with histological progression. Interestingly, p 53 expression was upregulated at the invasive stage of BilIN, but was low in noninvasive BilIN, while p 53 expression was upregulated in IPN-B 1 and reached a plateau in IPN-B 2 and invasive ICC. Expression of p 16 INK 4 a, which was frequent in BilIN 1, was decreased in BilIN- 2 / 3 and invasive carcinoma. EZH 2 expression showed a stepwise increase from BilIN to invasive carcinoma. Membranous expression of Î²-catenin and E-cadherin was more markedly decreased in ICC with BilIN than in ICC with IPNB. Interestingly, disruption of the membranous distribution of Î²-catenin and E-cadherin seems to result in the invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells of BilIN and IPN-B expressing MMP- 7 and MT 1 -MMP. Increased expression of cyclin D 1 and c-myc was more frequent in the IPNB lineage than BilIN lineage, possibly related to the Wnt signaling pathway associated with the nuclear accumulation of Î²-catenin.

We evaluated the cases for cellularity, atypia, architecture and background. RESULTS: All cases were diagnostic of malignancy, characterized by atypical cells present predominantly in three-dimensional clusters and single cells, facilitating the diagnosis. The clusters had cell ball and papillarylike arrangements, like the morular growth pattern seen on histopathology. Apocrine cytology was present in 12 cases, focal mucin background in 5 and psamomma bodies in 2. The differential diagnosis includes primary papillary neoplasms of the breast, metastatic ovarian papillary serous carcinoma, apocrine and <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> of the breast, and intraductal carcinoma (micropapillary type).

30|$|Breast cancer spreads by contiguity, lymphatic channels, and blood-born metastases. The {{most common}} disseminated sites are the lungs, bones, and liver. Other common sites include {{the skin and}} brain, whereas uterine {{involvement}} is rare [16]. There are 10 cases described {{in the literature of}} breast carcinoma metastases to polyps, seven of them were related to tamoxifen [6, 8 â 12], but none were related to toremifene. The tumor was lobular carcinoma in five cases [7, 9 â 10, 12], ductal in four [4 â 6, 11], and apocrine in one [8]. Lobular carcinoma is the most common histological type of breast carcinoma metastasizing to the uterus. Presentation was vaginal bleeding in seven cases [4, 6, 8 â 10, 12], uterine enlargement in two [5, 7], and endometrial thickness in one [11]. The patientsâ ages ranged from 53 to 92 Â years (mean, 68 Â years). Of the five cases submitted to surgery [5 â 8, 11], there was endometrial involvement in one case [7] and bilateral ovarian involvement in one other [6]. Our case presented with endometrial thickness but the endometrium and cervix were also involved by the malignancy. Like in other cases [9 â 12], signet ring cells were present in the metastatic carcinoma.

Expression of PAX 8 in thyroid tissue is evaluated and compared with traditional thyroid markers which are thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor- 1 (TTF- 1). Materials and Methods: Consecutive tissue sections of non-neoplastic thyroid tissue (n = 131), adenomatous nodule (n = 26), follicular neoplasms (n = 25), papillary carcinoma (n = 13), medullary carcinoma (n = 6), poorly differentiated carcinoma (n = 16), undifferentiated carcinoma (n = 6), and benign parathyroid tissue (n = 15) were submitted for PAX 8, PAX 2, TTF- 1, and thyroglobulin immunostain. Staining extent (% of cells stained) and intensity (score 0 - 3) were evaluated. Results: PAX 2 was not seen in any specimens. Strong (intensity score 3) (and diffuse 100 % of cells) nuclear staining for PAX 8 was noted in every case of non-neoplastic thyroid tissue and differentiated thyroid tumors. Staining for TTF- 1 was similar to that of PAX 8 in term of frequency, but the extent and intensity were less for some variants of papillary carcinoma or less differentiated follicular neoplasms. Thyroglobulin was noted in every case of non-neoplastic thyroid tissue and differentiated thyroid tumors, but the staining (which is cytoplasmic) was weak and focal in 66 cases of them, and this staining was often masked by strong staining of the adjacent <b>colloid.</b> For undifferentiated <b>carcinoma,</b> PAX 8 was the only expressed marker, but in only 1 / 6 cases. For medullary carcinoma, PAX 8 was not seen in any case, but TTF- 1 and thyroglobulin were noted in 67 % and 33 % of cases, respectively. For parathyroid tissue, PAX 8 was noted in 80 % of cases, but the staining was weak and focal in each; TTF- 1 and thyroglobulin were not seen. Conclusions: (1) PAX 8 is a very sensitive marker for thyroid differentiation, regardless of diagnoses, (2) PAX 8 is the only available marker, albeit of limited sensitivity, for undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma, (3) Both PAX 8 and TTF- 1 are sensitive markers for thyroid differentiation; with a diagnostic advantage for PAX 8; and both are superior to thyroglobulin, (4) PAX 8 may be the only marker needed for evaluating thyroid differentiation, and (5) In spite of an ontogenic similarity with PAX 8, PAX 2 is not expressed by thyroid tissue.

Of these 82. 4 per cent were Hindus, 7. 3 per cent Muslims, 7. 4 percent Christians and 2. 7 percent Parsis. The mean age at diagnosis was 55 years for Parsis which was 7 to 8 years older than that for the other communities. There were no remarkable differences in histological tumour type or grade; except that parsis had higher incidence of uncommon histological types, such as dust carcinoma in situ and <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> and had a slightly more favourable grade distribution. When classified according to the TNM system (UICC 1978), the Parsis had the most favourable stage at presentation followed by Christians, Hindus and Muslims in that order.

40|$|Background: Grading and hormone {{receptor}} determination in breast carcinoma are predictive factors for response to hormonal therapy. Aim: This study was undertaken to grade breast carcinoma {{and to determine}} estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Furthermore, the objective was to compare the results with histological grading and immunohistochemistry on surgical material. Materials and Methods: Fifty cases of breast carcinoma diagnosed on FNAC were included. The cytological grading was done according to the Robinsonâ²s grading system. The corresponding histology sections were graded using the modified Bloom-Richardson system. Immunostaining for ER and PR was done on smears and tissue sections. Results: On both cytological and histological evaluation, 49 cases were infiltrating ductal carcinoma and one case was <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> On comparing cytological and histological grading, 78 % were correctly graded on cytology. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for ER detection on immunocytochemistry (ICC) were 55. 6 %, 95 %, 93. 8 % and 61. 3 %, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for PR detection on ICC were 57. 7 %, 95. 2 %, 93. 8 % and 64. 5 %, respectively. The correlation for ER and PR between cytology and histology was 72. 3 % and 74. 5 %. Conclusion: The grading along with ER and PR immunostaining of breast carcinoma on smears is advocated because of high concordance between cytology and histology.

40|$|A ten-year {{follow-up}} study of 382 women with Stage I (T 1 N 0 M 0) breast carcinoma revealed recurrence and/or death due to cancer in 16 % of the patients. Among 134 patients (35 %) with a primary tumor 1. 0 cm {{or less in}} diameter (Group A), 7 % had recurrences and 5 % died of breast carcinoma. Recurrences were observed in 21 % of the 248 women with a tumor 1. 1 - 2. 0 cm in diameter (Group B), and 15 % died of disease. These differences in recurrence and mortality rates were statistically significant. All recurrences were due to infiltrating duct or lobular carcinoma which accounted for 91 % of the 382 carcinomas. Most strongly linked to recurrence was the finding of tumor emboli in lymphatics of the breast. This was found in 23 Group B patients and ten of them (43 %) died of disease. No recurrences were observed among the seven Group A patients with lymphatic emboli. Other features associated with a significantly increased risk of recurrence were poorly differentiated carcinoma, marked lymphoid reaction to tumor, and menarche before age 12 years or after age 14 years. No combination of variables proved to identify a subset of patients with an especially increased or low risk of recurrence. Stage I patients with lymphatic tumor emboli in the breast surrounding a carcinoma 1. 1 - 2. 0 cm in diameter have a sufficient risk for recurrence to warrant consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy.

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze changes in gastric cancer incidence patterns in a French well-defined population. Data on patients with an epithelial gastric cancer diagnosed between 1982 and 2011 were collected by the population-based digestive cancer registry of Burgundy (n = 4694). Time trends in gastric cancer incidence by period of diagnosis and birth cohort were analyzed by sex, subsite, and histological type. There was a decrease in incidence rates for antral carcinomas (- 2. 6 % per year in males, - 2. 5 % per year in females; p < 0. 001) and corpus carcinomas (- 3. 3 % and - 3. 2 %, respectively; p < 0. 001). Annual percentage changes were not significant for fundus carcinomas in both sexes and cardia carcinoma in females, although they increased in males (+ 1. 0 % per year; p < 0. 02). When comparing the 1900 cohort and the 1950 cohort, there was a five- to sevenfold decrease in the cumulative risk at 0 - 79 years for corpus and antral carcinomas in both sexes and a threefold decrease for fundus carcinomas. There were minor variations for cardia carcinomas. There was a decrease of incidence both by period of diagnosis and by birth cohort for adenocarcinoma and <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> It was more marked for undifferentiated carcinoma. The variation for signet-ring carcinoma was minor. Temporal variations in incidence rates of gastric cancer differed according to subsite and histology, suggesting different etiological factors. Available analytical studies provide an explanation for the reported trends by subsite...|$|E
40|$|Background:â Acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) is a {{major contributor}} to respiratory morbidity and mortality after oesophagectomy. Several pre-, intra- and post-operative factors are thought to predispose to its development in the post-oesophagectomy period. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine factors predisposing to ARDS in the post-oesophagectomy period. Methods:â A total of 112 patients who underwent elective oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer (gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia, 93; oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 16; oesophageal oat cell tumour, 1; oesophageal anaplastic carcinoma, 1; oesophageal <b>colloid</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> 1) between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2006 formed the study group in this retrospective study. The pre-, intra and post-operative data for these patients (male : female = 89 : 23, mean age 60. 8 years) were collected from an oesophagectomy database and hospital medical records. Results:â The incidence of ARDS was 13 %. The in-hospital mortality among ARDS cases was 20 % and 1 -year mortality was 40 %. Various factors such as preoperative chronic respiratory disease (P-value = 0. 000, odds ratio = 17. 76), smoking pack-years (P-value = 0. 045, odds ratio = 1. 02), abnormal preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s (P-value = 0. 009, odds ratio = 7. 97), high percentage of oxygen in inspired air (P-value = 0. 041, odds ratio = 1. 24) and use of perioperative inotropes (P-value = 0. 021, odds ratio = 4. 26) were associated with ARDS. Conclusions:â Preoperative physiological status as indicated by a preoperative history of chronic respiratory disease and preoperative pulmonary function influenced the post-operative outcome in our patients. The use of perioperative inotropes suggests perioperative cardiorespiratory instability, and could also predispose to the development of ARDS in the post-operative period. Diana J. Paul, Glyn G.
