40|$|This policy brief, {{written by}} Dr Christopher Hodges and Professor Stefan Vogenauer of Oxford University, is {{published}} as costs and funding are assuming far greater importance as keys to evaluating and {{providing access to}} justice. The findings were drawn upon by Lord Justice Jackson in his influential Costs Review which recommended moving to American style contingency fees, a recommendation that is widely expected to be implemented by the UK coalition government. The policy brief addresses the problem of maintaining fair and equal access to justice for all, whilst controlling cost and delay, a problem of particular relevance as governments across Europe are set to impose significant cuts in public expenditure {{as a consequence of}} the current economic climate.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{probably}} today 2 ̆ 7 s greatest global environmental threat, posing dire ecological, economic, and humanitarian consequences. In {{the absence of}} a comprehensive regulatory scheme to address the problem, some aggrieved Americans have sought relief from climate-related injuries by suing significant emitters of greenhouse gases under a public nuisance theory. Federal district courts have dismissed four such claims, with each court relying at least in part on the political question doctrine of nonjusticiability. However, one circuit court of appeals has reversed to date, finding that the common law cognizes such claims and that the judiciary is competent and compelled to adjudicate them. This Note argues that courts should dismiss climate-related public nuisance suits-at least those that seek injunctive caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Focusing on Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co. as a case in point, this Note concludes that such claims should be deemed nonjusticiable political questions or alternatively, should be dismissed for lack of redressability.

50|$|Prior to Donoghue v Stevenson {{liability}} for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly (trespass to the person) or indirectly (trespass on the case).

However, the decision fundamentally created {{a new type of}} liability in law which did not depend upon any previously recognised <b>category</b> <b>of</b> tortious <b>claims.</b> This was an evolutionary step in the common law for tort and delict, moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a fault-based system which only required injury.

40|$|In Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., the Supreme Court {{applied the}} {{presumption}} against extraterritorial application of U. S. law {{to hold that}} the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) did not encompass a claim between aliens for misconduct that occurred in another nation. Without much elaboration, the Court stated that the ATS only encompasses claims that “touch and concern {{the territory of the}} United States... with sufficient force to displace the presumption. ” As it did in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Kiobel Court purported to rest its decision on the original public meaning of the ATS when enacted in 1789. The Court, however, misperceived the original meaning of the statute by accepting two mistaken historical claims about the ATS advanced by academics and lower courts. First, the Court accepted the notion that incidents involving the rights of ambassadors prompted the First Congress to enact the ATS. Second, the Court endorsed the idea that the ATS was originally meant to cover only three “torts” that corresponded to the three criminal offenses against the law of nations emphasized by Blackstone in his Commentaries— namely, torts against ambassadors, violations of safe conducts, and claims relating to piracy. Both propositions lack substantial support in the historical record and oversimplify the political context in which the statute was enacted. To address incidents involving ambassadors, the First Congress enacted distinct jurisdictional and criminal provisions, including vesting original jurisdiction over claims by ambassadors in the Supreme Court. Indeed, the First Congress enacted specific jurisdictional and criminal provisions to address all three of the “Blackstone crimes. ” The ATS served a different purpose. Congress enacted the statute to cover a distinct <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> by foreign citizens against U. S. citizens for acts of violence that none of these other provisions adequately addressed. The Court’s reliance on these two myths in Sosa and Kiobel led it to misconstrue the ATS and, in certain respects, to unduly narrow the statute’s application. In future cases, the Court should abandon these myths and recognize that the ATS was originally meant to apply (1) to a broader range <b>of</b> tort <b>claims</b> by aliens, and (2) only to claims against U. S. citizens—a jurisdictional limitation that the Court has yet to address...|$|R

40|$|Climate change {{generates a}} {{conflict}} between generations: while {{it is in the}} interest of the current generation to continue to exploit inexpensive carbon-based fuel to drive economic growth, it {{is in the interest of}} future generations that we reduce our carbon emissions by making these fuels more expensive. This raises the following question: what moral framework should we use to adjudicate between the interests of different generations? In this work, I argue that the commonly used framework of "cost-benefit analysis"-the analytic framework for public policy that developed out of the field of welfare economics-fails as a normative framework for intergenerational policy. For one, by aggregating costs and benefits across all generations, it ignores that what matters is each generation. For another, by reducing all value into a unitary objective function, it ignores important distinctions between different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> moral <b>claims.</b> Third, by attempting to optimize a function across all time, it reflects a false sense of knowledge about the distant future. For all these reasons-and more-I conclude that this approach cannot offer a reasonable normative framework for intergenerational public policy. In its stead, I propose an "intergenerational threshold" principle which avoids aggregating generations together, gives space for different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> value, and, I will argue, is more robust to the epistemic limitations of intergenerational policy analysis. by Nathan R.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Discourse and Society [SAGE Publications Ltd. © The Author] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] article examines the way male suspects deny accusations of assaulting women in interrogations by police officers. It draws on a large corpus of British police interrogation materials, and uses conversation analysis to shed light on the location and design of, and responses to, suspects’ ‘category-based denials’ that they are not ‘the kind of men who hit women’. Two sections of analysis identify how, first, such denials routinely follow police officers’ direct questions about violent behaviour, and, second, how they become embedded in extended narratives that are not directly describing violence. In contrast to other discourse-analytic studies of men’s accounts of violence towards women, the article unpacks the component features that comprise what others might label grossly as the ‘discourse of gendered violence’. Rather than see how such ‘discourses’ operate in interview contexts, it shows how suspects construct, in a high-stakes setting for a particular purpose, different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> men, <b>claiming</b> membership in one (who do not hit women) by recruiting the notion of the other (who do). Thus, in addition to its contribution to the study of gender and violence, the article takes new steps in the ongoing development of membership categorization and conversation analysis, showcasing a type of systematic sequential analysis that can be done with membership categories...|$|R

40|$|The Polish Copyright Act {{provides}} for a number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> for copyright protection, including pecumiary claims i. e. claims seeking money payment. There are two claims falling under this category in article 79 sections 1 and 2. The first {{of them is a}} claim to pay a multiple salary (double or, in cases of culpable violation, triple remuneration at the time <b>of</b> making the <b>claim).</b> The other one, payable to the Art Promotion Fund by the person who committed a violation within the business activity performed on his own or another person’s behalf, payable even to somebody else’s account in the amount of at least double the probable benefits incurred by the violating party {{as a result of the}} violation. The Act also mentions claims to return the benefits incurred and claims to redress injuries committed in a culpable act. These claims can have either a pecuniary or non-pecuniary character (return of benefits in kind or redressing injuries by restoration of the former state). Such interpretation of the character <b>of</b> these <b>claims</b> results from respective provisions of the Polish Civil Code concerning unjust enrichment (art. 405) and redressing injuries (art. 363), but this interpretation can also be applied to the currently binding Act, irrespective of the view concerning the relation between claims under the Act and claims under the Civil Code. In the doctrine there is a dispute whether the claim to return incurred benefit, which is secured by consecutive copyright acts can be considered an unjust enrichment claim as understood in the civil code or rather a separate claim different in nature. The civil code appears to emphasise the non-pecuniary character of the unjust enrichment claim and claim for redressing injuries, since it primarily quotes return in kind (art. 405) and redressing injuries by restoration of the former state (art. 363 § 1 sentence 1). It may appear, however, that in copyright cases <b>claim</b> for return <b>of</b> benefits incurred and claim for redressing injuries will never have a non-pecuniary form due to the intangible character of the protected good. This is not entirely the case, however. It has long been known that such a claim to return incurred benefits in kind is an adjudicative claim i. e. one that seeks an adjudication granting the copyright bearer the objects that were subject to violation. The preceding copyright acts mentioned only unlawfully produced copies of work but at present under art. 80 section 3 such a claim can be applied only to objects used for unlawful production of copies of work or any other objects other than copies of work that were used for the violation. However, this claim is presently classified by definition as a non-pecuniary claim to remove the results of the violation, despite the fact that there are no sufficient grounds for such a claim in the Act in the area o f economic rights. Although such grounds is sometimes seen in art. 80 section 5, this provision can also be treated as a procedural counterpart <b>of</b> adjudicative <b>claim</b> taken from the material law. Such an adjudicative claim, when interpreted as a claim to remove the results of the violation rather than, alternatively, a claim to return the benefits incurred, fails to have sufficient legal grounds in the Act. On the other hand, it may be argued that the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> a <b>claim</b> for redressing injuries i. e. restitution claim includes a claim to render harmless, in particular to destroy the objects used for the purpose of unlawful production of copies of the protected work or any objects other than copies of the work that were used for the purpose of the violation. Also this claim seems to be a form of the by definition non-pecuniary claim to remove the results of the violation. Alternatively, it may also be seen as a (non-pecuniary) claim for desistence, clearly indicated in the Act among the claims available in cases of copyright violation (art. 79 section 1 in principio). It is therefore possible to include within the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> pecuniary <b>claims</b> only those <b>claims</b> for return <b>of</b> benefits or for redressing injuries that are based on a return of the benefit value and redressing injuries through payment, which will prove dominant in the case of copyright protection. With the above assumption the list <b>of</b> pecuniary <b>claims</b> resulting from the Copyright Act includes the following: • Claim to return benefits incurred, • Claim to pay multiple remuneration, • Claim to pay at least double probable benefit value; • Claim for redressing injuries. All the above claims can be accumulated except for the first two, which occur separately due to deeper historical reasons...|$|R
