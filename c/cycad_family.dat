50|$|Fronds are olive to yellow-green, {{and about}} 1m long, while {{leaflets}} are narrow (80-140 x 2-4 mm), with strongly revolute margins. Juvenile leaves {{are covered in}} greyish wool, becoming glabrous with age. Both male and female lemon-coloured cones are some 25 cm in length, occur in clusters of 2-5, and are densely woolly. Initially believed to be wind-pollinated, recent studies show that cones are pollinated mainly by the weevil family, and beetles from the Boganiidae, such as Metacucujus encephalarti. The Boganiidae are known only from South Africa and Australia, and this distribution, shared with the <b>cycad</b> <b>family,</b> indicates an ancient association between these insects and these plants. The beetles are strongly attracted by allomones produced in the early mornings and evenings by {{both male and female}} cones.|$|E
40|$|Macrozamia johnsonii D. Jones & K. Hill is {{a locally}} endemic <b>cycad</b> (<b>family</b> Zamiaceae) with a {{restricted}} occurrence in north-eastern New South Wales and currently listed as Endangered. Based on recent field surveys, its mean population size is estimated as approximately 3. 5 million mature plants, {{with the lower}} bound of the 95 % confidence interval at 1. 9 million mature plants. Thirty {{percent of the population}} occurs in a formal reserve. Macrozamia johnsonii occurs in grassy eucalypt forest, shrubby wet sclerophyll forest and in rainforest. It occurs most frequently on steeply sloping sites with high moisture index. There are no immediate significant threats to the species although timber harvesting is judged to be a potential longer term threat to part of the population. The conservation status of Macrozamia johnsonii is assessed using IUCN criteria and thresholds, using population size and extent data from this study and a plausible range of values based on available circumstantial evidence for parameters for which quantitative estimates are not available. Based on this assessment, we regard the conservation status of Macrozamia johnsonii to be in the category of Least Concern, and that its current listing as an Endangered species under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995) needs to be revised...|$|E
40|$|Macrozamia riedlei {{is a long}} lived, large seeded {{member of}} the <b>cycad</b> <b>family,</b> common to the Jarrah forest and Banksia {{woodlands}} within the Perth region of Western Australia. Because of the large size of the seeds (up to 50 mm), {{it is believed that}} large bodied herbivores are required to act as dispersal agents. Currently, the Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) is considered to be the primary dispersal agent for M. riedlei. Due to anthropogenic activities, much of the habitat of M. riedlei is becoming fragmented primarily through agricultural and residential land clearing. This leads to the potential restriction of long distance dispersal of seed, required for healthy gene flow and the ability for range expansion {{in the face of an}} uncertain climatic future. The aims of this study were to investigate the current population structure of M. riedlei at three locations within the Perth region and to identify dispersal agents and the distance they can disperse seeds. The sites chosen were Avon Valley, Sawyers Valley and Kings Park; these three sites were chosen since they present a gradient in emu population density, from abundant at Avon Valley to absent for a century at Kings Park. To ascertain how these three populations of M. riedlei were currently structured, all plants in replicate 50 x 50 m plots were recorded at each site and the data used to analyse the demographic and spatial structure of each population. Because of the gradient in emu population density, it was hypothesised that the spatial and demographic structure would differ at each site, due to the availability of emus to disperse the seeds of M. riedlei. The three study sites were shown to be very similar in population structure despite the difference in emu numbers. It was also found that the Australia Raven (Corvis coronoides) was capable of dispersing the seeds of M. riedlei over distances of up to 390 m, indicating that ravens are able to act as suitable dispersers of M. riedlei seeds and in the absence of emus maybe considered as a key dispersal agent...|$|E
