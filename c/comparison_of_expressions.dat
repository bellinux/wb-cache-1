According to the fact that constant control inputs make possible the representation of a bilinear system by a linear one, some propositions provide the sufficient conditions for active-bfprg (Bilinear Fundamental Problem of Residual Generation) in this particular case. These conditions are easy to check because they are based on the <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expressions</b> and on finding paths in a digraph...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{analyzed}} {{the role of}} the adverb "yappari" and the particle "ne" both of which are frequently used in conversational Japanese. We hypothesized that "yappari" and "ne" have the function of "in-group identity markers" and raise the politeness of the sentence. A survey wa cirulated and answered by 123 Japanese students and 75 learners of Japanese. The procedure of this study was follows: 1) establish 5 categories of personal relationships and corresponding levels of politeness used. 2) measure the degree of politeness used in "expression of request. " 3) establish the correlation between a particular expression of request and a corresponding level of politeness. 4) carry out the same analysis for expressions with "yappari" and "ne". 5) compare the results of the analysis of "expressions of requests" with the analysis of "expressions with 'yappari' and 'ne'. " Hypothesis testing and Spearman's rank correlation analysis verified our proposition. The <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expressions</b> suggests that the acquisition of the politeness function of "yappari" and "ne" is particularly dificult for the learner of Japanese...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a novel two-step method for <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> alternatively spliced genes by quantitative PCR (QPCR) applying different primer pairs. As a model system we used rat decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD 55) mRNA, which comprises three different isoforms: soluble (sDAF), transmembrane (tmDAF) and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored (gpiDAF) forms. The {{first step was}} to prepare solid phase specific for each mRNA isoform and purify the three DAF-forms from total RNA. We then assessed amplification efficiency of primer pairs designed to recognise each of the isoforms using equimolar amounts of the three purified DAF mRNAs. The final step in our assay was to compare <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the three DAF-isoforms in testis by QPCR taking into account the efficiency of their amplification to enable quantification. The RNA capture/QPCR method we described here can be used for quantifying the <b>expression</b> ratios <b>of</b> alternatively spliced mRNAs from a single gene or for direct <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> different genes...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Barbara J. Dougherty. Includes vita. This study {{investigated}} the differences in conceptions of variable among the groups of students identified as having a mathematics learning disability (MLD), other low mathematics achievement (LMA) students and typical mathematics achievement (TMA) students. This was done by analyzing the responses of these students on items involving the <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expressions</b> involving generalized quantities. The theoretical framework {{for this study was}} based upon the learning trajectory (LT) of the levels of sophistication of students' conceptions of variable. Data analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics. Results from the data analysis revealed little evidence of differences between MLD and LMA students. Differences between all students with mathematics difficulties (MD), including MLD and LMA students, and their TMA peers were primarily limited to items with higher procedural or operational complexity. The lack of significant differences between the MD and TMA students on other items suggests that most students' conceptions of variables are at a low level of sophistication. Furthermore, that students characterized by low-achievement and typical-achievement labels can have similarly low-levels of sophistication of conceptions of variables suggests that not only do the current measures of achievement provide an incomplete picture of students' understandings of algebra, but they also disproportionately disadvantage those labeled as low-achieving.

40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of aging is the stress of necessary adjustments in living arrangements which carry with it changes in social participation and dependency. These give rise to the phenomenon under investigation in this study: that of violence…often blatant, but sometimes muted. The literature speaks of an increase in the phenomenon worldwide which can be obscured in the non evident cases. This study attempts to surmount the obstacles not only by delving into the epidemiology, but investigating its significance and representations via the <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expressions</b> from a studied population in two countries: United States and Portugal. We present the partial results of a research using both qualitative and quantitative methodology that examines the social representations of elderly violence using the framework of Moscovici's Social Representation Theory. We analysed the thoughts of sixty participants divided into three categories : elderly individuals, family members and health workers. Content analysis was treated by the ALCESTE software that allows the comparison between the elements of the corpus of words or sentences. The results revealed the social representation of elderly violence for the subjects considering their cultural differences. It also highlights the importance of the reciprocity between individuals and the environment where violence occurs. In addition, evidences the lack of educational preparation of two main support pillars to the elderly: family and health professionals. The similarities of terms associated with violence points to the possibility of using a consensual concept proposed by the authors to promote preventative strategies while discussing the phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{high-throughput}} methods {{have made it}} possible to generate detailed temporal expression data for a single gene or large numbers of genes. Common methods for analysis of these large data sets can be problematic. One challenge is the <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> temporal <b>expression</b> data obtained from different growth conditions where the patterns <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> may be shifted in time. We propose the use of wavelet analysis to transform the data obtained under different growth conditions to permit <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> patterns from experiments that have time shifts or delays.

50|$|To {{quantify}} gene expression, the (Cq) for an RNA or DNA {{from the}} {{gene of interest}} is subtracted from the (Cq) of RNA/DNA from a housekeeping gene in the same sample to normalize for variation in the amount and quality of RNA between different samples. This normalization procedure is commonly called the ΔCt-method and permits <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> a gene of interest among different samples. However, for such <b>comparison,</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the normalizing reference gene needs to be very similar across all the samples. Choosing a reference gene fulfilling this criterion is therefore of high importance, and often challenging, because only very few genes show equal levels <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> {{across a range of}} different conditions or tissues. Although cycle threshold analysis is integrated with many commercial software systems, there are more accurate and reliable methods of analysing amplification profile data that should be considered in cases where reproducibility is a concern.|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} early mammalian development {{there is}} a need to compare profiles <b>of</b> gene <b>expression</b> from different stages of the preimplantation mouse embryo. We describe here a method that uses gene expression data held in the UniGene database of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The full mouse UniGene database (build # 151) contains 43 104 gene clusters generated from ∼ 4. 1 million sequences. The Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) used to build UniGene are derived from cDNA libraries that are archived separately in the database of Expressed Sequence Tags (dbEST) database, with their own catalogue numbers. The mouse dbEST database contains 32 non-normalized dbEST libraries constructed from preimplantation stages (unfertilized oocyte, fertilized oocyte, 2 -, 4 -, 8 - and 16 -cell embryo and blastocyst). These libraries contain 219 852 EST sequences mapping to 15 731 UniGene clusters. We have developed a computational pipeline approach that imports and aggregates inventories <b>of</b> gene <b>expression</b> contained in these dbEST libraries. It uses these data to build an annotated web-based database <b>of</b> preimplantation gene <b>expression</b> with an in-built capacity for <b>comparison</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> profiles. <b>Comparison</b> <b>of</b> gene <b>expression</b> profiles obtained for each developmental stage show statistically significant changes in gene expression during preimplantation development.
