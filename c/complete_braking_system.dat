40|$|The paper {{reports on}} a joined {{research}} project of Knorr-Bremse, Siemens Mobility and the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics. The goal {{of the project was}} to analyse the dynamical behaviour of friction brakes for high speed trains. It was intended to gain insight into possible vibration mechanisms and to assess the potential for lay-out and operation improvements for future light weight designs. In particular the frequency range up to 250 Hz has been addressed, since the corresponding excitation is unavoidable at least to some extent and has to be considered when the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is designed. The study includes a comprehensive multibody simulation study and its comparison to experimental results at the test rig of Knorr-Bremse in Munich.

Additionally a minimal model is introduced that demonstrates some characteristics of the <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> It turned out that the underlying knowledge is essential for the mechanical lay-out, which could be demonstrated by solving a particular vibration problem in an actual high-speed project. ...|$|R
40|$|Pneumatic <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> use {{pressurized}} air {{to apply the}} brakes and are used in trucks, amongst other vehicles. Due to the compressibility of the air, {{there is a time}} delay from the push-down of the brake pedal to the attainment of the desired brake effect. The time for the pressure in the brake cylinder to reach 75 % of its final pressure is subject to legal requirements, and this master thesis studies the possibilities to predict that time by simulation. The program GT-SUITE is chosen for the simulation, since it is shown to be suitable in a survey of potential software and an evaluation. Also, MATLAB is used to simulate an approximate system description. To support the modeling of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> components, measurements are made on a simple brake rig, gradually extended with common brake components which then can be modeled. Finally, the models are verified with a measurement on a <b>complete</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> In the simple rigs, the simulations are accurate and able to predict the effect of new components. Verifying the models, though, the simulation is not accurate enough. However, the simulation seems to give conservative results, which means that a truck that in simulation passes the certification is likely to pass it in reality too...|$|R

40|$|Brake {{propagation}} is slow {{for long}} freight trains that use a conventional air <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> If {{the train is}} too long then the brake application will not propagate throughout the whole train. Brake propagation {{is one of the}} factors that limit the length of current heavy haul freight trains using a conventional air <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> It is possible that a relatively simple modification to every wagon's brake valve could be done to ensure the brake signal is relayed throughout the train irrespective of the length of the train. The modification effectively increases the quick service volume or 'bulb' on Westinghouse style triple valves by connecting an additional volume and valve to the brake pipe. As each wagon's brakes apply, extra air will be taken from the brake pipe to fill the additional volume and thus ensuring the propagation of the brake signal {{to the rear of the}} train. The modification also has the advantage of reducing the time for the brakes to reach their final pressure, which reduces the train's stopping distance. A computer model of a <b>complete</b> train air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> developed through the Rail CRC is used to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the modification. Using air brake equipment at CQU, experimental tests have been conducted to determine the allowable size of the additional volume and show the stability of the modification...|$|R

It includes detailed studies of individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement. A full <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> performance and to design a <b>system</b> with better <b>brake</b> pedal ‘feel’.
