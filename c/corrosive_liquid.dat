Tommy finds and frees Kara, Danny, and Steven; they flee from Michael and hide in a laboratory. Regaining consciousness, Loomis helps Kara and the children escape the hospital. When Michael breaks into the room, Tommy injects him with a <b>corrosive</b> <b>liquid</b> and beats him unconscious with a lead pipe. As Tommy, Kara, Danny, and Steven leave, Loomis refuses to come with them as he has [...] "a little business to attend to”.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to being a highly <b>corrosive</b> <b>liquid,</b> hydrofluoric acid is also a powerful contact poison. [...] Because of the ability of hydrofluoric acid to penetrate tissue, poisoning can occur readily through exposure of skin or eyes, or when inhaled or swallowed. Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, and this can provide false reassurance to victims, causing them to delay medical treatment. Despite having an irritating odor, HF may reach dangerous levels without an obvious odor. HF interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful. Accidental exposures can go unnoticed, delaying treatment and increasing the extent and seriousness of the injury. Symptoms of HF exposure include irritation of the eyes, skin, nose, and throat, eye and skin burns, rhinitis, bronchitis, pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs), and bone damage.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{accounts}} {{claim that}} Genesis P-Orridge {{coined the term}} on the 1988 Psychic TV release “Tune In (Turn on the Acid House).” By other accounts, while shopping in Chicago in 1986, P-Orridge came across a bin of records marked acid, indicating a <b>corrosive</b> <b>liquid,</b> and mistook it for a reference to LSD. [...] P-Orridge allegedly bought the entire contents of the bin {{and went on to}} play them when DJing in Ibiza; and in so doing inadvertently introduced the Chicago sound to the MDMA-using, Osho-following [...] "orange people" [...] in attendance at the time. P-Orridge's role is disputed by music journalist Simon Reynolds, who calls it a [...] "self-serving myth", and by Psychic TV band member Fred Giannelli, who suggested that [...] "Gen has made this claim so [...] many times in interviews that he actually believes his own [...] bullshit." ...|$|E
40|$|United States Patent Number 8963565 Present {{invention}} concerns {{generally to}} a sensor or a sensor system for detecting spilling of aqueous liquids, {{for instance in}} conﬁned spaces were such is critical such in an airplane. The system of present invention is an early Warning system or sentinel {{for the prevention of}} corrosion by <b>corrosive</b> <b>liquids.</b> Corrosion caused by <b>corrosive</b> <b>liquids</b> can rapidly change the surface properties of components in engineering structures, and that will ﬁnally endanger the functionality of structural parts. However, if monitoring technologies are in place providing continuous information on the presence of <b>corrosive</b> <b>liquids,</b> corrosion treatment and even corrosion prevention can start at a very early stage. Present invention provides such by early detection of <b>corrosive</b> <b>liquids</b> by extended sensors based on the collapse of percolation conductivity (COPC). The term collapse refers {{to the fact that the}} transition into the non-conducting state must not necessarily have the properties of a thermodynamically well-deﬁned transition. nrpages: 12 status: publishe...|$|R

The red shirt that he was wearing mitigated the effects, but the Icarus was ruined beyond recognition. His assailant was severely reprimanded for assaulting a fellow-anarchist and received seven years' imprisonment for defacing a national art treasure.
