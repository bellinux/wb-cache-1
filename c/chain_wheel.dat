5000|$|De Vivie {{imported}} machines from England. In 1889 {{he made a}} bike of his own, called La Gauloise. It had {{a diamond}} frame, chain and a single gear. De Vivie was riding the col de la République (10 km south east of St Etienne) in 1889 {{when one of his}} readers overtook him - smoking a pipe. De Vivie felt challenged but also trapped: if he lowered his gear, he would go slower on the flat. But on the gearing that he had, he could not climb hills fast enough either. British thinking favoured epicyclic and planetary gears, concealed in the rear hub. De Vivie created the derailleur. His first had two chain wheels; the chain had to be lifted by hand from one to the other. He then placed two chain wheels on the left side. The combination gave him four gears. [...] In 1901 Velocio combined his invention with the four-speed proteon gear of the English Whippet, which used a split <b>chain</b> <b>wheel.</b> Pedalling backwards made the two halves of the <b>chain</b> <b>wheel</b> open. Pawls then secured them in one of four positions. De Vivie's development appeared in his Cheminot in 1906, the first derailleur. He overlooked taking out a patent and made barely any money from an invention which changed cycling.|$|E

Apart from determining the value of the abrasive wear, examinations of the magnetic phase content in the microstructure were carried out and plots of hardness of the surface layer as a function of the distance from the surface and microstructure of the materials were prepared. Based on the results, the following was found: an increase in the abrasive wear and a reduction in the hardness of the surface layer of <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> subjected to shot peening, as well as reduction of susceptibility to negative action of the shot for cast irons with the structure of upper ausferrite...|$|R

Current methods of calculating gear contact stresses use Hertz’s equations, which were originally derived for contact between sintered timing <b>wheel</b> and <b>chain</b> <b>wheels.</b> The results of the 2 D dimensional FEM analyses from ANSYS are presented. The relationship between relative density of P/M steels and mechanical behavior is also obtained from FEM and compared with the experimental data. Good agreement between the experimental and FEM results is observed, which demonstrates that FEM can capture the major features of the P/M steels behaviour during loading. This indicates that the FEM model is accurate...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of wear tests obtained for 4 groups of materials: surface-hardened alloy steels and alloy cast steels for structural applications, hard-wearing surface-hardened alloy cast steels, and austempered alloy cast irons. The wear tests have been performed on a specially designed test rig that allows reproducing the real operating conditions of <b>chain</b> <b>wheels,</b> including the rolling and sliding form of contact between elements. The <b>chain</b> <b>wheels</b> subjected to tests were operated with the use of loose quartz abrasive. This study presents results of measurements of material parameters, micro-structure of a surface subject to wear, as well as the linear wear determined for the materials considered. Based on the results, the following was found: the best wear properties were obtained for surface-hardened alloy steels and wear surface; strengthening of the ADI surface took place - most probably as a result of transformation of austenite into martensite; the uniformity {{of the structure of the}} materials affects the surface wear process. The study also indicated a significant degree of graphite deformation in ADI characterized by the upper ausferritic structure and its oblique orientation in relation to the surface, which resulted in a facilitated degradation of the surface caused by the quartz abrasive...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Fine {{blanking}} {{process is}} a high precision process and worldwide in developed countries. Since specimen does not occur fracture {{on the cutting edge}} and {{it is not necessary to}} decorate again in the finishing process for the fine blanking which can be reduced some operation steps. For example, if <b>chain</b> <b>wheel</b> of motorcycle is produced by conventional blanking, it needs nine steps. But, if it is produced by fine blanking, it requires only three steps. With these reasons, fine blanking is boom for the metal forming industry in Thailand. But, due to some mechanical properties for some kinds of metal such as low elongation or imperfect microstructure, it is not cut by using fine blanking directly. Approach: Objective of this research was to investigate microstructure of specimen for fine blanking process in order to avoid fracture surface on blank. The optimum condition will result in higher elongation while having small decrease in tensile strength. The circular specimen with diameter of 16 mm and thickness of 2 mm was chosen. Material was steel which contains 0. 45 % carbon. Results: Microstructures contained pearlite and ferrite grains. The grains sizes were expanded with temperature of heat treatments at 700, 800 and 900 °C, respectively, for 1 h. The specimen exposes to heat treatment in each temperature results in the increase of overall shear surface and the decrease of fracture surface when compared with no heat treatment. This is due to no appearance of strain hardening. For the microstructures exposed to heat treatment at 700 °C for 10 - 20 h were almost spherroidite. It revealed that facture surface became shear surface after heat treatment over 10 h. Conclusion/Recommendations: The changes of microstructure for 0. 45 % carbon steel significantly affected to the overall shear and fracture surface and yield strength due to increasing of spherroidite, thus fracture was decreased with time...|$|E
