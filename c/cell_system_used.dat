This study investigates the influence of increasing concentrations (2. 5 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % w/w SAP compared to PCL) of three different SAPs on the physico-chemical/mechanical and biological properties of PCL fibers. We demonstrated that physico-chemical surface characteristics were slightly improved at increasing SAP concentrations: the fiber diameter increased; surface wettability increased with the first SAP addition (2. 5 %) and slightly less for the following ones; SAP-surface density increased but {{no change in the}} conformation was registered.

Dynamic modelling is applied to identify the characteristic time scales of the system components when introducing a disturbance in operational parameters of the system. The information on {{the response of the}} system may be used to specify the control loops needed to manage the changes with respect to safe component operation. The commercial process modelling tool gPROMS is used to perform the system simulations. The component library of the tool is completed with dynamic models of a fuel cell stack and a pre-reformer. The other components are modelled for steady state operation. For the fuel cell a detailed dynamic model is obtained by writing the constitutive laws for heat transfer in the solid part of the cell and conservation of heat and mass in the air and fuel channels. Comprehensive representation of resistive cell losses, reaction kinetics for the reforming and heat conduction through the solid part of the cell is also included in the model. The pre-reformer is described as a dynamic pseudo-homogeneous one-dimensional tubular reactor accounting for methane steam reforming and water-gas shift reaction.

40|$|The {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) Leader (L) protein is {{produced}} in two forms, Lab and Lb, differing only at their amino-termini, due {{to the use of}} separate initiation codons, usually 84 nt apart. It has been shown previously, and confirmed here, that precise deletion of the Lab coding sequence is lethal for the virus, whereas loss of the Lb coding sequence results in a virus that is viable in BHK cells. In addition, it is now shown that deletion of the ‘spacer ’ region between these two initiation codons can be tolerated. Growth of the virus precisely lacking just the Lb coding sequence resulted in a previously undetected accumulation of frameshift mutations within the ‘spacer ’ region. These mutations block the inappropriate fusion of amino acid sequences to the amino-terminus of the capsid protein precursor. Modification, by site-directed mutagenesis, of the Lab initiation codon, {{in the context of the}} virus lacking the Lb coding region, was also tolerated by the virus within BHK cells. However, precise loss of the Lb coding sequence alone blocked FMDV replication in primary bovine thyroid cells. Thus, the requirement for the Leader protein coding sequences is highly dependent on the nature and extent of the residual Leader protein sequences and on the host <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> <b>used.</b> FMDVs precisely lacking Lb and with the Lab initiation codon modified may represent safer seed viruses for vaccine production...|$|E
40|$|In the brain, d-amino acid oxidase plays a {{key role}} in {{modulating}} the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation state, catalyzing the stereospecific degradation of the coagonist d-serine. A relationship between d-serine signaling deregulation, NMDAR dysfunction, and CNS diseases is presumed. Notably, the R 199 W substitution in human DAAO (hDAAO) was associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and further coding substitutions, i. e., R 199 Q and W 209 R, were also deposited in the single nucleotide polymorphism database. Here, we investigated the biochemical properties of these different hDAAO variants. The W 209 R hDAAO variant shows an improved d-serine degradation ability (higher activity and affinity for the cofactor FAD) and produces a greater decrease in cellular d/(d+l) serine ratio than the wild-type counterpart when expressed in U 87 cells. The production of H 2 O 2 as result of excessive d-serine degradation by this hDAAO variant may represent the factor affecting cell viability after stable transfection. The R 199 W/Q substitution in hDAAO altered the protein conformation and enzymatic activity was lost under conditions resembling the cellular ones: this resulted in an abnormal increase in cellular d-serine levels. Altogether, these results indicate that substitutions that affect hDAAO functionality directly impact on d-serine cellular levels (at least in the model <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> <b>used).</b> The pathological effect of the expression of the R 199 W hDAAO, as observed in familial ALS, originates from both protein instability and a decrease in kinetic efficiency: the increase in synaptic d-serine may be mainly responsible for the neurotoxic effect.

L. Collinsworth and C. K. Mathews, J. Virol. 13 : 908 - 915, 1974). Using this system, which is based primarily on that of M. G. Wovcha et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70 : 2196 - 2200, 1973), we reinvestigated the properties of mutants bearing lesions in genes 1, 41, and 62, and we resolved some disagreements with data reported from that laboratory. We also asked whether the DNA-delay phenotype of T 4 mutants is related to possible early leakage of DNA precursors from infected cells. Such cells display defective DNA synthesis in situ, even when ample DNA precursors are made available. Thus, the lesions associated with these mutations seem to manifest themselves {{at the level of}} macromolecular metabolism. Similarly, we examined an E. coli mutant defective in its ability to support T 4 production, apparently because of a lesion affecting DNA synthesis (L. Simon et al., Nature [London] 252 : 451 - 455). In the plasmolyzed cell system, reduced nucleotide incorporation is seen, indicating also that the genetic defect does not involve DNA precursor synthesis. The plasmolyzed cell system incorporates deoxynucleotide 5 ′-monophosphates into DNA severalfold more rapidly than the corresponding 5 ′-triphosphates. This is consistent with the idea that DNA precursor-synthesizing enzymes are functionally organized to shuttle substrates to their sites of utilization...|$|E

Osteoblast-like MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells stimulated by endothelin- 1, melittin, ionomycin or arachidonic acid showed diminished prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production upon pretreatment with econazole. Following pretreatment with bifonazole, stimulation with ionomycin or arachidonic acid also resulted in decreased PGE 2 formation. Clotrimazole inhibited ionomycin but not arachidonic acid stimulated PGE 2 synthesis in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. The results observed in osteoblast-like UMR- 106 cells pretreated with econazole, bifonazole or clotrimazole and stimulated by arachidonic acid were similar with the exception of clotrimazole which was a more effective inhibitor of PGE 2 biosynthesis than in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. Upon treatment with arachidonic acid thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) production in human platelets was abolished completely at concentrations of the three imidazole antimycotics higher than 5 [*]μM (IC 50 < 1 [*]μM). These data were confirmed by a direct assay using purified ram seminal vesicle prostaglandin H 2 synthase- 1 (PGHS- 1), which clearly showed inhibitory properties of econazole (IC 50 4. 7 ± 2. 3 [*]μM), bifonazole (IC 50 9. 4 ± 0. 8 [*]μM) and clotrimazole (IC 50 4. 4 ± 0. 6 [*]μM). Summarizing, these results indicate an inhibitory effect of econazole, bifonazole and clotrimazole on PGHS- 1, varying in its potency dependent on the <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> <b>used.</b> In addition TXB 2 formation is affected at doses even lower than those needed to suppress PGE 2 biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Steroidogenic acute {{regulatory}} protein (StAR) plays {{a critical role}} in steroid hormone biosynthesis, presumably by facilitating the delivery of cholesterol to P 450 scc in the inner mitochondrial membranes. StAR is synthesized as a 37 -kDa preprotein that is processed to a 30 -kDa mature form by cleavage of an N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence. To identify structural features required for StAR biological activity, we mutated the human StAR cDNA, including the deletion of N- and C-terminal sequences, and examined the ability of the mutants to promote steroidogenesis and enter the mitochondria of transfected COS- 1 cells. Deletion of up to 62 residues from the N terminus (N- 62) did not significantly affect steroidogenesis-enhancing activity. The N-terminal deletion mutants were associated with mitochondria-enriched fractions, but import and processing were progressively impaired with increasing length of the deletion. Immunogold electron microscopy and in vitro import assays showed that the active N- 62 mutant was not imported into the mitochondria. Removal of the 28 C-terminal amino acids (C- 28) inactivated StAR. Deletion of the C-terminal 10 amino acids (C- 10) reduced steroidogenic activity by 53 %, while truncation of the last 4 amino acids had no effect. The C- 28 mutant StAR was not efficiently imported into mitochondria or processed, whereas some of the C- 10 mutant was processed, indicating that import had occurred. We conclude that in the COS- 1 <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> <b>used,</b> StAR does not need to enter into mitochondria to stimulate steroidogenesis and that residues in the C terminus are essential for steroidogenesis-enhancing activity. These findings imply that StAR acts via C-terminal domains {{on the outside of the}} mitochondria...|$|E

40|$|Parasite excretory/secretory (ES) {{products}} {{are believed to}} play a role in the initiation of the host response to the abomasal parasites Haemonchus contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta. Both parasites inhibit and cause loss of the acid-producing parietal cells. Three days after transplantation of adult T. circumcincta into parasite-naive sheep, a subpopulation of their parietal cells no longer expressed the proton pump β-subunit, but still stained for Transforming Growth Factor-α, suggesting loss of the proton pump preceded cell death. To investigate the ability of parasites to modify the function of mammalian cells in vitro, HeLa, AGS and CaCo- 2 cells were exposed to ES products. ES products vacuolated all three cells, causing the development of large numbers of small vacuoles, which differed in appearance from those produced by Helicobacter pylori bacterial toxin VacA or ammonia. The vacuoles were unlike those which develop in parietal cells in the parasitised abomasum. Neither lipids nor prostaglandins appeared {{to play a role}} in vacuolation and the vacuolating factor in vitro is likely to be a protein because of its heat and acid lability. Vacuolation occurred within one hour and was partially reversible. ES products were also able to cause cytoskeletal rearrangement and detachment of HeLa cells, similar processes to those caused by bacterial pathogens, which also disrupt tight junctions in mammalian cells. H. contortus ES products also disrupted tight junctions of CaCo- 2 cell monolayers, a model <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> <b>used</b> for these studies. The increased epithelial permeability was associated with structural rearrangements of the tight junction proteins occludin and ZO- 1. This could explain protein loss and back-diffusion of pepsinogen into the blood, a marker of abomasal parasitism. Cell detachment and disruption of cell-cell adhesion in parasitised sheep may inhibit acid production by parietal cells, which cannot function when separated from adjacent cells. Increased permeability of the surface epithelium would allow parasite ES products to penetrate the mucosal barrier, causing further damage. This could also allow inhibition of parietal cells deeper in the abomasal glands and also allowing adult parasites living in the gastric lumen to modulate host immunity to enhance their survival...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of renin secretion was studied in continuous culture of human juxtaglomerular cells (JGC), which provided a permanent source of human renin production (Pinet, F., M. T. Corvol, F. Dench, J. Bourguignon, J. Feunteun, J. Ménard, and P. Corvol, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82 : 8503 - 8507). 95 % of the renin species secreted was prorenin, and therefore this study concerned primarily prorenin secretion. Renin production was stable, since the cells had been maintained in culture {{for more than}} two years. In culture, these human cells formed colonies of smooth musclelike cells, and electron microscopy showed the presence of cytoskeleton structures including myofibrils and attachment bodies. This human model was used to investigate the control of prorenin secretion in vitro at cellular level. Various pharmacological agents known to stimulate or inhibit renin secretion were tested in the cell cultures. The variations in prorenin secretion were measured in the supernatant. Forskolin, an independent receptor activator of adenylate cyclase, stimulated prorenin secretion in a dose-dependent manner and this stimulation was mediated by 3 ', 5 ' cyclic-AMP (cAMP). Angiotensin II (AII) was found to inhibit prorenin secretion directly in a dose-dependent manner and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), whose effects on human JGC were characterized for the first time, was also shown to exert such inhibition. When the effects of this inhibition by AII and ANF were tested on forskolin-mediated stimulation of prorenin secretion, the latter was inhibited and no change occurred in cAMP release. When JGC were treated with histamine, bradykinin, or one or two bradykinin analogues, the responses suggested that in these cells, H 2 -histamine receptors and kinin receptors are dependent on adenylate cyclase. One peptide, substance P, had an inhibitory effect on prorenin secretion but it was less important than AII and ANF. The present results demonstrate that the adenylate cyclase system of human JGC remains intact during culture and supports the hypothesis that cAMP is the second messenger and Cai 2 +, the final messenger involved in renin secretion.
