5|$|The {{tetrapods}} {{have their}} {{root in the}} early Devonian tetrapodomorph fish. Primitive tetrapods developed from an osteolepid tetrapodomorph lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygian-crossopterygian), with a two-lobed brain in a flattened skull. The coelacanth group represents marine sarcopterygians that never acquired these shallow-water adaptations. The sarcopterygians apparently took two different lines of descent and are accordingly separated into two major groups: the Actinistia (including the <b>coelacanths)</b> and the Rhipidistia (which include extinct lines of lobe-finned fishes that evolved into the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Coelacanths</b> {{belong to}} the {{subclass}} Actinistia, a group of lobed-finned fish related to lungfish and certain extinct Devonian fish such as osteolepiforms, porolepiforms, rhizodonts, and Panderichthys. <b>Coelacanths</b> were thought to have become extinct in the Late Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago, but were rediscovered in 1938 {{off the coast of}} South Africa.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the African <b>coelacanth</b> in 1938 and subsequently the Indonesian <b>coelacanth</b> in 1998 {{has resulted in a}} keen interest in molecular studies on the <b>coelacanth.</b> A major focus has been on the phylogenetic position of the <b>coelacanth.</b> Lobe-finned fish such as the <b>coelacanth</b> are thought to be {{at the base of the}} evolutionary branch of fish leading to tetrapods. These studies have further aimed to resolve the phylogenetic relationship of extant lobe-finned fish (two <b>coelacanth</b> species and the lungfishes) to vertebrates. Notwithstanding the lack of readily accessible good-quality <b>coelacanth</b> tissue, several major contributions to <b>coelacanth</b> molecular studies and biology have been possible. The mitochondrial genome sequences of both species of the <b>coelacanth</b> suggest that they diverged from one another 40 – 30 million years ago. A number of large gene families such as the HOX, protocadherin and heat shock protein clusters have been characterized. Furthermore, the recent successful construction of a large-insert (150 – 200 kilobase) genomic library of the Indonesian <b>coelacanth</b> will prove to be an invaluable tool in both comparative and functional genomics. Here we summarize and evaluate the current status of molecular research, published and databased, for both the African (Latimeria chalumnae) and the Indonesian (Latimeria menadoensis) <b>coelacanth...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Indonesian <b>coelacanth</b> (Latimeria menadoensis, Indonesian: raja laut) {{is one of}} two {{living species}} of <b>coelacanth,</b> {{identifiable}} by its brown color.

50|$|In 2002, the South African <b>Coelacanth</b> Conservation and Genome Resource Programme was {{launched}} to help further the studies and conservation of the <b>coelacanth.</b> This program focuses on biodiversity conservation, evolutionary biology, capacity building, and public understanding.

25|$|<b>Coelacanths</b> are {{opportunistic}} feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, {{and other}} fish {{found in their}} deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. <b>Coelacanths</b> are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements {{in a sort of}} hibernation mode.|$|E
25|$|Lobe-finned fishes, such as <b>coelacanths</b> and lungfish, {{were the}} most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian. Taxonomists who {{subscribe}} to the cladistic approach include the grouping Tetrapoda within the Sarcopterygii, and the tetrapods in turn include all species of four-limbed vertebrates. The fin-limbs of lobe-finned fishes such as the <b>coelacanths</b> show a strong similarity to the expected ancestral form of tetrapod limbs. The lobe-finned fish apparently followed two different lines of development and are accordingly separated into two subclasses, the Rhipidistia (including the lungfish, and the Tetrapodomorpha, which include the Tetrapoda) and the Actinistia (<b>coelacanths).</b> The first lobe-finned fishes, found in the uppermost Silurian (ca 418 Ma), closely resembled spiny sharks, which became extinct {{at the end of}} the Paleozoic. In the early–middle Devonian (416 - 385 Ma), while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas, some lobe-finned fishes came into freshwater habitats.|$|E
25|$|The lobed-finned fish (such as <b>coelacanths</b> {{and lung}} fish) have paired {{appendages}} whose internal skeleton {{is attached to}} the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone, the humerus or femur.

25|$|Latimeria {{is a rare}} genus of {{fish that}} {{includes}} two extant species: West Indian Ocean <b>coelacanth</b> (Latimeria chalumnae) and the Indonesian <b>coelacanth</b> (Latimeria menadoensis). They follow the oldest known living lineage of Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish and tetrapods), which means they are {{more closely related to}} lungfish, reptiles and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes. They are found along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Indonesia. Since there are only two species of <b>coelacanth</b> and both are threatened, it is the most endangered genus of animals in the world. The West Indian Ocean <b>coelacanth</b> is a critically endangered species.|$|R
50|$|The West Indian Ocean <b>coelacanth</b> (Latimeria chalumnae), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the African <b>coelacanth</b> {{is one of two}} extant species of <b>coelacanth,</b> a rare order of vertebrates more closely related to lungfish, reptiles and mammals than to the common ray-finned fishes.

40|$|The <b>coelacanth</b> {{is one of}} {{the nearest}} living {{relatives}} of tetrapods. However, a teleost species such as zebrafish or Fugu is typically used as the outgroup in current tetrapod comparative sequence analyses. Such studies are {{complicated by the fact that}} teleost genomes have undergone a whole-genome duplication event, as well as individual gene-duplication events. Here, we demonstrate the value of <b>coelacanth</b> genome sequence by complete sequencing and analysis of the protocadherin gene cluster of the Indonesian <b>coelacanth,</b> Latimeria menadoensis. We found that <b>coelacanth</b> has 49 protocadherin cluster genes organized in the same three ordered subclusters, α, β, and γ, as the 54 protocadherin cluster genes in human. In contrast, whole-genome and tandem duplications have generated two zebrafish protocadherin clusters comprised of at least 97 genes. Additionally, zebrafish protocadherins are far more prone to homogenizing gene conversion events than <b>coelacanth</b> protocadherins, suggesting that recombination- and duplication-driven plasticity may be a feature of teleost genomes. Our results indicate that <b>coelacanth</b> provides the ideal outgroup sequence against which tetrapod genomes can be measured. We therefore present L. menadoensis as a candidate for whole-genome sequencing...|$|R
25|$|The {{coelacanth}} {{has no real}} {{commercial value}} apart from being coveted by museums and private collectors. As a food fish it is almost worthless, as its tissues exude oils that give the flesh a foul flavor. The coelacanth's continued survival may be threatened by commercial deep-sea trawling, in which <b>coelacanths</b> are caught as bycatch.|$|E
25|$|Coelacanth {{eyes are}} very sensitive, {{and have a}} tapetum lucidum. <b>Coelacanths</b> are almost never caught in the daytime, but have been caught at all phases of the moon. Coelacanth eyes have many rods, receptors in the retina that help animals see in dim light. Together, the rods and tapetum help the fish see better in dark water.|$|E
25|$|Reasons {{for such}} slow {{evolution}} by <b>coelacanths</b> {{could be the}} lack of evolutionary pressure on these organisms. They have few predators, and they live deep in the Indian Ocean where conditions {{are said to be}} very stable. Without much pressure for these organisms to adapt to survive, the rate at which they need to evolve is much slower in comparison to other organisms.|$|E

25|$|The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish {{appeared}} in the Devonian, while the placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. However, another subclass of Osteichthyes, the Sarcopterygii, including lobe-finned fishes including <b>coelacanths</b> and lungfish) and tetrapods, was the most diverse group of bony fishes in the Devonian.

25|$|Due {{to their}} lobed fins and other features, {{it was once}} thought that the {{coelacanth}} was the most recent shared ancestor between terrestrial and marine organisms.

The position of Onychodus and Psarolepis in the cladogram is outside the major clade of sarcopterygians (lobe-finned fishes), but at a position more derived than actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes).|$|E

25|$|In the Early Devonian (416-397 Ma), the lobe-finned fishes {{split into}} two main {{lineages}} — the <b>coelacanths</b> and the rhipidistians. The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the Late Devonian and Carboniferous, from 385 to 299 Ma, as they were more common during those periods {{than in any other}} period in the Phanerozoic; <b>coelacanths</b> still live today in the oceans (genus Latimeria). The Rhipidistians, whose ancestors probably lived in estuaries, migrated into freshwater habitats. They in turn {{split into two}} major groups: the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs. The lungfish's greatest diversity was in the Triassic period; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left. The lungfish evolved the first proto-lungs and proto-limbs; developing the ability to live outside a water environment in the middle Devonian (397-385 Ma). The first tetrapodomorphs, which included the gigantic rhizodonts, had the same general anatomy as the lungfish, who were their closest kin, but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the late Devonian epoch (385 - 359 Ma), with the appearance of tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates). Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs that survived after the Devonian. Lobe-finned fishes continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era, suffering heavy losses during the Permian-Triassic extinction event (251 Ma).|$|E
25|$|They are nocturnal piscivorous drift-hunters. The body {{is covered}} in cosmoid scales that act as armor. <b>Coelacanths</b> have eight fins – 2 dorsal fins, 2 {{pectoral}} fins, 2 pelvic fins, 1 anal fin and 1 caudal fin. The tail is very nearly equally proportioned and is split by a terminal tuft of fin rays that make up its caudal lobe. The eyes of the coelacanth are very large, while the mouth is very small. The eye is acclimatized to seeing in poor light by rods that absorb mostly short wavelengths. Coelacanth vision has evolved to a mainly blue-shifted color capacity. Pseudomaxillary folds surround the mouth and replace the maxilla, a structure absent in <b>coelacanths.</b> Two nostrils, along with four other external openings, appear between the premaxilla and lateral rostral bones. The nasal sacs resemble those of many other fish and do not contain an internal nostril. The coelacanth's rostral organ, contained within the ethmoid region of the braincase, has three unguarded openings into the environment and {{is used as a}} part of the coelacanth's laterosensory system. The coelacanth's auditory reception is mediated by its inner ear, which is very similar to that of tetrapods because it is classified as being a basilar papilla.|$|E
25|$|Coelacanth {{locomotion}} is unique. To {{move around}} they most commonly {{take advantage of}} up- or down-wellings of current and drift. Their paired fins stabilize movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use the paired fins {{for any kind of}} movement. <b>Coelacanths</b> create thrust with their caudal fins for quick starts. Due to the abundance of its fins, the coelacanth has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands as well as swimming belly up. It is thought that the rostral organ helps give the coelacanth electroperception, which aids in movement around obstacles.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "fish" [...] most {{precisely}} describes any non-tetrapod craniate (i.e. {{an animal}} with a skull {{and in most}} cases a backbone) that has gills throughout life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins.

Indeed, lungfish and <b>coelacanths</b> are closer relatives of tetrapods (such as mammals, birds, amphibians, etc.) than of other fish such as ray-finned fish or sharks, so the last common ancestor of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods.
