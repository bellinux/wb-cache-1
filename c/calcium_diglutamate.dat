5000|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>diglutamate,</b> {{sometimes}} abbreviated CDG {{and also}} called calcium glutamate, is a compound with formula Ca(C5H8NO4)2. It is a calcium acid salt of glutamic acid. CDG is a flavor enhancer (E number E623) [...] - [...] {{it is the}} calcium analog of monosodium glutamate (MSG). Because the glutamate is the actual flavor-enahancer, CDG has the same flavor-enhancing properties as MSG, but without the increased sodium content. As a soluble source of calcium ions, this chemical is also used as a first-aid treatment for exposure to hydrofluoric acid.|$|E
40|$|There {{is concern}} that humans consume sodium, mostly as salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) at levels that produce {{significant}} medical risks. The current review gives an appraisal of psychologically relevant research into concerns {{in relation to}} sodium intake. Determinants of food choice, including sensory preferences, familiarity and exposure, customary level of sodium in daily diet, attitudes, and personality traits (including food neophobia) are explored, {{and their impact on}} dietary sodium is also discussed. In addition, strategies for reducing salt levels are discussed, including a reduction in salt content in food products, and the use of alternative tastants to salt. The use of glutamate salts such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) and <b>calcium</b> <b>diglutamate</b> (CDG) as alternative tastants is discussed. Finally, there is a summary of the methodological issues of the research reviewed and recommendations for future research into the area of alternative tastants is provided...|$|E
