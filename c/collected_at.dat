5|$|In 2007, a {{daily average}} of 455 cars {{traveled}} along SR-161, representing {{only a slight}} growth from previous years; in 2006, the average was 450 and in 2005, 415).

5|$|Instead, {{the state}} {{collects}} revenue from property taxes (though these are <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> the county, city, and school district level; Texas has a state constitutional prohibition against a state property tax) and sales taxes. The state sales tax rate is 6.25 percent, but local taxing jurisdictions (cities, counties, special purpose districts, and transit authorities) may also impose sales and use tax up to 2 percent {{for a total}} maximum combined rate of 8.25 percent.|$|E
5|$|Populations of Gyromitra esculenta {{appear to}} vary {{geographically}} in their toxicity. A French study {{has shown that}} mushrooms <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations, {{and there is some}} evidence that fungi west of the Rocky Mountains in North America contain less toxin than those to the east. However, poisonings in the west have been reported, although less frequently than in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Research on Iguanodon {{decreased}} {{during the}} early part of the 20th century as World Wars and the Great Depression enveloped Europe. A new species that would become the subject of much study and taxonomic controversy, I. atherfieldensis, was named in 1925 by R. W. Hooley, for a specimen <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> Atherfield Point on the Isle of Wight.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish embassy he {{eventually}} <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> Norham had been delayed, {{and it was}} on the return journey that the Duke of Somerset with Lords Roos and Hungerford, Sir Richard Turnstall, and Sir Thomas Findern and the bulk of the Lancastrian army (approximately 5,000 men) ambushed Montagu at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April 1464. The assault failed, and left Sir Ralph Percy dead on the field.|$|E
5|$|The mouse {{was first}} {{described}} by Frank Chapman in 1889 {{in a paper}} in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, from a specimen <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> Gainesville, Florida. The species was named as a separate subgenus of Peromyscus by Wilfred Hudson Osgood in 1909, but generic recognition was disputed in the 1980s. Michael Carleton and Guy Musser supported the ranking in 1993. No subspecies have been described.|$|E

5|$|The toll {{portion of}} SR 133 employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are charged {{flat-rate}} tolls {{based on what}} particular toll booths they pass through. Tolls are <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> selected on- and off-ramps; and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza, which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange).|$|E
5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E

5|$|As {{distance}} between {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the salinity in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> 11.40ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9ppt and falls again to 0.81ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{passengers}} of two-axle vehicles (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay tolls of 65¢ in cash or 55¢ if Pikepass is used. Drivers in vehicles {{with more than}} two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls. Tolls are <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> the single barrier toll plaza between the US-177 and Roff interchanges. Due to the partial interchanges, {{it is not possible}} to legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza. The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata {{was first}} <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> Botany Bay on 29 April 1770, by Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the British vessel HMS Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The species was not {{published}} until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described {{the first four}} Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum, commenting {{that it was the}} showiest species in the genus. As the first named species of the genus, Banksia serrata is considered the type species. Banksia serrata has the common names of old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-toothed banksia and saw-leaved banksia. It is also known as red honeysuckle and red banksia from the colour of its timber.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being {{severely}} beaten. A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> the murder scene did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Oldfield Thomas of the British Museum of Natural History (BMNH) in London {{published}} the first description of Mindomys hammondi, using two specimens <b>collected</b> <b>at</b> Mindo in Pichincha Province, Ecuador, in 1913 by Gilbert Hammond. He named the species Nectomys hammondi, classifying {{it in the}} genus Nectomys, {{which at the time}} included not only the large water rats currently placed in it, but also Sigmodontomys alfari and Oryzomys dimidiatus. He considered the animal to be most closely related to Nectomys russulus, a species he had himself described in 1897 and which is now recognized as a synonym of Sigmodontomys alfari.|$|E
