50|$|The {{practice}} {{of using a}} simple memorable abstraction of a host's numerical address on a computer network {{dates back to the}} ARPANET era, before the advent of today's commercial Internet. In the early network, each computer on the network retrieved the hosts file (host.txt) from a computer at SRI (now SRI International), which mapped <b>computer</b> <b>host</b> names to numerical addresses. The rapid growth of the network made it impossible to maintain a centrally organized hostname registry and in 1983 the Domain Name System was introduced on the ARPANET and published by the Internet Engineering Task Force as RFC 882 and RFC 883.|$|E
50|$|Delivery of {{the first}} web-based Telnet 3270, or TN3270 {{emulation}} adaptation is credited to Netscape Navigator a web browser designed by Netscape Communications Corporation. Telnet 3270, or TN3270 describes either the process of sending and receiving 3270 data streams using the Telnet protocol or the software that emulates a 3270 class terminal that communicates using that process. TN3270 allows a 3270 terminal emulator to communicate over a TCP/IP network instead of an SNA network. Standard telnet clients cannot {{be used as a}} substitute for TN3270 clients, as they use fundamentally different techniques for exchanging data. The Netscape versions offered limited functionality and essentially allowed web-based users to access the 3270 and UNIX, VAX and other <b>computer</b> <b>host</b> systems via the Netscape Navigator and Netscape Communicator web browser.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION 1. 1 World Wide Web (WWW) and HTML The World Wide Web is a {{hypertext}} {{information system}} on the Internet. It {{is based on the}} Client/Server model [1]. A Client-Server model for computer network system involves three components: the client, the server and the network. A client is a software program running on the end user's <b>computer</b> <b>host.</b> A server is a software application that runs on the information provider's <b>computer</b> <b>host.</b> The user sends a request for information through the client software. This request travels over the network to the server. The server interprets the request and takes some desired actions. The results of the request are sent back to the client for display on the user's host. A web client is the Web browser, such as Netscape or Internet Explorer. The Web server is a machine running the Web server software. The World Wide Web has grown very fast since its introduction in the early 1990 s. It has gained the attention of millions of peopl...|$|E

However, to interface the SDHC card (slave unit) with master unit (e.g., <b>computer,</b> <b>host,</b> or any application-specific device), we need a system which can talk with the on-card controller of the SDHC card for smooth execution of single/multiblock data read/write.|$|E

Additionally, with an Extender, the Media Center can be accessed {{at the same time}} by several users. The Xbox 360 gaming console has Media Center Extender functionality. The Ceton Echo is a stand-alone extender.|$|R
50|$|One form of desktop virtualization, {{virtual desktop}} {{infrastructure}} (VDI), {{can be thought}} of as a more advanced form of hardware virtualization. Rather than interacting with a <b>host</b> <b>computer</b> directly via a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, the user interacts with the <b>host</b> <b>computer</b> using another desktop computer or a mobile device by means of a network connection, such as a LAN, Wireless LAN or even the Internet. In addition, the <b>host</b> <b>computer</b> in this scenario becomes a server <b>computer</b> capable of <b>hosting</b> multiple virtual machines at the same time for multiple users.|$|R

30|$|There {{are three}} basic {{approaches}} proposed {{to estimate the}} length of a connection chain. One approach is proposed in [9] by Yung in 2002; the second one is using a step-function proposed in [22] by Yang and Huang in 2004; and the third one is the clustering-partitioning data mining approach proposed in [8] by Yang and Huang in 2007. Even though the ideas used to estimate {{the length of a}} connection chain are different, all the three approaches use RTT to represent the length of a connection chain. The concept of RTT discussed here is slightly different from the one used in most computer network textbooks. In any computer network textbook, an RTT indicates the sum of a packet delivery and response times between a <b>computer</b> <b>host</b> serving as a sender and another <b>computer</b> <b>host</b> serving as a receiver, assuming no other computer hosts existing in between the two hosts (i.e., there are only routers in between). But for all the three approaches we will discuss here, an RTT means the round-trip time between two computing hosts, and there might be many other hosts existing in between the two.|$|E
30|$|In {{the earlier}} days of computing, {{security}} monitoring was primarily performed by system administrators checking the log files of their servers. Then in the 1980 s, {{the concept of}} the Intrusion Detection System was introduced, where a separate monitoring device would look for suspicious behavior at the network or <b>computer</b> <b>host</b> level. Denning [14] produced what many consider to be the first landmark research paper for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) research back in 1987. A good example of an IDS is the common and widely known open source IDS called Snort [15],[16].|$|E

It {{consists of a}} Linux distribution for the target embedded system and development tools for a development <b>host</b> <b>computer.</b> The development <b>host</b> <b>computer</b> usually is a standard desktop computer running Linux or Windows. The Linux system and the application software for the target device are both created on the development host.|$|R
30|$|One {{traditional}} IDS {{product is}} a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) which monitors for cyber threats {{at the network}} layer by evaluating network traffic. Another traditional IDS product is a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) which monitors for cyber threats directly on the <b>computer</b> <b>hosts</b> by monitoring a <b>computer</b> <b>host’s</b> system logs, system processes, files, or network interface. An IDS can monitor specific protocols like a web server’s Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP); this type of IDS is called a Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS). IDSs can also be specialized to monitor application-specific protocols like an Application Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (APIDS). An example for this could be an APIDS that monitors a database’s Structured Query Language (SQL) protocol. Similar to the heterogeneity of the security event sources such as network and diverse host types, the IDSs themselves can be heterogeneous in their type, how they operate, and in their diverse alert output formats.|$|R
