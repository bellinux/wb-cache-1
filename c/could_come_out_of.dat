From an Indian perspective, the tournament continues to be known for Gavaskar's notorious innings against England. Still, Gavaskar scored {{the highest number of}} runs for India in the tournament, with 113. Among the bowlers, Abid Ali, with his 6 wickets, was the best bowler for India.|$|E

She also invited comment with her off-screen actions, as when she kissed k.d. lang while presenting her with an award at a Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center function in early 1997. DeGeneres finally officially came out in Time magazine, with an April 14, 1997 cover emblazoned with the words, [...] "Yep, I'm Gay".

500|$|Chibnall {{was elected}} by {{executive}} producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger to write a two-part episode about {{the return of the}} Silurians. Chibnall wanted [...] "Cold Blood" [...] in particular to be about the mistakes people make under pressure, and conflict that <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> protecting a family. The episode is also connected to the series' story arc, as the crack in the universe returns {{at the end of the}} episode. [...] "The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood" [...] were filmed in October and November 2009, with scenes in [...] "Cold Blood" [...] shot in Llanwynno, Wales, Cardiff's Temple of Peace, Plantasia, and an array of locations and sets for parts of the Silurian city, which the production team did not want to look like a cave. The episode was watched by 7.49 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mixed reviews from critics. Some reviewers were disappointed by the plot and characteristics of the Silurians, but the emotional ending was widely praised.|$|E

5000|$|A {{review by}} Allmusic {{called it an}} example of bop {{bordering}} on hard bop sound. For the 1980s {{it would not be}} considered very [...] "groundbreaking", but the album sounded like it <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the height of the bop era in the 1960s.|$|R

The storytelling was ancient and modern in the same breath. The full-on modernism in the sound, in the arrangement, was paramount in Garth’s experimentation.

500|$|When Joan Baez {{first met}} Dylan in April 1961, {{she had already}} {{released}} her first album and was acclaimed as the [...] "Queen of Folk". On hearing Dylan perform his song [...] "With God on Our Side," [...] Baez later said, [...] "I never thought anything so powerful <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that little toad". In July 1963, Baez invited Dylan to join her on stage at the Newport Folk Festival, setting the scene for similar duets {{over the next two}} years. By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the U.K, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back. Baez later toured with Dylan as a performer on his Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975–76, and sang four songs with Dylan on the live album of the tour, [...] Baez appeared with Dylan in the one-hour TV special Hard Rain, filmed at Fort Collins, Colorado, in May 1976. Baez also starred as 'The Woman In White' in the film Renaldo and Clara (1978), directed by Dylan and filmed during the Rolling Thunder Revue. Dylan and Baez toured together again in 1984 with Carlos Santana.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April 2010. He {{said that the}} aliens in the episode were [...] "one note", and overall [...] "Code of Honor" [...] didn't generate any emotional investment. He gave the episode a score of C−, summing it up as [...] "I'm not sure I'd believe a great show <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> TNG after watching 'Code', but I could at least say it had promise without sounding like a complete tool." [...] Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Code of Honor" [...] for Tor.com in May 2011. He thought the episode was riddled with clichés, and says that the episode only seems racist because of the casting even though the script didn't call for it. [...] "If the Ligonians had been played by white people, none of the dialogue would change, and nobody would call it racist", he said {{and gave it a}} score of two out of ten. Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation thought the episode was very slowly paced, and that the fight scene at the end was [...] "clunky and awkward", suggesting that this {{had something to do with}} the opposition of the cast and crew to the episode overall. She thought there were several plot holes, including why sickbay couldn't replicate the vaccine, and that the only redeeming quality of the episode was the beginning of the friendship between Data and La Forge.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter what— sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how she <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|Addressing the couple's {{possibility}} of marriage, children, and divorce, Hansis pondered [...] "why can't people on soaps just date?"

I think a lot of cool stories <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that". Silbermann voiced not knowing what the writers may have planned for the couple, but that [...] "the audience can assume it won't be smooth sailing". Hansis clarified: [...] "We have no idea what's happening until we get the scripts, which happens about a week in advance. We can talk to the producers if we want. I have done that once or twice, but they keep the writers and actors pretty separate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{heightened}} sense of crisis prompted Iorga to issue appeals against defeatism and reissue Neamul Românesc from Iași, explaining: [...] "I realized at once what moral use <b>could</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this {{for the thousands of}} discouraged and disillusioned people and against the traitors who were creeping up all over the place." [...] The goal was again reflected in his complementary lectures (where he discussed the [...] "national principle") and a new set of works; these featured musings on the Allied commitment (Relations des Roumains avec les Alliès, [...] "The Romanians' Relations with the Allies"; Histoire des relations entre la France et les roumains, [...] "The History of Relations between France and the Romanians"), the national character (Sufletul românesc, [...] "The Romanian Soul") or columns against the loss of morale (Armistițiul, [...] "The Armistice"). His ideal of moral regeneration through the war effort came with an endorsement of land reform projects. Brătianu did not object to the idea, being however concerned that landowners would rebel. Iorga purportedly gave him a sarcastic reply: [...] "just like you've been shooting the peasants to benefit the landowners, you'll then be shooting the landowners to benefit the peasants." ...|$|E
