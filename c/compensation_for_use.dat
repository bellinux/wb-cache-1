40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this report provides {{the basis for the}} development of a new procedure to be used by the Iowa DOT and cities and counties in the state to deal with detours. Even though the project initially focused on investigating new tools to determine condition and compensation, the focus was shifted to traffic and the gas tax method to set the basis for the new procedure. It was concluded that the condition-based approach, even though accurate and consistent condition evaluations can be achieved, is not feasible or cost effective because of the current practices of data collection (two-year cycle) and also the logistics of the procedure (before and after determination). The gas tax method provides for a simple, easy to implement, and consistent approach to dealing with <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of detours.

40|$|The model {{offshore}} wind power legislation focused on two aspects: <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of ocean space and environmental assessment. In particular, the model legislation recommends {{the adoption of a}} rent and royalty scheme that is premised on high rent and low royalties in order to stimulate qualified bids from developers who are motivated to begin production as early as possible and to discourage sham bidding. The model legislation also includes a provision that sets royalties at a lower rate {{in the early years of}} project operation, and that provides states with the discretion to waive or defer rent and/or royalties for a period of time to meet the goals and objectives of energy independence, job creation, reduced emissions of conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases and increased state requirements for electricity from renewable sources.

If it is the same phone company performing all three tasks (most likely the two largest phone companies - AT&T and Verizon), they keep all of the charge.

40|$|At the IATUL Conference in Tallinn in 1992 {{a report}} was {{presented}} {{about a new}} PICA project: RAPDOC. Information was presented about the reasons to start the project, its objectives, finances and project planning {{as well as information}} about the underlying interlibrary loan analysis in The Netherlands. The RAPDOC project officially came to an end on October 1, 1995. A project evaluation will be presented as well as the future usage of the obtained results. In the same year when the RAPDOC project came to an end, a new PICA project was launched: the PICA-WEBDOC project. In December 1995 an agreement was signed with RLG for collaboration on this project. The new service will allow end users to search WebCat, a special catalog of bibliographic records (maintained in parallel on both the RLG and PICA host computers, via Web browsers and to retrieve documents linked to them - full text, articles, maps, images etc. - using Web technology. WEBDOC interposes a licensing and accounting server between the catalog record and access to the whole document it describes, to verify that the user is covered by an institutional license or else to debit the users personal account. WEBDOC is designed to provide an environment for end-users access where the rights holders may seek <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of their materials. These include many journal articles and some unusual, high-quality and primary sources collections. RLG and PICA plan to launch WEBDOC as a pilot production project this year, starting in January in the Netherlands and Germany and in September in the United States. PICA has already identified a group of Institutions in the Netherlands that will participate with their end users in the pilot; this year RLG will identify pilot participants from among its members. Both organizations seek cooperation with commercial document suppliers and publishers to participate in the project. PICA recently signed the first contract with a publisher, Kluwer Academic Publishers in Dordredcht, the Netherlands. WEBDOC is the first phase of a broader strategic collaboration planned to achieve streamlined access to documents in paper form as well as digitized materials - and to give the end-user a single interface for information retrieval, document request, electronically assisted document delivery, and conventional interlibrary loan. RLG and PICA intend to pool development resources in creating shareable software modules and to offer integrated end-user services to libraries and their patrons {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|Copyright law’s {{constitutional}} {{mandate is}} to advance artistic progress {{for the public}} good by granting authors a set of exclusive rights. When considered {{in the context of}} creative endeavors that build upon preexisting, already copyrighted works, however, this seemingly straightforward objective becomes more complicated: in this situation, the law must balance the incentive to prepare the initial work with the incentive for improvement and continued progress in the form of derivative works, which can be inhibited by the rights conferred on the author of the preexisting work. Indeed, allowing individuals broad rights to exclude the public, {{for the benefit of the}} public, presents a contradiction in intellectual property law when those individual rights are invoked to prohibit absolutely the production of derivative works, as some courts have permitted copyright litigants to do. A blocking copyrights doctrine would help to relieve that uneasy and unnecessary result. Such a doctrine would be similar to the well-established blocking patents approach to overlapping inventions in intellectual property law, and would allow an unauthorized improver of a preexisting copyrighted work to practice, and retain rights to, the original contributions in her derivative work, subject to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of the preexisting work. In addition to looking to patent law for guidance, the law relating to improvers of tangible property is also instructive in addressing the dilemma of unauthorized derivative authors in the copyright system: that body of law offers even greater acceptance and encouragement of the efforts of subsequent users of property. Although copyright law, when compared to both patent law and the law of tangible property, presents equally, if not more, compelling reasons for granting an improver relief, a blocking doctrine has not been accepted by the courts in the copyright context. As this Article demonstrates, courts’ failure to accept the doctrine is in part due to a misunderstanding of the statutory provisions governing derivative works. In addition to correcting this misunderstanding, the Article points to recent decisions relating to remedies in copyright cases that further open the door to implementation of a doctrine of blocking copyrights. Taking this opportunity to incorporate the more favorable treatment of improvers seen in cases involving tangible property, this Article suggests that courts revisit copyright law’s treatment of unauthorized improvers and utilize key principles of a blocking copyrights doctrine in the remedies stage of an infringement action. Specifically, this Article argues that courts should use the relief granted to copyright plaintiffs as a vehicle to allow for a more nuanced, principled approach to infringement by unauthorized derivative authors. This Article suggests criteria for when and how courts should incorporate into their remedies determinations features of the law that more appropriately account for the contributions of improvers, thereby effecting important aspects of a blocking copyrights doctrine, if not wholesale adoption of it...|$|E
