5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s, the Mount Vernon complex, {{which was}} {{initially}} intended for the storage of ashes from recent deaths, could no longer cope with the scale of exhumation projects fuelling the demand for columbarium niches. Another crematorium and columbarium complex was built at Mandai, and this commenced operations in 1982, equipped with eight small and four medium-sized <b>cremators</b> and a total of 64,370 niches for the storage of cremated remains. Chinese voluntary associations such as Pek San Theng were allowed to build columbaria to house the remains of those exhumed from clan-owned cemeteries, and temples and churches were allowed to accommodate cremated remains. Mount Vernon Crematorium ceased operations on 30 June 2004.|$|E
25|$|Modern <b>cremators</b> {{automatically}} {{monitor their}} interior {{to tell when}} the cremation process is complete. The time required for cremation varies from body to body, and, in modern furnaces, the process may be as fast as one hour per 50kg (100lb) of body weight.|$|E
25|$|Cremation {{might be}} {{preferable}} for environmental reasons. Burial is a known source of certain environmental contaminants, with the coffin itself being the major contaminant; however, in some countries, e.g. the UK, legislation now requires that <b>cremators</b> be fitted with abatement equipment (filters) that remove serious pollutants such as mercury.|$|E

Since adolescence, <b>Cremator</b> is in love with Ellen, a seller of Luxus just thinking of going up in life. By a stroke of fate, the fortune of Omar, will not stop just at the hands of Bel, but also in the <b>Cremator,</b> Duda confused with another, the two have the same name: Daniel Miranda.|$|R
25|$|Each {{cremation}} uses about 28 {{gallons of}} fuel and releases about 540 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce ~270,000 tons of carbon dioxide. That’s more CO2 pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year. The environmental impact may be reduced by using <b>cremators</b> for longer periods, and not cremating {{on the same day}} as the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions. Cremation is therefore becoming more friendly toward the environment though natural burials are also possible. Some funeral and crematorium owners offer a carbon neutral funeral service incorporating efficient-burning coffins made from lightweight recycled composite board.|$|E
2500|$|Renovation {{work was}} {{scheduled}} for April 2013 at the crematorium.

2500|$|Cremations can be [...] "delivery only", with no {{preceding}} chapel {{service at}} the crematorium (although a church service may have been held) or preceded by a service {{in one of the}} crematorium chapels. Delivery-only allows crematoria to schedule cremations to make best use of the <b>cremators,</b> perhaps by holding the body overnight in a refrigerator, allowing a lower fee to be charged. Delivery-only is sometimes called west chapel service in industry jargon.|$|E

2500|$|The chamber {{where the}} body is placed is called a retort and is lined with {{heat-resistant}} refractory bricks. Refractory bricks are designed in several layers. The outermost layer is usually simply an insulation material, e.g., mineral wool. Inside is typically a layer of insulation brick, mostly calcium silicate in nature. Heavy duty <b>cremators</b> are usually designed with two layers of fire bricks inside the insulation layer. The layer of fire bricks {{in contact with the}} combustion process protects the outer layer and must be replaced from time to time. [...] The coffin or container is inserted (charged) into the retort as quickly as possible to avoid heat loss through the top door. The container may be mounted on a charger (motorised trolley) that can quickly insert it, or on a fixed or movable hopper that allows the container to slide into the cremator.|$|E
