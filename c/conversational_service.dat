Advertisements for escort agencies often carefully skirt the legal line, and avoid specifically offering prostitution or sexual services. This fact in turn is well-known to police and the political powers, who, where prostitution is illegal, usually prefer to act against more visible and problematic street prostitution. This has been criticized as hypocrisy, especially where governments license and tax the escort agencies. However, there almost certainly do exist agencies that do go by these laws and do not facilitate prostitution. Some countries have used a two-pronged approach of criminalizing street prostitution but permitting or licensing prostitution in brothels or via escort agencies.|$|E

The dialog system is composed by a dialog manager, an interpreter that guides the spoken dialog and robot actions, in terms of user intentions and relevant environment stimuli associated to the current conversational situation. We demonstrate our approach by developing a tour–guide robot that is able to move around its environment, visually recognize informational posters, and explain sec-tions of the poster selected by the user via pointing gestures. This robot also incorporates simple methods to qualify confidence in its visual outcomes, to inform about its internal state, and to start error–prevention dialogs whenever necessary.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} the behavior and dialogue planning module of <b>conversational</b> <b>service</b> robots. Most of the previously built conversational robots cannot perform dialogue management necessary for accurately recognizing human intentions and providing information to humans. This model integrates robot behavior planning models with spoken dialogue management that is robust enough to engage in mixedinitiative dialogues in specific domains. It has two layers; the upper layer is responsible for global task planning using hierarchical planning and the lower layer engages in local planning by utilizing modules called experts, which are specialized for performing certain kind of tasks by performing physical actions and engaging in dialogues. This model enables switching and canceling tasks based on recognized human intentions. A preliminary implementation of the model, which has been integrated with Honda ASIMO, has shown its effectiveness.

40|$|Abstract—An {{important}} {{problem that}} arises during {{the execution of}} service-based applications concerns the ability {{to determine whether a}} running service can be substituted with one with a different interface, for example if the former is no longer available. Standard Bounded Model Checking techniques can be used to perform this check, but they must be able to provide answers very quickly, lest the check hampers the operativeness of the application, instead of aiding it. The problem becomes even more complex when <b>conversational</b> <b>services</b> are considered, i. e., services that expose operations that have Input/Output data dependencies among them. In this paper we introduce a formal verification technique for an extension of Linear Temporal Logic that allows users to include in formulae constraints on integer variables.

The approach is based on a framework for online testing and a formal test-generation method which guarantees functional correctness for conversational services.

They are commonly used in professional settings while their usage is somewhat less developed in mass market situations. They suffer in fact from serious drawbacks preventing them to be massively adopted. We believe however that the attention toward supplementary services may significantly increase due to the exceptional concomitance of two main trends. The first one concerns the current interest boasted by the introduction of next generation networks, such as 4 G/IMS through the MMTEL specification efforts.

Such assumption is not realistic since it implies that providers of {{the same kinds of}} services agree on the interfaces the services offer. By interface mapping we mean the class of approaches aiming at relaxing this assumption. Most of those approaches available in the literature focus on stateless services and simply address mapping operation names and data structures. Instead, this paper focuses on <b>conversational</b> <b>services</b> for which the sequence of required operation calls, i. e., the interaction protocol, matters. We use model checking to automati-cally identify the interaction protocols mapping.
