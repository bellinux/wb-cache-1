5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Three PASDE canisters, located {{throughout}} the <b>cargo</b> <b>bay,</b> also photogrammetrically recorded structural response {{data of the}} Mir solar arrays during the docked phase of the mission. This data was later analyzed {{on the ground to}} verify the use of photogrammetric techniques to characterize the structural dynamics of the array, thus demonstrating that this technology would result in cost and risk reduction for the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{determined that}} {{the primary cause of}} the aircraft's loss was that fire detection and suppression facilities in class B <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> (the type used aboard the 747-200 Combi) were inadequate. The accident alerted aviation authorities worldwide {{to the fact that the}} regulations regarding class B bays had lagged far behind the growth in capacity of such <b>cargo</b> <b>bays.</b> The exact source of ignition was never determined, but the report concluded that sufficient evidence was found to confirm that the fire had burned for some time and that it might have caused structural damage.|$|R
50|$|Meteor is 380 {{feet long}} overall with a 366-foot keel. Other {{dimensions}} include {{a beam of}} 45 feet and a depth of 26 feet. She contains 12 <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> which now contain an exhibit {{on the history of}} the ship.|$|R
50|$|After Data {{threatens to}} kill {{everyone}} in the room, Picard agrees to comply with their demands. He tells Riker to let Data, Troi, and O'Brien move safely {{to one of the}} <b>cargo</b> <b>bays.</b> Picard, Worf, and Keiko O'Brien accompany them as hostages.|$|R
5|$|Captain Archer is {{confined}} in a <b>Cargo</b> <b>bay,</b> and the aliens are unconvinced that Enterprise carries no currency or valuable materials. They set-off {{to find the}} vault themselves, leaving Krem and Archer to transfer the loot. Archer sees Tucker and sends him to the launch-bay to retrieve the Ferengi's hypospray. Doing so, Tucker revives Sub-Commander T'Pol, and they {{try to find a}} way to stop the Ferengi. She assumes the gas-machine was intentionally placed on the surface as a 'Trojan Horse'. In Sickbay, three of the four Ferengi search for the non-existent vault, and T'Pol uses a PADD to distract and then start an argument between them.|$|E
5|$|Kriosian {{ambassador}} Briam (Tim O'Connor) {{comes on}} board the Enterprise with some cargo, ready for a peace ceremony with the Valtian. As the ship heads to the rendezvous, they save two Ferengi from a failing ship. Despite security being assigned, the Ferengi enter the <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> and deactivate the stasis field on Briam's cargo, revealing a young Kriosian woman named Kamala (Famke Janssen). With the Ferengi secured, it is revealed that she is an empathic metamorph who can sense what males around her desire and react appropriately. She was being brought as an arranged marriage to the Valtian representative. Kamala is generating pheromones that can affect males around her, which was why she was kept in stasis until the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{destroys the}} machine {{powering}} it and prepares {{to destroy the}} Collector base. However, the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order to sterilize the base instead with a timed radiation pulse {{so that it can}} be used against the Reapers. After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the Normandy, Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man, who is either pleased or furious with Shepard's decision. As Shepard meets in the Normandys <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> with the survivors, Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper. Humanity now has the full attention of the Reapers, who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} cabin {{had a single}} aisle layout, with two seats abreast {{on the right and}} a single row on the left. The aft side had a toilet section and two <b>cargo</b> <b>bays.</b> The aircraft was to be flown by two pilots and one radio operator.|$|R
50|$|The ships {{themselves}} are frequently described as several inch high round rubber disks around a pencil. The {{tip of the}} pencil would be the <b>cargo</b> <b>bays,</b> the opposite end would be the FTL engines. The disks are where the crew, officers and passengers live and work.|$|R
50|$|Captain Janeway {{provides}} the Nyrians the warmer temperature and dim lighting they request for their sensitive physiology, but is suspicious enough to order them confined to <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> and the ships systems locked down. Over the following hours, the displacements continue until {{only a handful}} of Voyagers crew remain aboard.|$|R
5|$|The {{freighter}} {{features a}} large, upward-opening main deck cargo door on its forward port-side fuselage. Adjacent to this large cargo door is an exit door {{used by the}} pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main deck cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit, additional <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> {{is located}} {{at the bottom of the}} {{aircraft}} cavity and is loaded by using a pulley system to load the cargo from the ground. At 1.8 million cubic feet, the <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> of the largest Aeroscraft design is much larger than that of any existing commercial freight aircraft (including the Boeing 747-8F and the Antonov 124 aircraft).|$|E
40|$|Test {{methods for}} a video-based Cargo Fire Verification System A video-based fire and smoke {{detection}} system for <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> of airplanes has been developed. It {{was necessary to}} create a suite of fire sensitivity and false alarm immunity tests applicable to these vision based fire detection systems. This paper will concentrate on testing aspects and test cell modifications...|$|R
25|$|The Aeroscraft is a rigid airship, {{having an}} {{internal}} structure {{to maintain its}} shape. As such it can reach otherwise difficult or inaccessible locations and can hover indefinitely at zero airspeed and with a full payload on board. The design incorporates <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> that are larger than any current air, truck or rail transport, while the payload capacity is significantly more than the current 16-ton maximum for helicopters.|$|R
25|$|Like any airship, the Aeroscraft {{may be used}} to {{transport}} cargo to remote or difficult locations and to hover over uneven terrain, in both civil and military use. Its operational independence from runways, ground crews or other infrastructure makes it especially suited to military and emergency relief operations. The large <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> would allow outsize cargo such as wind turbines or large aerospace parts to be stored internally.|$|R
25|$|Space Shuttle Atlantis {{carried a}} miniaturised {{satellite}} known as PSSC-2, or Picosatellite Solar Cell Testbed 2 into orbit. PSSC-2 was successfully deployed from the shuttle's <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> on flight day 13, becoming the 180th and last Space Shuttle payload {{to be placed}} into orbit.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 Citron founded SPACEHAB, Inc., which designs, builds, and {{operates}} space research laboratories and space logistics modules that fly aboard the Space Shuttle fleet. It began its space commercialization roots {{through the development}} of privately owned, pressurized modules that fly in the shuttle’s <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> and double the amount of working and living space available to the astronaut crew.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{then got}} to work with Ferguson and Hurley using the shuttle arm to take its OBSS from the station's Canadarm2 {{operated}} by Garan and Furukawa. The station arm had plucked the OBSS from its stowage position on the shuttle <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> sill. The handoff was to prepare to use the boom for any shuttle heat shield late inspections if required. Magnus worked with TV setup and Walheim transferred spacewalk gear.|$|E

5000|$|Conventional cargo designs {{generally}} [...] "mass out" [...] {{before they}} [...] "bulk out", {{meaning that they}} often fly mostly empty inside. In this case the aircraft is carrying around a large fuselage for no reason, adding mass and drag and thereby lowering performance. Nevertheless, {{they need to have}} oversized <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> for the cases where they have to carry bulky loads, rare as these may be. Lockheed's patent states: ...|$|R
50|$|Apocrypha 1.5 was {{released}} on August 20, 2009 and considered by CCP to be a mini-expansion. CCP felt that Apocrypha {{was released}} very early for a Summer expansion, {{and that they had}} enough content ready to go for it to be classified as more than a patch. The new mini-expansion brought to EVE four more epic mission arcs, new rig sizes, specialized <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> for specific ships, and performance enhancements for their Factional Warfare.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, Boeing {{announced}} plans for a scaled-up variant of the X-37B, referring {{to it as the}} X-37C. The X-37C spacecraft would be between 165% and 180% {{of the size of the}} X-37B, allowing it to transport up to six astronauts inside a pressurized compartment housed in the <b>cargo</b> <b>bay.</b> Its proposed launch vehicle is the Atlas V Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle. In this role, the X-37C could potentially compete with Boeing's CST-100 commercial space capsule.|$|E
25|$|Bolden piloted Space Shuttle Discovery during STS-31. Launched on April 24, 1990 from Kennedy Space Center, {{the crew}} spent the five-day mission {{deploying}} the Hubble Space Telescope and conducting {{a variety of}} middeck experiments. They also {{used a variety of}} cameras, including both the IMAX in cabin and <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> cameras, for Earth observations from their record-setting altitude of over 400 miles. Following 75 orbits of Earth in 121 hours, Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base on April 29, 1990.|$|E
25|$|Pettit and Kimbrough {{used the}} station’s Canadarm2 to move Leonardo from the Harmony module {{and placed in}} the shuttle’s <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> at 21:52 UTC. Stefanyshyn-Piper packed up {{equipment}} and supplies used for the four spacewalks and moved them to Endeavour for return, while Magnus continued work on the station’s new regenerative life support system. She drained a condensate collection tank to create the optimum ratio of condensate and distillate from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA), and gathered additional water samples for testing.|$|E
50|$|They {{usually have}} a sheet-metal body or open frame that rests on three wheels, a canvas roof with {{drop-down}} sides, a small cabin {{in the front of}} the vehicle for the driver, an air-cooled scooter version of a two-stroke engine, with handlebar controls instead of a steering wheel.The smaller motorized trikes are used as delivery vehicles for lighter loads. The larger trikes, with more powerful engines, have larger <b>cargo</b> <b>bays,</b> and they can carry freight within a city.|$|R
50|$|She materializes in {{an earlier}} time (2371). It is Voyagers first year in the Delta Quadrant and Kes {{transforms}} her appearance to {{the way she looked}} back then to blend in. She goes to the aeroponics bay, where she stuns and hides her younger self. Barely disguising her anger and hostility, she interacts with the crew when she must. She boards a shuttle in one of the <b>cargo</b> <b>bays,</b> taps into its communications system and plots a course for her home world, Ocampa.|$|R
50|$|Selecting a {{unit load}} size for {{distribution}} {{can be difficult}} because containers/pallets are usually available only in standard sizes and configurations; truck trailers, rail boxcars, and airplane <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> are limited in width, length, and height; {{and the number of}} feasible container/pallet sizes for a load may be limited due to the existing warehouse layout and storage rack configurations and customer package/carton size and retail store shelf restrictions. Also, the practical size of a unit load may be limited by the equipment and aisle space available and the need for safe material handling.|$|R
25|$|The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has {{established}} regulations regarding the carrying of {{certain types of}} batteries on airplanes because of their instability in certain situations. This action was partially inspired by a <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> fire on a FedEx airplane and the crash of UPS Airlines Flight 6. On 16 May 2012, the United States Postal Service (USPS) banned shipping anything containing a lithium battery to an overseas address due to fires from transport of batteries. The ban was lifted on 15 November 2012.|$|E
25|$|Pilot and {{observer}} sat {{in tandem}} under a sliding canopy, while the rear fuselage held a <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> with a hinged tail cone {{capable of carrying}} 2,000lb (910kg) of cargo, which could include a complete PT-6 engine, or five paratroopers, in extremely cramped conditions, with a sixth paratrooper in the observer's seat. Four 7.62mm machine guns were mounted in pods {{on the side of}} the fuselage, while 2,000lb (910kg) of external stores, including bombs, rockets and gun pods, could be carried on hardpoints under the wings and fuselage. To meet the specification's requirements for amphibious operations, it could be fitted with two large floats.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, the {{remaining}} Mars aircraft {{were to be}} sold for scrap, but a Canadian company, Forest Industries Flying Tankers (FIFT), was formed and bid for the four aircraft and a large spares inventory. The company represented a consortium of British Columbia forest companies, and the bid was accepted and the sale completed in December 1959. The four aircraft were flown to Fairey Aviation at Victoria, British Columbia, for conversion into water bombers. The conversion involved the installation of a tank in the <b>cargo</b> <b>bay</b> and retractable pick-up scoops to allow uploading of water while the aircraft was taxiing. The scoops allowed 30 tons of water to be taken on board in 22 seconds. Later some of the hull fuel tanks were replaced with water tanks.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, CM's Corporation {{released}} an 18 cm. action figure of Mechander Robo {{as part of}} the Mecha Action Series line. The figure features a Mechander Max jet that docks in the back, as well as <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> on the feet to store either the Triger-3 ship, the New Triger or two Jaws shark missiles. The forearm shields can combine into the Mechander UFO weapon. Other accessories include the Mechander Fencer sword, additional hands and an Omega Missile. A second edition in a metallic finish was also released.|$|R
25|$|The airport {{currently}} has 70 parking bays, {{one of which}} can accommodate the super-jumbo Airbus A380. Parking bays at the domestic terminal include one in-contact bay for Airbus A300-sized aircraft, nine in-contact bays for Airbus A320/Boeing 737-sized aircraft, and 49 remote bays for A320/737-sized aircraft. Parking bays at the international terminal include seven in-contact bays for Boeing 747-sized aircraft, 13 remote bays for 747-sized aircraft, one remote bay for an A380 aircraft, and three <b>cargo</b> <b>bays</b> for 747-sized aircraft. Works on the 24 new night parking bays had been completed in the apron area. With the new parking bays, the Chennai airport has 81 parking bays. Chennai airport is the first airport in India to have aero-bridges at the domestic terminal.|$|R
50|$|Geordi and Data also {{discover}} particle {{emissions in}} one of the <b>cargo</b> <b>bays,</b> creating an expanding subspace rift which threatens to breach the hull. They devise a method to counter the emissions and close the rift, but they need a way to trace the emissions to the source. Commander Riker volunteers, as he has been taken several nights in a row. Dr. Crusher injects him with a stimulant intended to counteract the sedative his captors are using, and he carries a tracking device which can be detected from the Enterprise when he is taken. Riker is again taken that night and finds himself in a strange environment on an operating table, near the other missing crew member, surrounded by busy aliens.|$|R
