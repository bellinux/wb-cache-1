5|$|Arad has 22 synagogues, {{of which}} 11 are Ashkenazi, 9 are Sephardi, one is Yemenite, {{and one is}} Ethiopian. Both the central Ashkenazi and Sephardi synagogues {{are located in the}} Ye'elim neighborhood. There are Gerrer synagogues in Avishur and Halamish, and a Chabad synagogue in Ye'elim. There are two mikvehs in the city–in the Tlalim and Ayanot neighborhoods. The city also has a small Messianic <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> being accused of illegal missionary {{activities}} by the Haredim and certain right-wing groups. Arad's dead are mostly buried in the local cemetery, located in the northeastern outskirts of the city, close to the road to Masada.|$|E
5|$|Peracarid crustaceans, {{including}} isopods, {{are known}} to form {{a significant part of}} the macrobenthic <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. In 2000, scientists of the Diversity of the deep Atlantic benthos (DIVA 1) expedition (cruise M48/1 of the German research vessel RV Meteor III) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean. In 2003, De Broyer et al. collected some 68,000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands. They found that about 98% of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily Lysianassoidea, and 2% to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000meters.|$|E

5|$|As M-37 crosses into Lake County, {{the highway}} crosses the Pere Marquette River. US10 follows M-37 through Baldwin. The Marquette Rail line turns westward {{on the edge}} of town, and north of Baldwin, the highway forms the {{dividing}} line between the Manistee National Forest to the west and the Pere Marquette State Forest to the east. The road crosses the Little Manistee River near Peacock and the Pine River in southwest Wexford County. M-37 curves to the northeast {{along the edge of the}} Hodenpyl Dam Pond near Mesick. M-37 turns east to follow M-115 through the community and then returns to a northward course into Sherman and on to Buckley. North of the latter community, the highway crosses into Grand Traverse County. The area around Buckley transitions to agricultural use again. This landscape continues past the M-113 to the area known as Chums Corners. There, M-37 merges with US31, and the two run through a small unincorporated <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> host to Wuerfel Park, home of the Traverse City Beach Bums, a minor league baseball team.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|Sam Houston was an {{attorney}} by profession and politically accomplished {{even before he}} moved to Texas. In Tennessee, he had been both {{a member of the}} United States House of Representatives and Governor. His military victory at the Battle of San Jacinto elevated him to hero status in Texas. After completing his first term as President of the Republic of Texas in early December 1838, he continued to practice law from his office in Liberty. He arrived in Mobile, Alabama, in the early months of 1839 as a partner of the Sabine City Company, seeking investors to develop a <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> today known as Sabine Pass. Through Martin Lea, he made the acquaintance of Antoinette's husband William Bledsoe, a wealthy businessman who in turn suggested Nancy Lea as a possible investor. Invited to a garden party at Martin's home, it was there Houston first became acquainted with Margaret. The mutual attraction was instantaneous.|$|E

5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E

25|$|Many {{biologists}} {{fell into}} two camps: the geneticists, who mostly {{worked in the}} laboratory; and naturalists, who studied natural populations {{in the field and}} museums, and put much of their effort into taxonomy. Each contributed concepts that were essential to the understanding of evolution. Naturalists introduced the biological species concept, the definition of species as a <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> reproductively isolated and occupies a distinctive ecological niche. They also recognized that species are polytypic, having variations in time and space; and that behavior and change of function can give rise to evolutionary change.|$|E

Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a <b>community...</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|E

25|$|The Nockamixon Cliffs are {{situated}} {{along the river}} {{in such a way}} that the north facing cliffs in Pennsylvania receive little to no direct sunlight, causing their temperatures to be cooler than normal.

The south facing cliffs in New Jersey at Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park have a nearly opposite habitat. They receive a high amount of sunshine, which makes the area near the cliffs warmer and drier than usual, creating a habitat for plants that normally thrive in much more arid areas.|$|E
