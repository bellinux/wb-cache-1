Mitchell Reichgut, director of the series, says in an e-mail newsletter:Another question that keeps <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> IRC channel and in forums around the web, is our rumored connection to SONY. As it happens, one of our producers has a day job there (which was probably the genesis of all the conspiracy theories) but that's {{as far as it}} goes. We pay for The Scene ourselves and the idea that the show is some kind of anti-piracy propaganda is truly silly.|$|R
60|$|We couldn't {{keep from}} talking about them, and they {{was all the}} time <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> memory, and looking {{just the way they}} looked when we was all alive and happy together. We could see the line marching, and the shiny spearheads a-winking in the sun; we could see the dromedaries lumbering along; we could see the wedding and the funeral; and more oftener than {{anything}} else we could see them praying, because they don't allow nothing to prevent that; whenever the call come, several times a day, they would stop right there, and stand up and face to the east, and lift back their heads, and spread out their arms and begin, and four or five times they would go down on their knees, and then fall forward and touch their forehead to the ground.|$|R

This is what they must have done. Nor have we any means of preventing their doing so, for nothing short of a force strong enough to reach down to the sea on either hand would prevent their passing us. At any rate we must halt here for a time. The whole of our baggage animals are destroyed, and nothing can be done until another train is collected." ...|$|R

40|$|Two strands came {{together}} to make the warp and woof of this year s meeting. The first was {{an article in the}} Journal of Medical Ethics by John Saunders, consultant physician at Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny and Professor of Philosophy, Humanities and Law in Health Care at the University of Wales, entitled The Practice of Medicine as an Art and as a Science in which he argues that although the practice of modern medicine is the application of science, the ideal of which has the objective of value-neutral truth, the reality is different: conclusions are applied by value judgements that may be impossible to specify in particular circumstances. For medicine as an art its chief instrument must be human faculty. the ability to listen and empathise [...] for the doctor {{to be part of the}} treatment; but although part of the art of medicine may lie in these areas, it does not exclusively do so. The art and science of medicine are inseparable, part of a common culture. The second strand, which kept <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> discussions last year, especially in the context of Diana Brighouse s talk on the her work as a psychotherapist with heartsink pain patients, is the concept of healing, of restoration to health and wholeness, which includes but is so much more than the relief of physical pain and which we can still aspire to even when this fails. We were doubly fortunate in having both John Saunders and his friend and colleague Martyn Evans, Professor of Philosophy at Durham University to guide us <b>in</b> <b>our</b> explorations of these inter-related subjects. Unfortunately thanks to the temperamental recording system (and the incompetence of it s operator me) the record is incomplete and omits much of the discussion which is such an important part of these meetings.
