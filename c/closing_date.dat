In both years, lambs grew faster (g/head/d) in spring at low (327; 385) than high (253; 285) stocking rate. Subterranean clover seedling populations (per m²), measured in autumn after grazing treatments in the previous spring, were greater at low (2850) than high (2500) stocking rate and declined with later <b>closing</b> <b>dates</b> (3850, 2950, 2100 and 1700 at 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks after early flowering). Seedling populations measured in autumn after grazing treatments in the second spring were unaffected by stocking rate (1290 low and 1190 high) but declined with later <b>closing</b> <b>dates</b> (1470, 1320 and 940).
