50|$|Many cash {{in transit}} {{companies}} are private security companies that offer <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> {{as part of}} their services. Loomis is today the only major CIT business that is fully dedicated to <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> after the split from Securitas. Brinks spun off its home security division setting the focus as well on <b>cash</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In an {{automated}} <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> environment, a cashier or teller opens a cash drawer (till) {{at the start}} of shift by dispensing cash from the automated <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> equipment. [...] At the end of the shift, the cashier or teller deposits cash into the automated <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> equipment which counts the cash and deposits it back into the safe. A manager sets permissions for each teller or cashier for dispensing and counting cash. A few automated <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> systems allow for networking and remote operation (dispensing, counting, reporting). Remote operation of automated <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> equipment facilitates cost savings and efficiency by centralizing all cash-related activity to one location that can remotely monitor and control cash operations.|$|R

40|$|During {{the recent}} years, {{electronic}} payment methods {{have become more}} customary and in cases more preferable. Nevertheless, cash remains a popular form of payment due, inter alia, to its ubiquity. Large use of cash is associated with security issues, investment costs, logistics costs of transport and <b>handling</b> <b>cash,</b> personnel costs, and the like. To deal with these issues, many retailers have, to different extents, outsourced <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> services to CiT companies. Kappe’ and Schiphol Airport Retail (SAR) are two retail groups functioning {{at a number of}} locations in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. They currently outsource part of their <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> services to ABN-AMRO and GWK-Travelex. This results in a further increase in costs incurred by Kappe’ and SAR. Consequently, enhancing the efficiency of money flow is of significant importance to both corporations. The aim of this research is to develop <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> processes which can bring about a more efficiency. This is done firstly by conducting a literature review on the reasons behind large costs of <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> for retailers. Then the current processes of <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> at Kappe' and SAR are studied to explore their deficiencies. After that, alternatives (e. g. automation, joint cash office, clustering) which can bring about a more efficient <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> process are proposed and assessed on criteria of interest to the problem owners (Kappe' and SAR). The implementation chapter is done for the selected alternative. In the next stage, the prudence of the selected processes is e-evaluated by using a multi-criteria analysis methodology and also based on the trends in customers’ use of cash in payments. Finally, given the findings of the research, recommendations are provided for future improvement in <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> processes.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} roles Automatic <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> systems play in an everyday economy. With few setbacks these systems {{do much more}} than dispense money, read checks, transfer money through bank accounts, etc. Automatic <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> systems are now found in prisons to help inmates' relatives transfer money to prisoners. This process is done electronically and is much more efficient and faster than previously manual money transfers. These systems also help prisoners psyche by dissuading prisoners from committing fraud or stealing money. In 1987 automated <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> systems started to become a favorite among retailers nationwide. The effectiveness and quick checkouts by customers encouraged to use debit/credit cards, acted as an attractant for customers. It would not be long until most businesses had installed automated <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> systems as way to keep customers satisfied.In states such as Oregon and New Jersey, where pumping your own gas is outlawed, automated <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> has played an important role as a crime deterrent and economical sound system. Gas attendants now do {{not have to worry about}} being burglarized. With automated cash systems in place at these gas stations, everything is used by computer, making transactions faster than ever. These systems also allow petroleum companies to save money and ensure a higher level of security.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{industrial}} powders, {{most of them}} organic, were characterized in terms of volumetric mean size, size distribution, density, particle shape, water rentention characteristics (under a series of controlled ambient relative humidities) and loosely packed and densely packed voidages (giving the compressibility). The behaviour of the powders in powder <b>handling</b> <b>apparatus</b> (a precision powder filler) was also determined.

The filling capacity of the powder <b>handling</b> <b>apparatus</b> was found {{to be related to the}} maximum bulk density of the powder while the filling accuracy turned out to be related to the compressibility of the powder.

40|$|In today’s ever-evolving society {{the use of}} cash is {{replaced}} by digital services in the banking sector. Some local banks restrict manual <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> while others remove it completely. This essay examines how management accounting is affected by restricted <b>cash</b> <b>handling.</b> The theory clarifies that management accounting strategies create guidelines and provides specific framework for employees and managers in the organization. If the strategy is unclear employees may have difficulty knowing how to achieve the set objectives.   The empirical study {{is based on a}} case study of two banks that have chosen to maintain the strategy of manual <b>cash</b> <b>handling</b> to a limited extent. Bank staff were asked about the strategy regarding restricted <b>cash</b> <b>handling,</b> and how they expect it to affect management accounting. The results of the study shows that the banking industry is a highly controlled industry. Furthermore, restricted <b>handling</b> of <b>cash</b> partially affects the bank staff at a functional level. The service to manage cash over the counter is decreasing and begins to disappear and the service {{is replaced}} by ATM's and thus administrative management is the most affected. This in turn shows that banks need less staff and thus can decrease costs...|$|R
