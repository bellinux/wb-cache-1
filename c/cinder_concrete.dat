5000|$|The building's older design {{utilizes}} thick masonry {{and gives}} the building added strength, which helped the building withstand the attacks and remain structurally sound. The building has thick, heavy masonry in the exterior infill walls, which encloses the building's steel frame. Brick, <b>cinder,</b> <b>concrete</b> and other masonry materials encase interior steel columns, beams, girders and other structural elements. The masonry allowed the structure to absorb much of the energy from debris hitting the building. [...] Nonetheless, the building had extensive damage to its east and south facades. Underground cable vaults belonging to Verizon, along with other underground utility infrastructure were also heavily damaged from water and debris.|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis {{consists}} of two parts, theoretical and practical. In the theoretical section are listed basic information about alternative aggregates used for concrete mixture, like polystyrene, <b>cinder</b> and recycled <b>concrete.</b> Further, the influence of these alternative aggregates, used as secondary raw materials, on the behaviour and properties of fresh respectively hardened concrete. Possibilities of application concrete containing secondary raw materials are mentioned. In the practical part are experimentally verified physical and mechanical properties of concrete containing crushed waste polystyrene beads, furthermore thermal insulation properties and resistance to elevated temperatures is tested. Influence of heating plant cinder powder as active addition to concrete mixture was tested. As a next is prepared concrete with replacement of coarse aggregate by <b>cinder</b> and recycled <b>concrete</b> and tested. The influence of these secondary raw materials on workability, compressive strength, frost resistance and water permeability of concrete is also defined. The last part of research is focused on recycled concrete such as main material used in mixture of aggregates bonded with cement, dispose for base layers in roads. In conclusion are discussed results from experimental research and summary of knowledge’s about using polystyrene, <b>cinder</b> and recycled <b>concrete</b> as aggregates for concrete mixtures...|$|R

50|$|Blocks of <b>cinder</b> <b>concrete</b> (cinder blocks or breezeblocks), {{ordinary}} concrete (concrete blocks), or {{hollow tile}} are generically known as Concrete Masonry Units (CMUs). They usually are {{much larger than}} ordinary bricks and so are much faster to lay for a wall of a given size. Furthermore, cinder and concrete blocks typically have much lower water absorption rates than brick. They often are used as the structural core for veneered brick masonry, or are used alone for the walls of factories, garages and other industrial-style buildings where such appearance is acceptable or desirable. Such blocks often receive a stucco surface for decoration. Surface-bonding cement, which contains synthetic fibers for reinforcement, is sometimes used in this application and can impart extra strength to a block wall. Surface-bonding cement is often pre-coloured and can be stained or painted thus resulting in a finished stucco-like surface.|$|E

In {{order to better}} realize the pumice concrete wall and <b>cinder</b> <b>concrete</b> wall compressive strength, respectively to make three slices of pumice concrete wall and three slices of <b>cinder</b> <b>concrete</b> wall, wall compressive experiment was carried out. The experimental {{results showed that the}} compressive strength of pumice concrete wall and volcanic concrete wall meet the requirements of the bearing capacity of masonry structure. Foreword Because the low-rise building’s strength request of concrete in rural area is not high, we can use local made lightweight aggregate of lightweight aggregate concrete {{to meet the needs of}} the project. The experiment mainly studies that the wall’s compressive strength of scoria {{concrete and}} pumice concrete. Each wall made 3 pieces, and the concrete grade is CL 15. The measurements of height×width×thickness is 900 × 900 × 250 (mm). General situation of experiment The preparation of lightweight aggregate concrete According to the Technical Specification for Lightweight Aggregate Concrete[1]（in Chinese ）,the scoria concrete and pumice concrete mix proportion of CL 15 as following: cement: 210 kg/m 3, fly-ash: 90 kg/m 3,water: 150 kg/m 3,fine sand: 380 kg/m 3,pumice/scoria: 570 kg/m 3.

The five building material composite walls such as laterite stone, mud brick, cellular concrete, dense concrete and <b>cinder</b> <b>concrete</b> with total thirty configurations were studied. A computer simulation program was developed to compute unsteady heat transfer characteristics using the cyclic admittance procedure. From the results, {{it is observed that}} the decrement factor decreases with the increase in the divided air space thickness within the composite wall for all building materials. Dense concrete was observed to be the energy efficient from the lowest decrement factor point of view among five studied building materials. Dense concrete decrement factor decreases by 23. 65 % for 0. 02 m air space thickness compared to the conventional composite wall without air space. It is also noticed that the time lag increases with the increase in the divided air space thickness within the composite wall for all building materials. Cellular concrete was observed to be the energy efficient from highest time lag perspective among five studied building materials. Cellular concrete time lag increases by 6. 23 % for 0. 02 m air space thickness compared to the conventional composite wall without air space. The results of the study help in designing energy efficient building enclosures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe energy {{consumption}} {{associated with the}} cooling of the buildings is huge. In India buildings consume about 33 % of country's power production for cooling and day lighting. The building enclosures such as walls, roofs and glasses play very vital role in reducing cooling loads in the buildings. The proper combination of window glass materials and wall materials can cut down the cooling costs extensively. In the present work, five different glass materials such as clear, bronze, grey, green and blue-green glass materials were selected and four different building materials such as burnt brick, <b>cinder</b> <b>concrete,</b> dense concrete and fly ash brick either side plastered with cement plaster were selected. Total twenty building models with various combinations of window glass and wall materials were designed in licensed Design builder 4. 3. 0. 039 version and thermal analysis {{was carried out in}} Energy plus 8. 1 software package. Thermal performance of various building models in four different climatic zones such as hot and dry, temperate, warm and humid and composite were investigated. From the results of the study, it is observed that fly ash brick wall building model with grey window glass is found to be energy efficient in all Indian climatic zones from the reduced cooling load point of view among all studied combinations in East, West, North and South orientations. From the results it is observed that the fly ash brick buildings with grey glass window is observed to be the most energy efficient combination for reducing cooling loads as they gain the least heat gain in south orientation (21. 51 kWh) for Ahmedabad region. The results of the study help in designing energy efficient passive buildings...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{pressure}} at five selected sites on the plantar surface of the foot and adaptations in running kinematics among fourteen male varsity collegiate distance runners on five different surfaces [...] asphalt, <b>cinders,</b> <b>concrete,</b> grass, and tartan. Pressure data were collected with an Electrodynogram system (EDG) and kinematic data were collected with a Redlake LOCAM 16 mm high-speed camera operating at 100 fps. Repeated measures ANOVA was utilized to evaluate differences (p< 0. 10) among the variables. Pressure at the fifth metatarsal site on the left foot was found to be higher on the harder surfaces [...] asphalt, concrete, and tartan [...] than on the softer surfaces [...] grass and cinders. Higher pressures were found, in general, on the metatarsal region of the foot as opposed to the calcaneal region, especially while running on the harder surfaces. This finding may suggest that adequate shock absorption occurs in the calcaneal region of the shoe used in this study, and/or the metatarsal region of the foot-shoe interface may merit more attention than is commonly thought. This contention is substantiated by the research of Cavanagh & LaFortune (1980). Among the kinematic variables quantified [...] stride length, stride rate, single leg support time, and swing time [...] only stride rate varied with surfaces. Stride rate was found to be slightly, but significantly (p< 0. 10) slower on concrete and asphalt than on the softer surfaces. The differences observed may be representative of a tendency of runners to slow down on concrete and therefore attenuate as much force as possible. This contention is substantiated by the research of Feehery (1986) and Nigg (1985). The other three kinematic variables were relatively unaffected by differences in the running surfaces investigated. The results of this study indicate that the underlying mechanisms and adaptations to running on different surface types are extremely complex phenomena which merit further investigation before physical educators and coaches can be provided with firm guidelines for appropriate running surface(s) for students and athletes...|$|R
50|$|Donk's Theatre was a {{historic}} movie theater located at Hudgins, Mathews County, Virginia. It {{was built in}} 1946-1947, and was a vernacular rectangular building constructed of rusticated <b>cinder</b> and <b>concrete</b> block, painted white and cream with Art Deco style details. The building measured 50 feet by 100 feet, and consisted of the central theatre entrance, storefronts, and a 504-seat auditorium. The theater operated as a segregated venue for motion pictures until passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964. The movie business was declining due to TV, and the theater closed in 1970. It reopened in 1975, as a live country music concert hall. On January 22, 2016, the roof of Donk's collapsed due to heavy snowfall from a winter storm, as did several of the outside walls. Little survived, and what remains {{will have to be}} demolished; the owners have said that they will save the marquee.|$|R

50|$|This city is {{the heart}} of the sugar market in Morelos. Fields cover much of the rural areas, and have been around since the 1600s. Sugar has been a large part of Morelos' economy, and {{continues}} to be so today. Many spend their days tending only to the sugar cane, and after the season (typically the harvest is made in the dry season), campesinos cut the cane, extract the sugar, and burn the fields. Also another large contributor to Cuautla's economy, is the construction workers, and the cement business.

50|$|Greendale {{is located}} {{southwest}} of Milwaukee, and its central core is roughly bounded by West Loomis Road, West Grange Avenue, Westway, and Southway. Its layout, as {{designed in the}} 1930s, has circulation patterns for both vehicular and non-vehicular movements, winding roads providing access to single-family and duplex homes, and a central business district that also houses municipal functions. Parks of various sizes are interspersed in the landscape. Originally three clusters of development were planned, but funding cuts meant that only one was actually built. Labor for the construction and development was {{funded in part by}} the Works Progress Administration. The principal municipal buildings of the village were designed by Walter G. Thomas in the Colonial Revival style. Utility lines were buried, and included a full complement of services: water, sewer, electricity, and telephone.

40|$|Recent testing {{performed}} at the plasma research center of Retech Systems, LLC processed simulated low- level radioactive wastes (LLW) at a production scale using high-energy plasma as a heat source. Various combinations of metal-oxide feeds were processed {{in order to determine}} their effect on plasma torch operation, throughput, plant performance, glass chemistry and density of poured wastes. Testing took place in November of 1999 using a full-scale production Plasma Arc Centrifugal Treatment (PACT) system located at Retech where the melt zone is a rotating cylindrica l hearth (centrifuge) and the heating source is a swirl flow, hollow electrode, plasma arc torch. The simulated LLW included <b>concrete</b> <b>cinder</b> block, refractory insulation board, soda-lime glass, and sand. This study has shown that processing these simulated LLW and forming slags of various compositions is difficult if the instantaneous feed composition is very high in silica. The electrical resistance of pure silica is high, especially at low temperatures, increasing plasma torch operating voltage markedly. Because the sand can spread rapidly over the centrifuge bottom, feed rates must be reduced when nearly pure sand is fed to reduce the thickness of the unmelted, unmixed surface centrifuge contents. The difficulties may occur either because a whole drum of sand is fed, or because of segregation of sand while a previously mixed drum is fed through our Archimedes type feeder...|$|R
