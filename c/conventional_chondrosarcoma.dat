40|$|Abstract Background G-CSF {{is known}} to {{function}} as a hematopoietic growth factor and it {{is known to}} be responsible for leukocytosis. G-CSF-producing tumors associated with leukocytosis include various types of malignancies. Case presentation We report the case of a 72 -year-old man with dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma characterized by dedifferentiated components of malignant fibrous histiocytoma- or osteosarcoma-like features in addition to <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma,</b> arising from his pelvic bone. After hemipelvectomy, when local recurrence and metastasis were identified, leukocytosis appeared and an elevated level of serum granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was also recognized. The patient died of multiple organ failure 2 months after surgery. Autopsy specimens showed that the histological specimens of the recurrence and metastasis were dedifferentiated components, without any <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> components. G-CSF was expressed only in the dedifferentiated components, not in the chondrosarcoma components, immunohistochemically. Conclusion This is the first report of chondrosarcoma, or any other primary bone tumor, with leukocytosis, probably stimulated by tumor-produced G-CSF from the dedifferentiated components. </p...|$|E
40|$|The mesenchymal, clear cell, and dedifferentiated {{chondrosarcoma}} subtypes {{are extremely}} rare, together constituting 10 % to 15 % of all chondrosarcomas. Their poor prognosis {{and lack of}} efficacious treatment emphasizes the need to elucidate the pathways playing {{a pivotal role in}} these tumors. We constructed tissue microarrays containing 42 dedifferentiated, 23 clear cell, and 23 mesenchymal chondrosarcomas and performed immunohistochemistry to study the expression of growth plate-signaling molecules and molecules shown to be involved in <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma.</b> We observed high expression of SOX- 9 and FGFR- 3, as well as aberrant cellular localization of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in all subtypes. TGFβ signaling through p-SMAD 2 and PAI- 1 was highly active in all chondrosarcoma subtypes, which suggests that TGFβ inhibitors as a possible therapeutic strategy in rare chondrosarcoma subtypes. As in <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma,</b> antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl- 2, and/or Bcl-xl) were highly expressed in all subtypes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{are limited}} {{data about the}} role of {{chemotherapy}} in patients with advanced chondrosarcomas. METHODS: The medical charts of 180 patients with advanced chondrosarcomas having received chemotherapy in 15 participating institutions between 1988 and 2011 were reviewed. RESULTS: Median age was 52 years. Sixty-three percent of patients had <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> and 88 % had metastatic disease. Combination chemotherapy was delivered in 98 cases (54. 5 %). One hundred and thirty-one patients (73 %) received an anthracycline-containing regimen. Using RECIST, the objective response rate was significantly different according to histological subtype, being 31 % for mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, 20. 5 % for dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, 11. 5 % for <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> and 0 % for clear-cell chondrosarcoma (P = 0. 04). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4. 7 months [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3 - 6. 5]. Performance status (PS) >/= 2, number of metastatic sites >/= 1 and single-agent regimen were independently associated with poor PFS. Median overall survival (OS) was 18 months (95 % CI 14. 5 - 21. 6). PS, number of metastatic sites and palliative surgery were independently associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional chemotherapy have very limited efficacy in patients with advanced chondrosarcoma, the highest benefit being observed in mesenchymal and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: For {{patients}} who have chondrosarcoma with unresectable disease, because of tumor location, tumor size, or extensive metastatic disease, treatment options are very limited because of their relative resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

40|$|PURPOSE: Chondrosarcomas are {{notoriously}} resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. We sought to identify critical signaling pathways {{that contribute to}} their survival and proliferation, and which may provide potential targets for rational therapeutic interventions. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) was surveyed using phospho-RTK arrays. S 6 phosphorylation and NRAS mutational status were examined in chondrosarcoma primary tumor tissues. siRNA or small-molecule inhibitors against RTKs or downstream signaling proteins were applied to chondrosarcoma cells and changes in biochemical signaling, cell cycle, and cell viability were determined. In vivo antitumor activity of BEZ 235, a phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /mTOR inhibitor, was evaluated in a chondrosarcoma xenograft model. RESULTS: Several RTKs were identified as critical mediators of cell growth, but the RTK dependencies varied among cell lines. In exploration of downstream signaling pathways, strong S 6 phosphorylation was found in 69 % of <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcomas</b> and 44 % of dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas. Treatment with BEZ 235 resulted in dramatic reduction {{in the growth of}} all chondrosarcoma cell lines. Tumor growth was similarly inhibited in a xenograft model of chondrosarcoma. In addition, chondrosarcoma cells with an NRAS mutation were sensitive to treatment with a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor. Functional NRAS mutations were found in 12 % of <b>conventional</b> central <b>chondrosarcomas.</b> CONCLUSIONS: RTKs are commonly activated in chondrosarcoma, but because of their considerable heterogeneity, targeted inhibition of the PI 3 K/mTOR pathway represents a rational therapeutic strategy. Chondrosarcomas with NRAS mutations may benefit from treatment with MEK inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Aim of {{this study}} was to analyze (1) survival, local {{recurrence}} (LR), and metastasis rates between the three histological tumor grades; (2) whether type of treatment and tumor site influenced prognosis for each histologic grade. Methods We retrospectively studied 296 patients with central <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcomas</b> (CS) (87 grade 1, 162 grade 2, and 47 grade 3). The femur was the most common site (91 cases), followed by the pelvis (82) and other less frequent sites. Type of surgery was related with histologic grade. Margins were wide in 222 cases, marginal in 23, and intralesional in 51 cases. Results At a mean of 7 years, 201 patients remained continuously NED, 33 were NED after treatment of relapse, 15 were AWD, 35 were died of disease, and 12 of other causes. Survival was 92 % at 5 years and 84 % at 10 years, significantly influenced by histological grading. In grade 3 CS, two factors influenced survival: type of surgery (resection vs. amputation, P = 0. 051) and site (P = 0. 039). The two significant factors lost their significance at multivariate analysis. Conclusion Central conventional CS with low/intermediate grade has a good prognosis, while high-grade tumors have poor outcome. Tumor relapses are strictly related with histologic grade...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} Aurora Kinase A and B in patients with chondrosarcoma and consider it as a prognostic marker and molecular target of therapy. Methods To evaluate {{the relationship of the}} Aurora Kinase A and B and the clinical pathological parameters and prognosis of chondrosarcoma. 72 case chondrosarcoma and 42 case chondroma were performed immunohistochemistry on the tissue microarray paraffin sections. The survival time of patients was followed-up. Results The expression of Aurora Kinase A and B in chondrosarcoma was significantly higher than that in chondroma (p). There were differences about the expression of Aurora Kinase A and B in chondrosarcoma between the recurrence group and the non-recurrence group, metastatic group and non-metastatic group (p), but not age and gender (p> 0. 05). The expression of Aurora Kinase A and B were significantly lower in group low grade <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> than that in groups medium and high grade <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> (p). The expression of Aurora Kinase A and B in chondrosarcoma showed a positive correlation (p). According to the Kaplan Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis, the survival rate was significantly different between the patients with positive Aurora Kinase A and the patients with negative expression (p) and Aurora Kinase A expression was an independent risk marker of survival(HR= 11. 263, 95 %CI: 2. 317 – 54. 748, P= 0. 003).

40|$|Chondrosarcoma {{represents}} approximately 11 % of all primary malignant bone tumors. It is {{the second}} most common sarcoma arising in bone after osteosarcoma.

For clustering, eight hierarchical clustering algorithms, three distance metrics, {{as well as several}} approaches for data preprocessing, including multivariate outlier detection, logarithmic transformation, and z-score normalization, were systematically evaluated. By selecting clustering approaches shown to give reproducible results for cluster recovery of known cell types, primary conventional central chondrosacoma cells could be grouped in two main clusters with distinctive marker expression signatures: one group clustering together with mesenchymal stem cells (CD 49 b-high/CD 10 -low/CD 221 -high) and a second group clustering close to fibroblasts (CD 49 b-low/CD 10 -high/CD 221 -low).

40|$|Chordoma is {{the fourth}} most common {{malignant}} primary neoplasm of the skeleton and almost the only one showing a real epithelial phenotype. Besides classic chordoma, so-called chondroid chordoma {{was described as a}} specific entity showing cartilage-like tissue within chordomatoid structures. However, since its first description, strongly conflicting results have been reported about the existence of chondroid chordoma and several studies suggested chondroid chordomas being in fact low-grade <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcomas.</b> In the present study, we used cytoprotein expression profiling and molecular in situ localization techniques of marker gene products indicative of developmental phenotypes of chondrocytes to elucidate origin and biology of chondroid chordoma. We were able to demonstrate the chondrogenic potential of chordomas irrespectively of the appearance of overt cartilage formation by identifying the multifocal expression of type II collagen, the main marker of chondrocytic differentiation. Additionally, the cartilage-typical large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was present throughout all chordomas and, thus, a very characteristic gene product and marker of these neoplasms. Biochemical matrix composition and cell differentiation pattern analysis showed a high resemblance of classic chordomas and in chordoid areas of chondroid chordomas to the fetal chorda dorsalis, whereas chondroid areas of chondroid chordomas showed features similar to adult nucleus pulposus. This demonstrates on the cell function level the chondrocytic differentiation potential of neoplastic chordoid cells as a characteristic facet of chordomas, mimicking fetal vertebral development, ie, the transition of the chorda dorsalis to the nucleus pulposus. Our study firmly establishes a focal real chondrocytic phenotype of neoplastic cells in chordomas. Chondroid chordoma is neither a low-grade chondrosarcoma nor a misnomer as discussed previously...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Chondrosarcomas are {{malignant}} bone tumors {{that are}} characterized by the production of chondroid tissue. Since radiation therapy and chemotherapy have limited effect on chondrosarcoma, treatment of most patients depends on surgical resection. We conducted this study to identify independent predictive factors and survival characteristics for conventional central chondrosarcoma and dedifferentiated central chondrosarcoma. Methods. A systematic literature review was performed in September 2014 using the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Subsequent to a beforehand-composed selection procedure we included 13 studies, comprising a total of 1114 patients. Results. The prognosis of central chondrosarcoma is generally good for the histologically low-grade tumors. Prognosis for the high-grade chondrosarcoma and the dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma is poor with lower survival rates.

40|$|Salvaging {{the limb}} after {{malignant}} bone tumor ablation {{is a tough}} challenge for a reconstructive surgeon confronting such extensive bone defects. A 40 -year-old male without any underlying disease was incidentally diagnosed with a chondrosarcoma over his left femoral bone. An orthopedic surgeon did a wide resection of the malignant bone tumor, leaving a massive bone defect about 11. 3 cm in length. A double-barreled free vascularized fibular bone was designed to reconstruct the femoral bone defect. The maximal fibular bone graft harvested was 19 cm long; after the osteotomy, one barrel was 11 cm {{and the other was}} 8 cm. An iliac crest cancellous bone graft was harvested to fill the residual space.

40|$|International audienceThe {{clinical}} {{management of}} osteosarcoma differs significantly {{from that of}} chondrosarcoma; therefore, it is extremely important to diagnose these 2 types of bone tumor accurately. In {{the absence of a}} specific marker, differential diagnosis by histochemistry is sometimes impossible, especially between chondroblastic osteosarcoma and <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma.</b> We analyzed 165 bone sarcomas by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays for expression of the galectin- 1 (GAL 1) lectin and by Western blot experiments. We found that GAL 1 was abundant in normal human osteoblasts from benign proliferations and in osteosarcomas, including chondroblastic osteosarcomas, but not in chondrosarcomas. There was a highly significant statistical difference in the percentage of stained cells (P < 10 (- 4)) and in the staining intensity (P < 10 (- 3)) of chondroblastic osteosarcomas compared to conventional chondrosarcomas. This discriminatory potential of GAL 1 staining for osteosarcoma-derived tumors was confirmed by Western blotting. We propose a diagnostic test for bone tumors that takes into account the optimal discriminative values for the percentage of cells stained and the intensity of staining. The positive and negative predictive values were 85. 7 % (trust interval of 63. 7 %- 97 %) and 90 % (trust interval of 80 %- 95. 9 %), respectively, demonstrating the pertinence of the test.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} role of {{angiogenesis}} and cyclooxygenase- 2 expression in cartilaginous tumors and correlate these factors with prognosis. INTRODUCTION: For chondrosarcoma, the histological grade is the current standard for predicting tumor outcome. However, a low-grade chondrosarcoma can follow an aggressive course-as monitored by sequential imaging techniques-even when it is histologically indistinguishable from an enchondroma. Therefore, additional tools are needed to help identify the biological potential of these tumors. The degree of angiogenesis that is induced by the tumor could assist in this task. Angiogenesis can be quantified by measuring the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and CD 34, and cyclooxygenase- 2 can induce angiogenesis by stimulating the production of proangiogenic factors. METHODS: In total, 21 enchondromas and 58 <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcomas</b> were studied by examining the clinical and histopathological findings {{in conjunction with the}} immunostaining markers of angiogenesis and cyclooxygenase- 2 expression. RESULTS: The significant variables that were associated with poor outcome were 1) higher-grade chondrosarcomas, 2) tumors that developed in flat bones, and 3) over-expression of CD 34 (with a median count that was higher than 5. 9 vessels in 5 high power fields). Moreover, CD 34 expression (measured using the Chalkley method) revealed significantly higher microvessel density in flat bone chondrosarcomas. DISCUSSION: Previous studies have shown a positive correlation between Chalkley microvessel density and histological grade; however, in our sample, we found that the former is predictive of the outcome. Chondrosarcomas in flat bones have been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis. We also found that CD 34 microvessel density values were significantly higher in flat-bone chondrosarcomas. This could explain-at least in part-the more aggressive biological course that is taken by these tumors.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveRecent {{studies have}} shown {{abnormal}} expression of CD 44 s {{and some of its}} isoforms in many human malignancies, but {{little is known about the}} presence of CD 44 in chondrosarcoma. In this study the expression of CD 44 s and two variant isoforms was evaluated. It was assumed that abnormalities in these receptor proteins may be associated with clinical outcome of the patients. MethodThirty paraffin-embedded chondrosarcoma samples were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies for CD 44 s, CD 44 v 5 and CD 44 v 6. Two independent examiners who were unaware of the clinical status of the patients evaluated the immunohistochemical results. The percentage of CD 44 -positive cells was scored semiquantitatively. A rate of higher than 10 % was considered as overexpression. ResultsAmong the 30 patients (median age 50 years) there were 22 <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcomas,</b> two dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas, two extraskeletal chondrosarcomas, and one periostal, mesenchymal, clear cell and myxoid chondrosarcoma each. In the immunochemistry staining overexpression (> 10 % of cells) of CD 44 s was shown in 56. 7 % (17 of 30), of CD 44 v 5 in 43. 3 % (13 of 30) and of CD 44 v 6 in 6. 7 % (two of 30) of the tumors. Four grade III chondrosarcomas (80 %) and 10 (71. 4 %) grade II chondrosarcomas showed overexpression for CD 44 s, whereas CD 44 s was overexpressed in only three (27. 3 %) grade I chondrosarcomas. Cox regression suggests overexpression of CD 44 s to be an additional prognostic marker for chondroid bone tumors independent of grading and other covariates. ConclusionsOverexpression of CD 44 s correlated significantly with metastatic potential and with poorer survival in patients with chondrosarcoma. CD 44 s might be an independent additional marker, but small sample size remains to be considered...|$|R

We sought to investigate whether an IDH 1 or IDH 2 mutation signature {{could be used as a}} clinically diagnostic marker for the distinction of dedifferentiated component of chondrosarcoma from undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of bone. Sixty-eight bone tumor cases, including 31 conventional chondrosarcomas, 23 dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas, and 14 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas of bone, were collected for IDH 1 / 2 mutation analysis either using the Qiagen IDH 1 / 2 RGQ PCR Kit or using whole exome sequencing.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the identification of}} new targets for therapeutic treatment of chondrosarcoma, tumours that are highly insensitive to conventional chemo- and radiation thearapy. A relatively new array technique to identify active kinases in chondrosarcoma cell cultures was used, which identified Src inhibitor dasatinib as a potential target in chondrosarcoma treatment. Subsequently, growth {{of the majority of}} chondrosarcoma cell cultures was inhibited by dasatinib. In addition to dasatinib, CDK inhibitor Flavoperidol, Aurorakinase inhibitor AZD 1152 and AKT inhibitor Enzastaurin were identified as candidates for therapeutic intervention in chondrosarcomas. Moreover, the use of selective COX- 2 inhibition was evaluated preclinically. In vitro, chondrosarcoma cell viability was inhibited by celecoxib, a selective COX- 2 inhibitor. Also in a grade II and III chondrosarcoma xenograft mouse model an anti- tumourigenic effect of celecoxib was found, since tumor size was negatively correlated to celecoxib serum levels. The results described in this thesis have led {{to a better understanding of}} molecular events that are important in the growth of <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma.</b> In addition, new targets were identified, which are expected to lead to the implementation of new therapy modalities for patients that have inoperable or metastatic chondrosarcoma.

40|$|BackgroundChondrosarcoma is {{the second}} most common primary sarcoma of bone. High-grade <b>conventional</b> <b>{{chondrosarcoma}}</b> and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma have a poor outcome. In pre-clinical research aiming at the identification of novel treatment targets, the need for representative cell lines and model systems is high, but availability is scarce. MethodsWe developed and characterized three cell lines, derived from conventional grade III chondrosarcoma (L 835), and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (L 2975 and L 3252) of bone. Proliferation and migration were studied and we used COBRA-FISH and array-CGH for karyotyping and genotyping. Immunohistochemistry for p 16 and p 53 was performed as well as TP 53 and IDH mutation analysis. Cells were injected into nude mice to establish their tumorigenic potential. ResultsWe show that the three cell lines have distinct migrative properties, L 2975 had the highest migration rate and showed tumorigenic potential in mice. All cell lines showed chromosomal rearrangements with complex karyotypes and genotypic aberrations were conserved throughout late passaging of the cell lines. All cell lines showed loss of CDKN 2 A, while TP 53 was wild type for exons 5 – 8. L 835 has an IDH 1 R 132 C mutation, L 2975 an IDH 2 R 172 W mutation and L 3252 is IDH wild type. ConclusionsBased on the stable culturing properties of these cell lines and their genotypic profile resembling the original tumors, these cell lines should provide useful functional models to further characterize chondrosarcoma and to evaluate new treatment strategies...|$|E

40|$|Enchondromas and <b>conventional</b> central <b>chondrosarcomas</b> are, respectively, {{benign and}} {{malignant}} hyaline cartilage-forming tumours that {{originate in the}} medulla of bone. In order {{to gain a better}} understanding of the molecular process underlying malignant transformation of enchondroma, and to investigate whether there is a biological difference between con-ventional central cartilaginous tumours and those of enchondromatosis or with phalangeal localization, a series of 64 enchondromas (phalanx, n = 21; enchondromatosis, n = 15) and 89 chondrosarcomas (phalanx, n = 17; enchondromatosis, n = 13) was collected. Indian Hedgehog (IHH) /parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) signalling, an important pathway in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation within the normal growth plate, was studied by immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of PTHrP, PTHR 1, Bcl- 2, p 21, cyclin D 1, and cyclin E. Quantitative real-time PCR for IHH, PTCH, SMO, and GLI 2 was performed on a subset of tumours. The data show that IHH signalling is absent in enchondromas and central chondrosarcomas, while PTHrP signalling is active. There was no difference in the expression of any of the molecules between 35 enchondromas an...|$|R
40|$|The {{prognostic}} {{factors of}} chondrosarcoma remain uncertain {{as only a}} few large studies with long-term follow-up have been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze oncological outcomes and prognostic factors. Materials and Methods A retrospective review of oncological outcomes and prognostic factors was performed on 125 consecutive chondrosarcoma patients who underwent surgery at our institution. Results Overall survival was 91. 6 %± 2. 5 %, 84. 1 %± 3. 8 %, and 84. 1 %± 3. 8 % at 5, 10, and 15 years respectively. Among the histological types, dedifferentiated type showed the worst survival (p < 0. 001). As for <b>conventional</b> type <b>chondrosarcoma,</b> histologic grade and anatomical location predicted outcome, with high-grade with axial location having the worst outcome (p < 0. 001). In contrast, low-grade chondrosarcoma of appendicular skeleton could be treated safely by intralesional curettage. Conclusion Histological type was significantly associated with the outcome of <b>chondrosarcoma.</b> For the <b>conventional</b> type, histologic grade and anatomical location predicted outcome, with high-grade with axial location having the worst outcome.

40|$|Abstract Background Chondrosarcomas are {{malignant}} cartilage-forming tumors {{which are}} highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Estrogen signaling {{is known to}} play an important role in proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and in growth plate regulation at puberty. Our experiments focus on unraveling the role of estrogen signaling in the regulation of neoplastic cartilage growth and on interference with estrogen signaling in chondrosarcomas in vitro and in vivo. Methods We investigated the protein expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR 1), androgen receptor (AR), and aromatase in tumor specimens of various chondrosarcoma subtypes, and (primary) chondrosarcoma cultures. Dose-response curves were generated of conventional central chondrosarcoma cell lines cultured in the presence of 17 β-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, 4 -androstene- 3, 17 dione, 4 -hydroxytamoxifen, fulvestrant and aromatase inhibitors. In a pilot series, the effect of anastrozole (n = 4) or exemestane (n = 2) treatment in 6 chondrosarcoma patients with progressive disease was explored. Results We showed protein expression of ESR 1 and aromatase in a large majority of all subtypes. Only a minority of the tumors showed few AR positive cells. The dose-response assays showed no effect of any of the compounds on proliferation of <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> in vitro. The median progression-free survival of the patients treated with aromatase inhibitors did not significantly deviate from untreated patients. Conclusions The presence of ESR 1 and aromatase in chondrosarcoma tumors and primary cultures supports a possible role of estrogen signaling in chondrosarcoma proliferation. However, our in vitro and pilot in vivo studies have shown no effect of estrogen-signaling inhibition on tumor growth. </p...|$|E
40|$|Clear cell {{chondrosarcoma}} {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} chondrosarcoma that mostly involves the end of long bones. However, nine cases {{have been reported in}} the head and neck: four in larynx, two in nasal septum, two in maxilla and one in the skull. These cases form the basis of this review. Head and neck cases accounts for less than 5 % of Clear cell chondrosarcomas in the whole body and the larynx is the most common place. The histological findings of head and neck cases are consistent with general features of this entity in the whole body and nearly all tumors in this case series had a component of <b>conventional</b> <b>chondrosarcoma.</b> Clear cell chondrosarcoma is an intracompartmental tumor and retains "Grenz zone" just beneath the epithelium. Therefore, the overlying mucosa remained intact in all laryngeal cases. Nasal tumor caused ballooning of the septum and the maxillary lesion did not involve the oral mucosa. This tumor presents various radiographic features in the head and neck area. Chondroblastoma, chondroma, osteoblastoma, osteosarcoma and metastatic renal cell carcinoma are included in the histologic differential diagnoses. Differentiation from chondroblastic osteosarcoma is important in the maxilla. A wide resection is adequate in most cases. However, some laryngeal cases show tendency to recur. Clear cell chondrosarcoma is a slow growing tumor and this necessitates a long time follow-up of patients. Due to the extreme rarity in the head and neck, diagnosis of Clear cell chondrosarcoma in this area, must be confirmed by histochemical and immunohistochemical studies...|$|E

The distinction of these two tumors is important, but it is occasionally problematic because of radiological and histological overlap. We analyzed seven skull base chondrosarcoma specimens for chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 / 2 mutations and brachyury expression. We detected CNAs in six of the seven cases, including chromosomal gains of 8 q 21. 1, 19. Mutation of IDH 1 was found with a high frequency, of which R 132 S was most frequently mutated. Immunohistochemical staining for brachyury was negative in all cases. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first whole-genome study of an SBSC case series. Our findings suggest that these tumors are molecularly consistent with a subset of <b>conventional</b> central <b>chondrosarcomas</b> and different from skull base chordomas...|$|R
40|$|Chondrosarcomas are cartilage-forming, poorly vascularized tumors. They {{represent}} the second malignant primary bone tumor of adults after osteosarcoma, but {{in contrast to}} osteosarcoma they are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical excision remaining the only therapeutic option. Few cell lines and animal models are available, and the mechanisms behind their chemoresistance remain largely unknown. Our goal was to establish new cell lines and animal cancer models from human chondrosarcoma biopsies to study their chemoresistance. Between 2007 and 2012, 10 chondrosarcoma biopsies were collected and used for cell culture and transplantation into nude mice. Only one transplanted biopsy and one injected cell line has engrafted successfully leading to <b>conventional</b> central high-grade <b>chondrosarcoma</b> similar to the original biopsies. In culture, two new stable cell lines were obtained, one from a dedifferentiated and one from a grade III <b>conventional</b> central <b>chondrosarcoma</b> biopsy. Their genetic characterization revealed triploid karyotypes, mutations in IDH 1, IDH 2, and TP 53, deletion in CDKN 2 A and/or MDM 2 amplification. These cell lines expressed mesenchymal membrane markers (CD 44, 73, 90, 105) {{and were able to}} produce a hyaline cartilaginous matrix when cultured in chondrogenic three-dimensional (3 D) pellets. Using a high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR approach, we observed that cell lines cultured in monolayer had lost expression of several genes implicated in cartilage development (COL 2 A 1, COMP, ACAN) but restored their expression in 3 D cultures. Chondrosarcoma cells in monolayer were sensitive to several conventional chemotherapeutic agents but became resistant to low doses of mafosfamide or doxorubicin when cultured in 3 D pellets, in parallel with an altered nucleic accumulation of the drug. Our results indicate that the cartilaginous matrix produced by chondrosarcoma cells may impair diffusion of several drugs and thus contribute to chemoresistance. Therefore, 3 D chondrogenic cell pellets constitute a more relevant model to study chondrosarcoma chemoresistance and may be a valuable alternative to animal experimentations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas {{that arise}} in osteochondromas are {{extremely}} rare lesions for which very little information on treatment and outcome {{is available in the}} literature. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to describe the specific clinical, radiographic, and histologic features of this lesion and to evaluate the oncologic out-come after different treatment strategies. Methods: We reviewed the files of the Rizzoli Institute between 1970 and 2002 and identified eighteen patients for whom adequate records and histologic images were available and in whom a high-grade sarcoma had been diagnosed at the same location as a preexisting osteochondroma. Radiographic studies, histologic slides, and clinical records were re-viewed, the features of those studies were tabulated, and prognostic features and the results of treatment were identified. Results: The patients included twelve men and six women with an average age of forty-six years (range, twenty-two to seventy-four years). Eight lesions occurred in patients with multiple osteochondromas, and ten occurred in patients with solitary lesions. The most common locations were the pelvis (six lesions) and the femur (five lesions). Symptoms in-cluded pain, swelling, and a growing mass; the average duration of symptoms was eighteen months. Radiographically, ten lesions appeared as a <b>conventional</b> secondary <b>chondrosarcoma</b> arising in an exostosis, whereas eight showed typi-cal signs of dedifferentiation. Histologic evaluation of the cartilage component demonstrated thirteen grade- 1 and two grade- 2 chondrosarcomas. In three cases, no cartilage component was recognized. The dedifferentiated componen...|$|R
