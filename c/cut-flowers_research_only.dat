40|$|The {{idea that}} one learns to do <b>research</b> <b>only</b> by taking methodological courses is false, {{as it is}} false the idea that one learns how to do <b>research</b> <b>only</b> through investigative practice.

This study aims to share with the academic community the concept, the intention, the context, and how the Seminar on Lines of Research in the Collective Health Master's Program at the University of Antioquia, Colombia has been developed.
