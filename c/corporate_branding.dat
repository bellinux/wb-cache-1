40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the extent to which the various {{elements}} of <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> identity as identified in the literature are perceived to contribute to <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> image formation. In doing so, a theoretical perspective is adopted for this study that borrows from both marketing communication and corporate communication theories. Three data collection techniques – Q methodology, an online questionnaire and computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) – were used to determine to what extent these elements are perceived significant in <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> image formation among participants from 106 South African organisations across various business sectors. Four categories were identified to be perceived as significant for <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> image formation, namely transformational leadership and management, positioning and differentiation strategy, brand equity and employee orientation and mentorship. To date, a comprehensive measuring instrument that theoretically includes all the <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> identity elements perceived to be significant in <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> image formation has not been developed. Based on the research findings, the study aims to propose a theoretical framework for establishing a measuring instrument that includes all the <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> identity elements deemed significant in <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> image formation as perceived by South African organisations. The objective of providing a theoretical framework for establishing a measuring instrument is to enable organisations to assess the role of their <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> identity in <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> image formation among their stakeholder groups. The theoretical framework includes the four identified categories perceived as significant in <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> image formation.

40|$|The study views a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> as {{more than}} just an outward manifestation of an {{organisation}} (its name, logo and visual presentation), or as an organising proposition that helps to shape an organisation’s value and culture and guide the organisation’s processes that generate and support value creation (Bickerton, 2001 : 43). <b>Corporate</b> <b>brands</b> are adored by stakeholders and organisations alike the world over because they provide enormous value to their organisations by differentiating their organisations from competitors, bestowing added value on products and services and contributing to a firm’s margins. According to Balmer (1995 : 30) the Catholic Church and ancient universities are regarded as representing “the apotheosis of <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> management, because, the two institutions have been astute in knowing what, how and when to change whilst preserving their core identity”. The study focused on these “apotheoses” to use as benchmarks for interrogating the approaches to <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> management in South Africa. In so doing, the study examines the nature, characteristics, importance and management practices of <b>corporate</b> <b>brands</b> in the South African market by confirming the meaning of <b>corporate</b> <b>brands,</b> the meaning of <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> management and the benefits provided by the adoption of a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> strategy. The study also focused on the relationship between <b>corporate</b> <b>brands</b> and product brands; it identified stakeholder saliency and the process of <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> management. There were two reasons for undertaking this study. The first was to add to the body of empirical {{research in the area of}} <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> management, as empirical studies are few and far in between in thi s area, and the second to examine how organisations in South Africa manage their <b>corporate</b> <b>brands.</b> The study therefore involved a twostage process; the first phase was a detailed review of the literature on <b>corporate</b> <b>brands</b> to establish the current body of knowledge on <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> management. The second phase consisted of primary research, used to test the output of the literature review. A total of 41 online questionnaires dealing with the subject matter were completed by individuals responsible for the management of <b>corporate</b> <b>brands</b> in various organisations. The study’s findings cannot be generalised to the population of interest, owing to the size of the sample. Nevertheless, the findings confirmed that <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> management consists of a parallel process that requires management of a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> internally while ensuring that it is relevant and meets stakeholders’ expectations, thus creating a positive reputation. Some of the findings contradicted the existing literature, for instance: • Although more respondents confirmed that a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> must consist of a name and logo, the related mean score was relatively low (see Chapter 5 section C). • Secondly, contrary to what the literature suggests, based on the responses a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> is not seen as an explicit formal written agreement between an organisation and its key stakeholders (see Chapter 5 section B). • Furthermore, <b>corporate</b> <b>brands</b> were not seen to offer reduced advertising and marketing costs (see Chapter 5 section B). • There was also a definite response to the responsibi l i t y of a chief executive officer (CEO) in terms of managing a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand.</b> The respondents made it clear that the responsibility of managing a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> does not lie with CEO only (Chapter 5 section C).

2500|$|The channel's {{association}} with the Lambie-Nairn branding agency began in [...] 1991 following on from when Alan Yentob became controller of BBC2 in 1987. Upon taking up office, Alan realised that a review needed {{to be carried out}} of the TWO. The research carried out a start of the review found that viewers saw the TWO as [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "Old Fashioned", with it having a highbrow effect. To rectify this, Lambie Nairn was hired to create a new identity. The 1986 ident was replaced by the start of the highly successful series of idents involving a sans serif '2'. The idents themselves were very simple, such as Paint or Water and this changed people's perception of the channel, despite the fact that only the idents had changed. These new 2's had <b>corporate</b> <b>branding</b> on BBC2 for the first time, allowing cross channel continuity to be easily done. It also brought a unified feel to the channel. These new idents also changed the style of idents. Previously the ident was a single scene that would introduce all types of programmes. The fact that there were multiple idents allowed variation (at one point, there were 40), and for different idents to introduce different genres of programme. Also, special idents were created for themed nights and for special events such as Christmas. A sure sign of success for these idents is that they survived the rebrand following the new BBC corporate logo in 1997. The idents simply displayed the new logo, while more idents were added to the batch.|$|E

In this article we argue that the translation of <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> values from marketplace to marketspace is often problematic, leading to inconsistencies {{in the way that the}} brand values are interpreted.

40|$|MA (Communication Studies), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Although every {{organisation}} disposes of {{a corporate}} identity, {{it is not a}} given that the organisation will also have a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand.</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>brands</b> refer not only to the visual corporate identity elements such as the name, the logo and the corporate colours but also reflect the associations that the internal and external interest groups attach to the organisation. The staff members of the organisation are regarded as the ambassadors of an organisation’s <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> which they should live and express in their work and actions. For that reason {{it is important that the}} <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> should be well established within the organisation itself. The North-West University (NWU) was established in 2004 as the result of a merger between the former Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education and the University of the North-West. The North-West University consists of four business units, viz. the Institutional Office, the Mafikeng Campus, the Potchefstroom Campus and the Vaal Triangle Campus. Because of the diversity of the erstwhile institutions, there were several serious implications for the North-West University. One of these was the development and the subsequent suitable management model, given the distance between campuses, and the other would the design and establishment of a <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> for the institution, given the culture and background of the former institutions. The result has been the use of a hybrid model with regard to the over-arching <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> of the North-West University to the extent that each campus has developed its own separate <b>corporate</b> <b>brand.</b> Although various studies have been done in the field about <b>corporate</b> <b>brands,</b> to date no study has been undertaken about the situation at the North-West University. Against this background it was possible to formulate the following general research question. What are staff members’ perceptions of, respectively, the <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> and <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> management of the North-West University and the Potchefstroom Campus? For the purposes of this study semi-structured interviews were conducted with management of the Institutional Office and the Potchefstroom Campus directly involved in the application of the <b>corporate</b> <b>brand.</b> A quantitative electronic questionnaire was also sent to all academic, administrative and support staff members of the Potchefstroom Campus. The study indicates that the management of the Institutional Office and of the Potchefstroom Campus in some instances hold differing views about the <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> of the North-West University and the Potchefstroom Campus. In contrast to this the study indicated that the staff members of the Potchefstroom Campus gave recognition to the fact that the Potchefstroom Campus had their own <b>corporate</b> <b>brand,</b> but that it is regarded as part of the over-arching <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> of the North-West University. The study also indicated that the North-West University and the Potchefstroom Campus <b>corporate</b> <b>brands</b> consisted of different components and that the management of <b>corporate</b> <b>brand</b> depended on the leadership of senior management, but that each staff member played a role in living and establishing the different <b>corporate</b> <b>brands.</b> Master...|$|R
