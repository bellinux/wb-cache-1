50|$|Common {{multiple}} {{units of the}} pascal are the hectopascal (1 hPa = 100 Pa) which is equal to one millibar, and the kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000 Pa) which is equal to one <b>centibar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Units {{derived from}} the bar include the megabar (symbol: Mbar), kilobar (symbol: kbar), decibar (symbol: dbar), <b>centibar</b> (symbol: cbar), and {{millibar}} (symbol: mbar or mb). The notation bar(g), though deprecated by various bodies, represents gauge pressure, i.e., pressure in bars above ambient or atmospheric pressure.|$|E
50|$|In 1793 the {{commission}} defined {{the unit of}} mass as a cubic decimetre of distilled water at 0째C, and gave it the name grave. Two supplemental unit names, gravet (0.001 grave), and bar (1000 grave), were added to cover the same range as the old units, resulting in the following decimal series of units: milligravet, centigravet, decigravet, gravet, centigrave, decigrave, grave, <b>centibar,</b> decibar, bar. The mass of a unit volume of water at 0째C was accurately determined by Lavoisier and Ha체y (18841 grains per cubic provisional decimetre). A prototype of the grave was made in brass.|$|E
40|$|Data {{from four}} years of {{irrigation}} studies with carrots indicate this crop has a rather wide tolerance to varying soil moisture levels as measured by yield and quality of roots. Yields have varied between treatments from 514 to 665 crates per acre. Soil moisture levels ranging from a very wet level (18 - 20 <b>centibars</b> of tension) to a dry level (75 - 80 <b>centibars</b> of tension) have shown {{no significant differences in}} yield. Only from treatment 5, the very dry schedule, was the yield significantly lower than for all other treatments...|$|R
40|$|Data {{from five}} years of {{experimentation}} with irrigation and soil moisture levels indicate that a certain knowledge and general understanding of these factors is important in potato production. Nine treatments ranging from a constant very wet level to a constant dry treatment were used. Yield differences were significant and varied {{from a low of}} 321 cwt, from plants exposed to a very wet (18 - 20 <b>centibars</b> tension) level early in the season followed by a dry (75 - 80 <b>centibars</b> tension) condition during {{the last part of the}} growing season, to 416 cwt where the plants were kept at a dry level early and changed to a very wet level late in the season. Growers often unknowingly reduce yields and lower quality by applying excessive amounts of irrigation water...|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of soil moisture are pronounced in cabbage grown under Arizona's semiarid conditions. An {{understanding of these}} effects is a must if the most effective cabbage production is to be achieved. High, constant levels of moisture reduces solidity, increases apparent size, reduces color and general market acceptance. On the other hand, dry soil moisture conditions increases solidity and color and reduces size and generally impairs market quality because of the smallness of size and the tough and woody texture of the cabbage thus produced. Best quality cabbage commensurate with acceptable yields and greatest effectiveness is obtained where moisture is kept at 75 - 80 <b>centibars</b> of tension...|$|R
40|$|Drought {{stress is}} a main {{limiting}} factor of turfgrass growth in arid and semi-arid regions. Therefore, in this study, the physiological and biochemical changes in two turfgrass species Agrostis stolonifera and Festuca arundinacea schreb during drought stress (70 - 75 <b>centibar)</b> in a 40 -day period and recovery were investigated. Control plants during drought stress were regularly irrigated at soil field capacity (20 - 25 <b>centibar).</b> The {{results showed that}} leaf relative water content and leaf chlorophyll content with long-term stress decreased. Electrolyte leakage and proline during drought stress significantly increased and in recovery stage, the level of electrolyte leakage and proline reached to the control. The activity of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in two turfgrass significantly increased after 30 days and then significantly reduced. In F. arundinacea schreb the activity of ascorbat peroxidase after 20 days significantly increased and then significantly reduced. Also, in F. arundinacea schreb species the activity of catalase increased during drought stress and in recovery stage the activity of catalase reduced. In studied species during drought stress and recovery stage, the activity of ascorbat peroxidase and catalase significantly increased compared to the control. These results suggested that the resistant species F. arundinacea schreb, under drought stress had {{a low level of}} electrolyte leakage, higher level of relative water content and chlorophyll destruction was less than A. stolonifera...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done to {{investigate}} the effects of deficit irrigation on yield and phenological stages of soybean. The experiment was conducted as split plots based on randomized complete block design with three replications at the Agricultural Research Farm, University of Guilan in 2009. The main plots were four irrigation levels based on potential moisture levels as follows; 30 - 35 (I 1), 50 - 55 (I 2), 70 - 75 (I 3) <b>Centibar</b> soil using Tensiometer and without irrigation (I 4) and the seven soybean cultivars namely 033, 032, Sahar (maturity group IV), L. 17, Zan, Clark and Madari (maturity group III) were tested in the sub plots. Daily temperatures were calculated from maximum and minimum weather station temperatures using l 0 째C as the base temperature. Deficit irrigation significantly affected the growth and yield parameters of Plant Height, No. of Seeds per Plant, Weight of Seeds per Plant, Plant Dry Weight, Seed and Biological yield. The higher values for these parameters were achieved with I 1 {{compared with those of}} I 2, I 3 and I 4. Decreasing irrigation to I 4, increased the period from planting to podding and this delayed the appearance of pods. All the phenological stages and yield components were significantly affected in all the cultivars. Higher values for these aforementioned parameters were achieved by 033 {{with the exception of the}} reproductive period (R 1 -R 8). According to the results, it seems that deficit irrigation is capable of decreasing growth, delay in the occurrence of phenological stages and decreasing yield components, and ultimately reduced yield of soybean...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} effect of deficit irrigation on phenological stages and yield of soybean cultivars, an experiment was conducted as split plots based on randomized complete block design with three replications at Agricultural Research Farm, University of Guilan in 2009. Main factor was included four irrigation levels based on potential moisture 30 - 35 (I 1), 50 - 55 (I 2), 70 - 75 (I 3) <b>centibar</b> soil using tensiometer and without irrigation (I 4) and sub plot factor was included seven soybean cultivars 033, 032, Sahar (belong to group maturity 4), L. 17, Zan, Clark and Madari (belong to group maturity 3). To determine thermal requirement growth degree day system was used. Thermal units required by daily weather statistics for planting to flowering, planting to poding, planting to seeding, planting to maturity, seed filling period and reproductive period, were determined. At harvest time, the following data were recorded: Plant height, no. of seeds per plant, weight of seeds per plant, plant dry weight, seed and biological yields. Planting to poding period and planting to seeding period increased with reduction in water available and water deficit delayed appearance of pods. Water deficit decreased the yield components, significantly. Cultivar had {{significant effect on}} the yield components and all of phenological stages. The highest seed yield produced from 033 cultivar. In general, the results showed that water deficit is capable by delays in the occurrence of phenological stages in time and decreasing yield components, reduce yield of soybean. The lowest time for appearance of pods and the highest yield was belonged to I 1. According to results, it seems that application of irrigation based on I 1, can improve growth and yield of soybean in Rasht region...|$|E
40|$|Onions respond {{favorably to}} {{increasing}} levels of soil moisture {{as measured by}} increase in bulb size and total yields. Maintaining a soil moisture level of 18 - 20 <b>centibars</b> of tension (nearly field-holding capacity) produces the greatest yields of bulbs. However, dry onions so produced are somewhat softer in texture, tended toward thick -neck growth, matured slower, and {{are more difficult to}} cure adequately in the normal length of time. Onions grown on lesser amounts of water tend to have the reverse characteristics. Costs of production are similarly increased under high soil moisture levels because of the need for replacing nitrogen leached out of the root zone. Also, the costs of the water and its application must be increased. Therefore, the economics involved would be a required consideration...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} irrigating by {{gravitation}} on yields of bean var. ICA-Palmar, applied during different growth stages,was studied. A randomized block design was used with 7 replications and 7 treatments {{in an area}} of 1. 5 ha with furrows at 0. 60 m (240, 000 plants/ha). The system of irrigating by gravitation using gated pipes was utilized. Agronomic practices were done for pest and disease control. Rainfall during the crop cycle modified the treatment. Treatments II, V, and VI used a water depth of 262, 275, and 287 mm and yielded 1874, 1872, and 1831 kg/ha, resp. Treatments I and III used 239 and 231 mm and produced 1652 and 1520 kg/ha, resp. The control only yielded 689 kg/ha and received only 175 mm with irrigation at germination and rainfall during the crop cycle. It was concluded that: (1) Five waterings supplying an usable water depth of 270 mm (an applied water depth of approx. 350 mm) gave the highest bean yield. (2) Irrigation at germination up to a depth of 30 cm allows the crop to develop until 20 days after planting. (3) During flowering (28 - 30 days) and fructification (48 - 50 days) soil moisture tension should not be higher than 35 <b>centibars.</b> (CIAT...|$|R
