40|$|Due to {{the impact}} of the optical {{characteristics}} of the materials composing the urban envelopes on the energy balance of cities, their categorization according to their ability to decrease urban temperatures is an indispensable tool for sustainable development. This work presents the evaluation results of the thermal performance of the different pedestrian pavements available in the region, so as to classify them according to the Solar Reflectance Index (SRI). The study was carried out during a 2 -year period, involving the analysis of the behaviour of 28 pavements in widely used compositions, shapes and colours. Additionally, the aging effect of the material was quantified over the SRI. The results show that 74 % of pavements diminished their initial ability for decreasing temperatures, while 50 % of the dark material, with initial negative performances, improved their thermal behavior.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence of cyberbullying among study participants and examine the psychological impact on both cyber victims and cyber attackers, also analyzing gender differences in the impact. The sample consisted of 639 students from the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Bucaramanga branch, with an average age of 17. 66 years (N = 303 boys, girls N = 334). For developing this analysis, the following instruments were used: (a) Scale cyber aggressions; (B) Scale cyber victimization; and (c) Symptom Assessment Questionnaire- 45 (SA- 45). The results show that 27. 5 % of the sample has been attacked on occasion, and that the stalker was 26. 7 % over the past year. On the other hand, the results showed that there is a psychological impact (SA 45 scales) in both cyber victims and cyber aggressors. Gender differences in cyberbullying were evident only at some scales (primarily depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity and somatization), although they were not significant among the psychological symptoms reported in this study (except for scales related to Somatization and Phobic Anxiety).  © Revista Colombiana de <b>Ciencias</b> <b>Sociale...</b>|$|R

40|$|The current {{perception}} of a dehumanized medical attention and its low quality has questioned the empathic capacity and ethics of the health professionals. The {{research in this field}} reports variations in this attributes along the doctors’ education. Objective: to explore the global levels of empathy and professional ethics, as well as the levels of each component of both attributes in a sample of applicants to a medical graduate program.

As part of the application process, they answered the Cognitive and Affective Empathy Test and the Professional Ethical Attitudes Scale. Results: The average scores of the sample got Average in empathy and Optimal in professional ethics. The comparison by gender, specialty and competences showed less affective and better ethical competence in women, more cognitive empathy in surgical specialties, and in general an absence of correlation between the two variables and specifically by competence. Conclusions: The importance of measuring the specific competences of each attribute is highlighted given that the variation in specific competences impact in different aspects the doctor’s education, as the specialty choice, the student selection, the development of academic programs and the adequate learning about the construction of an effective relation doctor-patient.  © Revista Colombiana de <b>Ciencias</b> <b>Sociale...</b>|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{cognitive}} abilities involved in interpersonal problemsolving and their connection with speech acts in children from contexts of social vulnerability. The sample included 120 schoolchildren between the ages of 8 - 13 in Mendoza, Argentina. The results showed that the children from more vulnerable family backgrounds, presented significantly less expressive speech acts than children at low vulnerability. It was also observed that displayed significantly poorer identification of emotions and anticipated significantly more negative consequences. In contrast, children who had high level of protective factors identified significantly more emotions, tended to generate more alternatives and anticipated less negative consequences. These results highlight the importance of carrying out early evaluations in contexts of risk, taking a preventive approach, and articulating knowledge from the fields of psychology and linguistics in order to develop new kinds of intervention and support strategies destined to children in school contexts.
