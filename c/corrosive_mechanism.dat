Two tests were conducted at room temperature using an acidic 30 % Chloride solution in passive tests procedure and 3 % NaCl solution in electrochemical process. From the experimental works, it appeared that AE signals could be detected during corrosion. Data were studied in time and frequency domain to characterize {{and to find out}} the relation between AE parameter and corrosion. In addition the source of generated acoustic signals and <b>corrosive</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the different corrosive environment condition were discussed. Introduction and AE source in corrosion monitoring AE is the stress waves produced by the sudden internal stress redistribution of the materials caused by the changes in the internal structure.

40|$|It was {{reported}} that cadmium metal reacted with sulphate solutions of its ions. An early investigator claimed that the reaction between the metal and its ions was reversible disproportionation. The equation Cd ⁺⁺ Cd⁰ = 2 Cd⁺ was proposed. The reaction was investigated mainly in sulphate solutions, although chloride solutions were also used. The effect of conditions, such as temperature, concentration, metallic surfaces, surface area, atmosphere and motion of the solution, was examined. During the investigation, etching, cracks, pits, tree growth, dendrites, and the deposition of cadmium around gas bubbles were observed. The results and the observed phenomena were considered {{in the light of}} known disproportionation and <b>corrosive</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> From these considerations, it appeared that corrosion explained the observations.

The study {{is carried out}} using different combinations of four coating process parameters, namely, concentration of nickel source (A), concentration reducing agent (B), bath temperature (C) and annealing temperature (D). The wear tests are conducted with a pin-on-disk Wear & Friction Monitor. The optimum combination of process parameters for minimum depth of wear is obtained.

40|$|Figure 6 shows a {{scanning}} {{electron micrograph}} {{of a piece}} of 316 L SS (from the gas phase in urea synthesis) most of which is completely transformed into corro-sion product. Only the lower left-hand corner is still metal. The corroded assembly is shown in Fig. 7. It was removed from a location close to that of the mate-rial shown in Fig. 1 - 5 and consists essentially of a tube, a ring, and a plate, only some of the ring still being in the form of metal. In Fig. 8 one sees backscatter shots for the principal elements involved of the same area as Fig. 6. Quite obviously Fe and Mo have hardly been moved by the corrosion process, Cr has been considerably reduced, and Ni has virtual ly disappeared. In another case, during testing in the gas phase of urea synthesis, a specimen of 330 SS showed severe intergranular attack (Fig. 9). Electron-microprobe traces (Fig. 10) for Ni, Cr, and C show no variation in Cr content, high Ni, and low C. Cr depletion, although obviously a cause, is apparently not the only cause for grain-boundary attack in austenitic SS. Ni enrichment, in the appropriate environment, can do the same thing.

The effect of weight percentage of SiC on friction and wear properties of Al-SiC MMC is investigated. Tribological tests are conducted under acid environment in a pin-on-disk tribotester by varying the design parameters (applied normal load and sliding speed) while {{the duration of}} each experiment is kept constant for 30 minutes.

The addition of SiC reinforcement increases the wear resistance of the metal matrix composite.

Erosion-corrosion testing was conducted using a submerged jet of 3. 5 % NaCl aqueous solution with spherical silica sand particles. The sand concentration was 2. 4 g/l, the velocity of the jet was 18 m/s and the testing temperature range was 16 °C- 27 °C. Both normal incidence (90 °) and low angle (20 °) tests were performed.

40|$|Key Words: Corrosive wear; liquid zinc;;H 13;;Co-based alloy; Fe-based alloy Abstract: In {{continuous}} hot dip galvanizing, serving parts {{working in}} the molten zinc, such as sink roll, sleeves, etc. tend towards degradation and failure due to corrosion and wear. In this paper, corrosive wear performance of several materials, such as boronized，H 13 ，Co-based alloy and Fe-based alloy coupled with Si 3 N 4 is evaluated {{with the aid of}} a self-made test machine of block-column sliding wear. Moreover, the <b>corrosive</b> wear <b>mechanism</b> is analyzed. It has been found that these materials suffered not only considerable wear, but also the corrosion of molten zinc. For boronized layer, the wear is the main reason to cause the failure of work parts under the act of the corrosive wear. For H 13, the interaction between corrosion and wear plays a very important role on its failure. For those alloys with bad corrosion resistance such as Co-based alloy and Fe-based alloy, both corrosion of solid solution and wear of intermetallic compound act on their failure at the same time. However, the rate of wear shows no obvious relation to the hardness although wear performance is important. The failure greatly lies on the ratio of the hardness of corrosion products to matrix...|$|R
40|$|In {{underground}} coal mines, rockbolts {{and cable}} bolts are two dominant {{forms of support}} elements to prevent instability of the surrounding rock mass. Using these steel anchoring elements with high strength and toughness provides better rock reinforcement in high stress environment, however failures identified of being caused by Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) have been observed. SCC is a substantial problem {{in a number of}} underground mines in Australia. It is difficult to detect and can result in catastrophic consequences without warning. Understanding and predicting this failure phenomenon plays a very important role in keeping the underground support system in good performance. This paper outlines the major developments of a study on SCC failure of the steel anchoring elements based on laboratory tests. SCC detecting technologies are discussed and, advantages and shortcomings related to each technology are provided. A SCC-Acoustic Emission (AE) testing system was set up in the Controlled Mine Environment (CME) laboratory at UNSW Australia that is aimed to provide a better understanding of this failure mode as well as to determine whether there is any relationship between AE signal activities and <b>corrosive</b> damage <b>mechanisms.</b> The test results showed the laboratory samples failed in a brittle manner and the cracking propagated in the transgranular mode.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to explore the possibility of enhancing the tribological properties of the ferritic-austenitic cast steel which is widely used in combustion gas desulphurization systems in the power industry. The subject of the research is the GX 2 CrNiMoN 25 - 6 - 3 cast steel, a material for making pump rotors and other parts intended for operation at a temperature of up to 70 °C in a water suspension containing Cl- and SO 4 - 2 ions and sand / gypsum particles. It seems that in some applications, at low dynamics of parts’ operation and a predominance of erosive phenomena over corrosive ones, {{there is a potential}} for using the σ phase as a structural constitu-ent that enhances the tribological properties. However, due to the increased brittleness of the material, a need arises for optimizing the quantity of this phase and carrying out detailed research into the morphology of precipitates. To describe the tribological properties, the testing of the erosive and <b>corrosive</b> wear <b>mechanism</b> was used, which was carried out on a test stand of the authors' own construction. Metallographic and stereological examinations and hardness tests were performed, which enabled the understanding of the successive stages of tribological wear of the cast steel under investigation.

40|$|Nowadays, {{problems}} of component materials reliability in gas and oil-fired gas turbines focus on assessing the potential behaviour of commonly employed coatings, {{in order to}} avoid expensive and unpredictable failure in service and producing new materials whose performance meets life time and manufacturing/ repairing requirements. This MPhil project has investigated the oxidative and <b>corrosive</b> degradation <b>mechanisms</b> for some of the alloy/coatings systems (CMSX- 4, CMSX- 4 / RT 22, CMSX- 4 / CN 91 and CMSX- 4 / “LCO 22 ”), which are currently used for turbines blades and vanes, in order to achieve a better knowledge of materials behaviour and to improve models for the prediction of turbine components’ lives. To achieve this target the study has made use of realistic simulations of turbine exposure conditions in combined with pre- and post-exposure metrology of bar shape materials samples, while optical microscopy has been applied to describe the microstructural evolution during the exposure and the products of the degradation for the hot corrosion. For high temperature oxidation, over extended periods of time (up to 10, 000 hours), the research has allowed to describe the morphological changes in respect of the exposure time and temperature and to determine the oxidation kinetics experienced by the alloy and coatings. A model has been presented for predicting θ- α-Al 2 O 3 growth. Moreover, using NASA COSP spalling model, with rate constants values coming from this study, a comparison between experimental mass change data and prediction has been shown.

40|$|AbstractNiCrAlY {{coatings}} {{are widely}} used in gas turbines for the protection against the high temperature oxidation and corrosion. Micro and Nanocrystalline NiCrAlY coatings on Superalloy were fabricated by Sputtering and High Velocity Oxide Fuel Spray (HVOF), respectively, in the present work. The coatings were subjected to high temperature cyclic oxidation at 900 °C in presence of air to investigate its oxidation kinetics. The weight change of the microcrystalline (mc) and nanocrystalline (nc) coatings was monitored after each cycle to establish its degradation rate in the corrosive environment. The parabolic rate constant was evaluated using the weight change data obtained for both mc and nc coatings by least square fitting method. It was observed that the nanocrystalline coatings showed lower value of parabolic rate constant as {{compared to that of}} its bulk coatings. The protective oxide scales were identified by the characterisation techniques such as XRD, FESEM, EDS and X-ray Mapping. The nanocrystalline NiCrAlY coatings exhibit superior high temperature corrosion resistance in air due to the formation of adherent, non-porous, and uniform protective scales such as NiCr 2 O 4, Cr 2 O 3 etc when compared to mc coatings. On the other hand, the protective scales formed over the mc coatings are non-uniform, discontinuous which provides relatively less protection in the <b>corrosive</b> environment. The <b>mechanisms</b> of nanosize effect on the rapid formation of protective scale, through high diffusivity of alloying elements, in nc coatings are proposed...|$|R
40|$|N/AIn this work, {{precipitation}} hardening (PH) stainless steel was plasma nitrided at low temperatures 400 oC and 425 oC for 15 h. The wear and corrosion-wear behaviour of the untreated and nitrided specimens were investigated under both dry sliding and wet sliding (in 3 % NaCl solution) conditions, using both one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) reciprocating motions. The 2 D motion was realised by reciprocating the sample stage {{as the primary}} motion {{and at the same}} time reciprocating the ball (pin) holder at a high frequency and small amplitude as the secondary motion. The results show that 2 D sliding has significant effects on the wear behaviour of the test specimens. Under dry condition, 2 D sliding leads to a significant increase in wear volume by 70 % to 230 %. Nitriding is very effective in increasing dry sliding wear resistance of the steel under both 1 D and 2 D conditions, with 400 oC nitriding being the most effective. Under corrosion-wear (tribocorrosion) condition in 3 % NaCl solution, 2 D sliding leads to a more significant drop in open circuit potential (OCP) and a more significant increase in anodic current than 1 D sliding. While under 1 D sliding condition, nitriding is effective in reducing material removal by tribocorrosion, under 2 D sliding condition, the effectiveness of nitriding is dependent on nitriding temperature. Nitriding at 425 oC results in accelerated material removal during 2 D sliding in the <b>corrosive</b> solution. The <b>mechanisms</b> of material removal are discussed in terms of the structures of the nitride layers and their electrochemical response to the corrosive solution...|$|R
