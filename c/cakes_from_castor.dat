30|$|The {{tendency}} to replace formaldehyde-based adhesives {{due to its}} harmful effects in both environment and human health, led the efforts in ecofriendly adhesives research. As PVA, the polyurethane derived <b>from</b> <b>castor</b> oil showed satisfactory results on fiber composites [17] and plywood manufactory [3]. Researches between MDF and polyurethane derived <b>from</b> <b>castor</b> oil interaction are scant, generating a need to study its properties. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the mechanical resistance of glued joint with polyurethane derived <b>from</b> <b>castor</b> oil in MDF panels.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the optimization of {{a method of}} simultaneous determination of glycerides, free and total glycerol in biodiesel ethyl esters <b>from</b> <b>castor</b> oil by using gas chromatography. Changes were proposed for the methods ASTM D 6584 and EN 14105 {{in order to determine}} these by-product contaminants in biodiesel <b>from</b> <b>castor</b> oil. The silylation reaction for this biodiesel was optimized, and 250 μL MSTFA was used. Its accuracy values were between 70 % and 120 % with RSD < 11 %. The identification of monoricinolein and diricinolein was made by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC–MS). The matrix effect (ME) was investigated and considered low for glycerol, mono- and diolein; it was medium for triolein. The method was robust even when there were variations in the matrix. It was also successfully used for the determination of glycerides, free and total glycerol in samples of biodiesel <b>from</b> <b>castor</b> oil...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} a day-long ASCA {{broadband}} (1 - 10 keV) spectro-imaging observation of the X-ray emission <b>from</b> the <b>Castor</b> multibinary system. Significant flares were detected from both the flare star system YY Gem (<b>Castor</b> C) and <b>from</b> <b>Castor</b> AB located 73 sec away. Using an optimal viewing geometry and image restoration techniques, {{we are able to}} spatially resolve the emission from the two X-ray components. Broadband flare activity <b>from</b> <b>Castor</b> AB is confirmed, and quiescent flux is detected. The quiescent spectrum of YY Gem is a complex blend of emission lines across the ASCA bandpass which requires multitemperature components or two-temperature variable metal-poor abundances (approximately 5 - 10 below solar) to obtain a satisfactory fit to both the Mewe-Kaastra and Raymond-Smith models. The flare spectrum is consistent with an increase in the emissivity of the hotter component...|$|R

The {{research was}} conducted using complete randomized design (CRD) consisting of one simple factor: the proportion of <b>cake</b> <b>from</b> BAS. The study was conducted by using 36 Sprague Dawley rats. The mice adapted for 6 days. On 6 th day conducted lipid profile analysis and grouping of the mice, so that each group had an average triglyceride level of the same. Rats were divided into 6 groups, each group consisting of 6 tails. Starting on 7 th day rats were fed according to the treatment, which consists of 6 levels, which AIN 93 standard feed, the feed of the <b>cake</b> <b>from</b> BAS: 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %.
