We assume that the underlying process is a random system with <b>complete</b> <b>connections</b> (which contains the Markovian case as a special one) satisfying some basic properties, and that a mapping operates on the event space. With these two elements we construct in Section 2 a new random system with <b>complete</b> <b>connections</b> which inherits the properties of the old one (Theorem 2. 2. 3). In Section 3 we prove a weak convergence theorem (Theorem 3. 4. 4) in the theoretical framework of the so-called distance diminishing models, which gives a straightforward application in Section 4 to conditional probabilities related to partially observed events (Theorems 4. 1. 3).

5000|$|Solitude {{does not}} {{necessarily}} entail feelings of loneliness, and in fact may, for those who choose it with deliberate intent, be one's sole source of genuine pleasure. For example, in religious contexts, some saints preferred silence and found immense pleasure in their perceived uniformity with God. Solitude is a state that can be positively modified utilizing it for prayer allowing to [...] "be alone with ourselves and with God, to put ourselves in listening to his will, but also of what moves in our hearts, let purify our relationships; solitude and silence thus become spaces inhabited by God, and ability to recover ourselves and grow in humanity. [...] " [...] The Catholic devotion of the Holy Rosary includes the most beautiful prayers to meditate in solitude the mysteries of Jesus and Virgin Mary's life, feeling in Their company; it’s a devotion to which is associated the divine grace and that causes an effective change of the emotional and spiritual state. The Buddha attained enlightenment through uses of meditation, deprived of sensory input, bodily necessities, and external desires, including social interaction. The context of solitude is attainment of pleasure from within, {{but this does not}} necessitate complete detachment from the external world. This is well demonstrated in the writings of Edward Abbey with particular regard to Desert Solitaire where solitude focused only on isolation from other people allows for a more <b>complete</b> <b>connection</b> to the external world, as in the absence of human interaction the natural world itself takes {{on the role of the}} companion.

30|$|Alona kaingang sp. nov. is {{a member}} of the pulchella-group because its posteroventral corner of the {{carapace}} is armed with many short and thin spinules not arranged in groups, three main head pores, marginal denticles of postabdomen merged and developed, lateral fascicles developed, IDL with three setae, seven setae on the exopodite of limb III, fourth setae of limb III well-developed, gnathobase of limb V reduced, and limb VI absent. Alona kaingang sp. nov. also has the fourth seta on the exopodite of limb III geniculated, like many species of the pulchella-group (except in Alona archeri). As an alternative to identification, the pulchella-group may be separated into two groups based on the morphology of the main head pores: one group contains species with interrupted connection (including those species with main head pore isolated) and the other contains species with <b>complete</b> <b>connection.</b> Thus, A. kaingang sp. nov., having a <b>complete</b> <b>connection</b> between the main head pores, could be differentiated from species belonging to do the first group: Alona capensis (Rüher, 1914), Alona setulosa (Megard, 1967), Alona cambouei (Guerne & Richard, 1893), Alona aguascalientensis Sinev & Silva-Briano, 2013, Alona nigra Smirnov, 1996, Alona setuloides Smirnov & Timms, 1983, Alona azorica Frenzel & Alonso 1989, Alona anastasia Sinev Alonso, Miracle & Suhaquillo, 2012, and Alona nuragica Margaritora, 1971. Regarding species with <b>complete</b> <b>connection</b> between main head pores, A. kaingang sp. nov. is distinguished by the presence of spinules on apical setae of antenna and proximal spines on IDL setae.
