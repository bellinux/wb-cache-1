50|$|On June 14, 1761, Heredia {{was sent}} to Guatemala to become its Captain General. He soon {{requested}} the Spanish crown to create a viceroyalty of Guatemala, pointing to the region's development of large cattle ranches and sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>fruit</b> and cocoa plantations, {{as well as the}} higher development of its cities, but the request was rejected. The same year, he was also appointed governor of Nicaragua (although according to some sources, he was actually governor of Nicaragua between 1746-1753) and acting governor of Honduras. His government in Honduras implemented a series of changes such as the reorganization of the tax code and an extension of state jurisdiction in social sectors. These initiatives met great success due to the goodwill he had cultivated with the provincial bureaucracy in his previous positions. Heredia was also able to improve relations with local government, including more efficient processing of applications by the people of Tegucigalpa. On March 12, 1768, he left the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Heredia also was recognized by the construction of Tegucigalpa in the construction of Omoa, where many people died due to the harsh climate of the region and his difficulty in adapting to it.|$|E
40|$|Cellulose fibers are {{promoted}} for use {{in various}} textile applications due their sustainable nature. Cellulose-based fibers vary considerably in their mechanical and flammability properties depending on their chemical composition. The chemical composition of a cellulose-based fiber is further dependent on their source (i. e., seed, leaf, <b>cane,</b> <b>fruit,</b> wood, bast, and grass). Being organic in nature, cellulose fibers, and their products thereof, pose considerable fire risk. In this work we have compared the flammability properties of cellulose fibers obtained from two different sources (i. e., cotton and peat). Compared to cotton cellulose textiles, peat-based cellulose textiles burn longer with a prominent afterglow which {{can be attributed to}} the presence of lignin in its structure. A series of phosphoramidates were synthesized and applied on both cellulose textiles. From thermogravimetric and pyrolysis combustion flow analysis of the treated cellulose, we were able to relate the flame retardant efficacy of the synthesized phosphorus compounds to their chemical structure. The phosphoramidates with methyl phosphoester groups exhibited higher condensed phase flame retardant effects on both types of cellulose textiles investigated in this study. In addition, the bis-phosphoramidates exhibited higher flame retardant efficacy compared to the mono-phosphoramidates...|$|E

The most destructive are from the Deroceras, Arion and Malix groups. Very few crops are unaffected as slugs are polyphagus and feed throughout the year whenever conditions are cool/warm and damp. With FYM & green manures, soil organic matter levels are increased which favours slugs.

Conversely, five fields with relatively low density A. citrana populations averaged 66 % apparent parasitism. This suggests that parasitoids may be important in maintaining orange tortrix populations at low levels. Three braconid Redacted for Privac...|$|R
