5|$|As the Mysterons {{start to}} fire on Cloudbase, Dr Fawn is killed. Posing as his assistant, Mysteron {{intermediary}} Captain Black reports that Scarlet is dead with {{no possibility of}} recovery, his retro-metabolic ability being too weak to heal such extensive injuries. The Mysteron assault intensifies, resulting {{in the deaths of}} Magenta and the remaining Angels, until only White, Blue and Lieutenant Green are left alive in the Control Room. As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself. White resolves to go down with his command, and is seen standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling freeze frame shot, accompanied by the sounds of Cloudbase <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> Earth.|$|E
5|$|With 10seconds {{left to go}} {{in round}} two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, {{throwing}} another right hand that landed on his chin and sent Judah <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the canvas. Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady, but was still dazed by the punch and fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the fight over, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event of Lion Fight 7 in Las Vegas on October 13, 2012, he met Eddie Walker in an 82kg/180lb bout. Schilling {{attacked}} Walker's lead leg from the start and scored knockdowns with elbows in rounds one and two. As Schilling got more aggressive {{towards the end of}} round two and began to look for the finish, Walker let his hands go and connected with a short right cross which sent Schilling <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the canvas in a state of unconsciousness.|$|E

When the sixth round began, Mosley landed a huge left hook that sent Vargas <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the canvas. Vargas rolled over onto all fours and was unsteady, but after stumbling twice he finally beat referee Kenny Bayless' count. Moments later, Mosley unleashed another flurry as Vargas could only protect his face, and the referee stopped the fight at 2:38 as a beaten and disoriented Vargas staggered back to his corner.|$|E

The fight started tense and cagey, with little to no action for the {{majority}} of round one until Filho, making his debut under kickboxing rules, landed the decisive strike, a perfectly timed counter right hook, which sent Hug <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the canvas in a state of unconsciousness at the 2:37 mark.|$|E

Their new ball bowlers Syed Rasel and Shahadat Hossain took two wickets each as Sri Lanka's top order struggled. It was Sri Lanka who had chosen to bat, but the Bangladeshis got some movement with the ball early on, and after Marvan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya had added 28 for the first wicket, Shahadat struck in the sixth over.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{entering}} the Veridian system, Enterprise makes {{contact with the}} Duras Bird of Prey. Picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran's location first. La Forge is returned to Enterprise, but he inadvertently reveals Enterprises shield frequency, allowing the Duras sisters to inflict crippling damage on Enterprise. Enterprise destroys the Bird of Prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. Commander William Riker orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship which separates from the star drive. The shock wave from the star drive's destruction sends the saucer <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the surface of Veridian III.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{came very}} close to failure—a postflight {{examination}} of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.|$|E

A piece of the concrete façade came loose and fell onto the sidewalk on busy Pennsylvania Avenue NW. A contractor was hired to remove loose concrete from the exterior. Construction netting was hung around the upper floors to prevent additional pieces of concrete from <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the ground. The {{total cost of the}} concrete removal and safety netting installation was $5.9 million. In 2007, an architectural design and planning consultant reported that the cost of these renovations and the disruption to FBI work and staff were not justifiable.

25|$|The {{match against}} Sri Lanka on 23 March 2007 {{turned out to}} be a one-sided contest. Chasing 255, the Indian batting crumbled against the Sri Lankan bowling attack with off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and pace bowler Chaminda Vaas taking 2/39 and 3/41 respectively, <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> 185 all out in the 44th over. Only Dravid (60 from 82 balls, 6 fours) and Sehwag (48 from 46 balls, 5 fours and 1 six) made any {{significant}} contribution for India. With one victory and two losses, India's hopes of entering the Super Eight stage were now grim and depended on a Bermuda victory over Bangladesh by a heavy margin in the last Group B match. But with Bangladesh beating Bermuda, India crashed out of the World Cup in the first round, the first time since 1992.|$|E
25|$|Harare-born all-rounder Ryan Watson put in {{the best}} all-round effort for Scotland all season, {{recording}} Scotland's fourth-highest score {{of the season with}} 86 and the best bowling analysis with four for 36, but none of the other players save Paul Hoffmann (conceding 21 runs in nine overs) made any significant contribution, and Durham Dynamos ran away with a 93-run victory. Batting first, Durham made 227 for 7, Gordon Muchall top-scoring with 79 and Gareth Breese upping the scoring-rate with two sixes in an unbeaten 47 off 39 balls near the end. The Scots then lost wickets left, right and centre, <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> 54 for 6 before Watson and Craig Wright added 77 for the seventh wicket. The run out of Wright precipitated the final collapse, though, as the last four wickets fell for three runs and Scotland were all out for 134.|$|E

25|$|Bardwell Mill {{was built}} in 1823. It worked by wind until 1925 and then by a Blackstone oil engine until 1941. The mill was {{derelict}} in 1978 but was later purchased by James Waterfield, who completed {{the restoration of the}} mill in 1985. The mill was sold to Geoffrey and Enid Wheeler in July 1987. On 16 October 1987, the mill was tailwinded when one of the gears in the fantail drive system became disengaged. The result was that the windshaft sheared {{at the rear of the}} canister, bringing the sails <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the ground. Restoration work began again in 1989 but was hampered by limited funds. Geoffrey Wheeler died in 1995 and in 1997 The Friends of Bardwell Windmill was set up. English Heritage and St Edmundsbury Borough Council gave over £73,000 towards the estimated cost of £92,000 to restore the mill. The balance was to be raised by the Friends. A replacement cap, cast iron windshaft and fantail were fitted to the mill in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Sylvester Joseph led the West Indian side in Shivnarine Chanderpaul's absence {{owing to}} illness. Openers Xavier Marshall and Runako Morton {{attacked}} from the outset, plundering 37 {{runs from the}} first six overs, when Irfan Pathan got Marshall out with an inswinger and bowled a wicket-maiden over. Pathan, Ashish Nehra and Anil Kumble continued to dig out wickets, but Morton remained at the crease. The West Indies <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> 112/6 after 24 overs. Kumble did get Banks and Dwayne Smith out lbw, the latter for a 12-ball cameo that yielded 26 runs. However, Morton stuck in, making 84, before losing his wicket to Nehra, getting caught by Dravid. West Indies needed 68 runs from 11 overs, with three wickets in hand. Denesh Ramdin, the wicket-keeper, gave it a go. He hacked at everything, missing occasionally, but also getting quite a few boundaries. His team needed twelve runs off the last over, and Nehra conceded only 4, helping his team win by seven runs.|$|E
25|$|In early August, the {{lightweight}} Breidis Prescott {{was chosen by}} Rubio as Khan's next opponent. Rubio had trained a fighter who had narrowly lost to Prescott before and thought that Khan {{would be able to}} handle the bigger Prescott, who had a prolific knock-out record of 17 KOs in 19 contests. On 6 September 2008, Khan was a huge favourite and was hoping to win a world title {{by the end of the}} year. Prescott came out fast in the fight and landed some good shots; a stiff jab jerked Khan's head back and foreshadowed what was to come. Prescott landed a left hook that jabbed Khan's temple; dizzying his senses. Instead of holding, Khan tried to punch back, but instead was punched on the head by a left hook, right hook combo, sending him <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the canvas. He managed to get to his feet. Prescott ended it for good with another left that put Khan down again. This time, he was unable to get up. It was officially over in 55 seconds.The fight was at the Manchester Evening News Arena on Khan's Sky Box Office debut.|$|E
50|$|A <b>crash</b> <b>to</b> desktop is a {{computer}} program crash which is said to occur when a program (commonly a video game) unexpectedly quits, abruptly taking the user back to the desktop.

Many times there is no apparent action that causes a <b>crash</b> <b>to</b> desktop. During normal function, the program may freeze for a shorter period of time, and then close by itself. Also during normal function, the program may become a black screen and play the last few seconds of sound (depending on the size of the data buffer) that was being played repeatedly before it <b>crashes</b> <b>to</b> desktop.

25|$|As {{the crews}} cut their ships {{free of the}} {{wreckage}} Minerve and Dido scraped alongside one another, their cannon opening fire once more at point blank range. The greater height of the French ship conferred an unexpected advantage as its higher spars ripped Didos topsails off her masts, allowing Minerve {{to pull away from}} the British ship. At this stage Lowestoffe, which had been hitherto prevented from joining the combat by the position of Dido, now arrived off Minerves bow and opened fire from close range. In less than eight minutes this raking fire had brought the foremast and the main and mizen topmasts <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the deck, rendering Minerve unable to manoeuvre. As this combat developed, Artémise had passed by at some distance, opening an ineffectual fire. Seeing that Minerve was badly damaged, Captain Charbonnier turned his ship and retreated northwards. Seeing the French ship withdraw, Towry ordered Middleton to pursue, Lowestoffe breaking off action with Minerve at 09:15 and chasing Artémise, which opened fire with its stern-chasers, damaging Lowestoffes mizenmast. Middleton replied with his own bow-chasers, but they had little effect and the faster Artémise soon pulled away from Lowestoffe. At 10:30 the chase was abandoned and Middleton returned to the isolated and battered Minerve.|$|E
25|$|India made up {{for their}} early losses with a very convincing win over Kenya at Bristol by 94 runs four days later. India scored a massive 329/2 through centuries from Tendulkar (140 not out from 101 balls, 16 fours, 3 sixes), who had rejoined the team, and Dravid (104 not out from 109 balls, 10 fours). The pair scored 237 in 29 overs at a run rate of 8.17 before medium pacer Debashish Mohanty wiped up the Kenyan batsmen with a 4-wicket haul (4/56). Tendulkar, {{declared}} Man of the Match, later dedicated his ton to his late father. India followed this victory with a record win against Sri Lanka at Taunton by 157 runs. Ganguly (183 from 158 balls, 17 fours, 7 sixes) and Dravid (145 from 129 balls, 17 fours, 1 six) picked up two centuries at over a run a ball to get India to a mammoth total of 373/6, sharing a partnership of 318 runs in 44.9 overs. Sri Lanka were then rattled due to Robin Singh's 5/31, <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> 216 all out. India {{then went on to}} seal a place in the Super Six stage with a win against hosts England at Edgbaston in Birmingham by 63 runs; in a match extended by a day due to rain, once again Ganguly (40 from 59 balls, 6 fours) and Dravid (53 from 82 balls, 6 fours) starred with the bat to score 238/2, while a strong team effort with the ball, led by Ganguly's 3/27, got England all out for just 169.|$|E
25|$|Australia's second innings began weakly, with Langer edging Agarkar to Patel {{before he}} even opened his account. Australia were then at 6/1. A window of {{opportunity}} opened up for the Indians. However, their hopes were soon evaporated by Matthew Hayden's crescendo of explosive and dynamic strokeplay. He hit the ball savagely, transferring his weight to the back foot often, and displayed clean and strong hits which sent the ball <b>crashing</b> <b>to</b> the fence. His powerful strokeplay ended in him stroking 99 from 98 balls. He reached 99 with a huge six off Ashish Nehra. The Queensland fans and the hayden family cheered and backed Hayden up to the hilt screaming out cheers to him, but he missed out the century when he top-edged a sweep to Sehwag at midwicket off Harbhajan. Hayden's knock was remarkable for the utter disdain he treated the Indian bowlers with. He was impervious {{to the efforts of}} the Indian bowlers, which was shown {{by the fact that he}} managed to treat even the good balls contemptuously. Of the 98 balls he faced for his 99, 51 balls were good length deliveries, which were dispatched for 52 runs. When the Indian bowlers pitched the ball slightly short, he was less destructive, hitting 12 runs off 30 such deliveries. In 17 other deliveries of which 8 were half-volleys and 9 were short balls Hayden hit 19 runs and 16 runs respectively, for a total of 35 runs from the other deliveries. He dominated almost every Indian bowler he faced, except Ajit Agarkar by scoring runs at more than a run-a-ball rate.|$|E
