5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal <b>Cognition,</b> published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal <b>Cognition,</b> will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E

40|$|Both PTSD-related <b>cognitions</b> {{and adult}} romantic {{attachment}} <b>cognitions</b> {{have been linked}} to level of symptomatology and can be conceptualized as interpersonal cognitive schemas that may increase vulnerability to the development of psychological symptoms. The present study examined PTSD-related <b>cognitions</b> and adult romantic attachment as moderators of symptom development after interpersonal trauma. Victims reported higher levels of PTSD-related <b>cognitions</b> and attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, than non-victims. Results suggest that the experience of trauma, high levels of insecure attachment, and high levels of PTSD-related <b>cognitions</b> are associated with higher levels of symptomatology. In addition, PTSD-related <b>cognitions</b> served as a unique predictor of PTSD symptoms, and moderated the relation between attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} two {{procedures for}} assessing the cognitive constructions of family interactions of conduct- disordered children and their mothers. Video- mediated recall (VR) uses videotaped replays of family interaction as a cue to elicit <b>cognitions</b> about the interaction; thought listing (TL) involves writing down <b>cognitions</b> about the interaction. Twenty-five conduct- disordered children and 17 nonproblem {{children and their parents}} participated in the study. <b>Cognitions</b> were coded into self-referent positive, self-referent negative, family-referent positive, family-referent negative, other-referent positive, and other referent- negative. There was a significant effect of clinical status on <b>cognitions</b> using the VR measure for both children and parents, but not using the TL method.

5|$|Varner's second monograph, Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare, was {{published}} in 2012 by Oxford University Press. Varner {{had been working on}} questions about R. M. Hare and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that Peter Singer was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation. A project entitled Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; Personhood, Ethics, and Animal <b>Cognition</b> was the first, while the second, the forthcoming Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities, in under contract with the publisher. While Personhood, Ethics, and Animal <b>Cognition</b> addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, Sustaining Animals is more practically focussed, exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal <b>Cognition</b> to real-world issues concerning human-animal relationships. Varner is also co-authoring a textbook under contract with Cambridge University Press entitled Environmental Ethics for Environmentalists with the University of Guelph ecologist Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist.|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{research}} has found that interparental conflict is associated with children’s adjustment and cognitive appraisals. This study aims to address two questions. First, does exposure to interparental conflict predict children’s immediate and long-term <b>cognitions</b> regarding interparental conflict? Second, do children’s immediate and long-term <b>cognitions</b> predict internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression? Children ages 9 - to 11 -years-old (n = 96; 59 females, 1 gender-neutral) were shown video presentations of conflict between two actors portraying a married couple. Children evaluated the actors’ behaviors as good or bad, and these evaluations were used as a measure of their immediate <b>cognitions</b> regarding interparental conflict stimuli. These immediate <b>cognitions</b> were compared to measures of children’s long-term <b>cognitions</b> regarding interparental conflict, exposure to interparental conflict, and internalizing problems using bivariate correlation and simple regression analyses. In contrast to the hypotheses, more exposure to interparental conflict did not predict immediate or long-term <b>cognitions,</b> nor did immediate or long-term <b>cognitions</b> predict children’s internalizing problems. Implications for future studies comparing immediate and long-term <b>cognitions</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Recording <b>cognitions</b> in {{real-time}} {{while running}} {{has been identified}} as one of the major limitations in the field of sport psychology. In this study, a new methodology was developed to overcome this limitation. For this purpose, 17 competitive long distance runners participated voluntarily. The experimental session consisted in identifying and storing <b>cognitions</b> (thoughts, emotions, sensations and mental images) while performing a 30 minutes treadmill run. In addition, participants were asked to register which of these <b>cognitions</b> were perceived as unpleasant. The mapping task showed a total of 1154 <b>cognitions</b> recorded, mostly thoughts. In general, during the session, <b>cognitions</b> perceived as unpleasant represented 13. 43 % of the total recorded. These <b>cognitions</b> were mainly directed to physical sensations that resulted from stimulations derived from the physical effort of running. Consequently, it is possible to claim an interaction relationship between sensations and exercise workload. The results attempt to demonstrate that the study of <b>cognitions</b> in real-time is deemed suitable during running...|$|R

40|$|Less {{is known}} about {{depression}} in children than in adults. This study integrates fields by combining cognitive and interpersonal research investigating childhood depression symptoms {{through the use of}} a genetic framework. Three research questions are addressed. First, what are the associations among interpersonal <b>cognitions,</b> anxiety, and depression? Second, what are the relative magnitudes of genetic and environmental influences on interpersonal <b>cognitions?</b> Third, to what extent do genetic and environmental influences explain associations between interpersonal <b>cognitions</b> and depression? Three hundred pairs of 8 -year-old twins reported on symptoms of depression and anxiety by completing the Children's Depression Inventory and the Screen for Childhood Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders. The authors examined interpersonal <b>cognitions</b> with the Children's Expectation of Social Behaviors and the Perceptions of Peers and Self Questionnaires. Interpersonal <b>cognitions</b> were more strongly correlated with depression (mean r =. 35) than with anxiety (mean r =. 13). Genetic influence on interpersonal <b>cognitions</b> was small (M = 3 %), and associations between interpersonal <b>cognitions</b> and depression were mainly explained by environmental influences. These latter findings may result from interpersonal <b>cognitions</b> in young children, reflecting life experiences as opposed to trait-like cognitive biases...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{abdominal}} complaints (IBS) are {{widespread in}} the general population, especially among women. Non-organic dimensions of the complaint such as complaint-related <b>cognitions</b> and behaviour appear {{to be related to}} the prognosis. The prognosis could possibly be improved by changing these factors during medical consultations. Therefore, doctors have to perceive patients' <b>cognitions</b> and behaviour. But, do they perceive them correctly? One hundred and twenty patients with functional abdominal complaints referred to an out-patient clinic for internal medicine completed a questionnaire about their complaints and their complaint-related <b>cognitions,</b> behaviour, and anxiety prior to the first consultation. After the first consultation, doctors completed a similar questionnaire indicating their perceptions of patients' <b>cognitions,</b> anxiety, behaviour, and complaints.

40|$|Perfectionism <b>cognitions</b> capture {{automatic}} perfectionistic {{thoughts and}} have explained variance in psychological adjustment and maladjustment beyond trait perfectionism. The {{aim of the}} present research was to investigate whether a multidimensional assessment of perfectionism <b>cognitions</b> has advantages over a unidimensional assessment. To this aim, we examined {{in a sample of}} 324 university students how the Perfectionism <b>Cognitions</b> Inventory (PCI) and the Multidimensional Perfectionism <b>Cognitions</b> Inventory (MPCI) explained variance in positive affect, negative affect, and depressive symptoms when factor or subscale scores were used as predictors compared to total scores. Results showed that a multidimensional assessment (PCI factor scores, MPCI subscale scores) explained more variance than a unidimensional assessment (PCI and MPCI total scores) because, when the different dimensions were entered simultaneously as predictors, perfectionistic strivings <b>cognitions</b> and perfectionistic concerns <b>cognitions</b> acted as mutual suppressors thereby increasing each others’ predictive validity. With this, the present findings provide evidence that―regardless of whether the PCI or the MPCI is used―a multidimensional assessment of perfectionism <b>cognitions</b> has advantages over a unidimensional assessment in explaining variance in psychological adjustment and maladjustment...|$|R
40|$|Affect {{induction}} {{research examining}} the causal pathways to developing and maintaining major depression has demonstrated a strong link between depressive affect and negative <b>cognitions.</b> Mindfulness {{has recently been}} incorporated into several psychotherapy interventions to disrupt the ruminative processes hypothesized to exacerbate transient dysphoric emotional states into substantial pathological conditions such as depression. The literature on depressive <b>cognitions</b> and rumination was reviewed to demonstrate the unique role mindfulness attention to experience may play in the disruption of known pathological cognitive pathways. Buddhist conceptualizations llS well as recent psychological operationalizations of mindfulness were reviewed to more fully present the construct. The primary hypothesis was that trait mindfulness would moderate the strong relationship between depressive affect and negative <b>cognitions.</b> Depressive affect, mindfulness, and the interaction between these two variables were used to predict negative <b>cognitions.</b> All three were significant predictors, such that negative affect {{was positively related to}} negative <b>cognitions,</b> mindfulness was negatively related to negative <b>cognitions,</b> and mindfulness significantly moderated the strength of the relationship between depressed affect and negative <b>cognitions.</b> Theoretical and treatment implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Successes and {{failures}} with technological innovation can, in some cases, {{be attributed to}} the decision-making processes in the user organization. There has been a growing interest among strategy researchers in managerial <b>cognitions.</b> This paper describes the nature and importance of knowledge bases and <b>cognitions</b> for decisions about technological innovation and suggests how knowledge and <b>cognitions</b> can be explored using process research.

40|$|Objective: Although health <b>cognitions</b> are {{regarded}} as key determinants for health behavior change, they are rarely studied from a dynamic perspective, evaluating the impact of changes in <b>cognitions</b> on changes in behavior. In the present study, we examine how changes in phase-specific and generic health <b>cognitions</b> influence first, the adoption of exercise and later, {{the maintenance of the}} newly acquired behavior. Methods: Participants were middle-aged, Finnish adults participating in a lifestyle intervention to prevent Type 2 diabetes (N = 389). Health <b>cognitions</b> and exercise were measured at baseline (preintervention) and twice after a lifestyle intervention took place (at 3 months and after 1 year). Results: The results show that both phase-specific and generic health <b>cognitions</b> changed during the intervention. However, these changes were most pronounced within those participants who started at a lower level to begin with. Most important, evidence for the dynamic interplay between changes in health <b>cognitions</b> and health behavior was observed: Phase-specific health <b>cognitions</b> facilitated the adoption as well as the maintenance of behavior changes. Conclusions: Thus, health <b>cognitions</b> are amenable to change, and these changes are adaptive in terms of initiating and maintaining health behavior change. This has implications both for practical intervention research, as well as for theory development...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{document}} the relationship between automatic and explicit parenting <b>cognitions</b> and alcohol use in adolescents. In addition, we examined whether this relationship was dependent on parental alcohol use. Method: A convenience sample of 59 parents (57. 63 % mothers, 59. 32 % younger than 50 years) with children between 14 and 18 years (58. 93 % girls) completed the Relational Responding Task (RRT) prior to a paper-and-pencil questionnaire. Results: The relationship between automatic parenting <b>cognitions</b> as measured by the RRT and the frequency of adolescent alcohol intake among drinkers was significant, χ²(1) = 7. 74, p < 0. 01, even after controlling for the predictive validity of explicit parenting <b>cognitions.</b> The prevalence of alcohol use was related to explicit parenting <b>cognitions</b> (OR = 0. 223, p < 0. 001) but not automatic parenting <b>cognitions.</b> Conclusion: This study is the first to demonstrate that automatic parenting <b>cognitions</b> as measured by the RRT can be used as a predictor of alcohol use in adolescents who have initiated drinking, even after controlling for explicit parenting <b>cognitions.</b> This study provides the starting point of a much broader research program aimed at uncovering the relationship between automatic parenting <b>cognitions</b> and offspring behavior, also beyond the domain of alcohol use...|$|R
