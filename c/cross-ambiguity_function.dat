40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of having a}} joint radar and communication system on a single hardware is driven by space, military, and commercial applications. However, designing sequences that can simultaneously support radar and communication functionalities {{is one of the}} major hurdles in the practical implementation of these systems. In order to facilitate a simultaneous use of sequences for both radar and communication systems, a flexible sequence design is needed. The objective of this dissertation is to address the sequence design problem for integrated radar and communication systems. The sequence design for these systems requires a trade-off between different performance measures, such as correlation characteristics, integrated sidelobe ratio, peak-to-sidelobe ratio and ambiguity function. The problem of finding a trade-off between various performance measures is solved by employing meta-heuristic algorithms. This dissertation is divided into an introduction and three research parts based on peer-reviewed publications. The introduction provides background on binary and polyphase sequences, their use in radar and communication systems, sequence design requirements for integrated radar and communication systems, and application of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to find optimal sets of sequences for these systems. In Part I-A, the performance of conventional polyphase pulse compression sequences is compared with Oppermann sequences. In Part I-B, weighted pulse trains with the elements of Oppermann sequences serving as complex-valued weights are utilized for the design of integrated radar and communication systems. In Part I-C, an analytical expression for the <b>cross-ambiguity</b> <b>function</b> of weighted pulse trains with Oppermann sequences is derived. Several properties of the related auto-ambiguity and cross-ambiguity functions are derived in Part I-D. In Part II, the potential of meta-heuristic algorithms for finding optimal parameter values of Oppermann sequences for radar, communications, and integrated radar and communication systems is studied. In Part III-A, a meta-heuristic algorithm mimicking the breeding behavior of Cuckoos is used to locate more than one solution for multimodal problems. Further, the performance of this algorithm is evaluated in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). It is shown that the Cuckoo search algorithm can successfully locate multiple solutions in both non-noise and AWGN with relatively high degree of accuracy.

40|$|Abstract-Recently, {{the concept}} of MIMO (multiple-inputmultiple-output) radars has drawn {{considerable}} attention. In traditional SIMO (single-input-multiple-output) radar, the transmitters emit coherent waveforms to form a focused beam. In MIMO radar, the transmitters emit orthogonal (or incoherent) waveforms to increase the spatial resolution. These waveforms also affect the range and Doppler resolution which can be characterized by the ambiguity function. In traditional (SIMO) radars, the ambiguity function of the transmitted pulse characterizes the compromise between range and Doppler resolutions. In the MIMO radar, since many transmitting waveforms are involved, their <b>cross-ambiguity</b> <b>functions</b> enter into the signal design problem. In this paper, frequency hopping codes are used to generate these orthogonal MIMO radar waveforms. A new algorithm for designing the frequency hopping codes is proposed.

40|$|Abstract—The {{ambiguity}} {{functions of}} a kind of direct chaotic radar system are investigated. In this radar system, a microwave chaotic Colpitts oscillator is employed to generate the source signal that is directly transmitted through a wideband antenna without modulation. The auto-ambiguity function of this radar system shows many sidelobes which makes the unambiguous detection difficult. It is because the spectrum of the chaotic signal is not very flat and smooth, with pulsation peaks in it. The <b>cross-ambiguity</b> <b>functions</b> of the direct radar system have also been investigated to evaluate the electronic counter countermeasure (ECCM) performance and the “multi-user” characteristic. It is shown that rather excellent ECCM capability can be achieved in this radar system with transmitting chaotic signals generated by circuits with same parameters but at different time or with slightly different circuit parameters. In addition, several possible methods to reshape the spectrum of the chaotic signal from microwave Colpitts oscillators to improve the unambiguous detection performance are suggested {{at the end of this}} paper. 2 Shi et al. 1...|$|R

The proposed CFAR algorithm, Cell-Under-Test Inclusive (CI) CFAR, utilizes a goodness-of-fit test for determining and combining homogeneous windows, {{resulting in a}} higher detection performance. The CI-CFAR algorithm layout and analytical properties for the ideal case are investigated. In comparison to the traditional Cell-averaging (CA) CFAR and Order-statistic (OS) CFAR, it is demonstrated that CI-CFAR outperforms both in most situations. Also, the relationship between efficient sorting and homogeneity is investigated. ^ Then the volume bounds on the coherent Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) ambiguity function are investigated. The coherent MIMO radar delay-Doppler ambiguity function is the coherent sum of all auto and <b>cross-ambiguity</b> <b>functions</b> of the K spatially diverse waveforms. It is demonstrated that the upper bound on the attainable “clear area” for the coherent MIMO ambiguity function {{is as good as}} the conventional Woodward single-waveform ambiguity function, which is better than the bounds obtained from the incoherent MIMO ambiguity function. ^ Finally, a new technique, dubbed Space-Time LandScaping (STLS), is investigated. The main idea is that if the two or more transmitted waveforms in a MIMO radar system are all different, then the coherent sum of the waveforms in each point in space will be different in general. The difference is investigated in the hopes of increasing performance, particularly in resolution. It is shown that the families of waveforms and the criteria used in this dissertation exhibit no immediate advantages over the single waveform case. Some properties of STLS are proven in hopes of finding different criteria and/or families of waveforms that can demonstrate the benefits of MIMO radar systems in future research. ...|$|R
