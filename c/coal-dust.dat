5|$|The French {{army was}} forced to march through rain and black <b>coal-dust</b> mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with mud and rain as it slept in the open. Little food was {{available}} for the soldiers, but nevertheless the veteran French soldiers were fiercely loyal to Napoleon.|$|E
2500|$|Domestic chores {{for women}} without {{servants}} meant {{a great deal}} of washing and cleaning. <b>Coal-dust</b> from home stoves and factories filled the city air, coating windows, clothing, furniture and rugs. Washing clothing and linens meant scrubbing by hand in a large zinc or copper tub. Some water would be heated and added to the wash tub, and perhaps a handful of soda to soften the water. [...] Curtains were taken down and washed every fortnight; they were often so blackened by coal smoke that they had to be soaked in salted water before being washed. Scrubbing the front wooden doorstep of the home every morning was done to maintain respectability.|$|E
60|$|She took up {{a handful}} of <b>coal-dust</b> and, {{ordering}} him to stoop, shampooed him with hearty good-will.|$|E
60|$|Tottie being summoned {{with the}} baby, {{entered the room}} {{staggering}} with the rotund mountain of good-natured self-will entirely concealing her person, with exception of her feet and the pretty little <b>coal-dusted</b> arms with which she clasped it to her heaving breast.|$|R
60|$|She {{gathered}} her skirts, lowered her {{foot to the}} side of the boat, and leapt down, laughing. <b>Coal-dust</b> flew up.|$|E
6000|$|Entering the breaker, {{which was}} thickly coated {{both inside and}} out with <b>coal-dust,</b> he {{reported}} to Donovan, the boss, by saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{this is very}} well, gentlemen; but he can't throw any of his <b>coal-dust</b> in my eyes. There's {{nothing in}} it. Why, there can't be {{anything}} in it. A fellow like that for manager? Phoo!" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{artificial}} breeze, sweeping {{round the}} sides of the screen, caused an eddy which sent up a cloud of <b>coal-dust,</b> but neither John nor his mate appeared to care for this. Their eyes were evidently coal-proof.|$|E
6000|$|... "Asleep below, wi' {{his hair}} full o' <b>coal-dust,</b> {{looking more like}} a nigger than the son o' a rich American. Human nature's a verra curious thing, but if he can stand another month, I'll hae hope o' him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're pretty thick," [...] replied Will Garvie, {{wiping his}} countenance {{with a piece}} of waste, which, while it removed the perspiration, left behind a good deal of oil, and {{streaked}} his nose with <b>coal-dust.</b> But Will was not particular! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A fair {{day and a}} {{fair wind}} for all, thank God!" [...] said Emanuel Pyecroft, {{throwing}} back the cowl-like hood of his blanket coat. His face was pitted with <b>coal-dust</b> and grime, pallid for lack of sleep; but his eyes shone like a gull's.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a little}} past noon, {{and many of the}} women come to their doors and look curiously after a miner, who, in his working clothes, and black with <b>coal-dust,</b> walks rapidly towards his house, with his head bent down, and his thick felt hat slouched over his eyes.|$|E
60|$|There was silence. Morel {{stared at}} the sugar-basin instead of eating his dinner. His black arm, with the hand all gnarled with work lay on the table. His wife pretended not to see him rub {{the back of his}} hand across his eyes, nor the smear in the <b>coal-dust</b> on his black face.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the covers}} were {{taken off the}} basins, I saw they were filled with ashes, <b>coal-dust,</b> and lamp-black. The young men mixed these all together, and smeared the whole over their heads and faces. They then wept and beat their breasts, crying, [...] "This is the fruit of idleness, and of our wicked lives." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was dressed}} in a canvas suit abundantly besmeared with <b>coal-dust</b> and oil, and had cinders in his whiskers, and a smell of half-slaked ashes all over him. He was not a bad-looking fellow, nor even what could be fairly called a dirty-looking fellow, in spite of this; and, in short, he was Mr Toodle, professionally clothed.|$|E
60|$|Armand, {{with his}} rough clothes soiled with <b>coal-dust,</b> his face grimy and {{streaked}} with sweat, certainly looked to have but {{little in common}} with the ci-devant aristos who formed the hulk of the groups in the courtyard. He looked up; the soldier was regarding him with obvious amusement, and at sight of Armand's wild, anxious eyes he gave vent to a coarse jest.|$|E
60|$|Passing on, the rescued men {{moved forward}} {{to where the}} women stood, anxiously gazing. Blackened as they were with <b>coal-dust,</b> they were recognizable, and with wild screams of joy three women burst from the rest and threw {{themselves}} in their arms. But {{only for a moment}} could they indulge in this burst of happiness, for the other women crowded round.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} for you to do, so far as I can see," [...] said the girl, slowly, [...] "is to make {{yourself}} up like a coalie. There are one or two colliers in the harbor, and if you took off your coat--I could send it on afterwards--rubbed yourself all over with <b>coal-dust,</b> and shaved off your moustache, I believe you would escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Coal, {{food and}} fresh water were running out; their {{medicine}} chest was empty. Everything was foul with soot, <b>coal-dust</b> and salt. I expect {{it was long}} since {{they were able to}} clean decks. The skipper was in a hammock under the bridge-awning and could not get up. An African trader, Montgomery of a Liverpool house, seemed to have control. His skin was yellow, like a mulatto's." ...|$|E
60|$|But the {{certificate}} {{was in good}} order, and Armand, covered in <b>coal-dust,</b> with the perspiration streaming down his face, did certainly not look like an aristocrat in disguise. It was never very difficult to enter the great city; if one wished to put one's head in the lion's mouth, one was welcome to do so; the difficulty came when the lion thought fit to close his jaws.|$|E
60|$|We {{came near}} to the ugly rows of houses that back up against the pit-hill. Everywhere is black and sooty: the houses are back to back, having only one entrance, which is from a square garden where black-speckled weeds grow sulkily, and which looks on to a row of evil little ash-pit huts. The road {{everywhere}} is trodden over with a crust of soot and <b>coal-dust</b> and cinders.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{a ladder}} and basket if you like. By which means, or by others, he grew rich as a Dust Contractor, {{and lived in}} a hollow in a hilly country entirely {{composed}} of Dust. On his own small estate the growling old vagabond threw up his own mountain range, like an old volcano, and its geological formation was Dust. <b>Coal-dust,</b> vegetable-dust, bone-dust, crockery dust, rough dust and sifted dust,--all manner of Dust.' ...|$|E
60|$|Jimmy laughed, {{and told}} him to raise steam enough to take the Shasta to sea. She made six knots most of that night; and two days later the men went ashore again. Fleming, at least, never forgot the rest of that trip down the wild West Coast. He mixed his {{resinous}} billets with saturated <b>coal-dust</b> and broken hemlock bark, but in spite of it he stopped the Shasta every now and then when his boilers gave him water instead of steam.|$|E
60|$|They saw the {{two girls}} appear, small, {{brilliant}} figures in the near distance, in the strong light of the late afternoon. Both wore light, gay summer dresses, Ursula had an orange-coloured knitted coat, Gudrun a pale yellow, Ursula wore canary yellow stockings, Gudrun bright rose, the figures of the two women seemed to glitter in progress over the wide bay of the railway crossing, white and orange and yellow and rose glittering in motion across a hot world silted with <b>coal-dust.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Marco's joy was exuberant--but {{only for}} a moment; then he grew thoughtful, then sad; and when he heard me tell Dowley I should have Dickon, the boss mason, and Smug, the boss wheelwright, out there, too, the <b>coal-dust</b> on his face turned to chalk, and he lost his grip. But I knew {{what was the matter}} with him; it was the expense. He saw ruin before him; he judged that his {{financial}} days were numbered. However, on our way to invite the others, I said: ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the place}} where Rachael lived, {{though it was not}} in his way; by the red brick streets; by the great silent factories, not {{trembling}} yet; by the railway, where the danger-lights were waning in the strengthening day; by the railway's crazy neighbourhood, half pulled down and half built up; by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens were sprinkled with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by <b>coal-dust</b> paths and many varieties of ugliness; Stephen got {{to the top of the}} hill, and looked back.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} door behind him, and was glad. It was a rainy evening. The Palmerston would be the cosier. He hastened forward in anticipation. All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone black with wet. The roads, always dark with <b>coal-dust,</b> were full of blackish mud. He hastened along. The Palmerston windows were steamed over. The passage was paddled with wet feet. But the air was warm, if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer and smoke.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{apparently}} {{only a year}} or two older than herself, and clad in blue jean overalls, blackened and smeared with oil and <b>coal-dust.</b> Even his youthful face, which he turned towards her, had a black smudge running across it and almost obliterating a small auburn moustache. The look of surprise that he gave her, however, quickly passed; he remained patiently and in a half-preoccupied way, holding his hammer in his hand, as she advanced. This was evidently the young fellow who could [...] "do anything that could be done with wood and iron." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{eyes were}} {{instantly}} turned upon {{the man who}} had approached unseen and made this announcement. By the electric light, shining brightly on them from the corner, they made him out to be a big, muscular fellow, clad in a working-man's garments. His feet were incased in heavy brogans, a narrow strap of black leather held his overalls about his waist, and a black and greasy cap was on his head. His face was grimed with <b>coal-dust,</b> and a coarse blue shirt, open at the neck, revealed a wide throat and massive chest.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{took him}} {{on board the}} Estremedura, {{and when he had}} removed most of the <b>coal-dust</b> from his person they sat down with a bottle of thin wine before them in the sobrecargo's room. Jefferson was lean in face and person, though he was largely made, and had dark eyes that could smile and yet retain a certain intentness and gravity. His voice had a little ring in it, and, big as he was, he was seldom {{altogether}} still. When he filled his glass his long fingers tightened on it curiously.|$|E
60|$|Barbara had {{not gone}} up the greasy ladder to the bridge and waited on deck. She had left home without much breakfast, in the dark, and was cold and rather depressed. All was gloomy and strangely flat. The tug looked small and was horribly dirty. <b>Coal-dust</b> covered rails and ropes; grimy drops from the rigging splashed on the trampled black mud on deck. The crew were not sober and their faces were black. Two or three draggled women called to them from the pierhead, their voices {{sounding}} melancholy and harsh.|$|E
6000|$|We were to sail Sunday at eleven, and Saturday {{afternoon}} had arrived. The {{crowd on}} the wharf and the <b>coal-dust</b> were thicker than ever. In one pocket I carried a cheque-book, a fountain-pen, a dater, and a blotter; in another pocket I carried {{between one and}} two thousand dollars in paper money and gold. I {{was ready for the}} creditors, cash for the small ones and cheques for the large ones, and was waiting only for Roscoe to arrive with the balances of the accounts of the hundred and fifteen firms who had delayed me so many months. And then - ...|$|E
6000|$|A well {{established}} society in Woodhouse, full of fine shades, {{ranging from the}} dark of <b>coal-dust</b> to grit of stone-mason and sawdust of timber-merchant, through the lustre of lard and butter and meat, to the perfume of the chemist and the disinfectant of the doctor, on to the serene gold-tarnish of bank-managers, cashiers for the firm, clergymen and such-like, {{as far as the}} automobile refulgence of the general-manager of all the collieries. Here the ne plus ultra. The general manager lives in the shrubberied seclusion of the so-called Manor. The genuine Hall, abandoned by the [...] "County," [...] has been taken over as offices by the firm.|$|E
60|$|The jewel swung {{from the}} baby's hand {{and fell in}} a little heap on the coal-dusty bottom of the barge. The man groped for it, {{with a kind of}} careful reverence. Ursula noticed the coarsened, blunted fingers groping at the little jewelled heap. The skin was red {{on the back of the}} hand, the fair hairs glistened stiffly. It was a thin, sinewy, capable hand nevertheless, and Ursula liked it. He took up the {{necklace}} carefully, and blew the <b>coal-dust</b> from it, as it lay in the hollow of his hand. He seemed still and attentive. He held out his hand with the necklace shining small in its hard, black hollow.|$|E
60|$|Miss Miggs deliberated within {{herself for}} some little time, looking {{hard at the}} shop-door while she did so, as though her eyes and {{thoughts}} were both upon it; and then, taking {{a sheet of paper}} from a drawer, twisted it into a long thin spiral tube. Having filled this instrument with a quantity of small <b>coal-dust</b> from the forge, she approached the door, and dropping on one knee before it, dexterously blew into the keyhole as much of these fine ashes as the lock would hold. When she had filled it to the brim in a very workmanlike and skilful manner, she crept upstairs again, and chuckled as she went.|$|E
60|$|A long {{suburb of}} red brick houses--some with patches of garden-ground, where <b>coal-dust</b> and factory smoke darkened the {{shrinking}} leaves, and coarse rank flowers, {{and where the}} struggling vegetation sickened and sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace, making them by its presence seem yet more blighting and unwholesome than in the town itself--a long, flat, straggling suburb passed, they came, by slow degrees, upon a cheerless region, where not a blade of grass was seen to grow, where not a bud put forth its promise in the spring, where nothing green could live but {{on the surface of}} the stagnant pools, which here and there lay idly sweltering by the black road-side.|$|E
