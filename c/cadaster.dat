2500|$|Already in 1688, {{with their}} {{control of the}} country {{practically}} complete, the Venetians appointed Giacomo Corner as the governor-general (provveditore generale) of the Morea to administer their new territory. The task he faced was daunting, as the population had fled from the coming of war: 656 out of 2,115 villages were deserted, almost all the Muslim population had abandoned the peninsula for lands still in Ottoman hands, while even towns like Patras, which numbered 25,000 inhabitants before the war, now had 1,615 left. Apart from the region of Corinthia and the autonomous Mani Peninsula, the Venetians counted only 86,468 inhabitants in 1688, out of an estimated pre-war population of 200,000. Under Corner's oversight, a committee of three senators (Jeronimo Renier, Domenico Gritti, Marino Michiel) was sent to the Morea to reorganize the provincial administration, revive local authorities, compile a <b>cadaster</b> and settle land disputes. The peninsula was divided into four provinces: ...|$|E

In this paper, we present a new extrusion approach based on non-overlapping footprints (EABNOF) that supports relatively complex 3 D situations. In EABNOF, overlaps between overlapping footprints of the input data are removed, which also involves splitting extrusion intervals and handling the associated cadastral objects of footprints. The newly generated non-overlapping footprints are extruded to generate primitives. To construct geometric models and topologies for cadastral objects, three judgment criteria are proposed to identify and remove redundancies from these primitives, and then primitives of the same 3 D spatial unit or topological feature are merged. Considering the feasibility of using EABNOF for current cadastral data, we design a data model that associates 3 D cadastral data with the footprints of 2 D <b>cadasters.</b> We examine two types of structures on Pozi Street to verify EABNOF: a building complex and property objects. The results demonstrate that EABNOF can construct geometric models and topologies in 3 D <b>cadasters.</b> EABNOF is based on the footprints of 2 D cadastral data, and thus is particularly suited to areas with 2 D cadastral data to establish 3 D <b>cadasters</b> with low costs...|$|R

In the process of working on this thesis, many aspects, which could influence this connection, were considered.

The reason for this study was the complexity of the man - landscape relationship and the different aspects which can determine the nature of it. The results were confronted with the local people's perception by interviews. The thesis is structured into several parts. One of the crucial is the theoretical chapter, which presents the various attitudes to landscape, mainly those which emphasize land use discipline, landscape heritage, landscape memory and territorial identity. All these phenomenons appear in the other parts of the thesis.

The next passage covers the information on the legal status of the land of the palace in the legislation and the <b>cadasters.</b> Further we can learn the ways of forming land of the palace in the district. The composition of the lands of palace was not permanent. Firstly, the formation of the fund land of the palace administration occurred as a result of seizures of other forms of ownership with the change of their status. Secondly, the peasant land was transferred to the category of palace. Land of the palace administration was actively transferred into the possession of the temporal and monasteries landowners.

30|$|Ultimately, {{the goal}} is to develop a clear and {{compelling}} method of communicating operational risks to the current and future users of critical orbits as well as the insurers. Useful visualization of orbit vulnerability <b>cadasters</b> will be difficult {{due to the fact that}} debris can disperse from an initial altitude/inclination, for example, due to a continuous change in RAAN (see Fig.  2) in nonpolar orbits. Both the vulnerability index map and visualization of a risk cadastre would need to be calculated frequently for each specific orbit of interest. For debris measurement, existing modeling approaches would be of great use. For example, orbital debris models like ORDEM 3.0 could be used to propagate “witness plates” in specific, high-value orbits that are standard sizes or represent specific spacecraft to determine the spatial density or flux of debris (Stansbery and Matney 2014). But setting target and critical loads, enforcement of mitigation, and navigating the politics may be more difficult than engineering a cadastral representation.|$|R

On {{the basis}} of family reconstitution, linked to census lists, <b>cadasters</b> and other records, it is {{possible}} to reconstruct the life courses, family histories and kinship networks for all the inhabitants of local society. The parish of Beim near the town of Osnabrück in Northwest Germany is marked by strong inequality between minority of peasants with large land holdings and the majority of landless peasants, who were labourers, tenants and linen producers at the same time. This article seeks to analyse the relations between the individual families of the two classes in detail by examining economic ties like land-lease, labour and credit, as well as social ties like kinship and godparenthood.

The current extraordinary availability of remotely sensed images makes it now urgent to envision and develop automatic methods that can simplify their inspection and the extraction of relevant information from them, as the quantity of information is no longer manageable by traditional “human” visual interpretation. This paper expands {{on the development of}} automatic methods for the {{detection of}} target landscape features—represented by field system patterns—in very high spatial resolution images, within the framework of an archaeological project focused on the landscape engineering embedded in Roman <b>cadasters.</b> The targets of interest consist of a variety of similarly oriented objects of diverse nature (such as roads, drainage channels, etc.) concurring to demark the current landscape organization, which reflects the one imposed by Romans over two millennia ago. The proposed workflow exploits the textural and shape properties of real-world elements forming the field patterns using multiscale analysis of dominant oriented response filters. Trials showed that this approach provides accurate localization of target linear objects and alignments signaled by a wide range of physical entities with very different characteristics...|$|R
