40|$|Histopathology and {{phenotypic}} {{considerations in}} IgM-secreting B-cell tumors allow distinction between different diseases, but insight into pathogenesis is restricted. Here, variable region (V) gene analysis can complement classification but, more importantly, can also reveal disease origins and clonal history. We used V(H) gene analysis to probe origins in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), and contrasted these with the less malignant counterpart, IgM-secreting monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Limited data on WM sequences had previously shown evidence for somatic mutation, but with <b>conflicting</b> <b>analysis</b> of intraclonal variation in tumor sequences. To further the investigation, we analyzed seven cases of WM and compared these with three cases of IgM MGUS. In both diseases, V(H) genes were somatically mutated with {{no evidence of}} intraclonal variation, even at the MGUS stage. A sensitive V(H) gene-probe assay revealed no evidence for isotype switch transcripts {{in any of the}} WM and IgM MGUS cases. These findings reveal an origin of WM and IgM MGUS from a IgM cell, which transforms after cessation of somatic mutation but without initiating switch events. In contrast, IgM-secreting multiple myeloma arises at a later stage in differentiation, when isotype switch mechanisms have been engaged...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} resolution of today's simulated scientific data sets is constantly growing. Simulations spanning thousands of discrete time steps are common these days; simulations {{with a much}} higher resolution exist. The growing amount of discrete time steps leads to significant problems, particularly concerning the navigation through such data sets. This thesis presents a set of techniques that together enable an intuitive, interactive, and accurate navigation through time-varying scientific data. A time model that describes different time scales and their relations in scientific visualizations serves as a basis. Novel 3 D interaction techniques for search and maneuver navigation tasks are developed and are evaluated in user studies. Based on initial user input, the {{temporal resolution}} of time-varying scientific data is adapted by a multi-objective optimization approach, which tries to combine <b>conflicting</b> <b>analysis</b> goals. In order {{to speed up the}} computation of time-varying visualizations during navigation, a remote parallel computation system using different user-centered scheduling strategies is presented. The developed approaches are evaluated using multiple large time-varying data sets from medicine, geosciences and flow mechanics. The heterogeneous techniques proposed - applied individually as well as in combination - enable or ease the analysis of large time-varying data in an interactive work process...|$|E
40|$|Meckel {{syndrome}} (MKS) is {{a lethal}} disorder characterized by renal cystic dysplasia, encephalocele, polydactyly and biliary dysgenesis. It is highly genetically heterogeneous with nine different genes implicated in this disorder. MKS {{is thought to}} be a ciliopathy because of the range of phenotypes and localization of some of the implicated proteins. However, limited data are available about the phenotypes associated with MKS 1 and MKS 3, and the published ciliary data are <b>conflicting.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the wpk rat model of MKS 3 revealed functional defects of the connecting cilium in the eye that resulted in lack of formation of the outer segment, whereas infertile wpk males developed spermatids with very short flagella that did not extend beyond the cell body. In wpk renal collecting duct cysts, cilia were generally longer than normal, with additional evidence of cells with multiple primary cilia and centrosome over-duplication. Kidney tissue and cells from MKS 1 and MKS 3 patients showed defects in centrosome and cilia number, including multi-ciliated respiratory-like epithelia, and longer cilia. Stable shRNA knockdown of Mks 1 and Mks 3 in IMCD 3 cells induced multi-ciliated and multi-centrosomal phenotypes. These studies demonstrate that MKS 1 and MKS 3 are ciliopathies, with new cilia-related eye and sperm phenotypes defined. MKS 1 and MKS 3 functions are required for ciliary structure and function, including a role in regulating length and appropriate number through modulating centrosome duplication...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} Conflict Driven Clauses Learning (CDCL). It relies on an extended notion of implication graph containing additional arcs, called inverse arcs. These are obtained by {{taking into account the}} satisfied clauses of the formula, which are usually ignored by <b>conflict</b> <b>analysis.</b> This extension captures more conveniently the whole propagation process, and opens new perspectives for CDCL-based approaches. Among other benefits, our extension leads to a new <b>conflict</b> <b>analysis</b> scheme that exploits the additional arcs to back-jump to higher levels. Experimental results show that the integration of our generalized <b>conflict</b> <b>analysis</b> scheme within two state-of-the-art solvers improves their performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, {{the study}} of {{conflict}} and conflict resolution remained compara-tively immune to broad developments in social and political theory. When the changing nature and locus of large-scale conflict in the post-Cold War era is also taken into account, {{the case for a}} reconsideration of the fundamentals of <b>conflict</b> <b>analysis</b> and <b>conflict</b> resolution becomes all the more stark.
