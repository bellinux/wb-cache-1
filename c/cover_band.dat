After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with Jenny Lewis and later with Julian Casablancas, Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} and sound of The Guardian Legend have been influential. Robert Dewar and Matthew Smosna {{of the open}} computing magazine Open Systems Today cited the game {{as an example of}} how graphics co-processors such as those in the NES can compensate for inadequate CPU speed in graphics-intensive computer applications. They noted that the fast-paced action seen in the game could not be replicated on a personal computer at that time (1992) without an expensive graphics board and regardless of CPU speed. The music of the game, composed by Masatomo Miyamoto and Takeshi Santo, has remained popular years after the game's release. Samantha Amjadali of the Melbourne-based newspaper The Herald Sun reported that a remixed tune from the game was rated as the second most popular track on the website OverClocked ReMix in March 2002. Video game <b>cover</b> <b>band</b> The Advantage's 2006 album Elf Titled featured a cover version of music from one of the game's dungeon levels.|$|E
