We present models and inference procedures that balance the context-sensitive costs of deferring alerts {{with the cost of}} interruption. We describe the challenge of reasoning about such costs under uncertainty via an analysis of user activity and the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>notifications.</b> After introducing principles of attention-sensitive alerting, we focus on the problem of guiding alerts about email messages. We dwell on the problem of inferring the expected criticality of email and discuss work on the Priorities system, centering on prioritizing email by criticality and modulating the communication <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> to users about the presence and nature of incoming email. 1 Introduction Multitasking computer systems provide great value to users by hosting numerous processes and applications simultaneously.

40|$|This work reports {{results from}} two studies {{investigating}} intelligent notification scheduling. The first study tested {{the performance of}} composite statistical models for detecting and differentiating three granularities (types) of breakpoints within novel task sequences. Results showed that the models detect breakpoints reasonably well, but do not perform as expected for differentiating their type. Our second study investigated how scheduling notifications at different types of breakpoints affects users and their tasks. Results showed that scheduling notifications to occur at breakpoints reduces frustration and reaction time relative to delivering them immediately. We {{also found that the}} <b>content</b> <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> determines the type of breakpoint at which it should be scheduled. The overall concept <b>of</b> scheduling <b>notifications</b> at breakpoints matched well with how users preferred notifications to be managed.

40|$|The law {{increasingly}} requires {{private companies}} {{to disclose information}} {{for the benefit of}} consumers. The latest examples of such regulation are state and federal laws that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving their personal information. These laws, proposed in the wake of highly publicized data spills, seek to punish the breached entity and to protect consumers by requiring the entity to notify its customers about the security breach. There are competing approaches, however to how the law is to mandate release of information about data leaks. This Article finds that the current statutes 2 ̆ 7 focus on reputational sanction is incomplete. An important function <b>of</b> breach <b>notification</b> is mitigation <b>of</b> harm after a data leak. This function requires a multi-institutional coordinated response of the kind that is absent from current policy proposals. This Article advocates creation of a coordinated response architecture and develops the elements of such an approach. Central to this architecture is a coordinated response agent (CRA) that oversees steps for automatic consumer protection and heightens mitigation. This Article also proposes a bifurcated notice scheme that lets firms know that the CRA is watching and is scrutinizing their decision whether or not to disclose information about a breach to the affected individuals. Moreover the CRA will set in motion automatic protective measures on behalf of the breached consumers. Finally, the CRA will regulate the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> messages to reflect the nature of the data breach...|$|R

40|$|Today, the {{architecture}} of distributed computer systems is dominated by client /server platforms relying on synchronous request/reply. This architecture is not well suited to implement information-driven applications like news delivery, stock quoting, air tra#c control, and dissemination of auction bids due to the inherent mismatch between the demands of these applications and the characteristics of those platforms. In contrast to that, publish/subscribe directly reflects the intrinsic behavior of information-driven applications because communication here is indirect and initiated by producers of information: Producers publish notifications and these are delivered to subscribed consumers by the help <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> service that decouples the producers and the consumers. Therefore, publish/subscribe {{should be the first}} choice for implementing such applications. The expressiveness <b>of</b> the <b>notification</b> selection mechanism used by the consumers to describe the notifications they are interested in is crucial for the flexibility <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> service. Content-based notification selection is most expressive because it allows to evaluate filter predicates over the whole <b>content</b> <b>of</b> a <b>notification.</b> The advantage in expressiveness compared to channelor subject-based selection results in increased flexibility facilitating extensibility and change.

40|$|The {{focus of}} my {{dissertation}} research {{is on the}} examination <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> systems that harness different presentation formats for notification delivery, the preferences that individuals express for these various types <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and how these preferences are affected by contextual information surrounding notification delivery. My research is unique from other work in the literature in two primary ways. First, {{while the majority of}} prior work addressing notification delivery, both in terms of format and timing, has focused on the effects <b>of</b> a <b>notification</b> on an individual’s performance on a given task or set of tasks, my focus is the individual’s perception <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> and particularly on that individual’s preferences for different notification formats delivered within different contextual scenarios. An interest in this question is motivated by prior studies that have shown that annoyance with computer-human interactions is a primary reason behind user abandonment of interactive software systems. Second, my preliminary findings suggest that different people prefer different types <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in different contexts, which motivates a change of focus in the development of such systems toward customizing notifications not only to the features of an individual’s context but also to the individual him- or herself. An additional element of novelty in my work is that my final study was conducted in a purely naturalistic office environment, in which the notifications evaluated were precisely those notifications being delivered to study participants throughout their workday. The primary contribution of this dissertation is twofold: a detailed analysis of the methodology for the design, data collection, and analysis of a study <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> preferences in a naturalistic setting {{with a great deal of}} inherent complexity; and a set of results, based on the analysis of preference data acquired in various settings, about how an individual’s contextual environment, and the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> a given <b>notification,</b> can affect that individual’s preferences for notification delivery...|$|R
40|$|Using data on {{correction}} {{rates for}} vehicle recalls in the United States from 2007 to 2010, we investigate information transmission from manufacturers to owners regarding the defects of recalled vehicles. We {{pay special attention}} {{to the role of the}} language manufacturers use to convey each recall’s seriousness in the letters they send to owners to explain the nature of the defects in their vehicles, and the possible consequences if the defects are not fixed. We find that recalls linked to riskier defects, defined by the type of equipment affected in the vehicles, are associated with higher correction rates. Interestingly, the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> recall <b>notification</b> letters plays an important role in increasing correction rates because the letters convey information to owners above and beyond baseline information about which part of their vehicles can present problems. We also find that, in a number of cases, the language that manufacturers use to explain the risks to owners are worryingly milder than the descriptions the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) use, resulting in significantly lower correction rates.

50|$|The {{main issue}} is that the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the {{password}} <b>notification</b> email can be easily discovered by anyone {{with access to the}} inbox of the account owner. This could be as a result of shoulder surfing or if the inbox itself is not password protected. The contents could then be used to compromise the security of the account. The user would therefore have the responsibility of either securely deleting the email or ensuring that its contents are not revealed to anyone else. A partial solution to this problem, is to cause any links contained within the email to expire after a period of time, making the email useless if it is not used quickly after it is sent.|$|R
40|$|Middleware {{supporting}} event-based {{communication is}} {{widely recognized as}} being well suited to mobile applications since it naturally accommodates a dynamically changing population of interacting entities and the dynamic reconfiguration of the connections between them. STEAM is an event-based middleware designed for use in ad hoc networks. STEAM differs from other event-based middleware in that its architecture does not rely {{on the presence of}} any separate infrastructure, event notification filters are distributed, and filtering may be applied to functional and non-functional attributes. In particular, filters may be applied to either the subject or the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> an event <b>notification,</b> or to non-functional attributes, such as location and time. Filters may be used to define geographical areas within which event notifications are valid, thereby bounding the propagation <b>of</b> these <b>notifications.</b> Such proximity-based filtering represents a natural way to filter events of interest in mobile applications. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of STEAM and its use of proximity-based filtering. In particular, we show how proximity-based filtering can be used {{to reduce the number of}} events delivered to collaborative mobile applications...|$|R

Hence, the most fundamental problem in the area of content-based publish/subscribe systems is probably the scalable routing <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> from their producers to their respective consumers. Unfortunately, existing content-based notification services are not mature enough to be used in large-scale, widely-distributed environments. Most existing notification services are either centralized, use flooding, or use simple routing algorithms that assume that each event broker has global knowledge about all active subscriptions. All these approaches exhibit severe scalability problems in large-scale systems. In contrast to that, this thesis concentrates on mechanisms to improve the scalability of content-based routing algorithms and presents more advanced routing algorithms that do not rely on global knowledge. The algorithms presented here exploit similarities between subscriptions by using identity- and covering-tests, and by merging filters. While identity-based routing is a simplified version of covering-based routing, merging-based routing is more advanced because it exploits the concept of filter merging. Furthermore, the idea of imperfect routing algorithms is introduced. The thesis consists of a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part presents a formal specification of publish/subscribe systems, a routing framework and a set of routing algorithms, and discusses how the routing optimizations can be broken down to the actual data/filter model. The practical part presents the implementation <b>of</b> the Rebeca <b>notification</b> service which supports advertisements and all the routing algorithms mentioned above. A detailed practical evaluation of the implemented algorithms based upon the prototype is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Users of {{content-based}} publish/subscribe systems (CBPS) {{are interested}} in receiving data items with values that satisfy certain conditions. Each user submits a list of subscription specifications to a broker, which routes data items from publishers to users. When a broker receives a notification that contains a value from a publisher, it forwards it only to the subscribers whose requests match the value. However, in many applications, the data published are confidential, and their contents must not be revealed to brokers. Furthermore, a user’s subscription may contain sensitive information that must be protected from brokers. Therefore, a difficult challenge arises: how to route publisher data to the appropriate subscribers without the intermediate brokers learning the plain text values <b>of</b> the <b>notifications</b> and subscriptions. To that extent, brokers {{must be able to}} perform operations on top <b>of</b> the encrypted <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> subscriptions and <b>notifications.</b> Such operations may be as simple as equality match, but often require more complex operations such as determining inclusion of data in a value interval. Previous work attempted to solve this problem by using one-way data mappings or specialized encryption functions that allow evaluation of conditions on ciphertexts. However, such operations are computationally expensive, and the resulting CBPS lack scalability. As fast dissemination is an important requirement in many applications, we focus on a new data transformation method called Asymmetric Scalar-product Preserving Encryption (ASPE) [1]. We devise methods that build upon ASPE to support private evaluation of several types of conditions. We also suggest techniques for secure aggregation <b>of</b> <b>notifications,</b> supporting functions such as sum, minimum, maximum and count. Our experimental evaluation shows that ASPE-based CBPS incurs 65 % less overhead for exact-match filtering and 50 % less overhead for range filtering compared to the state-of-the-art...|$|R

40|$|Publish/subscribe systems allow many {{parties to}} {{communicate}} {{by way of}} many-to-many message exchanges. These systems can be topic- or content-based. In topic-based systems, message flows are statically partitioned and each flow {{is associated with a}} so called topic, group or channel. For efficiency and convenience purposes, content-based systems allow subscribers to provide semantic filters over the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> the <b>notifications.</b> Content-based networking is a generalization of the content-based publish/subscribe model, such that networking messages are no longer addressed to the identifiers of the communication end-points (e. g. network or group addresses). Messages are published into a distributed (information) space and routed by the networking substrate to the “interested ” communication end-points. Naming, binding and communication are intertwined in the same substrate. Routing in a topic-based distributed publish/subscribe system is a problem similar to the multicasting routing problem and uses similar algorithms to determine and maintain the dissemination trees. An extra level of complexity is introduced by requiring that messages are filtered and useless transmissions be avoided. Thus, dissemination trees must be dynamically pruned, message by message, to only cover matching subscribers. This paper presents a compilation of the main proposed algorithms to route notifications in distributed content-based publish-subscribe systems, published in the last decade. It differs from surveys published on the broad topic of publish/subscribe systems by focusing the analysis on the content-based routing problem in respect to optimality, complexity and applicability. Moreover, whenever it is relevant, the algorithms covered are linked with similar algorithms developed and used by the networking community. This helps to put the content-based routing problem into perspective. 1...|$|R

The key finding is that perceived message urgency is the primary indicator <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in the home—if people think a message is urgent, they want the message to be shown immediately, regardless {{of what they are}} doing at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The study also shows that the acceptability of low-urgent and medium-urgent messages could be improved by taking into account mental activity load at the time <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> No effect <b>of</b> physical activity was found on acceptability.
