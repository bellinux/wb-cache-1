40|$|An {{essential}} {{feature of}} cardio-pulmonary by-pass is {{the provision of}} adequate cerebral perfusion during open heart surgery. Although various methods exist for measuring cerebral blood flow, they involve the exposure and possible transection of major cerebral vascular channels and are therefore limited to the experimental field.

In the past decade, different mammalian cell lines have been used to clarify the mechanism of CPPs penetration and to characterize the internalization process, which has been described either as an energy-independent direct penetration through the plasma membrane, or as endocytic uptake. Whatever the mechanism involved, the cell penetration properties of these peptides make their use very attractive as vector for promoting the cellular uptake of coupled bioactive macromolecules, such as peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides. Here we demonstrate, {{for the first time in}} insect, that cultured columnar cells from the larval midgut of Bombyx mori more readily internalize eGFP (enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) when fused to CPP Tat. Tat-eGFP translocates across the plasma membrane of absorptive cells in an energy-independent and non-endocytic manner, since no inhibition of the fusion protein uptake is exerted by metabolic inhibitors and by drugs that interfere with the endocytic uptake.

The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to determine whether IL 2 alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) cells depress cardiac function using the isolated, perfused, working rat heart preparation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 - 350 g) were anesthetized and the hearts were removed and placed on the <b>perfusion</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Hearts were perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB), or oxygenated KHB containing IL 2 alone, IL 2 -Media (cell culture media supplemented with 1, 500 U IL 2 /ml), LYMPH (cell culture media from cultured mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers), or LAK (cell culture media from cultured lymphocytes harvested from patients receiving IL 2 /LAK in the presence of 1, 500 U/ml IL 2). The cells were removed before perfusion (n = 9). Cardiac output and coronary flow were measured at 20 -min intervals with preload constant (afterload varied or afterload constant (preload varied). The results indicate a significant depression in cardiac function in hearts treated with LAK. This depression was evident at 20 min and was more pronounced at 60 min. Washout of the KHB plus LAK reversed this depression. Thus, IL 2 -stimulated/cultured human mononuclear cells produce a soluble factor that produces a reversible severe depression of cardiac function...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Although it is {{generally}} accepted that the animal skin represents a barrier to the permeation of pesticides in the living organism, experimental evidences are lacking. For this reason we measured the transcutaneous permeability of three heavily used herbicides (atrazine, paraquat, glyphosate) across the skin of frog and pig. Methods: The ventral skin, from Rana esculenta, and the ear skin, from pig, were isolated and mounted in a specially constructed <b>perfusion</b> <b>apparatus</b> preventing the edge damage interference. Skin was perfused {{on both sides with}} a Ringer solution. 1 mCi of the 14 C- labelled chemical under investigation was added to one compartment. From the opposite compartment, 4 ml were collected after 6 or 24 h, for frog or pig, respectively. Radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter. Results: Permeability values of frog skin were higher than those measured in pig skin. For example, in the case of atrazine, values were 57, 68 10 - 3 cm h- 1 and 0, 92 10 - 3 cm h- 1, respectively. In both cases the rank order of permeability was: atrazine > paraquat > glyphosate. Conclusion: The low permeability of herbicides across the pig skin confirms that the skin is not an important site of permeation of xenobiotics in mammals. On the other hand, the high permeability value of atrazine across the frog skin accounts for its toxic effect on the whole organism and justifies its banning by several countries in Europe...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that dietary {{red palm oil}} (RPO) supplementation improves functional recovery in hearts subjected to ischaemia-reperfusion. However, little knowledge exists concerning the effects of RPO supplementation of a high-cholesterol diet on ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The signalling mechanisms responsible for RPO's effects {{in the presence of}} cholesterol also remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effects of RPO, given with a high-cholesterol diet, on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and apoptosis. Long-Evans rats were fed a control diet, a control diet containing 2 % cholesterol, or a control diet containing 2 % cholesterol and 7 g RPO per kg (CRPO) for 5 weeks. Hearts were excised and mounted on an isolated working heart <b>perfusion</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Cardiac function was measured after which hearts were freeze-clamped and used to assess MAPK phosphorylation and to evaluate apoptosis. Cholesterol supplementation caused a poor aortic output (AO) recovery compared with the control group (35 絠(sem 6 粩 v. 55 素(sem 2 絩 %), but when RPO was added, the percentage AO increased significantly. The cholesterol group's poor AO was associated with a significant increase in p 38 -MAPK phosphorylation, whereas the CRPO-supplemented group showed as significant reduction in p 38 -MAPK phosphorylation when compared with the cholesterol-supplemented group. This significant reduction in p 38 -MAPK was also associated with reduced apoptosis as indicated by significant reductions in caspase- 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) {{has been}} used to characterize the cohesive nature of a micronized pharmaceutical powder used for inhalation therapy. Salbutamol sulfate (also referred to as albuterol sulfate), a therapeutic drug commonly delivered from dry powder inhalers (D]PI), was chosen as a model system because the cohesion and subsequent de-agglomeration during inhalation are critical aspects to the efficacy of such a delivery system. Salbutamol sulfate drug particulates were mounted on V-shaped AFM cantilevers using a novel micromanipulation-technique. Force-distance curves obtained from the measurements between cantilever drug probes and model compacts of salbutamol sulfate were integrated to determine separation energies. The effect of humidity (15 - 75 % RH) on the energy required to separate a drug particle from model drug surface was determined using a custom-built <b>perfusion</b> <b>apparatus</b> attached to the AFM. Separation energy measurements over 10 x 10 -mum areas of the compact surface (n = 4096) exhibited log normal distributions (apparent linear regression, R- 2 {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 97). Significant increases in the median separation energies (p < 0. 05) between the salbutamol sulfate drug probes and salbutamol sulfate model surfaces were observed as humidity was increased. This result is most likely attributed to capillary interactions becoming more dominant at higher humidities. This investigation has shown the AFM to be a powerful technique for quantification of the separation energies between micronized drug particulates, highlighting the potential of the AFM as a rapid preformulation tool...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Cardioplegia is an {{important}} step to facilitate cardiac surgery while limiting intraoperative myocardial injury. Although recent advances in cardioplegic arrest methods have significantly contributed to better postoperative outcomes, there is still controversy regarding the optimal composition and temperature of the cardioplegic solution. Accordingly, we aimed to assess whether cold or lukewarm Sabax cardioplegia offer improved myocardial protection compared with the classical Krebs-Henseleit solution. Methods: The hearts of 40 male Wistar rats were isolated and submitted to constant-flow retrograde perfusion using a Langendorff <b>perfusion</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The hearts were randomly assigned to cold Krebs-Henseleit (K-H), cold Sabax, or lukewarm Sabax cardioplegia. The ECG, heart rates, and left ventricular systolic pressures (LVSP) were recorded pre- and post-cardioplegia. The time needed for cardioplegia induction and post-cardioplegia recovery were also noted. Results: Both cold and lukewarm Sabax cardioplegia insured faster induction and faster recovery following isothermic reperfusion compared to the standard K-H solution (both p< 0. 01). With K-H cardioplegia, the hearts presented a 21. 7 % force loss after reperfusion (p< 0. 001), whilst Sabax cardioplegia was associated with a slight increase in ventricular mechanical activity (3 % LVSP increase with lukewarm Sabax cardioplegia, p< 0. 001 and 2 % LVSP increase with cold Sabax cardioplegia, p = 0. 02). With Sabax cardioplegia the hearts displayed considerably less major arrhythmic events and presented less significant bradycardia. Conclusions: The present data suggest that Sabax cardioplegia may be superior to the classical cold crystalloid K-H solution in preserving mechanical activity of the heart and may provide superior protection against major arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|Background: Creatine kinase is {{a cardiac}} {{biomarker}} {{that is used}} for the assessment of ischemic injuries and myocardial infarction. The present study was designed to evaluate effects of oxytocin administration during ischemia and reperfusion periods on CK-MB levels in the coronary effluent of isolated rat heart and the possible role of oxytocin receptor, nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin and mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channels in this regard. Methods: Male wistar rats (n= 8) were anesthetized with sodium thiopental and their hearts were transferred to a Langendorff <b>perfusion</b> <b>apparatus.</b> All animals were randomly divided into nine groups as follow; in the ischemia-reperfusion group, hearts underwent 30 min of regional ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. In oxytocin group, hearts were perfused with oxytocin 5 min after ischemia induction for 25 min. In other groups, 35 min prior to oxytocin perfusion, atosiban (a non-specific oxytocin receptor blocker), L-NAME (an NO synthase inhibitor), indomethacin (a non-specific cyclooxygenase blocker) and 5 -HD (a specific mKATP channel blocker) were perfused for 10 min. In all groups, we measured CK-MB levels in the coronary effluent at the end of reperfusion. Moreover, coronary flow (mL/min) was measured at baseline, during ischemia period and 60 and 120 min after reperfusion. MB level in oxytocin group as compared to ischemia-reperfusion group. Administration of atosiban, L-NAME, indomethacin and 5 -HD prior to oxytocin perfusion abolished the effects of oxytocin on CK-MB levels. Conclusion: Administration of oxytocin during ischemia and reperfusion periods deceased CK-MB levels but infusion of atosiban, L-NAME, 5 -HD and indomethacin inhibited oxytocin from exerting its effects...|$|R
40|$|Background—Lectins are {{proteins}} {{capable of}} specific binding to carbohydrates without altering their covalent structure. As {{an essential part}} of plants they are ingested in our daily diet. By binding to glycosyl side chains of receptors lectins can mimic or inhibit the action of the ligand. Oral administration of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) in rats dose dependently induces growth of the small intestine and the pancreas by an unknown mechanism.  Aims—To investigate the mechanism of PHA induced intestinal and pancreatic growth.  Methods—Thirty day old male rats were pairfed for 10 days with lactalbumin as a control diet or lactalbumin plus PHA or purified soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) as a positive control (42 mg/rat/day) with or without 20 µg of the cholecystokinin A (CCK-A) antagonist MK 329. To investigate further the effect of PHA on CCK release intestinal mucosal cells were isolated from rats which were continuously perfused in a <b>perfusion</b> <b>apparatus.</b> CCK release into the medium was assayed.  Results—PHA and STI significantly stimulated growth of the pancreas and the small intestine. MK 329 blocked this growth effect in the pancreas but not in the small intestine. In vivo, PHA significantly increased CCK plasma levels from 0. 75 to 6. 67 (SEM 2. 23) compared with 2. 3 (0. 35) pM in the control group. In addition, in vitro PHA dose dependently stimulated CCK release with a maximal effect at 100 ng/ml.  Conclusion—In vivo and in vitro PHA is a potent stimulus for CCK release in the rat, thereby inducing pancreatic growth, whereas intestinal growth is stimulated by a CCK independent mechanism. ...|$|R
