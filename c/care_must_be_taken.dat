5|$|<b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to avoid}} the {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is {{only a third of}} that of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E
50|$|No {{matter the}} quantity, <b>care</b> <b>must</b> always <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to prevent any}} {{electrostatic}} discharge or friction during mixing or handling, as these may cause accidental ignition.|$|R
50|$|The game very {{strongly}} {{encourages people to}} mix with each other, but is rather complex for some players. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to ensure that the}} starting hands are similar in value.|$|R
50|$|Spindle speeds {{are reduced}} {{when working with}} carriers, due to the {{unbalanced}} nature of the setup. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by the operator when using carriers, as {{it is easy to}} get snagged on one.|$|R
5|$|The {{existence}} of the different scales means that <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when comparing large numbers between languages or countries, or when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant scale has changed over time. For example, British English, French, and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale, depending on {{the date of the}} document, since each of the three countries has used both systems at various times in its history. Today, the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale, but France and Italy use the long scale.|$|E
5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when designing the mould.|$|E
50|$|Because {{industrial}} {{hydraulic systems}} operate at hundreds {{to thousands of}} PSI and temperatures reaching hundreds of degrees Celsius, severe injuries and death can result from component failures and <b>care</b> <b>must</b> always <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when performing maintenance on hydraulic systems.|$|R
50|$|Houseplants {{may also}} be used as natural humidifiers, since they {{evaporate}} water into the air through transpiration. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> still <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to prevent bacteria or mold in the soil from growing to excessive levels, or from dispersing into the air.|$|R
50|$|Power band width: Since two-strokes {{are very}} {{dependent}} on wave dynamics, their power bands {{tend to be}} narrow. While struggling to get maximum power, <b>care</b> <b>must</b> always <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to ensure that the}} power profile does not get too sharp and hard to control.|$|R
5|$|<b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> with medications, as {{side effects}} {{may be more}} common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, (Ln,Th)PO4, which usually contains all the rare earths, {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid, but cerium oxide is insoluble in HNO3 and hence precipitates out. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.|$|E
50|$|The {{stability}} of the selected discretisation is generally established numerically rather than analytically as with simple linear problems. Special <b>care</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to ensure that the}} discretisation handles discontinuous solutions gracefully. The Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations both admit shocks, and contact surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Modern canning {{techniques}} now employ coatings {{that may}} produce toxic fumes when burning {{and can cause}} metal fume fever, and <b>care</b> <b>must</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to ensure that cans used for burning are uncoated plain metal. Such coatings are usually used for tomatoes and other acidic foods.|$|R
25|$|Properly curing {{concrete}} leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to avoid freezing or overheating {{due to the}} exothermic setting of cement. Improper curing can cause scaling, reduced strength, poor abrasion resistance and cracking.|$|R

Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter. Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of fractional crystallization of La(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, or by ion-exchange techniques when higher purity is desired.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken,</b> however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
25|$|Studying model {{organism}}s can be informative, but <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when extrapolating from one organism to another.|$|E
50|$|<b>Care</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to {{differentiate}} {{people who do}} not like snakes or fear them for their venom or the inherent danger involved. An ophidiophobe not only fears them when in live contact but also dreads to think about them or even see them in video or still pictures.|$|R
50|$|When a horse uses a feedbag for {{the first}} time, {{offering}} it in a hand-held position, without strapping it on, may allow the horse to become accustomed to it. This can {{reduce the risk of}} the horse panicking. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> also <b>taken</b> to adjust the bag to ensure that the horse can breathe easily.|$|R
50|$|<b>Care</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to count}} the beads before and after using them to ensure they are all removed from the anus. There have been {{instances}} of the string being broken by intense rectal movements. If a bead gets stuck within the rectum and cannot be pushed out naturally, medical intervention may be necessary.|$|R

25|$|<b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to {{make sure}} that the {{integral}} converges. But the mean may be finite even if the function itself tends to infinity at some points.|$|E
25|$|Squares: The cube is {{the only}} convex example. Other {{examples}} (the polycubes) {{can be obtained by}} joining cubes together, although <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> if coplanar faces are to be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{intensity}} of UV radiation emitted by the bulb, eye protection is suggested when using a deuterium bulb. <b>Care</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to avoid touching the bulb directly to avoid burns due to high operating temperatures. Touching the bulb directly even when cool can smudge the casing and therefore reduce output intensity.|$|R
50|$|Heating {{degree days}} are defined {{relative}} to a base temperature—the outside temperature above which a building needs no heating. Base temperatures may be defined for a particular building {{as a function of}} the temperature that the building is heated to, or it may be defined for a country or region for example. In the latter case,building standards or conventions my exist for the temperature threshold, these include:The base temperature does not necessarily correspond to the building mean internal temperature, as standards may consider mean building insulation levels and internal gains to determine an average external temperature at which heating will be required. Base temperatures of 16°C, 18°C, and 19°C (60, 65, 66 °F) are also used. The variation in choice of base temperature implies that HDD values cannot always <b>be</b> compared - <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>take</b> to ensure that only HDDs with equal base temperatures are compared.|$|R
25|$|While {{trazodone}} {{is not a}} true {{member of}} the SSRI class of antidepressants, it does still share many properties of the SSRIs, especially the possibility of discontinuation syndrome if the medication is stopped too quickly. <b>Care</b> <b>must,</b> therefore, <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> when coming off the medication, usually by a gradual process of tapering down the dose {{over a period of}} time.|$|R
25|$|The blossom {{produces}} nectar plentifully, {{and large}} areas {{can be a}} source of honey. Because the bloom attracts a variety of pollinators, <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> in the application of insecticides to avoid label violations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{to guard}} against the {{application}} of external heat sources (such as direct sunlight, heating pads, etc.) which in certain circumstances can trigger the release of too much medication and cause life-threatening complications.|$|E
25|$|Control grid modulation: The {{operating}} bias and gain {{of the final}} RF amplifier can be controlled by varying the voltage of the control grid. This method requires little audio power, but <b>care</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to reduce distortion.|$|E
