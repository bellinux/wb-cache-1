5|$|By early 1570, the Ottoman {{preparations}} and {{the warnings}} {{sent by the}} Venetian bailo at Constantinople, Marco Antonio Barbaro, had convinced the Signoria that war was imminent. Reinforcements and money were sent post-haste to Crete and Cyprus. In March 1570, an Ottoman envoy was sent to Venice, bearing an ultimatum that demanded the immediate <b>cession</b> of Cyprus. Although some voices were raised in the Venetian Signoria advocating the <b>cession</b> of the island in exchange for land in Dalmatia and further trading privileges, the hope of assistance from the other Christian states stiffened the Republic's resolve, and the ultimatum was categorically rejected.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of United States victories, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the two-year war. In return, for US$18,250,000, Mexico gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, ceded the Mexican <b>Cession</b> in 1848, most of which today is called the American Southwest, and Texas's borders were {{established}} at the Rio Grande.|$|E

5|$|After being {{appointed}} {{governor of}} the newly formed Indiana Territory in 1800, William Henry Harrison sought to secure title to Native American lands to open more land for settlers; in particular, he hoped the Indiana Territory would attract enough settlers to qualify for statehood. Harrison negotiated numerous land <b>cession</b> treaties with American Indians, including the Treaty of Fort Wayne on September 30, 1809, in which Miami, Pottawatomie, Lenape, and other tribal leaders sold 3,000,000acres (approximately 12,000km²) to the United States.|$|E
5|$|As Taylor took office, Congress faced {{a battery}} of {{questions}} related to the Mexican <b>Cession,</b> acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly angry about the aid that northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican <b>Cession,</b> and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise. As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.|$|E

5|$|Edwards won an {{unlikely}} 1826 election to become Governor of Illinois. Conflict with the legislature over state bank regulations marked Edwards' administration, {{as did the}} pursuit of Indian removal. As governor or territorial governor he twice sent Illinois militia against Native Americans, in the War of 1812 and the Winnebago War, and signed treaties for the <b>cession</b> of Native American land. Edwards returned to private life when his term ended in 1830 and died of cholera two years later.|$|E

On 11 January 1918, she was declared obsolete, but was retained as a training boat at the submarine base on Brioni. U-2 was at Pola at the war's end, and was scrapped after her <b>cession</b> to Italy as a war reparation in 1920. U-2 did not sink any ships during the war.|$|E

5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the <b>cession</b> the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the <b>cession</b> was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
5|$|Lacking the {{resources}} to rebuild Sarawak after the war, Charles Vyner Brooke decided to cede Sarawak as British Crown Colony and a <b>Cession</b> Bill was put forth in the Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly), which was debated for three days. The bill was passed on 17 May 1946 with a narrow majority (19 versus 16 votes). This caused hundreds of Malay civil servants to resign in protest, sparking an anti-cession movement and {{the assassination of the}} second colonial governor of Sarawak Sir Duncan Stewart. Despite the resistance, Sarawak became a British Crown colony on 1 July 1946. Anthony Brooke opposed the <b>cession</b> of Sarawak to the British Crown, for which he was banished from Sarawak by the colonial government. He was only allowed to return 17 years later after Sarawak had become part of Malaysia. In 1950 all anti-cession movements in Sarawak ceased after a clamp-down by the colonial government.|$|E

5|$|Through 26 {{separate}} {{treaties with}} the United States federal government, Native American tribes in Nebraska gradually ceded the lands currently comprising the state. The treaty and <b>cession</b> involving the Omaha area occurred in 1854 when the Omaha Tribe ceded most of east-central Nebraska.

5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican <b>Cession</b> dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5000|$|In the end, {{most of the}} trans-Appalachian {{land claims}} were ceded to the Federal {{government}} between 1781 and 1787; New York, New Hampshire, and the hitherto unrecognized Vermont government resolved their squabbles by 1791, and Kentucky was separated from Virginia and made into a new state in 1792. The <b>cessions</b> were not entirely selfless—in some cases the <b>cessions</b> were made in exchange for federal assumption of the states' Revolutionary War debts—but the states' reasonably graceful <b>cessions</b> of their often-conflicting claims prevented early, perhaps catastrophic, rifts among {{the states of the}} young Republic, and assuaged the fears of the [...] "landless" [...] states enough to convince them to ratify the new United States Constitution. The <b>cessions</b> also {{set the stage for the}} settlement of the Upper Midwest and the expansion of the U.S. into the center of the North American continent, and also established the pattern by which land newly acquired by the United States would be organized into new states rather than attached to old ones.|$|R
5|$|California {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by numerous Native American peoples since antiquity. The Spanish, the Russians, and other Europeans began exploring and colonizing {{the area in}} the 16th and 17th centuries, with the Spanish establishing its first California mission at what is now San Diego in 1769. After the Mexican <b>Cession</b> of 1848, the California Gold Rush brought worldwide attention to the area. The growth of the movie industry in Los Angeles and Hollywood, high tech in Silicon Valley, tourism, agriculture, and other areas in the ensuing decades fueled the creation of a $1.85 trillion economy, the ninth-largest in the world.|$|E

By the first partition the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211,000km² (30% of its territory, amounting {{at that time to}} about 733,000km²), with a population of over four to five million people (about a third of its population of 14 million before the partitions). The treaty was a major success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share might have been the smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. Russia received the largest, but economically least-important area, in the northeast.|$|E
