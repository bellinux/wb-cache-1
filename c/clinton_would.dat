5|$|Scott's {{recruiting}} {{difficulties in}} Virginia continued, despite {{the implementation of}} a draft by the state legislature. Finally, in October 1779, he forwarded troops sent to him from Washington's Northern Army on to Lincoln in South Carolina, fulfilling his quota. He retained only Abraham Buford's regiment with him in Virginia. In February 1780, about 750 men sent by Washington under William Woodford arrived at Scott's camp in Petersburg, Virginia. Virginia authorities, fearing that the British force to the south under General Henry <b>Clinton</b> <b>would</b> turn north to Virginia, detained Scott and Woodford until it was clear that Clinton's object was Lincoln's position at Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Without a Saxbe fix, <b>Clinton</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} ineligible {{to serve in}} the Cabinet until the {{conclusion}} of the 112th United States Congress in January 2013, near the end of Obama's elected term. The Senate passed Saxbe-fix legislation on December 10, 2008, acting by unanimous consent to reduce the Secretary of State's salary back to its January 1, 2007 level of $186,000, taking effect at 12:00 noon on January 20, 2009. President George W. Bush signed the resolution into law on December 19, cancelling all emolument increases made or to be made during Clinton's Senate term between noon of January 3, 2007, and noon of January 3, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that <b>Clinton</b> <b>would</b> enter the Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined {{to run and}} Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E

Although Clinton remained behind in delegates, the press soon ran cover stories about Obama's apparent trouble connecting with less educated whites and Catholics.|$|E

According to Richey, congressional Republicans knew that <b>Clinton</b> <b>would</b> sign the welfare-reform measure; so they {{attached}} a bill to create an abstinence-only education program and authorized its funding with $250 million over five years. The Louisiana program was a national model acclaimed by Focus on the Family and other pro-family organizations.

25|$|Carter's 1976 electoral {{sweep of}} all {{the states of the}} former Confederacy except Virginia (which he {{narrowly}} lost to Gerald Ford) was the first time a Democrat (excluding the third-party campaigns of George Wallace and Harry Byrd) had swept the South since 1956, and would never be repeated.

25|$|Perot's {{campaign}} took 18.9% of the vote, finishing {{second in}} Maine and Utah. This was noted {{for being the}} highest vote share of a third-party candidate since 1912, {{though he did not}} obtain any electoral votes. This is also the earliest presidential election where all four major party presidential and vice presidential candidates are still living, the most recent when both Georgia and Montana would vote Democratic, and the last time the state of Florida backed the losing candidate. Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>would</b> also become the first Democrat to win an election without carrying Texas, and was also the first time since 1968 when it did not vote for the winning candidate.|$|E
25|$|Clinton's {{election}} ended an era {{in which}} the Republican Party had controlled the White House for 12 consecutive years, and for 20 of the previous 24 years. The election also brought the Democrats full control of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government, including both houses of U.S. Congress and the presidency, {{for the first time since}} the administration of the last Democratic president, Jimmy Carter. This would not last for very long, however, as the Republicans won control of both the House and Senate in 1994. Reelected in 1996, <b>Clinton</b> <b>would</b> become the first Democratic President since Franklin D. Roosevelt to serve two full terms in the White House.|$|E

25|$|The {{agreement}} {{came under}} heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA {{resulted in a}} loss of American jobs. NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding {{a situation in which the}} president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change. While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President <b>Clinton</b> <b>would</b> go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993. NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth.|$|E
25|$|On September 24, 2008, {{after the}} onset of the 2008 global {{financial}} crisis, McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington so he could help craft a $700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry, and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill. Despite this decision, McCain was portrayed as somebody not playing {{a significant role in the}} negotiations for the first version of the bill, which fell short of passage in the House. He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September 26, despite Congress' lack of immediate action on the bill. His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy. Days later, a second version of the original bailout bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with Obama, his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden, and McCain all voting for the measure (Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>would</b> as well).|$|E
