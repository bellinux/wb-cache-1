The Standard model includes 12 fermions (matter elementary particles with spin 1 / 2) which are divided in three generations, groups with same interactions but different masses. Each generation can be classified into two leptons (with electric charges Q=- 1, electron-like and Q= 0, neutrino) and two quarks (with electric charges Q=- 1 / 3, down-type and Q= 2 / 3, up-type). However, {{the understanding of the}} relationship between generations and ratio of masses of different generations are unknown.

It is in pretty good agreement with experimental data. Assuming that the same relation valid for Q= 0, we are able to calculate neutrino masses.

We may, however, feel assured that the relation which we have observed to exist between the variations of A and a, will hold true in all cases which fall between the same extreme limits; that is, wherever the utmost increase or diminution in which the result has been found by observation to coincide with the law, is not exceeded.|$|E

If, in {{the second}} place, the property, in the {{instances}} {{in which it has}} been observed, is not an effect of causation, it is a property of Kind; and in that case the generalization can only be set aside by the discovery of a new Kind of crow. That, however, a peculiar Kind not hitherto discovered should exist in nature, is a supposition so often realized that it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> at all improbable. We have nothing to authorize us in attempting to limit the Kinds of things which exist in nature. The only unlikelihood would be that a new Kind should be discovered in localities which there was previously reason to believe had been thoroughly explored; and even this improbability depends on the degree of conspicuousness of the difference between the newly-discovered Kind and all others, since new kinds of minerals, plants, and even animals, previously overlooked or confounded with known species, are still continually detected in the most frequented situations. On this second ground, therefore, {{as well as on the}} first, the observed uniformity of co-existence can only hold good as an empirical law, within the limits not only of actual observation, but of an observation as accurate as the nature of the case required. And hence it is that (as remarked in an early chapter of the present book) we so often give up generalizations of this class at the first summons. If any credible witness stated that he had seen a white crow, under circumstances which made it not incredible that it should have escaped notice previously, we should give full credence to the statement.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether the water chemistry in lake Lillsjön have changed significantly due to human impact of surrounding areas. Lake Lillsjön is located outside the central parts of Östersund. It is an important recrational area, and has great natural values, among other things it is habitat for several species of Chara stoneworts. Chara requires clear calcareous water, high pH, relatively low levels of nitrate-nitrogen and low phosphorus concentrations. Lake Lillsjöns is recepient for surface water from a nearby commercial and industrial area, as well as melt water from an adjecent snow dump. Compared to ten other Chara-lakes in the region, lake Lillsjön shows higher concentration of total phosphorus and higher water colour. The study concludes that the surface water from surrounding areas, as well as melting water from the snow dump, are the main sources of the higher concentration of total phosphorus in lake Lillsjön. While the colour of the incoming water only shows a weak difference compared to the water colour of the reference lakes, the source of the higher water colour cannot be established. The water of lake Lillsjön <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>consider</b> a suitable habitat for Chara. ...|$|R

60|$|As soon as {{the escape}} of Hannibal was made known at Carthage, {{the people of the}} city {{immediately}} began to fear that the Romans would consider them responsible for it, and that they should thus incur a renewal of Roman hostility. In order to avert this danger, they immediately sent a deputation to Rome, to make known the fact of Hannibal's flight, and to express the regret they felt on account of it, in hopes thus to save themselves from the displeasure of their formidable foes. It may at first view seem very ungenerous and ungrateful in the Carthaginians to abandon their general in this manner, in the hour of his misfortune and calamity, and to take part against him with enemies whose displeasure he had incurred only in their service and in executing their will. And this conduct of the Carthaginians would have to be considered as not only ungenerous, but extremely inconsistent, if it had been the same individuals that acted in the two cases. But it was not. The men and the influences which now opposed Hannibal's projects and plans had opposed them always and from the beginning; only, so long as he went on successfully and well, they were in the minority, and Hannibal's adherents and friends controlled all the public action of the city. But, now that the bitter fruits of his ambition and of his totally unjustifiable encroachments on the Roman territories and Roman rights began to be realized, the party of his friends was overturned, the power reverted to the hands of those who had always opposed him, and in trying to keep him down when he was once fallen, their action, whether politically right or wrong, was consistent with itself, and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> as at all subjecting them to the charge of ingratitude or treachery.|$|E
