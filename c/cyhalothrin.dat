40|$|Context: Lamda <b>cyhalothrin</b> and neem seed extract {{can protect}} {{chickpea}} by controlling pod borer Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). Objective: To {{find out the}} effect of neem seed extract and lambda-cyhalothrin application schedule for the effective and economic management of pod borer attacking chickpea. Materials and Methods: The experiments were conducted in High Barind Tract of northern Bangladesh with the application of neem seed extract @ 50 g-l (two and three spraying) and lambda-cyhalothrin. (Karate 2. 5 EC) @ 2 ml-l (two and three spraying) and untreated control. The seeds of BARI-Chola 5 chickpea were sown in rows with the spacing of 40 cm. At maturity, all the pods were collected from 10 randomly selected plants from middle rows of each plot. The damaged (bored) and total numbers of pod were counted. The grain yield loss (kg-ha) and percent pod damage were determined. The seed yield of each treatment was converted to kg-ha. Results: The lowest pod damage (2. 55 %) as well as grain yield loss (34. 90 kg-ha) were observed in the treatment where lamda <b>cyhalothrin</b> applied three times at 7 days interval from flowering stage.

In a field test, full, half, and quarter rate insecticide mixtures of profenofos and <b>cyhalothrin</b> were compared with full and half rates of each insecticide alone. Toxicity data were obtained with susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant first and third instar tobacco budworm larvae. Field data demonstrated that half rate mixtures of profenofos and <b>cyhalothrin</b> provided approximately equal control to full rates of each compound separately with susceptible larvae. With pyrethroid-resistant larvae, the half rate mix worked as well as the full rate of profenofos and much better than the full rate of <b>cyhalothrin.</b> Overall, the half rate mixture of each insecticide worked better on susceptible larvae than on resistant larvae. Cotoxicity values obtained from laboratory bioassays with each insecticide alone and in combination indicate that profenofos and <b>cyhalothrin</b> are acting independently in the mixture with first instars and antagonistically in the mixture with third instars. The data suggest that mixtures of profenofos and <b>cyhalothrin</b> at reduced rates will achieve control comparable to full rates of either insecticide alone.

The developed methodology was applied to commercial insecticides and human breast milk samples. Some potential selective bioaccumulation for <b>cyhalothrin,</b> cyperpermethrin and tetramethrin was described in humansThis work has been supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the project Consolider-Ingenio (2010 CSD 2009 - 00065).

40|$|A {{randomized}} block {{experiment was}} conducted in cabbage fields at Texas Agriculture Experiment Station at Weslaco {{in the spring and}} fall 2005 and spring 2006. There were four blocks and two pesticide treatments, spinosad (SpinTor?), lambda- <b>cyhalothrin</b> (Warrior?), and an untreated control. The pesticide treatments were for the management of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) and Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Pitfall traps captured eight families of spiders in fall 2005, and thirteen families in spring 2006. The most abundant family was Lycosidae with Pardosa delicatula (Gertsch and Wallace) followed by Pardosa pauxilla (Montgomery) and Hogna helluo (Walckenaer) in fall 2005, while in spring 2006 Hogna helluo was most abundant followed by Pardosa delicatula and Pardosa pauxilla. The diversity of spiders in fall 2006 in the lambda-cyhalothrin plots was lower than that of spiders found in the untreated control or the spinosad treated plots, which were up to 2. 6 and 2. 4 times, respectively, more diverse. In spring 2006, the spiders in untreated control and spinosad treated plots were 1. 5 and 1. 3 times respectively more diverse than spiders in the lambda-cyhalothrin treated plots. In fall 2005, mean diversity of spiders in spinosad treated plots was 1. 1 times more diverse than in the untreated control, although this difference was not statistically significant. In spring 2006, spinosad treated plots had 1. 2 times greater diversity than untreated control and this difference was significant. The effects of two insecticide treatments on height, width, and weight of cabbages were highly significant in all three seasons. Cabbage harvest in spinosad and lambda- <b>cyhalothrin</b> plots showed greater height, width, and weight than in untreated control but were not different from each other. However, in the larval damage rating, spinosad treatment showed better management of diamondback moth and cabbage looper than lambda- <b>cyhalothrin...</b>|$|E
40|$|This section method (SM) {{documents}} {{a selective}} pyrethroid analysis in sediment water and {{is followed by}} all authorized EMON personnel. This method uses the triple quadrupole to improve sensitivity and enables the lowering of the reporting limit over the previous method which used the ECD and MSD. 2. Principle: The SM describes the method for determination of resmethrin, bifenthrin, fenpropathrin, lambda <b>cyhalothrin</b> epimer, lambda <b>cyhalothrin,</b> permethin cis, permethrin trans, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate / esfenvalerate and deltamethrin in sediment water. The pyrethroids are extracted from the sediment water using liquid-liquid extraction with hexane. The extracts are concentrated and then cleaned up with florisil before being analyzed with a gas chromatography equipped with triple quadrupole detector. The reporting limit is 10 ppt for resmethrin, 2 ppt for bifenthrin and 5 ppt for {{all the rest of}} the compounds. 3. Safety: 3. 1 All general laboratory safety rules for sample preparation and analysis shall be followed. 3. 2 Hexane is a flammable and toxic solvent; it should be handled with care in a ventilated area. 4.

40|$|Milk {{of cattle}} was {{collected}} from various localities of Faisalabad, Pakistan. Pesticides concentration {{was determined by}} HPLC using solid phase microextraction. The residue analysis revealed that about 40 % milk samples were contaminated with pesticides. The mean±SE levels (ppm) of <b>cyhalothrin,</b> endosulfan, chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were 0. 38 ± 0. 02, 0. 26 ± 0. 02, 0. 072 ± 0. 01 and 0. 085 ± 0. 02, respectively. Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models were used to predict the residues of unknown pesticides in the milk of cattle using their known physicochemical properties such as molecular weight (MW), melting point (MP), and log octanol to water partition coefficient (Ko/w) {{as well as the}} milk characteristics such as pH, % fat, and specific gravity (SG) in this species. The analysis revealed good correlation coefficients (R 2 = 0. 91) for cattle QSAR model. The coefficient for Ko/w for the studied pesticides was higher in cattle milk. Risk analysis was conducted based upon the determined pesticide residues and their provisional tolerable daily intakes. The daily intake levels of pesticide residues including <b>cyhalothrin,</b> chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin in present study were 3, 11, 2. 5 times higher, respectively in cattle milk.

40|$|Indoor {{residual}} {{insecticide spraying}} (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) {{are commonly used}} together even though evidence that such combinations confer greater protection against malaria than either method alone is inconsistent. A deterministic model of mosquito life cycle processes was adapted to allow parameterization with results from experimental hut trials of various combinations of untreated nets or LLINs (Olyset, PermaNet 2. 0, Icon Life nets) with IRS (pirimiphos methyl, lambda <b>cyhalothrin,</b> DDT), in a setting where vector populations are dominated by Anopheles arabiensis, so that community level impact upon malaria transmission at high coverage could be predicted. Intact untreated nets alone provide equivalent personal protection to all three LLINs. Relative to IRS plus untreated nets, community level protection is slightly higher when Olyset or PermaNet 2. 0 nets are added onto IRS with pirimiphos methyl or lambda <b>cyhalothrin</b> but not DDT, and when Icon Life nets supplement any of the IRS insecticides. Adding IRS onto any net modestly enhances communal protection when pirimiphos methyl is sprayed, while spraying lambda <b>cyhalothrin</b> enhances protection for untreated nets but not LLINs. Addition of DDT reduces communal protection when added to LLINs. Where transmission is mediated primarily by An. arabiensis, adding IRS to high LLIN coverage provides only modest incremental benefit (e. g. when an organophosphate like pirimiphos methyl is used), but can be redundant (e. g. when a pyrethroid like lambda cyhalothin is used) or even regressive (e. g. when DDT {{is used for the}} IRS). Relative to IRS plus untreated nets, supplementing IRS with LLINs will only modestly improve community protection. Beyond the physical protection that intact nets provide, additional protection against transmission by An. arabiensis conferred by insecticides will be remarkably small, regardless of whether they are delivered as LLINs or IRS. The insecticidal action of LLINs and IRS probably already approaches their absolute limit of potential impact upon this persistent vector so personal protection of nets should be enhanced by improving the physical integrity and durability. Combining LLINs and non-pyrethroid IRS in residual transmission systems may nevertheless be justified as a means to manage insecticide resistance and prevent potential rebound of not only An. arabiensis, but also more potent, vulnerable and historically important species such as Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus...|$|E
