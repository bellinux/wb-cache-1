The leaks may lead to loss of pressure/propellant, increased risk of explosion and possible <b>cryo-pumping</b> into air pockets within the laminate. Ultrasonic techniques have been shown capable of detecting the presence of microcracking and in this work {{they are used to}} quantify the level of microcracking. Resonance ultrasound methods are utilized with artificial neural networks to build a microcrack prediction/measurement tool. Two networks are presented, one unsupervised to provide a qualitative measure of microcracking and one supervised which provides a quantitative assessment of the level of microcracking. The resonant ultrasound spectroscopic method is made sensitive to microcracking by tuning the input spectrum to the higher frequency (shorter wavelength) components allowing more significant interaction with the defects. This interaction causes the spectral characteristics to shift toward lower amplitudes at the higher frequencies. As the density of the defects increases more interactions occur and more drastic amplitude changes are observed. Preliminary experiments to quantify the level of microcracking induced in graphite/epoxy composite samples through a combination of tensile loading and cryogenic temperatures are presented.

The process design, system analysis, specification development, and commissioning oversight were performed by the cryogenics department at Jefferson Lab, while the contracts and system installation was performed by the ESC group at JSC. Commissioning data indicate an inverse coefficient of performance better than 70 W/W for a 18 kW load at 20 K (accounting for liquid nitrogen pre-cooling power) that remains essentially constant down to one third of this load. Even at 10 percent of the maximum capacity, the performance is better than 150 W/W at 20 K. The refrigerator exceeded all design goals and demonstrated the ability to support a wide load range from 10 kW at 15 K to 100 kW at 100 K.

40|$|RF {{electron}} guns with {{a strained}} super lattice GaAs cathode can generate polarized electron beam of higher brightness and lower emittance than do DC guns, {{due to their}} higher field gradient at the cathode's surface. In a normal conducting RF gun, the extremely high vaccum required by these cathodes can not be met. We report on an experiment with a superconducting SRF gun, which can maintain a vacuum of nearly 10 - 12 torr because of <b>cryo-pumping</b> at the temperature of 4. 2 K. With conventional activation, we obtained a QE of 3 % at 532 nm, with lifetime of nearly 3 days in the preparation chamber. We plan to use this cathode in a 1. 3 GHz 1 / 2 cell SRF gun to study its performance. In addition, we studied the multipacting {{at the location of}} cathode. A new model based on the Forkker-Planck equation which can estimate the bunch length of the electron beam is discussed in this paper. Future particle accelerators such as eRHIC and ILC require high brightness, high current polarized electrons Recently, using a superlattice crystal, the maximum polarization of 95 % was reached. Activation with Cs,O lowers the electron affinity and makes it energetically possible for all the electrons excited in to the conduction band and reach the surface to escape into the vacuum. Presently the polarized electron sources are based on DC gun, such as that at the CEBAF at Jlab. In these devices, the life time of the cathode is extended due to the reduced back bombardment in their UHV conditions. However, the low accelerating gradient of the DC guns lead to poor longitudinal emittance. The higher accelerating gradient of the RF gun generates low emittance beams. Superconducting RF guns combine the excellent vacuum conditions of the DC guns with the higher accelerating gradients of the RF guns and provide potentially a long lived cathode with very low transverse and longitudinal emittance. In our work at BNL, we successfully activated the GaAs. The quantum efficient is 3 % at 532 nm and is expected to improve further. In addition, we studied the multipacting at the location of cathode.

40|$|RF {{electron}} guns with {{a strained}} superlattice GaAs cathode {{are expected to}} generate polarized electron beams of higher brightness and lower emittance than do DC guns, due to their higher field gradient at the cathode's surface and lower cathode temperature. We plan to install a bulk GaAs:Cs in a SRF gun to evaluate the performance of both the gun and the cathode in this environment. The status of this project is: In our 1. 3 GHz 1 / 2 cell SRF gun, the vacuum can be maintained at nearly 10 {sup - 12 } Torr because of <b>cryo-pumping</b> at 2 K. With conventional activation of bulk GaAs, we obtained a QE of 10 % at 532 nm, with lifetime of more than 3 days in the preparation chamber and have shown that it can survive in transport from the preparation chamber to the gun. The beam line has been assembled and we are exploring the best conditions for baking the cathode under vacuum. We report here the progress of our test of the GaAs cathode in the SRF gun. Future particle accelerators, such as eRHIC and the ILC require high-brightness, high-current polarized electrons. Strained superlattice GaAs:Cs {{has been shown to}} be an efficient cathode for producing polarized electrons. Activation of GaAs with Cs,O(F) lowers the electron affinity and makes it energetically possible for all the electrons, excited into the conduction band that drift or diffuse to the emission surface, to escape into the vacuum. Presently, all operating polarized electron sources, such as the CEBAF, are DC guns. In these devices, the excellent ultra-high vacuum extends the lifetime of the cathode. However, the low field gradient on the photocathode's emission surface of the DC guns limits the beam quality. The higher accelerating gradients, possible in the RF guns, generate a far better beam. Until recently, most RF guns operated at room temperature, limiting the vacuum to {approx} 10 {sup - 9 } Torr. This destroys the GaAs's NEA surface. The SRF guns combine the excellent vacuum conditions of DC guns and the high accelerating gradient of the RF guns, potentially offering a long lived cathode with very low emittance. Testing this concept requires preparation of the cathode, transportation to the SRF gun and evaluation of the performance of the cathode and the gun at cryogenic temperatures. In our work at BNL, we successfully activated the bulk GaAs in the preparation chamber. The highest quantum efficient was 10 % at 532 nm that fell to 0. 5 % after 100 hours. We explored three different ways to activate the GaAs. We verified that the GaAs photocathode remains stable for 30 hours in a 10 {sup - 11 } Torr vacuum. Passing the photocathode through the low 10 {sup - 9 } Torr transfer section in several seconds caused the QE to drop to 0. 8 %. The photocathode with 0. 8 % QE can be tested for the SRF gun. The gun and beam pipe were prepared and assembled. After baking at 200 C baking, the vacuum of the gun and beam pipe can sustain a low 10 {sup - 11 } Torr at room temperature. The final test to extract electrons from the gun is ongoing.

In the typical fusion reactor, tritium and deuterium are fuel elements for fusion reaction, and they exist in condensed state around the <b>cryo-pump</b> in the normal operation condition. In the accident situation, increasing heat transfer system temperature can mobilize lots of tritium in the vacuum vessel. And then, coolant can react with high-temperature structures generating hydrogen gas inside vacuum vessel.

These telescopes may contain <b>cryo-pumps</b> and servos that introduce additional vibrations. A better solution is required. In our paper, we analyze the feasibility of utilizing solar radiation pressure (SRP) and radiometric force to achieve precise attitude control. Our studies show radiometric actuators {{to be a viable}} method to achieve precise pointing. The device uses 8 thin vanes of different temperatures placed in a near-vacuum chamber.

Results of the target material activation were additionally used to estimate the levels of contamination within the NIF target chamber and the workplace controls necessary for safe operation. The analysis examined the impact of using Be-Cu and Ge-doped CH capsules on the external dose received by workers during maintenance activities. Five days following a 20 MJ shot, dose rates inside the Target Chamber (TC) due to the two proposed capsule materials are small ({approx} 1 {micro}rem/h). Gold and depleted-uranium (DU) are considered as potential hohlraum materials. Following a shot, gold will most probably get deposited on the TC first wall. On the other hand, while noble-gas precursors from the DU are expected to stay in the TC, most of the noble gases are pumped out of the chamber and end up on the cryopumps.

When engineers build a first-of-its-kind instrument like the JWST, they often must make new tools to construct the new technology. Throughout the decades of planning, development, and construction of the JWST, NASA has worked with numerous partners to spur innovations that have enabled the telescope s creation. Though the JWST s launch date is still several years away, a number of these innovations are spinning off to provide benefits here on Earth. One of these spinoffs has emerged from the extensive testing the JWST must undergo to ensure it will function in the extreme environment of space. In order to test the JWST instruments in conditions that closely resemble those in space, NASA uses a cryogenic vacuum chamber. By dropping the temperatures down to - 400 F and employing powerful pumps to remove air from the chamber, engineers can test whether the JWST instruments will function once the spacecraft leaves Earth. Traditionally, a phase-shifting interferometer is used to measure optics like the JWST s mirrors to verify their precise shape, down to tens of nanometers, during manufacturing. However, the large size of the mirrors, coupled with vibration induced by the <b>cryo-pumps,</b> prohibits the use of traditional phase-shifting interferometers to measure the mirrors within the chamber environment. Because the JWST will be located in deep space, far from any possible manned service mission, it was essential to find a robust solution to guarantee the performance of the mirrors...|$|R
40|$|The {{refrigeration}} {{system for the}} W 7 -X superconducting magnet and the divertor cryo-vacuum pumps is presented. In total, five main helium cooling circuits have to be supplied by the refrigerator—four for the magnet including auxiliary equipment like support structure, thermal shield and current leads, {{and one for the}} <b>cryo-pumps.</b> For the shields of the latter, an additional LN₂—cooling circuit is required. The lowest operating temperature is 3. 3 K. It will be provided by evacuating a sub-cooler bath using a cold or warm compressor. Three of the helium cooling circuits use altogether four identical cold circulators. Apart from the current leads which are supplied with the coolant from a LHe storage tank, the peak reserve power required is equal to 7 kW at 4. 5 K entropy equivalent. However, this potential maximal demand occurs continuously for periods of only a few hours at most, and altogether for less than 1 % of annual time. The refrigerator thus will be designed for 5 kW continuous power at 4. 5 K equiv. corresponding to 1. 5 MW compressor connected rating. The reserve peak power will be covered, if necessary, by using the latent heat and vapour enthalpy of LHe from a storage tank. This supporting LHe stream is added to the phase separator and fed subsequently to the low pressure return stream at the cold end of the cold box. LN 2 -pre-cooling equipment of the cold box—which is installed for W 7 -X cool-down anyway—can also be used to increase refrigeration power. The LHe required for maintaining reserve refrigeration power as well as for running the current leads is generally produced overnight when W 7 -X is in idle current mode...|$|R
40|$|Vanadium Oxide {{clusters}} in a supported form or {{as part of}} {{a multiple}} phase system have recently become significant as catalytic active components in many selective oxidation reactions. The research on catalysts, which mainly contain VxOy as active components and which are applied in the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons concentrates on the systems Vanadium Titanium Oxide 1 and Vanadyle Pyrophosphate 2. Therefore, VxOy clusters can serve as 2 -dimensional model catalysts. The inert gas aggregation technique 3 was used, which allowed the preparation of metal clusters under clean conditions. V 2 O 5 was evaporated by direct heating of an open crucible into an Argon atmosphere of about 1 mbar partial pressure, which was cooled down by liquid Nitrogen in order to obtain a supersaturation for the creation of nuclei and for further cluster growth. The prepared clusters were deposited on amorphous carbon films after the Argon gas had been pumped off by means of a Helium cooled <b>cryo-pump.</b> By using a Gatan transfer holder, the samples were transferred under Nitrogen into the electron microscope (Philips CM 200 FEG) for structural characterisation. In order to study the type of the chemical binding, electron energy loss (EELS) was performed. The main results can be summarised as follows: depending on the temperature of the substrate during the cluster deposition, partly crystalline particles could be observed, but also samples without atomic resolution. The clusters presented here with atomic resolution were not stable under the electron beam. Originally crystalline particles changed to amorphous structures. Therefore, low dose experiments were performed. However, structural characterisation turned out to be extremely difficult. By using the EELS-technique it could be shown that the originally as V 2 O 5 evaporated material showed spectra different from the evaporated material. It could be shown that reduction occurred and the final structure was between V 2 O 5 and VO. After larger irradiation times only VO was observed. It is not clear whether a reduction took place already prior to the deposition or due to the interaction with the electrons or also during the evaporation process. Furthermore, it could be observed that under the electron beam changes in the EELS-spectra occurred. Pure Vanadium was also evaporated which caused the nucleation of crystalline Vanadium clusters, which were later, after structural characterisation, oxidised. Typical examples of such particles are shown in the figures a-c together with the power spectra. Fig. a shows a Vanadium cluster of about 3 nm diameter with bcc structure in the [001] orientation. In fig. b also a Vanadium cluster is shown. The diameter is about 4 nm and the structure is bcc in the [110] orientation. Also amorphous parts are visible. Fig. c represents a particle after oxidation in air. The oxidation state is that of VO. The structure is cubic of NaCl-type and the orientation is [110]. The small deviations of the lattice parameters and the lattice angles from the bulk data are typical for distortions present in small nanoparticles. References 1.
