40|$|A project {{undertaken}} by the University of Padua has developed the new database system TESS for mosaics. This database system meets the national standards required by the Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo e la Documentazione – ICCD. The database is available on-line thanks to the project «Cultural heritage in the Adriatic area: knowledge, preservation and enhancement», <b>co-financed</b> by the <b>Community</b> <b>Initiative</b> INTERREG III A – Adriatic Cross Border Programme. In detail, the database TESS includes informative files regarding Building and Rooms, Location, relevant Bibliography and Mosaic Pavement. Each file contains plans, designs and photographs. Furthermore, all the fields {{have a list of}} univocal and exhaustive terms in the Italian language. The mosaics database aims to provide a key working tool for the identification of the origins of iconographic themes, their geographic distribution and the development of local fashions which vary according to the context. The software was developed on a FileMaker client/server environment to achieve these key goals: multiplatform availability (Windows/Macintosh), multiuser capability and remote connectivity. Making wide use of the latest tools included in FileMaker 8, the development group created a smart and complete GUI to access the complex data structure, {{and at the same time}} implemented a stringent control of user privileges by setting data-related group policies. The result is a powerful middleware application that allows data entry, analysis and publication to geographically distributed operators and will provide data consultation to other users through normal web browsers...|$|R

We {{provide an overview of}} the growing body of research on this aspect of family time, describe the difference between a citizen model and program models for working with families, give two examples of <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> initiated by family professionals, describe next steps for evaluating this community organizing model, and offer implications for family professionals. Key Words: <b>community,</b> <b>community</b> <b>initiatives,</b> evaluation, family time, overscheduled children. <b>Community</b> <b>initiatives</b> and <b>community</b> organizing have their roots in the late 19 th century settlement house movement (Trolander, 1987) and the early 20 th century community organizing strategies used to improve the physical environments of neighbor-hoods and the living conditions of citizens (Alinsky, 1969).
