Data analysis estimates of internal consistency were moderate, and estimates of rela-tionships with external validity criteria, namely, academic achievement, aspirations, and year in school, moderately supported the validity of each subscale. Results indicate some support for the use of each subscale with high-ability <b>college</b> <b>students.</b> Putting the Research to Use: Academic self-concept is a construct that likely affects multiple other academic areas, including academic achievement, educational aspirations, career aspirations, and retention. Among high-ability <b>college</b> <b>students,</b> academic self-concept may be related to participation in an honors program and living in an honors residence hall, which may further the academic, social, and emotional collegiate experience. Having a psychometrically sound measure of academic self-concept that is appropriate for use with high-ability <b>college</b> <b>students</b> will enable researchers to effectively study the academic self-concepts of high-ability <b>college</b> <b>students.</b> Traditional measures of academic self-concept are often validated on younger samples of high-ability students, but the research is lacking on validity research related to samples of <b>college</b> <b>students...</b>|$|R
