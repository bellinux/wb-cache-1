50|$|In {{addition}} to aircraft {{specifically designed to}} meet the LSA requirements, certain <b>certificated</b> <b>aircraft,</b> such as the original Piper Cub, happen to fall within the definition of a light-sport aircraft and can be operated by individuals holding FAA sport pilot certificates. The aircraft can not be re-certificated as LSA, however: although sport pilots may operate conventionally <b>certificated</b> <b>aircraft</b> that fall within the definition of an LSA, the aircraft themselves continue to be certificated in their original categories.|$|E

50|$|Garmin has a {{dedicated}} division for aviation products, such as integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar {{and other related}} avionics. For example, the G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft. The G900X {{is similar to the}} G1000 but designed for use in experimental aircraft, and the G600 is a retrofit solution for several <b>certificated</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem {{that will only}} affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element. [...] A heated pitot tube is required in all <b>aircraft</b> <b>certificated</b> for instrument flight except <b>aircraft</b> <b>certificated</b> as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|R
5000|$|A Designated Airworthiness Representative (DAR) is {{a private}} person {{designated}} by the United States Federal Aviation Administration to act on its behalf in the certification of type <b>certificated</b> and amateur-built <b>aircraft</b> for the issuance of airworthiness certificates, special flight permits, import aircraft, export certificates for products and articles, conformity inspections and field approvals for repair and alterations. Most DARs have limited and/or certain [...] "functions" [...] authorized by the FAA based on their experience and technical background. A DAR [...] may charge a fee {{for his or her}} services.|$|R

50|$|It is {{generally}} illegal in the United States to install replacement or modification parts on a <b>certificated</b> <b>aircraft</b> without an airworthiness release {{such as a}} Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) or Parts Manufacturing Approval (PMA). There {{are a number of}} other methods of compliance, including parts manufactured to government or industry standards, parts manufactured under technical standard order authorization TSO, owner-/operator-produced parts, experimental aircraft, field approvals, etc.|$|E

50|$|For safety, all <b>certificated,</b> {{single-engine}} fixed-wing <b>aircraft,</b> including <b>certificated</b> gliders, {{must meet}} specified criteria regarding stall and spin behavior. Complying designs typically have a wing with greater {{angle of attack}} at the wing root than at the wing tip, so that the wing root stalls first, reducing {{the severity of the}} wing drop at the stall and possibly also allowing the ailerons to remain somewhat effective until the stall migrates outward toward the wing tip. One method of tailoring such stall behavior is known as washout. Some designers of recreational aircraft seek to develop an aircraft that is characteristically incapable of spinning, even in an uncoordinated stall.|$|R
5000|$|Avgas is {{currently}} available in several grades with differing maximum lead concentrations. Because tetraethyllead {{is an expensive}} and polluting ingredient, the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum. Historically, many post-WWII developed, low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel {{has not yet been}} developed and certified for most of these engines. , numerous <b>certificated</b> reciprocating-engine <b>aircraft</b> require high-octane (leaded) fuels. Teledyne-Continental Motors states: [...] "Current aircraft engines feature valve gear components which are designed for compatibility with the leaded ASTM D910 fuels. In such fuels, the lead acts as a lubricant, coating the contact areas between the valve, guide, and seat. The use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear {{due to the lack of}} lead. The result can be remarkable, with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours." [...] Lycoming has also provided a list of engines and fuels that are compatible with them. A number of their engines are not compatible with unleaded fuel according to their chart.|$|R
5000|$|Dan-Air's {{original}} eight Boeing 727-100s, which entered service between 1973 and 1978, {{differed from}} overseas-registered aircraft. Dan-Air's examples featured additional emergency doors {{each side of}} the rear fuselage as well as a stall-protection system known as a [...] "stick pusher". The additional exits were needed for having the <b>aircraft</b> <b>certificated</b> for an increased maximum seating capacity of 150. This necessitated satisfying the British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requirement that all passengers could leave within 90 seconds using only half the available exits. Stall protection had been introduced in the light of experience with the stalling characteristics of both civil and military British T-tailed jet aircraft, including the loss of a Hawker Siddeley Trident on a test flight over Norfolk when it entered a deep stall. This stall-protection system consisted of a stick pusher, a [...] "nudger" [...] and an independent [...] "shaker" [...] for each pilot. When the aircraft was in danger of stalling it warned the pilots by shaking the control columns as well as correcting attitude and altitude, in an attempt to increase air speed and so avert an irrecoverable deep stall. It was estimated that installing stall-protection cost Dan-Air £100,000 per aircraft and up to £1 million for the entire fleet.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, several {{distinct}} {{groups of}} aircraft may be flown as light-sport. Existing <b>certificated</b> <b>aircraft</b> and experimental, amateur-built aircraft that {{fall within the}} definition listed in 14CFR1.1 are acceptable, as are aircraft built to an industry consensus standard rather than FAA airworthiness requirements. The accepted consensus standard is defined by ASTM Technical Committee F37. Aircraft built to the consensus standard may be factory-built and sold with a special airworthiness certification (S-LSA) or may be assembled from a kit under the experimental rules (E-LSA) under experimental airworthiness. A company must have produced and certified at least one S-LSA {{in order to be}} permitted to sell E-LSA kits of the same model. E-LSA kits are not subject to the normal experimental amateur built (E-AB) requirement 14CFR21.191 which identifies an aircraft, the [...] "major portion of which has been fabricated and assembled by persons who undertook the construction project solely for their own education or recreation." ...|$|E
50|$|What {{happens when}} {{there are very few}} market {{participants}} and the goods or services are not widely available to the public? Lets take surveillance systems in a military overseas contingency environment as an example. Battlefield full motion video is not something that is found in the commercial sector - Wal-Marts don't sell this; moreover, frequently there are special restrictions which impact on commercial firms ability to engage in work of this nature. For example, special FAA Administrator permission is required before a US <b>certificated</b> <b>aircraft</b> or pilot can fly in Iraq under Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 77; if there are very few, or only one, vendor who can participate in this requirement, there are no vendors out there for meanginful competition which is the bedrock assumption of FAR Parts 12 and 13. In view of the above, the airborne recon contract is NOT a commercial service - therefore use of FAR Part 12 commercial items contracting processes is wholly inappropriate and not permissible under the applicable laws governing Federal acquisition.|$|E
5000|$|Resorcinol-formaldehyde {{resin glue}} {{is very strong}} and durable (resisting {{immersion}} in boiling water, mild acids, salt water, solvents, mold, fungus, ultraviolet, etc.). It must be mixed before use (liquid resin and powdered catalyst). It has a dark purple color which may be objectionable in some uses. Toxic. For many years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that [...] "Resorcinol is the only known adhesive recommended and approved for use in wooden aircraft structure and fully meets necessary strength and durability requirements" [...] for <b>certificated</b> <b>aircraft,</b> however in fact {{the vast majority of}} wooden aircraft built in recent decades (mostly amateur-built aircraft) instead use other types of adhesives (primarily epoxy resin systems) which offer greater strength and even more importantly, much less criticality in perfect application technique. Most newer adhesives are much more tolerant to typical construction mistakes (such as small gaps or misalignments between parts) than resorcinol, which offers virtually no tolerance for such everyday construction situations. This can pose major difficulties, especially in complex assemblies. However, resorcinol is still used by some builders/restorers, and is commonly seen in vintage aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Despite the concerted {{efforts of}} {{manufacturers}} and certification agencies, {{incidents and accidents}} continue to happen to <b>aircraft</b> <b>certificated</b> to “Fly Into Known Icing”, falsely thought of as being “immune to in-flight icing”. The current successive process of CFD for ice shape prediction, then icing tunnel testing (experimental fluid dynamics- EFD), and finally flying in natural ice conditions (flight fluid dynamics-EFD), has many gaps {{that can only be}} filled by modern CFD. By developing compatible CFD tools able to simulate both the aerodynamics and icing in a concurrent engineering way, and by viewing the aircraft as a system and not as disjoint components, it will be shown how CFD, EFD and can be combined in a rigorous mathematical way to carry out a much faster, more complete and more thorough evaluation of the aircraft’s FIKI and result in a much safer aircraft. The Seminar will cover aspects of physical and mathematical modeling (impingement, accretion, de-icing, anti-icing, conjugate heat transfer, turbulence modeling), CFD (FEM, FVM, automatic mesh optimization) and the actual certification campaign of China’s first regional Jet, the ARJ 21. The seminar will particularly focus on a reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework inching toward the calculation, via RANS, of the aerodynamics + water impingement + ice accretion + performance degradation, in real-time. The ROM methodology is based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, multi-dimensional interpolation and machine learning algorithms, along with an error driven iterative sampling method, to adaptively select an optimal set of snapshots. The methodology is applied {{for the first time to}} a “full aircraft” and to the “entire” icing certification envelope, providing invaluable additional data to the limited ones from icing tunnels or natural flight-testing. The level of accuracy achieved strongly supports the drive to incorporate more CFD information into in-flight icing certification and pilot training programs, leading to increased aviation safety...|$|R
40|$|The Weight-Shift Control (WSC) Aircraft Flying Handbook {{introduces}} the basic pilot {{knowledge and skills}} that are essential for piloting WSC aircraft. It introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that is needed as they progress in their pilot training. This handbook is for student pilots, {{as well as those}} pursuing more advanced pilot certificates. Student pilots learning to fly WSC <b>aircraft,</b> <b>certificated</b> pilots preparing for additional WSC ratings or who desire to improve their flying proficiency and aeronautical knowledge, and commercial WSC pilots teaching WSC students how to fly should find this handbook helpful. This book {{introduces the}} prospective pilot to the realm of WSC flight and provides information and guidance to all WSC pilots in the performance of various maneuvers and procedures. This handbook conforms to pilot training and certification concepts established by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). There are different ways of teaching, as well as performing flight procedures and maneuvers, and many variations in the explanations of aerodynamic theories and principles. This handbook adopts a selective method and concept to flying WSC aircraft. The discussions and explanations reflect the most commonly used practices and principles. Occasionally, the word “must ” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR). It is essential for persons using this handbook also to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). Performance standards for demonstrating competence required for pilot certification are prescribed in the appropriate WSC practical test standard.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is to encourage air carrier and repair station employees to voluntarily report errors that may be critical to identifying potential precursors to accidents. Under an ASAP, safety issues are resolved through proactive action rather than through punishment or discipline. The goal {{of this study was}} to identify factors that may lead to the success or failure of an ASAP. The Maintenance ASAP Questionnaire (MAQ) was developed and distributed to a randomly selected sample of 83, 0000 <b>certificated</b> <b>aircraft</b> mechanics. The results of this survey indicate that there is an overwhelming belief among the respondents that the ASAP programs can truly improve safety. The hurdles in building a successful ASAP program are rooted in two key areas: (a) limited interpersonal trust among mechanics, managers, and the FAA inspectors and (b) lack of awareness about the ASAP programs as well as its potential benefits. In addition to higher levels of trust and awareness among the organizations with successful ASAP programs, it was also clear that these organizations had a more collaborative labor-management relationship...|$|E
