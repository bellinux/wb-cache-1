5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> is {{assessed}} as {{a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red List of Endangered Species. It {{is one of the}} species to which theAgreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds(AEWA) is applied to. TheUnited States Forest Service (USFS)has designated the <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> a species of special status because of threats from habitat loss and toxic metal poisoning in its US range.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} fossil loon species are {{known from the}} Pliocene, and {{specimens}} from the Pleistocene of California and Florida appear to represent a paleosubspecies of the <b>common</b> <b>loon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> is {{also known}} as the great {{northern}} diver in Eurasia. (Another former name, great northern loon, was a compromise proposed by the International Ornithological Committee.) It is one of five loon species that make up the genus Gavia, the only genus of the family Gaviidae and order Gaviiformes. Its closest relative is another large black-headed species, the yellow-billed loon or white-billed diver (Gavia adamsii). There are no recognised subspecies of the <b>common</b> <b>loon.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>loons</b> {{have faced}} {{a decline in}} {{breeding}} range primarily due to hunting, predation, human destruction of habitat, contaminant exposure, and water-level fluctuations or flooding. Some environmentalists attempt to increase nesting success by mitigating the effects {{of some of these}} threats, namely terrestrial predation and water-level fluctuations, through the deployment of rafts and artificial nesting islands in the breeding territories of <b>common</b> <b>loons.</b>|$|R
25|$|Common birds {{include the}} boreal chickadees, gray jays, spruce grouse, black-backed woodpeckers, <b>common</b> <b>loons</b> and crossbills.|$|R
50|$|Garrett Island {{provides}} {{habitat for}} 44 {{species of birds}} including eagles, <b>common</b> <b>loons,</b> tundra swans, and 14 species of ducks.|$|R
5|$|Internal parasites of the <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> {{include many}} species of worms, {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, {{and can lead to}} illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The black fly Simulium annulus is closely associated with the <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> to which it is attracted to chemicals in the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> {{is listed}} under Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species, and in Article I under the European Union (EU) Birds Directive. It {{is one of}} the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) is applied. In Europe it appears in 20 Important Bird Areas (IBAs), {{including}} Ireland, Svalbard, mainland Norway, Iceland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. It is also a listed species in 83 Special Protection Areas in the EU Natura 2000 network. The USDA National Forest Service has designated the <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> a species of special status, and in the upper Great Lake regions of the Huron-Manistee, Ottawa, and Hiawatha national forests as a regional forester sensitive species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> was {{eaten in}} the Scottish Islands from the Neolithic until the eighteenth century, and its {{thick layer of}} fat beneath the skin {{was used as a}} cure for sciatica.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>loons</b> have a bone {{structure}} {{made up of}} a number of solid bones (unlike normally hollow avian bones), which add weight but help in diving.|$|R
50|$|International Bird Rescue {{routinely}} {{cares for}} a variety of species. Among the most commonly treated include brown pelicans, western gulls, northern fulmars, western grebes, American coots, American white pelicans, eared grebes, <b>common</b> murres, Pacific <b>loons,</b> <b>common</b> <b>loons,</b> black-crowned night herons, great blue herons, mallard ducks, and Canada geese.|$|R
50|$|Longville {{is home to}} {{many types}} of birds, {{including}} water fowl, forest birds, and even eagles. Nearby lakes, especially Long Lake, are home to many <b>common</b> <b>loons,</b> the state bird of Minnesota. <b>Common</b> <b>loons</b> are a frequent sight on Long Lake and have been for decades {{becoming part of the}} lake's identity. Bald eagles also inhabit the region. They can be seen flying above lakes such as Long Lake and picking fish out the water. It is not uncommon to see a bald eagle fly over Long Lake with a fish in its talons.|$|R
5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} bald eagles will attack incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E
5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, <b>common</b> <b>loon,</b> American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|Danish {{zoologist}} and mineralogist Morten Thrane Brünnich {{first described}} the <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> in 1764, as Colymbus immer in his Ornithologia Borealis. The now-defunct genus Colymbus contained grebes {{as well as}} loons, and remained in use until the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature attempted to clarify the nomenclature in 1956 by declaring Colymbus a suppressed name unfit for further use and establishing Gavia, created by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1788, as the valid genus name for the loons.|$|E
50|$|Siskiwit Lake {{contains}} several lake islands, including Eagle Nest Island, Teakettle Island, Lost and Found Island, and Ryan Island, the largest. <b>Common</b> <b>loons</b> {{nest and}} breed {{on some of}} these islands.|$|R
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>loons</b> {{are mainly}} Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their {{breeding}} season {{in spring and}} summer, most <b>common</b> <b>loons</b> live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, <b>common</b> <b>loons</b> favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity.|$|R

5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} {{by a number of}} mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> eggs are especially vulnerable if the adult is absent.|$|E
5|$|The hoot is a short, soft {{call and}} is {{another form of}} contact call. It is a more {{intimate}} call than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This call is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{is located}} along the Atlantic Flyway, a major route for migratory {{waterfowl}} {{along the eastern}} coast. Lakes in central Massachusetts provide habitat for many species of fish and waterfowl, but some species such as the <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> are becoming rare. A significant population of long-tailed ducks winter off Nantucket. Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened piping plover. Protected {{areas such as the}} Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat for shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of grey seals.|$|E
50|$|The {{archipelago}} {{was identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of greylag and barnacle geese, <b>common</b> eiders, <b>common</b> <b>loons,</b> great cormorants, European shags, white-tailed eagles, purple sandpipers and black guillemots.|$|R
50|$|Squam Lake is a {{nesting site}} for <b>common</b> <b>loons</b> {{and is a}} good place to see them in {{breeding}} plumage during the summer months. Bald eagles and great blue herons are also known to nest on the lake.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} fish living in Wolfe Lake include both smallmouth and largemouth bass, walleye, {{northern}} pike, perch, rockbass, sunfish, bluegill and whitefish. Wildlife is diverse, including black bear, white-tailed deer, eastern coyotes, fox, minks, <b>common</b> <b>loons</b> and bald eagles.|$|R
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{voice and}} {{appearance}} of the <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> has made it prominent in several Native American tales. These include an Ojibwe story of a loon that created the world, and a Micmac saga describing Kwee-moo, the loon who was a special messenger of Glooscap (Glu-skap), the tribal hero. The tale of the loon's necklace was handed down in many versions among Pacific Coast peoples. The Delaware in the east of North America and the Buryats of Siberia also had creation stories involving the loon.|$|E
5000|$|The many rivers {{flowing into}} Richmond Gulf make its water {{brackish}} but a healthy habitat for brook trout and whitefish, beluga and seal. [...] Many species of birds, such as <b>common</b> <b>loons,</b> eider ducks and peregrine falcons, find summer shelter and nest here.|$|R
50|$|Crystal Lake is a {{nesting site}} for <b>common</b> <b>loons</b> {{and is a}} good place to see them in {{breeding}} plumage during the summer months. Bald eagles and great blue herons are also known to visit the lake. Moose, black bear, otters, and beavers have been sighted near the shoreline.|$|R
2500|$|Mammals {{found in}} the park include white-tailed deer, moose, black bears, raccoons, snowshoe hares, red foxes, bobcats, and Canadian lynxes.

5|$|In 2009, $1 {{million of}} federal {{stimulus}} money was delegated to {{the restoration of}} the marshland near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase the population of birds and fish. The Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service collaborated to place soil and plant marsh near the causeway to allow a larger nursing location for fish and provide greater quantities of food for water birds. Over 490 species of birds have been found in the area including the brown pelican, black-billed whistling duck, reddish egret, white-faced ibis, pauraque, buff-bellied hummingbird, golden-fronted woodpecker, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, Neotropic cormorant, laughing gull, Franklin's gull, ring-billed gull, herring gull, gull-billed tern, <b>common</b> <b>loon,</b> brown-crested flycatcher, hooded oriole, peregrine falcon and piping plover. Bird populations are protected and can be viewed at the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge on Oso Bay.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, and <b>common</b> <b>loon,</b> the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>loon</b> {{or great}} {{northern}} diver (Gavia immer) is a large member of the loon, or diver, family of birds. Breeding adults have a plumage that includes a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen, blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure whiteunderpartsexcept some black on the undertail coverts and vent. Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders, and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish. The sexes look alike, though males are significantly larger and heavier than females. During the breeding season, they live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States (including Alaska), {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland and Iceland. Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in Arctic Eurasia. Common loons winter on both coasts of the US as far south as Mexico, and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>loons</b> (Gavia immer) {{frequent}} {{the lower}} reaches of tidal creeks of all refuge divisions from late autumn through early spring. They are commonly observed feeding on green crabs and small fish. During spring, summer and autumn migration, 11 species of wading birds use the estuarine {{systems of the}} refuge.|$|R
50|$|The Oregon Coast Trail {{passes through}} the center of this {{headland}} refuge where interpretive displays describe its many inhabitants.
