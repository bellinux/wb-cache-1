25|$|Conservative Member of Parliament Tom Lukiwski {{is known}} for his ability to stall Parliamentary Committee {{business}} by filibustering.

2500|$|On March 9, 2011, Milliken {{made two}} {{historic}} rulings finding a prima fascia case of contempt of Parliament {{against the government}} of Stephen Harper, referring the matter to the Procedure Committee. The House subsequently voted to [...] "agree with the finding of the Standing <b>Committee</b> <b>on</b> <b>Procedure</b> and House Affairs {{that the government is}} in contempt of Parliament" [...] in supporting a non-confidence vote on March 25, 2011. Prior to the vote, the last House of Commons which Milliken would preside over, the Speaker was praised by MPs from all sides of the House. Conservative Government House Leader John Baird paid homage to Milliken’s career, recalling a meeting he’d had with the Speaker of the British House of Commons. “The Speaker of the Commons there said that he and Speakers from all around the Commonwealth look to you as their leader and their inspiration as someone who has conducted himself very professionally. For a Canadian to hear that from a British Speaker is a pretty remarkable conclusion and assessment of your role as Speaker." [...] Baird predicted that Milliken would “go down in history as, if not one of the best Speakers, the best Speaker the House of Commons has ever had." ...|$|E
