The Columbus Avenue station in Mount Vernon was closed in the Penn Central era, due to its proximity to Mt. Vernon station and the expense of converting it to high-level platforms. It had previously been a transfer station to the overhead viaduct station of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway; an impressive ruin remains and is easily visible from passing trains. Other stations abandoned along the mainline include Devon, at the junction of the Waterbury Branch, and Norwalk, replaced by South Norwalk. The changeover from catenary to third rail was moved from Woodlawn to just west of Pelham in the early 1990s. There is an abandoned coach yard just east of Port Chester station.|$|E

50|$|The plan {{adopted by}} the MBTA {{is based on the}} Indigo Line plan {{advanced}} by community activists, which was intended to make the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> more like rapid transit than commuter rail, with increased frequency and number of stops.

The Indigo Line plan also called for the use of diesel multiple unit (DMU) cars for faster acceleration and deceleration, which was considered by the MBTA but not implemented initially because of lack of funding. , the proposed state budget includes some funds to purchase DMU railcars and the state plans to issue a request for proposals in December to purchase 30 DMUs, with deliveries starting in 2018 and completed by 2020.|$|E
