40|$|Communication cables {{are used}} to {{transfer}} data between components of a system. As {{a part of the}} EMC analysis of complex systems, it is necessary to determine which level of interference can be expected at the input of connected devices due to the coupling into the irradiated cable. For electrically large systems consisting of several rooms with cables connecting components located in different rooms, an estimation of the coupled disturbances inside cables using commercial field computation software is often not feasible without several restrictions. In many cases, this is related to the non-availability of computing memory and processing power needed for the computation. In this paper, we are going to show that, starting from a topological analysis of the entire system, weak <b>coupling</b> <b>paths</b> within the system can be can be identified. By neglecting these <b>coupling</b> <b>paths</b> and using the transmission line approach, the original system will be simplified so that a simpler estimation is possible.

Starting from an incident electromagnetic field, we determine transfer functions describing the coupling means (apertures, cables). Using these transfer functions and the knowledge of the weak <b>coupling</b> <b>paths</b> above, a decision is taken regarding the means for paths that can be neglected during the estimation. The estimation of the coupling into the cable is then made while taking only <b>paths</b> with strong <b>coupling</b> into account.

40|$|In recent years, {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) {{problems associated with}} high frequency and high speed interconnects are becoming of increasing concern. Coaxial cables are a popular form of interconnect. In this thesis, the crosstalk coupling between two parallel coaxial cables in free space and above a ground plane is investigated. The degree of coupling is usually formulated analytically in the frequency domain. In this thesis, a method for time domain simulation is proposed using the TLM technique. Results are compared with frequency domain solutions and experimental results. Also; the standard model has been improved by including the skin depth effect in the coaxial cable braid. The crosstalk between the two coaxial cables is observed through the induced voltages on the loads of the adjacent cable, which is deemed to be the usual measureable form of cable coupling. The equivalent circuit developed for the <b>coupling</b> <b>path</b> of two coaxial cables in free space takes account of the differential mode (DM) current travelling in the braids of the cables. As for the <b>coupling</b> <b>path</b> of the cables via a ground plane, the equivalent circuit is developed based on the flow of differential mode (DM) and common mode (CM) currents in the braid, where the coaxial braid’s transfer impedance is modelled using Kley’s model. The radiated electric (E) field from the coaxial cable above a ground plane is also deduced from the predicted cable sheath current distribution and by the Hertzian dipoles’ approach.
