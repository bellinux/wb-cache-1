50|$|The <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> {{may or may}} not be {{bypassed}} with a capacitor. Feedback {{may also}} be applied to the <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Where [...] = voltage gain, µ is the {{amplification}} factor of the valve, rP is the internal plate resistance,RK is the <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> and Rtot is the parallel combination of RP (external plate resistor) and Rload.If the <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> is bypassed, use RK = 0.|$|E
50|$|Typically a 12AX7 triode is {{configured}} with a high-value plate resistor, 100k ohms in most guitar amps and 220k ohms {{or more in}} high-fidelity equipment. Grid bias is {{most often}} provided by a <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor.</b> If the <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> is unbypassed, negative feedback is introduced and each half of a 12AX7 provides a typical voltage gain of about 30; the amplification factor is basically twice the maximum stage gain, as the plate impedance must be matched. Thus half the voltage is across the tube at rest, half across the load resistor. The <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> can be bypassed to reduce or eliminate AC negative feedback and thereby increase gain; maximum gain is about 60 times.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} circuits are simplified conceptual circuits only, {{real world}} circuits also require a smoothed or regulated power supply, heater for the filaments (the details depending on if the selected valve types are {{directly or indirectly}} heated), and the <b>cathode</b> <b>resistors</b> are often bypassed, etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} type 295 had a directly heated output section, and an indirectly heated input section. The 2B6 tube, {{introduced in}} 1933, had similar power ratings, but had both cathodes indirectly heated. The Sylvania 6N6G, introduced in 1936, had both cathodes indirectly heated, and {{also had the}} <b>cathode</b> follower <b>resistor</b> hard-wired inside the envelope. A single-ended 6N6G amplifier required only one external component, the output transformer; currents and bias voltages were set by the internal resistor. A push-pull 6N6G amplifier required only two tubes and two transformers (input and output).|$|R
5000|$|... if {{the shared}} emitter (or <b>cathode</b> or source) <b>resistor</b> is {{relatively}} small, total current will vary with signal, and the signal {{will not be}} evenly split across both outputs, so {{a fraction of the}} first device's output will have to be fed to the second device's base or grid or gate to balance the amplitudes at the two outputs. Effectively, the second device is acting now as an inverting unity-gain amplifier.|$|R
5000|$|Automatic bias or self bias - using a <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> {{to raise}} cathode {{potential}} above grid (tied to ground) and stabilize plate current; ...|$|E
5000|$|The other {{technique}} {{is to use}} a pair of amplifier tubes with a common <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor.</b> In this case, the input tube is operated as a standard common cathode amplifier, while its twin is operated in common grid mode. The input signal is amplified by the input tube in the normal fashion. An unbypassed <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor,</b> common to both tubes, couples the signal to the cathode of the second amplifier, which is operated in [...] "Grounded grid" [...] mode, with the grid resistor bypassed by a capacitor which maintains a constant grid voltage. The pair of tubes produce outputs exactly out of phase, but the gain of the grounded grid amplifier is slightly higher, requiring that their plate resistances be different in order to maintain balance.|$|E
50|$|The basic gain {{stage for}} a valve {{amplifier}} is the auto-biased common cathode stage, in which an anode resistor, the valve, and a <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> form a potential divider across the supply rails. The resistance of the valve varies {{as a function of}} the voltage on the grid, relative to the voltage on the cathode.|$|E
5000|$|To {{establish}} <b>cathode</b> bias, a <b>resistor</b> {{is placed}} between the emitting element, or cathode {{and the negative}} return of the [...] "B" [...] or HT supply. Current drawn through this resistor by tube conduction places the cathode slightly more positive than the negative return. The grid input is returned directly to the negative supply, causing it to be negative {{with respect to the}} cathode. Thus, changes in tube conduction are automatically compensated by changes in bias.|$|R
50|$|Cathode bias is {{also used}} to achieve phase inversion. In a more simple circuit, which has less than unity gain, the <b>cathode</b> and plate <b>resistors</b> are made equal. In {{accordance}} with Kirchhoff's law, the current through both resistors will be equal, thus the voltage across them will also be equal. As the plate becomes more negative, the cathode will become more positive, and conversely. The resulting signals are capacitively coupled to any succeeding stages, providing a pair of signals 180° out of phase.|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{aspects of}} {{electron}} and positron injection, storage and extraction in a damping ring of an injection complex are described. Symmetrical strip-line type kickers {{are used in}} quasi-traveling wave mode. A generator {{of a pair of}} negative and positive polarity pulses bases on two double pulse forming network (DPFN). Both DPFN are charged up to 50 kV using a common pulse transformer. Every DPFN is commutated by single high-voltage hydrogen thyratron. One of the thyratrons has a floating <b>cathode.</b> Special design <b>resistors</b> are used as kicker terminators. Circuit wave resistance is 25 Ohm, pulses duration is 80 ns, and repetition rate is up to 50 Hz...|$|R
50|$|In a cathode {{follower}} or common-plate configuration, the output {{is taken from}} the cathode resistance. Because of negative feedback (the cathode-ground voltage cancels the grid-ground voltage) the voltage gain is close to unity and the output voltage follows the grid voltage. Although the <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> can be many kilohms (depending on biasing requirements), the small-signal output impedance is very low (see operational amplifier).|$|E
50|$|An example {{crowbar circuit}} {{is shown to}} the right. This {{particular}} circuit uses an LM431 adjustable zener regulator to control {{the gate of the}} TRIAC. The resistor divider of R1 and R2 provide the reference voltage for the LM431. The divider is set so that during normal operating conditions, the voltage across R2 is slightly lower than VREF of the LM431. Since this voltage is below the minimum reference voltage of the LM431, it remains off and very little current is conducted through the zener and <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor.</b> If the <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> is sized accordingly, very little voltage will be dropped across it and the TRIAC gate terminal will be essentially at the same potential as MT1, keeping the TRIAC off. If the supply voltage increases, the voltage across R2 will exceed VREF and the zener will begin to regulate voltage, drawing more current through it. The voltage at the gate terminal will be pulled down to VZ (the zener voltage), exceeding the gate trigger voltage of the TRIAC and latching it on.|$|E
5000|$|An {{exception}} to the general rule may {{be made in the}} case of [...] "push-pull", or balanced circuits. A pair of tubes, driven by identical signals 180 degrees out of phase, may share a common unbypassed <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor.</b> Slight differences in tube conduction are then dynamically balanced by bias variations that tend to reduce distortion. This technique is useful in the input circuits of balanced line receivers or push-pull power output circuits.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{problem is}} a slight {{reduction}} in gain. The <b>cathode,</b> or bias <b>resistor</b> appears in series with the plate, or load resistor. The bias voltage must be subtracted from the total [...] "B" [...] or HT voltage in gain calculations. In most circuits, this problem is easily overcome by selecting a load impedance at least two orders of magnitude greater than the bias resistance. For example, a 1K bias resistor will have virtually no effect if the load impedance is at least 100K. These values were, in fact, used by Leo Fender in many of his guitar amplifier designs. Refer to [...] "The Tube Amp Book" [...] by Gerald Weber, schematic section.|$|R
40|$|In {{basis of}} {{application}} of method of own radiation for the wares of radio electronics lies presence of direct connection of resource of {{work of the}} REC with his temperature. For the row of components (transistors, diodes, oxide <b>cathodes,</b> <b>resistors)</b> there are the expected statistical dependences. Application of the method of own radiation is possible even on the standards of radio electronics adjusted not enough to diagnose on the places of their exploitation. With the help of this method {{are determined by the}} components that have worked {{for a long time and}} are abandoned before the state, which leads to increased availability ratio of REE and to reduce the cost of software lifecycle. The operationability of method evidently shows up at research of large number of the same type digital blocks (REC). The analysis of sources showed that the thermal fields of the same type wares well correlated, and the use of method of own radiation in the system of diagnostics allows to carry out high-performance non contact diagnostics with the use of computer technique for treatment of the got results. A diagnostic parameter in a method is a temperature of surface of the REC, changes under the action of the specially built verification test sequence, registers one self in accordance with the method of transfer of thermal energy (heat conductivity, convection, thermal radiation) and can be presented by not only the set of numerical values but also as two-dimensional (three-dimensional) thermograms. After forming of set of informing signs application of the computing engineering and algorithms of recognition is possible. The process of localization of place of disrepair in a digital block is related to determination of defective component by registration and treatment of diagnostic parameter ? thermal response on entrance test sequences for this component. Use of method of own radiation, it is impossible without creation of diagnostic models, that represent connection of DP with physical and chemical properties not only the REC but also protective layer that covers the semiconductor crystal of the REC. For the construction of model of transfer of heat from a "warmed-up" crystal on the surface of the REC (task of non-stationary heat conductivity) the analysis of technology of making and structure is conducted modern semiconductor the REC. The aim of the article are determinations of time of display of diagnostic parameter on the surface of the REC in the method of own radiation for continuous and determined on by time of entrance influence. ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ???????????? ????????? ??? ??????? ???????????????? ????? ??????? ?????? ????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ???????????

40|$|Beam {{transport}} in plasma channels is a {{transport mechanism}} especially {{suited for the}} transport of high current beams or beams of poor quality (e. g. large momentum spread). It is currently studied {{as an alternative to}} ballistic focusing for final transport in ion beam driven inertial fusion reactors. Plasma channels are created by a discharge in a background gas. The channels can be initiated either by laser heating of the gas along the axis or by sending an ion beam pulse through the gas-filled vessel before the discharge, which ionizes the gas on the axis. The initial GSI experiments used a discharge chamber with a length of 50 cm. In 2003, the experimental setup has been refitted to accommodate a longer chamber to be able to produce longer plasma channels. A 50 cm extension tube was inserted. Within this extended chamber, 1 m long channels could be created. However, it became evident that the former design of having the chamber walls on one half of the cathode potential had to be improved, because the electric field strength on the axis in the longer chamber is very low with just one wall potential. Calculations showed that different potentials on the three wall parts increase the field strength [1]. Insulator flanges of 3 cm thickness and an array of resistors were included in order to set the three parts of the new chamber separately to different percentages of the full <b>cathode</b> potential. The <b>resistors</b> are used as potential dividers, so that the total voltage is divided evenly between the wall parts, see fig. 1. ion bea...|$|R
50|$|The use of grid leak bias {{competed with}} use of a {{so-called}} C battery for providing a fixed negative voltage on the grid. When vacuum tubes came to be constructed with cathodes electrically isolated from their filaments, it became possible to use cathode biasing. This involved use of a resistor from the cathode to ground, which provides better control of anode current through negative feedback. This method also requires a relatively large capacitor across the <b>cathode</b> <b>resistor</b> to avoid losing AC gain (through negative feedback), {{and the cost of}} a sufficiently sized capacitor was an issue in the pre-war years, as capacitors had low capacity per volume and per cost.|$|E
