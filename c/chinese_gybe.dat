50|$|A <b>Chinese</b> <b>gybe</b> on a {{sailing vessel}} {{is a type}} of gybe where the upper section of the main sail moves across the boat, filling from the {{opposite}} side, whilst the lower section and boom remain on the original side of the vessel. It contrasts with a normal gybe, where the whole sail moves across the boat as the boat turns its stern through the wind. A <b>Chinese</b> <b>gybe</b> is usually induced by too little tension on the vang or kicking strap, allowing the boom to rise up and the leech of the sail to twist excessively.|$|E
50|$|The term {{can be used}} in a {{different}} sense, in which a <b>Chinese</b> <b>gybe</b> is a gybe caused when a boat rolls excessively to windward (usually when running downwind), causing an unexpected and/or uncontrolled change in course (specifically bearing off dangerously). This sense of the term is similar to death roll.|$|E
5000|$|Accidental jibes {{may occur}} when running dead {{downwind}} {{and the wind}} catches the leeward side of the sail. When the wind direction crosses the centerline of the boat without jibing the point of sail {{is referred to as}} [...] "by the lee" [...] When sailing [...] "by the lee" [...] {{the outer edge of the}} mainsail is facing slightly into the wind. Rolling motion, slight changes in the boat heading or wind direction can cause an unexpected and surprising jibe, suddenly and forcefully flipping the mainsail to the opposite side of the boat. Do not sail [...] "by the lee" [...] except for brief durations (such as to avoid an obstacle), and only when keeping all crew clear of the boom swing and the arc of the mainsheet sweep. A crew member can be used to help hold the boom in place in smaller boats. When sailing directly downwind, unintentional jibes can also occur; diligent helmsmanship is required to prevent [...] "by the lee" [...] conditions and keeping clear of the boom sweep is advised. In larger stable boats, a preventer can help by keeping the boom held forward, preventing the boom motion of a jibe, especially in light winds. However, in high winds, the [...] "sheeting in action" [...] of a preventer can cause severe rounding up on the other tack. Smaller boats may find that a backwinded sail is more heel inducing than allowing a jibe. See broach, <b>Chinese</b> <b>gybe</b> and death roll.|$|E
