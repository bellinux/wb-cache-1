50|$|Thermal {{ionization}}, {{also known}} as surface ionization or <b>contact</b> <b>ionization,</b> is a physical process whereby the atoms are desorbed from a hot surface, {{and in the process}} are spontaneously ionized.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{ionization}} (also {{known as}} surface ionization, or <b>contact</b> <b>ionization)</b> involves spraying vaporized, neutral atoms onto a hot surface, {{from which the}} atoms re-evaporate in ionic form. To generate positive ions, the atomic species should have a low ionization energy, and the surface should have a high work function. This technique is most suitable for alkali atoms (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) which have low ionization energies and are easily evaporated.|$|E
50|$|The Q-machine plasma {{is created}} at a plate {{that has been}} heated to about 2000 K and hence is called the hot plate. Electrons are emitted by the hot plate through {{thermionic}} emission, and ions are created through <b>contact</b> <b>ionization</b> of atoms of alkali metals that have low ionisation potentials. The hot plate is made of a metal that has a large work function and can withstand high temperatures, e.g. tungsten or rhenium. The alkali metal is boiled in an oven {{that is designed to}} direct a beam of alkaline metal vapour onto the hot plate. A high value of the hot plate work function and a low ionisation potential of the metal makes for a low potential barrier for an electron in the alkaline metal to overcome, thus making the ionisation process more efficient. Sometimes barium is used instead of an alkaline metal due to its excellent spectroscopic properties. The fractional ionization of a Q-machine plasma can approach unity, which can be orders of magnitude greater than that predicted by the Saha ionization equation. The Q-machine's nonequilibrium plasmais a primary example of epicatalysis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{ejection}} {{of material}} during laser ablation {{gives rise to}} the development of discontinuities in the ambient gas. Several of these discon-tinuities are observed and characterized, including externally and internally propagating shock waves, contact surface, and the ionization front. Quali-tative experimental observations and analysis of these discontinuities is pre-sented. Results from shadowgraphy enabled determination of an irradiance threshold between two different ablation mechanisms, and determination of several stages of plasma plume evolution. Consideration of the refractive index as a dynamic sum of the contributions from gas and electrons led to separate identification of ionization front from the <b>contact</b> surface. Further-more, <b>ionization</b> front was observed to lead the shock wave at the earlier stage of the ablation. ...|$|R

Four kinds of ion sources have been developed: The <b>contact</b> <b>ionization</b> source for Cs as propellants, the electron bombardment source for Cs or Hg, the RF ionization source for Hg, and the hollow needle spray nozzle for colloidal glycerol particles.

40|$|Vacuum {{ballistic}} focusing may be {{a straightforward}} method to obtain the heavy ion beam spot size necessary to drive an inertial confinement fusion target. Proper scaling of particle energy, mass, beam current, beam emittance, and magnetic field replicates the dynamics of a full driver beam in a small laboratory experiment. By expanding the beam and then focusing to a very small spot, the effects of aberrations and space charge on this method of final focus can be studied. To date, 200 {micro}A of 120 keV K{sup +} has been focused to test the matching and focusing elements. A recently designed high brightness <b>contact</b> <b>ionization</b> source is being tested for upcoming focusing measurements with an 87 {micro}A Cs beam that will duplicate the dynamics of a proposed driver design at one-tenth scale. Transverse phase space and beam current density at various stages of the focus will be presented.

40|$|The {{construction}} and assembly of a Cs ion injector {{consisting of a}} pulsed source and 3 pulsed drift tubes has been complete since April, 1980. The measurement program, underway since then to chardcterize the beam, has been interspersed {{with the development of}} diagnostic equipment. The Cs <b>contact</b> <b>ionization</b> source and each of the 3 drift tubes are driven by 500 kV Marx generators. The injector has been operated reliably at 300 kV/stage at a repetition rate of 1 pulse/ 4 sec. About 105 pulses have been accumulated. The space charge limited diode and drift tube acceleration system were designed with the aid of the EGUN code of Herrmannsfeldtl. Measurements of the beam envelope have been made by means of a movable biased charge collector. Good agreement with the EGUN calculation is found. Measurements of the beam emittance have been made at the exit of the third drift tube. The normalized emittance TI EN = 2 x 10 - 6 T m-rad is of better optical quality than that required for further acceleration and transport in a Heavy Ion Fusion (HIF) Induction Linac Driver...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the static and dynamic {{characteristics of a}} 0. 25 mum gate-length fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor. Considering properly the physical topology of the transistor with its accesses, numerical simulations are performed using a two-dimensional ensemble Monte Carlo simulator and these are compared with experimental results. Moreover, in the simulation we include important effects that appear in real transistors, such as surface charges, <b>contact</b> resistances, impact <b>ionization</b> phenomena and extrinsic parasitic capacitances. The appearance of a velocity overshoot region near the drain, together {{with the presence of}} hot carriers in the channel, is observed in the saturation regime. The dynamic behaviour of the device is described through significant small signal equivalent circuit parameters, which are examined by means of internal quantities (such as profiles of the internal electron concentration), provided by numerical simulations. In general, the device shows excellent performance in terms of important design parameters, such as transconductance-to-current ratio, transconductance and cut-off frequency together with a reduced capacitive coupling to the substrate. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations show an exceptional agreement with the experimental data, thus confirming the validity of the simulator as a reliable toot for the analysis of the influence of geometrical and electrical parameters on the static and dynamic performance of the device...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the static, dynamic and noise {{characteristics}} of FDSOI MOSFET’s {{by means of}} numerical simulations validated by comparison with experimental data. For this purpose, we use a 2 D Ensemble Monte Carlo simulator, taking into account, in an appropriate manner, the physical topology of a fabricated 0. 25 μm gate-length FDSOI transistor. Important effects appearing in real transistors, such as surface charges, <b>contact</b> resistances, impact <b>ionization</b> phenomena and extrinsic parasitics {{are included in the}} simulation. This allows to accurately reproduce the experimental behavior of static and dynamic parameters (output and transference characteristics, gm/ID ratio, capacitances, etc.). Moreover, due to the characteristics of our microscopic approach, results are explained by means of internal quantities such as concentration, velocity or energy of carriers. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations for the typical four noise parameters (NFmin, Rn, phase and module of Γopt) of the 0. 25 μm FDSOI MOSFET also show an exceptional agreement with experimental data. Once the reliability of the simulator has been confirmed, a full study of the noise characteristics of the device (intrinsic noise sources, normalized α, β and C parameters, experimental noise figures of merit) is performed. Taking advantage of the possibilities of the Monte Carlo method as a pseudoexperimental approach, the influence on these noise characteristics of the variation of some geometry parameters (downscaling the gate length and thickness of the active layer) is evaluated an interpreted in terms of microscopic transport processes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>ionization</b> (doped) sources used {{in current}} Heavy Ion Fusion (HIF) {{experiments}} {{consist of a}} porous tungsten substrate doped with an alkali carbonate. During {{the early stages of}} the heating cycle (T {approx} 600 C), the carbonate breaks down and releases the alkali atoms that then diffuse through the substrate. At the emitter surface there is a balance between the fast desorption rate of the alkali atoms (mostly as neutrals) and the slower replenishment rate from the substrate by diffusion. Time-resolved measurements of neutral particle evaporation rates at the emitter surface have been used to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient (D) that characterizes the migration of alkali species in the substrate. These estimates are consistent with the observed source lifetimes (tens of hrs.) and establish the alkali migration in the bulk as a diffusion-limited process. The measurements suggest that the faster migration rates (D {approx} 10 {sup - 5 }- 10 {sup - 6 } cm{sup 2 }/s) occur early during the heating cycle when the dominant species are the neutral alkali atoms. At operating temperatures there is a slower migration rate (D {approx} 10 {sup - 7 } cm{sup 2 }/s) due to the dominance of ions, which diffuse by a slower surface diffusion process...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops diverse {{research on}} small (diameter {approx} few mm), high current density (J {approx} several tens of mA/cm{sup 2 }) heavy ion sources. The {{research has been}} developed {{in the context of}} a programmatic interest within the Heavy Ion Fusion (HIF) Program to explore alternative architectures in the beam injection systems that use the merging of small, bright beams. An ion gun was designed and built for these experiments. Results of average current density yield () at different operating conditions are presented for K{sup +} and Cs{sup +} <b>contact</b> <b>ionization</b> sources and potassium aluminum silicate sources. Maximum values for a K{sup +} beam of {approx} 90 mA/cm{sup 2 } were observed in 2. 3 {micro}s pulses. Measurements of beam intensity profiles and emittances are included. Measurements of neutral particle desorption are presented at different operating conditions which lead to a better understanding of the underlying atomic diffusion processes that determine the lifetime of the emitter. Estimates of diffusion times consistent with measurements are presented, as well as estimates of maximum repetition rates achievable. Diverse studies performed on the composition and preparation of alkali aluminosilicate ion sources are also presented. In addition, this work includes preliminary work carried out exploring the viability of an argon plasma ion source and a bismuth metal vapor vacuum arc (MEVVA) ion source. For the former ion source, fast rise-times ({approx} 1 {micro}s), high current densities ({approx} 100 mA/cm{sup 2 }) and low operating pressures (< 2 mtorr) were verified. For the latter, high but acceptable levels of beam emittance were measured ({var_epsilon}{sub n} {le} 0. 006 {pi} mm {center_dot} mrad) although measured currents differed from the desired ones (I {approx} 5 mA) by about a factor of 10...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{experimental}} study of a plasma which is made strongly turbulent by conducting an electric current. The experiments are performed on the cylindrical potassium plasma column which exists between the hot and cold end-plates of a single-ended Q-machine. The plasma is continuously produced at the hotplate by <b>contact</b> <b>ionization</b> and confined radially by a strong axial magnetic field such that Ï ce Â» Ï pe. The electrons and ions are initially close to thermal equilibrium with the hotplate, with a common temperature â 0. 2 eV. The plasma density (~ 10 9 cm - 3), is such that the time for collisions between electrons and ions is very long compared to the time taken for an electron to travel {{the length of the}} column. Pulsed electron currents of duration ~ 2 Î¼s are drawn through the plasma by applying positive voltage pulses (â² 100 V) to the cold plate. Simple electrical measurements indicate that, above a critical current, the plasma has an anomalously low conductivity accompanied by the onset of a high level of potential fluctuations, which are detected in the plasma by electrostatic probes. A diagnostic technique has been developed to study the temporal evolution of the distribution function of axial electron velocities. This involves time-resolved measurements of the dispersion of electron plasma waves during the current pulse. Analysis of this dispersion gives unambiguous measurements of the electron density n, drift velocity v d, and root mean square (or thermal) velocity v e, during the pulse. The results indicate that, after an. initial transient, n and v d are axially uniform, n remains equal to the initial value and the current drawn from the plasma gives a good measure of their product. The critical current corresponds to v d = 1. 3 v c, which linear theory predicts, is the threshold for the electron-ion two-stream instability. Above this threshold, v e quickly exceeds v d and, in contrast to the predictions of linear theory and computer simulation, continues to rise for constant v d to high values, (indicating electron temperatures â² 80 eV), limited only by the energy containment time of the column. The values of conductivity deduced from the effective scattering rate and from the electrical measurements are in good agreement, and are consistent with an empirical scaling law found in a pulsed toroidal discharge by other workers. Measurements on the potential fluctuations indicate a broad frequency spectrum: in the low frequencies the correlation lengths were too short to be measured; in the high frequencies the fluctuations were shown to consist of relatively coherent, long wavelength electron plasma waves. </p...|$|E
