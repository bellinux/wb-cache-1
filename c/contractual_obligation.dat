5|$|Following {{the debacle}} of The Road Back, Charles Rogers {{tried to get}} out of his {{contract}} with Whale; Whale refused.

5|$|The at-large {{spot in the}} Orange Bowl {{was filled}} via a {{round-robin}} selection procedure defined by the other Bowl Championship series games (the Sugar, Fiesta, and Rose bowls) and the automatic bids. The order of at-large selections rotates annually among the BCS bowls. In 2009, the Fiesta Bowl picked first, followed by the Sugar Bowl, then the Orange Bowl. The Fiesta Bowl picked Ohio State, while the Sugar Bowl selected Utah. The Orange Bowl was thus left to select Big East Conference champion Cincinnati, fulfilling the BCS' <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to provide a game for the conference's champion.|$|E
5|$|The band's third album, Emotive, was {{released}} on November 2, 2004 - the actual U.S Presidential Election Day. However, the album received a much more polarizing reception than the prior two albums, with some critics and fans not appreciating the band's move into more political content, or the radical liberties they had taken with the album's cover versions. Other's accused the band of rushing out a third album {{in order to fulfill}} the band's three album <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to Virgin Records, a claim refuted as false by Howerdel. The album still managed to receive a generally positive reception from critics. Sales were similarly positive, but less so than prior albums. The position debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 142,000 copies in its first week - matching Thirteenth Step's peak chart placement, but selling almost 90,000 copies less. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA, indicating 500,000 units sold.|$|E
40|$|<b>Contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> are {{traditionally}} regarded as voluntary. A voluntary obligation {{is one that}} can be acquired only if one intends to acquire it. This traditional understanding finds doctrinal expression in the requirement that contracting parties intend to create legal relations. It has, however, been doubted that the Anglo-Canadian law of contract insists on this requirement. Skeptics argue that cases ostensibly decided on the basis of such a requirement are better explained otherwise. In this paper I invoke the legal force of contractual disclaimers to show that <b>contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> are indeed voluntary. When parties to an agreement purport to exclude it from the reach of the law by expressly disavowing an intention to bind themselves legally, they have issued a disclaimer. An unambiguous disclaimer will preclude an agreement from being enforced as a contract. <b>Contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> are thus “disclaimer-sensitive”. I argue that this striking feature of <b>contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> can be plausibly explained only if <b>contractual</b> <b>obligations</b> are voluntary...|$|R

5|$|On June 15, 1994, the National Basketball Association's {{franchise}} relocation committee {{voted unanimously}} to block {{the sale of the}} franchise to Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis through at least the 1994–95 season. Top Rank's offer was rejected by the league due to questions surrounding their financing plan. The $152 million purchase price would have been paid for through $40 million from unknown investors; up to $76.25 million in loans from banks that had yet to make commitments; and $50 million or more from undisclosed sources based on projected revenues from the un-built arena in New Orleans. Also, the league filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis seeking an injunction against any transfer of the team from Minnesota. On June 21, 1994, the league officially denied sale of the franchise to Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis. On June 28, 1994, Top Rank would file a counter-suit in Louisiana Civil District Court. The suit sought to have ownership fulfill their <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to sell the team to Top Rank. The following day, federal district court ruled that the franchise was to remain in Minneapolis through June 15, 1995.|$|E

A federal court in Newark, New Jersey, eventually ruled that Braddock's <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to stage his title defense at MSG was unenforceable for lack of mutual consideration.|$|E

25|$|Howard the Duck (titled Howard: A New Breed of Hero in the UK) is a 1986 American science-fiction comedy film {{directed}} by Willard Huyck and starring Chip Zien, Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, and Tim Robbins.

25|$|In an American Hospital Association study, {{the cost}} to replace one nurse in the U.S. was {{estimated}} at around $30,000–$64,000. This amount is likely related {{to the cost of}} recruiting and training nurses into the organization. Hiring foreign nurses is more financially taxing compared to hiring domestic-graduate nurses; however, facilities save money in the long run because foreign nurses have a <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to complete their term. The JACHO in the United States wrote in a 2002 research report on the shortage in the US that recruiting foreign trained nurses from abroad (not referring to those who reside in the United States already) does not help the global nursing shortage and, in fact, perpetuates it.|$|E
25|$|The first {{significant}} bank credit card sale came to market in 1986 {{with a private}} placement of $50 million of outstanding bank card loans. This transaction demonstrated to investors that, if the yields were high enough, loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market. Sales of this type — with no <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> by the seller to provide recourse — allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and regulatory purposes (easing balance sheet and capital constraints), {{while at the same}} time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees. After the success of this initial transaction, investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral, and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of a rebadged model named Dodge Monaco resulted from a <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to use 260,000 of the PRV engines over five years, a clause in the AMC buyout from Renault. The Monaco sold poorly, and both it and the Premier were cancelled in 1992. There was little marketing support for the Premier by the Jeep-Eagle dealers themselves because they were focused on selling the highly successful and more profitable Jeep models. Furthermore, the decision to eventually combine Jeep-Eagle with Chrysler-Plymouth dealers called for the long-term corporate goal of phasing out the Eagle brand. There were 139,051 Premiers and Monacos built at Bramalea. Chrysler paid a penalty for every car not produced and V6 engine not purchased from Renault.|$|E

25|$|The penal bond {{is another}} type of the bond that was {{historically}} used to assure {{the performance of a}} contract.

One historically significant type of penal bond, the penal bond with conditional defeasance, printed the bond (the obligation to pay) {{on the front of the}} document and the condition which would nullify that promise to pay (referred to as the indenture of defeasance—essentially, the <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation)</b> on the back of the document. The penal bond, although an artifact of historical interest, fell out of use by the early part of the nineteenth century in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Klaatu was {{eventually}} signed by Capitol's Canadian division, EMI Canada, and released their final album, Magentalane, in 1981. This album saw the group {{returning to their}} brand of Beatles-influenced pop/rock. As a <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to Capitol-EMI in Canada, the band was forced to play their first-ever live dates and tour most of Canada to promote Magentalane. From November 1981, the group expanded to a sextet, using members of Max Webster and Nightwinds, Gary McCracken and Gerald O'Brien for live performances. However, in April 1982 Dee Long – never fond of performing live, by most accounts – quit the group. Although Woloschuk and Draper carried on performing {{for a few more}} months, Klaatu officially disbanded in August of the same year.|$|E
25|$|In June 1949, Hirsch {{alleged that}} the Hornets (the Chicago Rockets were renamed the Hornets in 1949) had {{breached}} a <b>contractual</b> <b>obligation</b> to pay him a bonus and sought a release {{to allow him to}} play for the Green Bay Packers. However, the Los Angeles Rams held Hirsch's NFL rights having selected him in the 1945 NFL Draft, and Hirsch was therefore unable to sign with the Packers. Instead, he signed with the Rams in July 1949. Hirsch earned $20,000 a year from the Rams, following a bidding war with the Hornets. However, after the 1949 season, the AAFC folded, and the Rams reduced his salary with the competition from the AAFC gone. During his career with the Rams, Hirsch never again attained the salary level he was paid as a rookie.|$|E
