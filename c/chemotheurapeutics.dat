5000|$|The Bijvoet Center has a {{staff of}} around 150 people, {{including}} about 10 full professors, 20 senior researchers, 50 postdocs and 50 PhD students.The general theme of the research in the Bijvoet Center is elucidating how biomolecules function {{in the human body}} and in life in general and how the processes and interactions between biomolecules in living cells are affected in patients. [...] This includes, for example, research to understand the cause and potential therapeutic approaches for a disease like cystic fibrosis, which is caused by misfolding of the protein CFTR when it is mutated due to a genetic defect. Another example is the development of so-called nanobullets, which are small antibody fragments, based on the single-chain antibodies found in llamas to target <b>chemotheurapeutics</b> directly to cancer cells in a cancer patient.|$|E
