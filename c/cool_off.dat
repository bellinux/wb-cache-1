Realizing the danger, {{he is about to}} head back when a walker attacks him. The group races towards his screams, and Daryl quickly dispatches the walker; Carl realizes it is the walker he found in the swamp. Hershel finds Dale's injures are too severe and he will not survive. The group agrees to euthanize Dale, but Rick himself cannot take the shot. Daryl takes the {{revolver}} and ends Dale's suffering.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Naja nigricollis is {{currently}} expanding from the southeastern regions of Nigeria {{to the more}} desert and arid conditions in {{the central part of}} the nation. They also live in coastal scrubs and dry grasslands. Like other cobra species, they may find abandoned termite mounds or rodent holes to hide or <b>cool</b> <b>off.</b> However, tree trunks seem to be their favourite hiding places. They are excellent tree climbers, thus can be arboreal at times. Because they are so common across Africa, they are encountered in villages or small towns where they may come in direct contact with people.|$|E

On January 23, 2012, Hill announced that filming had concluded. Multiple scene takes were made, allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations. Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens. The alien costume featured an animatronic head, remotely controlled by three people. The suit was hot even in cold areas, and had to be unzipped to let Doug Jones <b>cool</b> <b>off</b> between takes. The costume was enhanced with CGI in a number of ways, including replacing arms and dilating pupils (which Schaffer thought made the creature seem more alive).|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to <b>cool</b> <b>off</b> or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
5|$|Six star {{systems have}} been found to contain exoplanets, of which two were {{discovered}} by the Doppler method and four by the transit method. 6 Lyncis, an orange subgiant that spent much of its life as an A-type or F-type main sequence star, is orbited by a planet with a minimum mass of 2.4 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 899 days. HD 75898 is a 3.8 ± 0.8 billion-year-old yellow star of spectral type G0V that has just begun expanding and cooling off the main sequence. It has a planet at least 2.51 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 418days. The centre of mass of the system is accelerating, indicating there is a third, more distant, component at least the size of Jupiter. Three star systems were found to have planets that were observed by the XO Telescope in Hawaii as they passed in front of them. XO-2 is a binary star system, both the stars of which are slightly less massive and cooler than the Sun and have planetary companions: XO-2S has a Saturn-mass planet at 0.13 au distance with a period of around 18 days, and one a little more massive than Jupiter at a distance of 0.48 au and with a period of around 120 days, and XO-2N has a hot Jupiter with around half Jupiter's mass that has an orbit of only 2.6 days. XO-4 is an F-type main sequence star that is a little hotter and more massive than the Sun that has a hot Jupiter orbiting with a period of around 4.1 days. XO-5 is a Sun-like star with a hot Jupiter about as massive as Jupiter that takes around 4.2 days to complete an orbit. WASP-13, a Sun-like star that has begun to swell and <b>cool</b> <b>off</b> the main sequence, had a transiting planet discovered by the SuperWASP program in 2009. The planet is around half as massive as Jupiter and takes 4.35 days to complete a revolution.|$|E

25|$|On January 3, 1841, the Acushnet set sail. Melville {{slept with}} some twenty {{others in the}} forecastle; captain Valentine Pease, the mates, and the skilled men slept aft. Whales were found near The Bahamas, and in March 150 barrels of oil were sent home from Rio de Janeiro.

500|$|In {{an unfortunate}} coincidence, Hurricane Joan hit shortly after an armed {{conflict}} in the region had started to <b>cool</b> <b>off.</b> The hurricane destroyed much of the infrastructure in Nicaragua, contributing to a recession that was already underway. The losses to cash crops severely reduced exports to under 200million dollars (1988USD). These factors combined to aggravate a recession and deepen the economic crisis. Government spending to rebuild infrastructure negated recently introduced anti-inflation measures. Hurricane Joan was a partial cause of Nicaraguans being, on average, worse-off {{than they were in}} the 1970s. In all, the storm left at least 250,000 people homeless. Total damages in the country amounted to $751.1million. [...] Joan was the first major hurricane to strike Nicaragua since Edith in 1971.|$|E

500|$|Hawaiian eruptions often {{begin as}} {{a line of}} vent eruptions along a fissure vent, a {{so-called}} [...] "curtain of fire." [...] These die down as the lava begins to concentrate at {{a few of the}} vents. Central-vent eruptions, meanwhile, often take the form of large lava fountains (both continuous and sporadic), which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more. The particles from lava fountains usually cool in the air before hitting the ground, resulting in the accumulation of cindery scoria fragments; however, when the air is especially thick with clasts, they cannot <b>cool</b> <b>off</b> fast enough due to the surrounding heat, and hit the ground still hot, the accumulation of which forms spatter cones. If eruptive rates are high enough, they may even form splatter-fed lava flows. Hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long lived; Puʻu ʻŌʻō, a cinder cone of Kilauea, has been erupting continuously since 1983. Another Hawaiian volcanic feature is the formation of active lava lakes, self-maintaining pools of raw lava with a thin crust of semi-cooled rock; there are currently only 5 such lakes in the world, and the one at Kīlauea's Kupaianaha vent is one of them.|$|E

40|$|Residential {{conveyancing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} regulated consumer transactions in Australia with innumerable statutes nationally aimed at the regulation of the transaction or parties to it. Commonly these statutes employ a variety of mechanisms such as vendor disclosure statements, <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> rights and implied warranties all aimed at redressing the perceived information imbalance between buyers and sellers. Although the mechanisms are similar, all states and the Australian Capital Territory except Western Australia and the Northern Territory employ the statutory mechanisms in different combinations and ways. This is evident in the area of <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> periods which vary in length, starting point and regulatory complexity across all relevant jurisdictions. These parochial differences are commonly recognised as increasing compliance costs for businesses operating nationally with little or no research emerging as to the consumer benefits from the regulation. Through a comparative analysis of <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> regulation in each participating jurisdiction, the article suggests that increasing the complexity of regulation creates an imbalance in the relationship allowing the consumer to take advantage of a seller's technical non-compliance despite the fact the buyer is receiving substantially what was bargained for. The article concludes by suggesting considerations for achieving a degree of regulatory equilibrium between buyers and sellers under <b>cooling</b> <b>off</b> legislation which should satisfy the interests of sellers while meeting consumer protection objectives for the buyer. ...|$|R
