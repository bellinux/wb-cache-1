50|$|Another use of {{the term}} occurs in {{industrial}} refrigeration, specifically vapor-compression refrigeration. Normally, the economizer concept is applied when a particular design or feature on the refrigeration cycle, allows a reduction either in the amount of energy used from the power grid; {{in the size of the}} components (basically the gas compressor’s nominal capacity) used to produce refrigeration, or both.For example, for a walk-in freezer that is kept at , the main refrigeration components would include: an evaporator coil (a dense arrangement of pipes containing refrigerant and thin metal fins used to remove heat from inside the freezer), fans to blow air over the coil and around the box, an air-cooled <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> sited outdoors, and valves and piping. The <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> would include a compressor and a coil and fans to exchange heat with the ambient air.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of air-conditioning, {{the largest}} energy demand for {{buildings}} in the tropics, is increasing as regional population and affluence grow. The majority of installed systems are split type air-conditioners. While the performance of new equipment is much better, {{the influence of the}} microclimate where the <b>condensing</b> <b>units</b> are installed is often overlooked. Several studies have used CFD simulations to analyse the stack effect, a buoyancy-driven airflow induced by heat rejected from <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> This leads to higher on-coil temperatures, deteriorating the performance of the air-conditioners. We present the first field measurements from a 24 -storey building in Singapore. A network of wireless temperature sensors measured the temperature around the stack of <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> We found that the temperatures in the void space increased continuously along the height of the building by 10 – 13 °C, showing a significant stack effect from the rejected heat from <b>condensing</b> <b>units.</b> We also found that hot air gets stuck behind louvres, built as aesthetic barriers, which increases the temperature another 9 °C. Temperatures of around 50 °C at the inlet of the <b>condensing</b> <b>units</b> for floors 10 and above are the combined result, reducing the unit efficiency by 32 % compared to the undisturbed design case. This significant effect is completely neglected in building design and performance evaluation, and only with an integrated design process can truly efficient solutions be realised...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Recessed spaces outside {{high-rise}} {{residential buildings}} of public-type in Hong Kong often contain {{a large number}} of <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> of window-type air-conditioners that during summer reject heat into this space at the same time. For four <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> per story, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is used to predict temperature and flow fields inside the recessed spaces that differ in heights and condenser-unit locations. The results show that a powerful rising hot air stream and one vortex pair are formed in the space near to its corner wall. In addition, the results show that <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> will suffer more when they are placed inside the taller recessed space, and at locations higher at this space and nearer to its corner wall. Then, these units would draw less air at an elevated temperature, and therefore become less energy efficient and de-rated in output capacity and sometime have interrupted operation. However, the <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> at lower levels may benefit because they will draw more air at nearly environmental temperature. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|The {{subcooling}} {{process can}} happen in many different ways; therefore, {{it is possible to}} distinguish between the different parts in which the process takes places. Normally, subcooling refers to the magnitude of the temperature drop which is easily measurable, but it is possible to speak of subcooling in terms of the total heat being removed. The most commonly known subcooling is the condenser subcooling, which is usually known as the total temperature drop that takes place inside the condenser, immediately after the fluid has totally condensed, until it leaves the <b>condensing</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> used {{in central}} air {{conditioning}} systems typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming refrigerant vapor into liquid, a compressor to raise {{the pressure of the}} refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside. A typical configuration of such a <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> is as follows: The heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside. In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes, which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can move from outside to inside the unit. There is a motorized fan inside the <b>condenser</b> <b>unit</b> near the top, which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan. The fan is used to blow the outside cooling air in through the heat exchange section at the sides and out the top through the grating. These <b>condenser</b> <b>units</b> are located {{on the outside of the}} building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit. Of course, an electric power supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit.|$|R

50|$|Crankcase heat {{is common}} in air {{conditioning}} (cooling) systems where R-22 {{has been used for}} many years. The home owner often shuts off the disconnect to the outdoor <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> for the winter, leaving the compressor without crankcase heat. If the homeowner then starts the unit without some time for the heat to boil the refrigerant out the oil, damage likely occurs to the compressor. On start-up, the crankcase pressure reduces as soon as the compressor starts to turn. The refrigerant boils and turn the oil to foam. The oil and refrigerant (some of the refrigerant may be in liquid state) is pumped out of the compressor. Valve and bearing damage may occur and the compressor may be operated with a limited oil charge until it returns to the crankcase from the evaporator.|$|E
50|$|Packaged {{terminal}} {{air conditioner}} (PTAC) systems are {{also known as}} wall-split air conditioning systems. They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the <b>condensing</b> <b>unit</b> on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.|$|E

50|$|A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} unit designed to produce cool (chilled) water for space cooling purposes.The chilled water is then circulated {{to one or}} more cooling coils located in air handling units, fan-coils, or induction units. Chilled water distribution is not constrained by the 100 foot separation limit that applies to DX systems, thus chilled water-based cooling systems are typically used in larger buildings. Capacity control in a chilled water system is usually achieved through modulation of water flow through the coils; thus, multiple coils may be served from a single chiller without compromising control of any individual unit.Chillers may operate on either the vapor compression principle or the absorption principle. Vapor compression chillers may utilize reciprocating, centrifugal, screw, or rotary compressor configurations. Reciprocating chillers are commonly used for capacities below 200 tons; centrifugal chillers are normally used to provide higher capacities; rotary and screw chillers are less commonly used, but are not rare. Heat rejection from a chiller may be by way of an air-cooled condenser or a cooling tower (both discussed below). Vapor compression chillers may be bundled with an air-cooled condenser to provide a packaged chiller, which would be installed outside of the building envelope. Vapor compression chillers may also be designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit; normally such a chiller would be installed in an enclosed central plant space. Absorption chillers are designed to be installed separate from the <b>condensing</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
