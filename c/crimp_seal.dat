40|$|The {{combination}} of glass vial, elastomeric stopper, and aluminum <b>crimp</b> <b>seal</b> {{represents one of}} the principal packaging systems used to package diagnostic reagents, ophthalmic and veterinary medicines, and pharmaceutical products. This work states that elastomeric flat liners are an alternative to traditional stoppers. To confirm this position, several comparative moisture transmission evaluations are conducted to contrast the barrier performance of glued flat liners against stoppers in continuous thread closures on glass vials. After a review of several standard packaging integrity testing methods, this thesis demonstrates the use of coulometric titration as an alternative package system testing methodology. Coulometric titrators are commercially available, and coulometric titration is well established as a precise moisture determination method for determining the micro-moisture contents in both solid and liquid products. The accuracy of coulometric titration technique is well suited for discerning the slight changes in moisture content of hygroscopic products after being packaged in candidate high moisture barrier packaging systems...|$|E

40|$|Two cans {{containing}} plutonium {{bearing materials}} were found during radiography surveillance activities to be bulged. The cans had been stored in DOT 6 M shipping containers at the Savannah River Site. The {{material in the}} first can (Item CZA 96 - 179) was packaged can/bag/can configuration with {{the inner and outer}} cans being <b>crimp</b> <b>sealed.</b> The <b>crimp</b> <b>sealed</b> innermost can was clearly deformed from the radiography picture taken for surveillance purposes. This material had been stored in the shipping container since the mid 1970 s. The second can (Item 50014440) contained plutonium bearing material of a different origin. The material had been repackaged at the Savannah River Site in the mid 1990 's, and the repackaged can was stored in a 6 M shipping drum. A special puncturing tool, which secured the can and allowed for a very controlled puncture of both outer and inner cans was used in a glovebox. The glovebox has a dry air system and an argon supply. The puncturing tool utilized a non-sparking punch and an argon purge. The cans were repackaged into filtered outer cans.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for <b>crimp</b> <b>sealing</b> and severing tubes flush {{or below}} a fixed surface. Tube crimping below a fixed surface requires an asymmetric die and anvil configuration. The anvil must be flat so that, after crimping, {{it may be}} removed without deforming the crimped tubes. This asymmetric die and anvil is used when a ductile metal tube and valve assembly are attached to a pressure vessel which has a fixed surface {{around the base of}} the tube at the pressure vessel. A flat anvil is placed against the tube. Die guides are placed against the tube on a side opposite the anvil. A pinch-off die is inserted into the die guides against the tube.

40|$|The {{control of}} the <b>crimped</b> {{closures}} <b>sealing</b> {{is a serious problem}} for the quality {{control of the}} producers using such closures. The sealing of this closure is ensured by the pressure of a seal-ring between the container and the <b>crimped</b> closure. The <b>sealing</b> quality depends on the applied materials, crimped force on the crimping machines and other settings. However the closing force on the sealing can not be controlled directly, just in an indirect way by measuring the torque of the crimped closures. During the research we have specified the connection between the crimp force, the remaining closing force after the relaxation and the measurable torque, and we have also developed the right instrumentation for the quality control of crimped closure...|$|R
30|$|All fermentations were {{conducted}} in triplicate within treatment, under a CO 2 gas phase in volume-calibrated glass serum vials (Wheaton) of ~ 60  mL volume fitted with butyl rubber closures and aluminum <b>crimp</b> <b>seals.</b> Experiments {{were conducted}} using freshly collected and diluted ruminal inocula. Vials contained Goering–Van Soest medium (1970) reduced with cysteine and Na 2 S, along with the switchgrass [19  mg DM (mL liquid volume)− 1]. Total liquid volume in the vials was typically 10  mL, except for the NR concentration experiment (22  mL). Unless otherwise indicated, resazurin was added at low concentrations (0.008  mM) as a redox indicator to confirm (via decolorization upon reduction) establishment of reducing conditions in the culture media. Each redox mediator was dissolved in N 2 -gassed, deionized water to achieve a ~ 20  mM stock solution and added to fermentation vials to achieve the indicated concentration in the medium. Each experiment included control vials that lacked redox mediators, as well as blank vials that contained media and inoculum but lacked switchgrass or redox mediators. All experimental setup and incubations were conducted under non-aseptic conditions, with no sterilization of vessels, apparatus, biomass feedstocks, or culture media. Incubations were performed 39 °C in a static upright position for 72  h.|$|R
40|$|Layered LiMg 0. 1 Co 0. 9 O 2 {{has been}} {{synthesized}} using microwave assisted solution technique. The precursor {{has been subjected}} to thermo-gravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and calcined at 850 ◦C. The precursor and the calcined powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) to confirm the formation of single-phase layered material. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies were carried out {{to understand the nature of}} the metal–ligand bond and the observations were consistent with the XRD spectrum. Scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images have been obtained to understand the surface morphology and the grain orientation of the synthesized material.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigations to determine how process settings and crimp geometry affect the seal strength and integrity of traditional polyolefin and biopolymer flexible packaging materials. The results show agreement with previous studies where temperature and dwell time are found to be the dominant factors for both polyolefin and biopolymer films. Pressure and crimp geometry are shown to be secondary factors in the process, up to the point of squeezing the film into molecular contact. In general it is shown that biopolymers exhibit similar sealing characteristics to more traditional films. In respect of the <b>sealing</b> <b>crimp</b> geometry it is shown that the crimp pitch has little or no effect on sealing integrity for films with gauges between 25 µm and 40 µm. But, for the same gauge material, crimp angles greater than 80 ° offer the greatest potential to gain higher seal strengths. It is further shown that with the cellulose and PLA films tested, a higher seal strength can be produced with crimp pitches of 2 mm and lower. Also presented are some more general implications for guiding the selection of <b>sealing</b> <b>crimp</b> geometry and their usage with biopolymers...|$|R

Mtc. okinawensis was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney at the Iheya Ridge, Okinawa Trough (Takai et al. 2002). The base medium composition for TP was as follows (L− 1): 0.09  g KH 2 PO 4, 0.09  g K 2 HPO 4, 3.0  g MgCl 2 – 6 H 2 O, 4.0  g MgSO 4 – 7 H 2 O, 0.8  g CaCl 2, 0.33  g KCl, 30  g NaCl, 0.25  g NH 4 Cl, 10.0  mg NiCl 2 – 6 H 2 O, 0.24  mg Na 2 MoO 4 – 2 H 2 O, 4.9  mg NaSeO 4, 10.0  mg Fe 2 (SO 4) 3, 0.5 -mL resazurin solution (1  g L− 1), 10 -mL trace element solution, and 2.5  g NaHCO 3. The trace element solution contained (L− 1): 1.0  g NaCl, 0.5  g MnSO 4 –H 2 O, 0.18  g CoSO 4 – 2 H 2 O, 0.1  g CaCl 2 – 2 H 2 O, 0.18  g ZnSO 4 – 7 H 2 O, 0.01  g CuSO 4 – 5 H 2 O, 0.02  g KAl(SO 4) 2 – 12 H 2 O, 0.01  g H 3 BO 3, 0.025  g NiCl 2 – 6 H 2 O, and 0.3  mg Na 2 SeO 3 – 5 H 2 O. Batches of the culture in 160 -mL pressure-resistant serum bottles, each containing 20  mL of medium, were flushed with N 2 for 5  min, sealed with butyl rubber septums and aluminum <b>crimp</b> <b>seals,</b> and autoclaved at 121  °C for 20  min. The headspace for the TP comprised 100 kPa N 2, 100 kPa CO 2, and 200 kPa H 2.

5000|$|Another {{commonly}} used technique is the baking {{of food in}} aluminum foil packets. Food is wrapped inside a durable packet of tin or aluminum foil, <b>crimped</b> to <b>seal,</b> and placed on or under hot coals. Baked potatoes are commonly cooked this way but entire meals can be cooked in one packet. Besides aluminum or tin, organic material such as leaves (of tree, [...] "Nelumbo nucifera" [...] lotus, [...] "Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro" [...] bamboo aka Bambusa oldhamii (麻竹葉), phragmites, plantain, taro, etc.), husks (of corn, [...] "Phyllostachys makinoi" [...] bamboo (桂竹籜), etc.), and skins of fruit (citrus, etc.) are also frequently employed. Tree leaves such as those from the banana tree do not burn/ignite as they contain enough oil to resist {{the heat from the}} flames (at least until the frying is complete). The way to adapt recipes where food is wrapped in foil is to use a barrier such as baking or silicone paper between the food and the foil; the overall technique is similar to the en papillote technique developed in French cuisine, but uses a more robust container.|$|R
30|$|For the {{thermophilic}} coculture experimental set (hereafter, TC), we {{purchased a}} pure coculture of Syntrophothermus lipocalidus strain TGB-C 1 and Mtb. thermautotrophicus strain ΔH (DSM 12681) from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ; Braunschweig, Germany). Mtb. thermautotrophicus {{is one of}} the best-studied methanogens in terms of its genetic, biochemical, and biogeochemical characteristics (e.g., Smith et al. 1997; Kawagucci et al. 2014). S. lipocalidus was originally isolated from a granular sludge in a thermophilic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (Sekiguchi et al. 2000). The　syntrophism between these microbes was previously studied by Sekiguchi et al. (2000). In addition, the CH 4 –H 2 O hydrogen isotope fractionation for this syntrophic consortium has been previously investigated (Yoshioka et al. 2008). The syntrophic consortium was cultivated in the medium as follows (L− 1): 0.54  g NH 4 Cl, 0.14  g KH 2 PO 4, 0.20  g MgCl 2 – 6 H 2 O, 0.15  g CaCl 2 – 2 H 2 O, 25  g NaCl, 2.0  g NaHCO 3, 0.5 -mL resazurin solution (1  g L− 1), 1 -mL vitamin solution, and 1 -mL trace element solution. The composition of the vitamin solution was as follows (L− 1): 4.88  mg biotin, 8.82  mg folic acid, 4.12  mg pyridoxine–HCl, 6.74  mg thiamine–HCl, 7.52  mg riboflavin, 2.44  mg nicotinamide, 9.54  mg calcium pantothenate, 27.1  mg vitamin B 12, 2.74  mg 4 -aminobenzic acid, and 4.12  mg lipoic acid. The trace element solution contained (L− 1) the following composition: 1.27  g FeCl 2 – 4 H 2 O, 0.20  g MnCl 2 – 4 H 2 O, 0.13  g CoCl 2, 0.14  g ZnCl 2, 1.3  mg CuCl 2 – 2 H 2 O, 13.3  mg AlCl 3, 6.2  mg H 3 BO 3, 24.2  mg Na 2 MoO 4 – 2 H 2 O, 13.0  mg NiCl 2, 1.7  mg Na 2 SeO 3, and 3.3  mg Na 2 WO 4 – 2 H 2 O. Batches of the culture in 120 -mL serum bottles, each containing 40  mL of medium, were flushed with mixture gas of N 2 /CO 2 (80 : 20, v/v) for 5  min and sealed with butyl rubber septums and aluminum <b>crimp</b> <b>seals.</b> After autoclaving at 121  °C for 20  min, the headspace was pressurized with N 2 gas up to 150 kPa. After gas injection, 0.5  mL of the filter-sterilized reducing solution was added to the bottles. The reducing solution contained (L− 1) 6.25  g Na 2 S– 9 H 2 O and 6.25  g cysteine-HCl. Butyrate solution sterilized in an autoclave was added to the culture bottles at a final concentration of 20  mmol/L immediately before the inoculation. The amount of inoculum for each TC batch was 0.55  mL. Batches of TC were incubated at 55  °C in the dark without shaking.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, SOCOM {{requested}} Black Hills Ammunition {{to develop}} ammunition for the Mk 12 SPR that SOCOM was designing. For the rifle {{to be accurate}} out to 600 yards, Black Hills [...] "militarized" [...] a cartridge that used the Sierra 77 grain OTM (Open Tip Match) projectile; it switched from a [...]223 Remington to 5.56 mm case, increased pressure loading, <b>crimped</b> and <b>sealed</b> the primer, and added a flash retardant to the powder. The Mk 262 Mod 0 was adopted in 2002. Issues came up in development including reliability problems in different temperatures and when the weapon got dirty, and cycling issues in cold weather due to the slightly shorter barrel of the SPR compared to the full-length M16A2 barrel. The problems were addressed with a slower burning powder with a different pressure {{for use in the}} barrel, creating the Mk 262 Mod 1 in 2003. During the product improvement stage, the new propellant was found to be more sensitive to heat in weapon chambers during rapid firings, resulting in increased pressures and failure to extract. This was addressed with another powder blend with higher heat tolerance and improved brass. Also during the stage, Black Hills wanted the bullet to be given a cannelure, which had been previously rejected for fear it would affect accuracy. It was eventually added for effective crimping to ensure that the projectile would not move back into the case and cause a malfunction during auto-load feeding. Although the temperature sensitive powder and new bullet changed specifications, the designation remained as the Mod 1.|$|R
30|$|All {{pyrolysis}} {{experiments were}} {{performed in a}} gold-tube pyrolysis system at constant temperatures of 300, 330, 350, 360, 370, 390, 400 and 420  °C for time intervals between 24 and 360  h at a constant pressure of 50  MPa. These were carried out at the Petroleum Geology Research and Laboratory Center (PGRLC) of the Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development (Zhang et al. 2013). The error for the temperature was less than ± 1  °C. The tubes used in our experiments were 50  mm in length with an inner diameter (ID) of 4.0  mm and a wall thickness of 0.5  mm. The reactants were accurately measured and loaded into the tube. A series of anhydrous samples and two series of hydrous samples were loaded into the gold tubes. In anhydrous experiments, only 50  mg of kerogen samples were loaded, while in hydrous experiments samples were separated into two sets, one with kerogen plus 50  μg deionized water (δDH 2 O = − 55 ‰), {{and the other with}} the same amount of water and additional 50  mg of U-ore in order to magnify the impact of water and differentiate the effects of added minerals on the hydrocarbon generation. Air in the tube was removed by argon flow, and {{the other end of the}} tube was <b>crimped</b> and <b>sealed</b> by an argon arc welder with most of the sealed end submerged in liquid nitrogen. When reaction ended, the pressure was relieved, and the gold tubes were withdrawn. Before analysis, the tubes were weighed and compared with the preheated weight to determine whether leakage had occurred during pyrolysis.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{connector}} contacts {{are typically}} Beryllium copper (BeCu) or Phosphor bronze {{which is then}} plated with gold or some other non-corrosive, highly-conductive metal. The contacts are contained by a dielectric insulator (typically a layered construct of various polymers or glass depending upon connector series and manufacturer, and often known as the insert) and are housed in an enclosure (i.e., shell), that is often die-cast aluminum and plated or anodized for corrosion protection. The contacts may be captive or removable using a special tool. The electrical connection into the system at the contact terminal is either a soldered or <b>crimped</b> connection. The <b>seal</b> between the shell and insert may be moisture resistant or a hermetic seal. The inserts in each connector half must be oriented for correct mating, and the shell or insert usually contains a keying feature to prevent mis-mating that could damage the connector or result in an electrical problem. Cable clamps and other mounting hardware may be provided, and the mated halves are usually secured by a locking mechanism to prevent disengagements.|$|R
