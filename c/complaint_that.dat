5|$|A planned 2013 sale of WCLG (and its sister-station WCLG-FM) by Bowers Broadcasting Corporation {{was halted}} by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{due to a}} <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> the company buying the stations, AJG Corporation, has close {{connections}} with another local broadcaster, West Virginia Radio Corporation.

5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Christmas break, in a faxed letter to NDP {{candidate}} Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the Commissioner of the RCMP, Giuliano Zaccardelli announced the RCMP had opened a criminal investigation into her <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> it appeared Liberal Finance Minister Ralph Goodale's office had leaked information leading to insider trading before making an important announcement on the taxation of income trusts. On December 27, 2005, the RCMP confirmed that information in a press release.

No charges were laid against then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale.|$|E
5|$|In August 2015, Darabont {{requested}} to amend his original <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> AMC further reduced his profits from Season 2 as his firing mid-season {{meant he was}} not fully vested in the season, allowing AMC to reduce the profits paid him. Darabont's amended request points {{out that he had}} written and produced all the episodes in that season already and was entitled to the proper profit share. The judge granted this amendment in February 2016, partially influenced by concerns raised in Darabont's deposition.|$|E
5|$|Münchhausen's wife Jacobine von Dunten died in 1790. In January 1794, Münchhausen married Bernardine von Brunn, fifty-seven {{years his}} junior. Von Brunn {{reportedly}} took ill {{soon after the}} marriage and spent the summer of 1794 in the spa town of Bad Pyrmont, although contemporary gossip claimed that she spent her time dancing and flirting. Von Brunn {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Maria Wilhemina, on 16 February 1795, nine months after her summer trip. Münchhausen filed an official <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> the child was not his, and spent the last years of his life in divorce proceedings and alimony litigation. Münchhausen died childless on 22 February 1797.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the track, a <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning {{that they could not}} be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E
5|$|There are argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) galena {{deposits}} on Flat Holm; {{the pits}} and mounds {{visible on the}} surface of the island are a result of trial borings. A dispute over lead mining rights in the 1780s ended with John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart making an official <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> the lighthouse keeper was using the coals intended for the lighthouse for processing lead. Mining for lead was not profitable, however, and the works were abandoned. Red marl from the Triassic Period fills joints in the Carboniferous Limestone showing evidence of karstic (cave forming) processes during this period. Caves on the western and north-eastern sides of the island were used during the years of smuggling.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> {{may be caused by}} a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but {{is believed to be the}} result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{filed an}} appeal disputing the {{constitutionality}} of his first-degree murder conviction with the Utah Supreme Court. His attorney argued that Parsons had already been convicted of another charge for the crime, making his murder conviction a violation of double jeopardy. On October 16, 1989, the court unanimously upheld the conviction and rejected his appeal {{on the grounds that}} Parsons should have raised that objection before he waived his right to a trial with his guilty plea. On March 5, 1990, District Judge J. Philip Eves rejected Parsons' <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> he was denied his right to legal counsel while in prison and set his execution date for April 30, 1990. A new team of attorneys, which included Gregory Sanders and Ronald Yengich of the Rocky Mountain Defense Fund, took up Parsons' appeal that he had ineffective counsel during his trial. On January 12, 1994, the Utah Supreme Court rejected Parsons' petition for a writ of habeas corpus.|$|E
5|$|Simon Harwood, {{the officer}} who struck Tomlinson, was a police constable with the Territorial Support Group (TSG) at Larkhall Lane police station in Lambeth, South London. Harwood had faced 10 {{complaints}} in 12 years, nine {{of which had been}} dismissed or unproven. The <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> was upheld involved unlawful access to the Police National Computer. The complaints included a road-rage incident in or around 1998 while he was on sick leave, during which he reportedly tried to arrest the other driver, who alleged that Harwood had used unnecessary force. On Friday, 14 September 2001, before the case was heard by a discipline board, Harwood retired on medical grounds. Three days later, on Monday, 17 September, he rejoined the Met as a civilian computer worker.|$|E
5|$|After a large fire at Miss Knox's School (site of the Briarcliff Corporate Campus) in 1912, the department's {{equipment}} was upgraded {{to deal with}} larger fires. The village purchased its first motorized vehicle, an American LaFrance pumper truck. The existing hose-and-chemical wagon was motorized and became the chief's car. In 1914, the Briarcliff Manor Municipal Building was constructed to house the government and fire engines. The likeness of its garage doors {{can be seen in}} the façade of the present restaurant. Later in 1914 the department established sub-stations at Mrs. Whitson's barn on Pleasantville Road and on the Holden farm at Scarborough Road (roughly opposite the current firehouse); these were discontinued in 1921. The first major fire to involve the motorized vehicles was in 1916 at the central business district. In spite of the new equipment, several buildings at the northern end were destroyed. The 1908 hook-and-ladder truck was motorized in 1923 and two years later, the chief's car was replaced by another American LaFrance vehicle. An electric siren was installed in 1928 after a <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> the previous alarm sounded more like a call to breakfast than an alarm of fire.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, without resigning from Parliament, Kent Hughes {{rejoined the}} Army, {{becoming}} a {{colonel in the}} 8th Division. He served in the Malaya campaign of 1942, where he was again mentioned in despatches. Kent Hughes was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was kept in the Changi Prisoner Of War camp, where he was beaten and half-starved. In 1943 he was shipped as a slave labourer to Taiwan. In October 1944 he was shipped to Japan and on to Korea, and then sent by rail to Mukden in Manchuria, where prisoners of war were put to work in arms factories. In August 1945 Kent Hughes was liberated by the invading Red Army and returned to Australia with an amoebic <b>complaint</b> <b>that</b> would continue to bother him. While imprisoned, Kent Hughes secretly wrote what became Slaves of the Samurai, a colourful account of his wartime experiences, published in 1946. He also took up the case of Australian General Gordon Bennett, {{who was accused of}} cowardice and desertion after leaving Singapore without authorisation shortly before the city surrendered to the Japanese. Kent Hughes appeared before the Royal Commission into Bennett's case, and argued that Bennett was correct to avoid being taken prisoner and return to Australia to continue the fight.|$|E
