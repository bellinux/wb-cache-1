The object of research is a laboratory, four-stroke, DI diesel engine, operated at loads from 50 kW to 250 kW at a constant speed equal to 750 rpm. During the laboratory tests over 50 parameters of the engine were measured with its technical condition recognized as a „working properly” and with simulated leakage of both air intake valve and exhaust gas valve on the second cylinder. The results of this laboratory research confirm that the leakage of cylinder valves causes no significant changes of the thermodynamic parameters of the engine. Simulated leakages through the inlet and exhaust valve caused a significant increase in fuel consumption of the engine. Valve leakages cause an increase of the exhaust gas temperature behind the cylinder with leakage and behind other cylinders. The exhaust gas temperature increase is relatively small and clearly visible only at low loads of the engine. The increase of the temperature and pressure of the <b>charging</b> <b>air</b> behind the intercooler were observed too. <b>Charging</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is significantly higher during the engine operation with inlet valve leakage.

To date <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> control has, in the main, been passive; aiming only to reduce temperatures towards, but still above, ambient temperature. Driven by increasing specific output, the opportunities for sub-ambient charge cooling need to be investigated. For some real world driving conditions it is also desirable to raise the charge temperature. Air Cycle Technology ltd (ACT), working with the University of Huddersfield (UoH) are developing a controllable charge air cooling system, which will deliver charge air at sub-ambient temperature over a wide engine operating range. The system uses a turbo-expander to deliver air-cycle cooling in a simple and practical way. The system can be enhanced by combination with a charge air heating process. Accurate charge temperature control over as wide an engine operating range as possible is also addressed. The system is fully compatible with the operational, packaging and cost needs of vehicle OEMs. The paper presents the principle, process and application of a controllable charge air cooling/heating system. It covers the design and operation of the turbo-expander which delivers sub-ambient charge temperatures, the option of charge air heating and possible control methods.

40|$|Heladhanavi 100 MW Diesel Power Plant in Puttalam, Sri Lanka {{comprises}} of six 18 V 46 Wartsila turbocharged {{air cooled}} engines. Fuel {{consumption of the}} engines varies with the ambient conditions. It has been seen in hotter days fuel consumption is higher comparatively to cooler days. This study was conducted as per the requirement {{to find out the}} reasons behind this variation of the fuel consumption and to quantify the effects on the efficiency with respect to the charge air properties in relation to temperature and humidity. In this study the effect of <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> was analyzed performing two sets of experiments. A combustion analysis experiment (experiment 1) was performed to monitor what happens inside the combustion chamber during day and night times. This is to investigate the cause of efficiency variation and why and how it happens. Simultaneously a fuel consumption test was performed using the direct method with the fuel flow meter and energy dispatch readings taking in to the consideration. A humidity analysis inside the charge air receiver was carried out simultaneously to investigate the humidity effect on the combustion. A flue gas analysis test (experiment 2) was performed to determine the efficiency variation in day and night times through the indirect method. Along with this analysis the direct method was followed up to calculate fuel consumption to compare the results from the both tests. A humidity analysis inside the charge air receiver was carried out simultaneously to investigate the humidity effect on the combustion. For all the tests and analysis DG 02 at approximately Rhs: 55, 000 was selected to conduct the measurements as 48, 000 rhs major overhaul was completed recently. All the components in the fuel system such as pumping elements and injectors are in good condition. The cylinder head, liner and piston overhaul was also have been carried out. The experiments were planned so the lots other factors are not affecting the combustion efficiency during the process to isolate the ambient conditions. The experiments were also carried out during day and night times on the same day to minimize other factors such as fuel quality affecting the equations. Always the LHV of the incoming fuel was obtained for calculations to avoid further mistakes. The results are elaborated along with findings from the past studies in the Literature review. It was confirmed the fuel consumption is positively affected by the <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> while the efficiency is negatively affected. From the literature review it was found out the humidity in charge air affects positively on the fuel consumption while efficiency is negatively affected. The <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> affects the ignition delay period so that the peak pressure and then the combustion efficiency. The efficiency improvement is further confirmed by the flue gas analysis experiment as the loss in the flue gas reduces in night time comparatively to the day time. At Heladhanavi temperature and humidity in charged air behaves in completely opposite manner in day and night times. During day time temperature is high while humidity is low. For the night time case its vise versa. Finally it can be concluded that under the prevailing ambient conditions at the Heladhanavi Power Plant, Puttalam, Sri Lanka, the effect of <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is more prominent than the effect of humidity in the combustion process for the Wartsila 18 V 46 diesel engines, as a result the efficiency improves during the night time comparatively to the day time. Therefore, proper cleaning and maintaining of the charge air coolers are the most important factor to maintain the <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity inside charge air receiver at a lowest value.

40|$|Recently, {{diesel engine}} cycle {{simulation}} has been acknowledged {{as an effective}} way for the development and performance optimization of compression ignition engines operating {{on a variety of}} fuels. The goal of this research was, therefore, to develop a JP- 8 surrogate with a limited number of fuel components so that its chemical mechanism could be developed for its use with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for enabling time-efficient diesel engine cycle simulation. In order to achieve this goal, a new approach was developed for the formulation of surrogate for compression ignition engine application. The development approach required the surrogate to match several properties of the target JP- 8 fuel. A total of six different surrogates, with maximum number of components limited to four, was developed using a MATLAB code, Ignition Quality Tester (IQT), and HYSYS simulation software. Then, all the surrogates were tested in the IQT at different <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and the results of the tests were compared with those for the target JP- 8. The surrogate that best reproduced the auto-ignition and combustion characteristics of the target JP- 8 in the IQT was then selected for its validation in a single cylinder direct injection research diesel engine operating at different conditions. The similarities between the auto-ignition, combustion, and emissions characteristics of the surrogate and the target JP- 8 were then examined to underscore the validity of the surrogate development approach as well as the use of the IQT for surrogate development and preliminary validation. Finally, a reduced chemical mechanism of the surrogate was developed for its use with the CFD codes for diesel engine cycle simulation. The IQT tests showed that the two-component surrogate S 2 best reproduced the autoignition and combustion characteristics of the target JP- 8. The results of the engine validation tests indicated that the surrogate S 2 closely reproduced the autoignition, combustion, and emissions characteristics (Carbon Monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and oxides of Nitrogen) of the target JP- 8 at the tested conditions. However, the particulate matter concentrations were lower for the surrogate than for the target JP- 8. Further, the results of the 3 D CFD simulation, which utilized the reduced chemical mechanism of the surrogate S 2, were in fairly good agreement with the autoignition, combustion, and emissions data of the surrogate S 2 obtained from engine experiments...|$|R

Die vom Abgas auf das Kältemittel übertragbaren Wärmeströme reichen in weiten Teilen des Motorbetriebsfelds grundsätzlich aus, um den Dampfstrahlkälteprozess anzutreiben. Die kältemittelseitig notwendigen Antriebszustände konnten im einfachen Abgaswärmeübertragerprototyp erreicht und der Prozess kann problemlos über das Kältemittelantriebsdruckniveau geregelt werden. Die Wärmeübertragung im überkritischen Druckbereich des Kältemittels wurde durch ein Modell mit geeigneten Korrekturen der gängigen Nusseltbeziehungen mit einer mittleren arithmetischen Abweichung von nur 4, 7 % ausreichend genau abgebildet. Mit dem Modell der unterkritischen Wärmeübertragung wurden für die Arbeit ausreichend genaue Ergebnisse erzielt. Die Skalierung der Kälteleistung des Dampfstrahlkälteprozesses in den für die mobile Anwendung interessanten Leistungsbereich von 1, 5 kW bis 6 kW wurde mit für die weitere Kühlung der Ladeluft ausreichenden Temperaturhüben und absoluten Verdampfungstemperaturen von bis zu - 15 °C experimentell nachgewiesen. Die Mitführrate der Dampfstrahlverdichtung kann unter Berücksichtigung der Realgaseffekte bei gegebener Geometrie abhängig von den drei Ruhezuständen mit dem über einen physikalisch interpretierbaren Verlustkoeffizienten an die Experimente angepassten Simulationsmodell mit einer mittleren arithmetischen Abweichung von 7, 8 % berechnet werden. Die erzielbaren Ladelufttemperaturen von 12 °C bis - 3 °C sind bei Ottomotoren zur Wirkungsgradsteigerung nutzbar. Der zusätzliche Energieverbrauch für die Kältemittelpumpe sowie der Rückkühlbedarf, nicht aber der erhöhte Abgasgegendruck bzw. der Kraftstoffmehrverbrauch aufgrund des Anlagengewichts, gefährden allerdings bei geringen thermischen Wärmeverhältnissen die Vorteilhaftigkeit des Konzepts. Ein grundlegender Nachteil des Dampfstrahlkälteverfahrens ist zudem die Sensitivität des thermischen Wärmeverhältnisses gegenüber der Erhöhung der Umgebungstemperatur. Die hohen Prozessleistungsdichten sind der wesentliche Systemvorteil. The {{doctoral}} thesis at hand analyzes the characteristics {{and the potential}} of an exhaust gas heat driven jet-ejector cooling process working with R 134 a as refrigerant which is used for <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> cooling consecutive to the conventional <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> cooler of gasoline combustion engines in vehicles. The analysis focuses on the exhaust gas heat exchanger and the jet-ejector as core components of the cooling process which have been investigated separately by means of experiments and simulation. The heat flows transferable from the exhaust gases to the refrigerant are gene-rally sufficient to operate the jet-ejector cooling process almost in the entire operating range of the combustion engine. The necessary refrigerant-side conditions have been achieved in a simple heat exchanger prototype and the process may easily be controlled by the high side pressure of the refrigerant. The heat exchange at super-critical refrigerant pressures can be simulated with the developed model employing the adequate corrections of the well-established Nusselt relations with an arithmetic aver-age deviation of only 4. 7 % from the experimental results. The results of the model developed for the heat exchange at subcritical refrigerant pressures reproduce the experimental results satisfactorily for scope of the thesis. The down-scaling of the jet-ejector cooling process to the cooling capacity range of 1. 5 kW to 6 kW for the automotive application has been experimentally demonstrated. A sufficient temperature lift and absolute evaporation temperatures of down to - 15 °C for the continued <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> cooling have been achieved. The entrainment ratio of the jet-ejection can be calculated for a given ejector geometry dependent on the three stagnation conditions with an arithmetic aver- age deviation of 7. 8 % using a simulation model which accounts for real gas effects and allows a fit of the calculated to the experimental results {{by means of a}} loss coefficient with a clear physical meaning. The potential <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 12 °C to - 3 °C are adequate for improving the efficiency of gasoline engines. The additional energy consumption due to the refrigerant pump and the heat rejection demand, rather than the elevated back pressure or the additional fuel consumption due to the device's weight, may at low thermal coefficients of performance overcompensate the system's advantage. The high sensitivity of the thermal coefficient of performance to an increase of the ambient temperature is another essential disadvantage of the jet-ejection cooling process.

40|$|Currently, {{interest}} in different alternative transport fuels is growing. There {{are two main}} reasons for this motivation: the universal environmental concern, caused by the noticeable impact of petroleum fuels on the human health and environment, {{and the necessity of}} replacement due to the declining availability of petroleum. Dual-fuel engines could mean a partial solution of these worries, since the primary fuel of this type of engines is natural gas, mostly formed by methane, which can derived from both renewable and fossil sources. Diesel consumption is reduced by the introduction of some gas fractions, and dual-fuel mode allows, mainly, fewer greenhouse gas emissions. From the economic and environmental point of view, dual-fuel is, thus, highly desirable. However, from a technical standpoint, this technique has been proved to be difficult to realize and optimize. Therefore, this master’s thesis has the objective to serve as a support on dual-fuel research field, as far as the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) effect on combustion and emissions performance is concerned. Emphasis on the thesis was set, thereby, on the EGR rate variation effect on different engine parameters, such as lambda, cylinder pressure, exhaust gas temperature, <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> heat release rate (HRR), cumulative heat release rate (HR) or ignition delay, {{as well as on the}} NOx, THC and CO emissions performance. Based on the results of this master’s thesis it can be concluded that EGR rate raises lead on significant reduction of NOx emissions, as well as a slightly decrease of unburned hydrocarbons. CO emissions are not influenced at low EGR rates, performing a sudden increase for the highest ones, around 25 - 30 %. At the same time, combustion efficiency seems to decline with EGR, as seen from HR curves and CO emissions, obtaining extremely rich mixtures...|$|E
40|$|As the {{regulations}} for engine-out emissions {{around the world}} are getting increasingly stringent, dual-fuel (DF) combustion involving natural gas or methane as primary fuel ignited by a very small diesel pilot can be an attractive alternative to diesel only combustion in heavy duty engines of both road as well as marine applications. Natural gas or methane have potential for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions because of their high hydrogen to carbon ratio compared to diesel fuel. Their highly premixed combustion also produces less NOx than diesel as the overall combustion temperature is lower. Furthermore, they have huge potential for exploitation at competitive prices in regions such as India, China and North America, thus helping to reduce dependency on conventional diesel and gasoline. In this thesis work, an attempt has been made to characterize the DF combustion of premixed methane and diesel pilot with the help of optical and thermodynamic measurements. DF combustion experiments were carried out in a single cylinder, optical research engine with electro hydraulic valve actuation system and custom made engine control program that enable research with great degree of parameter freedom. Crank angle resolved images of Natural Luminosity (NL) resulting from combustion were acquired using a high speed CMOS camera. NL signals showing the development of premixed flame fronts, cylinder pressure traces, heat release rate (HRR) profiles and ignition delays are considered as tools for characterizing the DF combustion in this thesis work. Influences of methane lambda (λCH 4), of pilot fuel ratio (PR) and of <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> on dual-fuel combustion were investigated separately using three different case studies. From optical and thermodynamic investigations, it was observed that the ignition delay and shape of HRR in DF combustion strongly depend upon lambda of the gaseous fuel. With methane substitution rate ranging from 82 % to 88 %, when λCH 4 was varied from 1. 1 to 1. 9, it was observed that the periods of ignition delays were longer at both least as well as most lean case, with relatively shorter delays around the λCH 4 1. 5 region. The study of DF combustion as a function of PR revealed that the DF ignition delay decreased with increasing PR until a certain extent after which any increase in PR did not bring the ignition delay significantly forward. In the final case study, for both λCH 4 1. 1 and λCH 4 1. 8 cases, it was observed that higher intake temperatures shortened ignition delays, promoted second stage combustion and reduced cycle-to-cycle variations. However, at high intake temperatures, certain DF cycles also demonstrated excessive rates of pressure rise immediately after the onset of combustion. In summary, it is concluded that at high substitution rates (ca. 85 %) and light load conditions as experimented in this thesis, DF combustion is dominated by the premixed flame front propagation mode rather than by the characteristics of diesel diffusion combustion...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There are currently many factors motivating car manufacturers to reduce the tailpipe CO 2 emissions from their products. One of the major routes to achieving reduced CO 2 emissions in spark-ignition 4 -stroke engines is to ‘downsize’ the swept volume which, among other advantages, reduces the proportion of fuel energy expended on pumping losses. The full-load performance deficit caused by reducing the swept volume of the engine is normally recovered by pressure charging. One of the limits to pressure charging is combustion knock, which is the unintended autoignition of the last portion of gas to burn in the combustion chamber after combustion has been initiated. This thesis presents results from investigations {{into a number of}} methods for suppressing knock, including (1) tests where the density of the intake air is closely controlled and the effect of <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is isolated, (2) where the latent heat of vaporization of a fuel is used to reduce the outlet temperature of a supercharger, and (3) where the engine architecture is configured to minimize exhaust gas residual carryover to the benefit of stronger knock resistance. Extensive comparison of this resulting engine architecture is made with published data on other strategies to reduce the effect of the knock limit on engine performance and efficiency. Several such strategies, including cooled EGR, were then investigated to see how much further engine efficiency (in terms of brake specific fuel consumption) could be improved if they are adopted on an engine architecture which has already been configured with best knock limit performance in mind. Within the limits tested, it was found that if the charge air density is fixed then the relationship between knock-limited spark advance and air temperature is linear. This methodology has not been found in the literature and is believed to be unique, with important ramifications for the design of future spark-ignition engine charging systems. It was also found that through a combination of an optimized direct-injection combustion system, an exhaust manifold integrated into the cylinder head, and a 3 -cylinder configuration, an engine with extremely high full-load thermal efficiency can be created. This is because these characteristics are all synergistic. Against the baseline of such an engine, other technologies such as excess air operation and the use of cooled EGR are shown to offer little improvement. When operating a pressure-charged engine on alcohol fuel, it was found that there exists a maximum proportion of fuel that can be introduced before the supercharger beyond which there is no benefit to charge temperature reduction by introducing more. Strategies for reducing the amount of time when such a system operates were developed in order to minimize difficulties in applying such a strategy to a practical road vehicle. Finally, a new strategy for beneficially employing the latent heat of vaporization of the fuel in engines employing cooled EGR by injecting a proportion of the fuel charge directly into the EGR gas is proposed. This novel approach arose from the findings of the research into pre-supercharger fuel introduction and cooled EGR...|$|E

These components are utilised for precondition and aftertreatment of air, fuel and exhaust gas, which {{is involved in}} the combustion process. In this dissertation a methodology for a model-based function development with semi-physical engine models for control of air path quantities of an exemplary Diesel engine with high-pressure (HP-EGR) and low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation (LP-EGR) is developed. In this framework for function development black-box models for stationary and dynamical emission formation are utilised to optimise reference values for the air path control and to rate the developed control scheme with regard to the cumulated driving cycle emissions of the new European driving cycle (NEDC). A combination of HP-EGR and LP-EGR represents a novel approach to significantly lower the particulate and NOx emissions of Diesel engines. A semi-physical mean value engine model with lumped parameters is the base to analyse the system properties of the complex air path. In doing so, the additional LP-EGR shows only minor influences to the quantities <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> pressure and HP-EGR, while there are significant influences of these quantities on the LP-EGR mass flow rate. Furthermore, the LP-EGR is characterised by significant gas propagation times in the intake and exhaust system.

However, realtime <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> filtering models {{are essential for}} generating homogeneous climate data by transforming one <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> measurement system into another, and correcting in-situ <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> biases especially for non-aspirated radiation shield systems. This study investigated the <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> biases caused in the commonly used radiation shields in the United States, including the ASOS, MMTS, Gill, CRS, ASP-ES, and NON-ASPES shields along with corresponding temperature sensors. The realtime <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> filtering models developed for each <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> system are capable of removing the solar radiation and ambient wind speed effects on <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements taken over comparable vegetation surfaces at any weather station or experimental site...|$|R
40|$|The {{submitted}} {{thesis is}} focused on abrupt day-to-day <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> drops. The theoretical part describes the meteorological and physical-geographical factors which influence <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> Abrupt <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> drops were ascertained by daily data of maximum, minimum and mean <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> in order to detect their potentional varying seasonalities. In thesis were used data from Praha-Ruzyně station between 1 st January and 31 st December. The {{results indicate that the}} interdiurnal <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> drops vary in each temperature characteristics. While daily maximum <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> exhibit the greatest rates of decrease in summer months (July - August), the greatest drops of daily minimum <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> occur exclusively in December and January. Significant abnormality was ascertained during abrupt cooling {{at the turn of the}} years 1978 and 1979, when abrupt temperature drop was detect in both maximum and minimum <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> The seasonality of interdiurnal mean <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> drops exhibit changes of both daily maximum and minimum <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> In thesis is also discussed the unsuitability of specification of intrdiurnal air tepmerature changes based on daily mean <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> Key words: temperature drop, cold front, radiation cooling, interdiurnal chang...|$|R

25|$|The inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> relates {{strongly}} {{with the heat}} sink base temperature. For example, if there is recirculation of air in a product, the inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is not the ambient <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> The inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> of the heat sink is therefore higher, which also results in a higher heat sink base temperature.|$|R
30|$|<b>Air</b> <b>temperature</b> at {{the inlet}} of EATHE pipe plays a {{significant}} role, because {{the rate of}} heat transfer between air and soil is governed by the <b>temperature</b> difference between <b>air</b> and ground. Kumar et al. (2006) studied the impact of ambient <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> on outlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> It was noticed that, with the increase in inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> the outlet <b>temperature</b> of <b>air</b> also increases, but the amplitude decreases significantly. When the inlet temperature varied from 27 to 45.9  °C, outlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> varied from 23.8 to 27.9  °C for an 80  m-long earth air tunnel. Elminshawy et al. (2017) used a small laboratory scale EAPHE experimental set-up under controlled conditions of operating parameters such as soil bulk <b>temperature,</b> <b>air</b> flow rate, and induced <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> at three different compaction levels. It was noticed that, for a particular compaction level (at highest density), the cooling capacity of EAPHE system increases by 227 % when the induced <b>air</b> inlet <b>temperature</b> is increased from 40 to 55  °C. Niu et al. (2015) established a 1 -D steady-state control volume model and observed the impact of inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> on the performance of EAHE. It was found that, when the inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> was high, the decline rate of <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> in EAHE pipe was higher. For the inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 34, 32, 30, 28, and 26  °C, the highest and lowest decline rate of <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> was found for 34 and 26  °C, respectively.|$|R

40|$|The supply <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> {{set point}} for a singleduct {{constant}} air volume air handling unit (AHU) system is often reset based on either return <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> or outside <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> {{in order to reduce}} simultaneous cooling and heating energy consumption. Both reset strategies make engineering sense as long as the reset schedules are reasonable. Quite often the decision to use one over the other is made with the assumption that they will all achieve some sorts of energy savings. However, the impact of these two strategies on AHU energy consumption could be very different. A comparison of these two commonly used supply <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> reset strategies for a single-duct constant air volume system is presented in this paper. It is shown that from either the building energy consumption or building comfort point of view, the reset strategy based on outside <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> is inherently better than that based on return <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> Significant amount of heating energy savings can be achieved by switching from return <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> based reset to outside <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> based reset. The reset strategy can also benefit variable air volume (VAV) AHUs. An improved supply <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> set point reset control strategy is proposed by combining and staging the outside air and return <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> based resets...|$|R

Altitude flight conditions from 5000 to 30, 000 feet were simulated for a range of engine powers from 750 to 3000 brake horsepower. Slipstream rotation prevented normal pressure recoveries in {{the right side of the}} main duct in the region of the right intercooler cooling-air duct inlet. Total-pressure losses in the charge-air flow between the turbosupercharger and the intercoolers were as high as 2. 1 inches of mercury.

30|$|Table  7 {{shows that}} the inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> has got the maximum {{influence}} on <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> drop obtainable having a percentage contribution of 57.80 %.

The <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> drop produced by EATHE system highly depends on inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> because when the difference between inlet <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and soil temperature increases, more drop in <b>temperature</b> of <b>air</b> flowing through the buried pipes is achieved.|$|R
30|$|This {{survey was}} {{conducted}} from 2005 to 2008 regarding the thermal environment of three types of experimental houses—a wood and mud composite wall type (Type WM), a mud wall type (Type M), and an insulated wall type (Type I). To reveal {{the influence of the}} wall composition of wooden houses on the indoor thermal environment, each experimental house was constructed on the same site. As a result, under natural indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the monthly average indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> level and the time ratio of indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> surpassing the outdoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> were in the following order: Type I > Type WM > Type M. Type WM exhibited the highest phase shift of <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> indicating that the insulation performance and heat capacity affect the phase shift of <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> The equalization of indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> through the suppression of the increase in the indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> of Type M is likely caused by low insulation performance and large thermal capacity. The time fluctuations in electric consumption by air conditioning and indoor–outdoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> differences of each experimental house over 1  day indicated that a building’s thermal load and the thermal capacity are related.|$|R
