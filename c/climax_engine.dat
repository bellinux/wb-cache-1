5|$|The car was {{initially}} conceived in 1965 for a 1.5-litre (92-cubic inch) Coventry <b>Climax</b> <b>engine,</b> but never raced in this form. For the 1966 Formula One season the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) doubled the limit on engine capacity to 3litres (183cuin). Australian company Repco {{developed a new}} V8 engine for Brabham's use in 1966, but a disagreement between Brabham and Tauranac over the latter's role in the racing team left no time {{to develop a new}} car to handle it. Instead, the existing BT19 chassis was modified for the job.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1966 season, Stewart won the Tasman Series from his BRM {{teammate}} Graham Hill in two-litre BRMs and also raced closely with his great rival and friend Jim Clark who was somewhat disadvantaged by an unreliable Lotus 39 which was let down by its old 2.5 litre <b>Climax</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The car {{was first}} raced in the 1961 British Empire Trophy, where Rob Walker put Jack Fairman in the car, but the start was an inauspicious one as Fairman crashed on lap 2. In the British Grand Prix at Aintree, Fairman drove the car again, but {{surrendered}} it to Stirling Moss after his Walker-entered Lotus 18 failed. The car was disqualified for outside assistance on lap 56. The car's last major F1 race was its moment of motor racing immortality, as Moss drove the P99 {{to victory in}} a damp International Gold Cup at Oulton Park. In February 1963, the car, having been fitted with a 2.5-litre <b>Climax</b> <b>engine,</b> was driven by Graham Hill in the Australian Grand Prix at Warwick Farm and the Lakeside International at Lakeside, placing sixth and second respectively. The P99's final racing action came in the British Hillclimb championship in 1964, 1965 and 1966, with Peter Westbury winning the title in 1964.|$|E

2500|$|A 1958 {{advertisement}} from Saidel Sports-Racing Cars offered two models. The Jomar Mk2 (with fibreglass or aluminum bodywork and the <b>Climax</b> <b>engine)</b> {{was listed}} with the copy, only 930 lbs and [...] "Outhandles Everything." [...] The second model, the Jomar Coupe, an 1,172 c.c. fixed-head sports car. These cars utilised the same chassis. In 1959, Motor Sport reported: ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1956, Wilkinson and Pickard {{undertook}} {{to create the}} first original TVR body style, which would be fitted on the Jomar-style chassis. The body shape was created {{with the use of}} two Microplas Mistral nose sections, one for the bonnet and one (reversed) for the rear. Although never officially named, this car is usually referred to as the TVR Open Sports. The first car, painted red and fitted with a Coventry <b>Climax</b> <b>engine,</b> was tested successfully by Wilkinson at the Aintree Motor Racing Circuit in the summer of 1956. Either three or four TVR Open Sports were built in total, although the true number is not known due to incomplete records. One of the cars was provided to Autosport Magazine writer Francis Penn for testing. He drove it at Aintree and described its steering response and grip as [...] "superb".|$|E
2500|$|The same year, Brabham {{entered the}} famous Indianapolis 500 oval {{race for the}} first time in a {{modified}} version of the Formula One Cooper. It had a 2.7-litre <b>Climax</b> <b>engine</b> producing [...] compared to the 4.4-litre, [...] Offenhauser engines used by the front-engined roadsters driven by all the other entrants. Jack qualified a respectable 17th at 145.144 mp/h (pole winner Eddie Sachs qualified at 147.481 mp/h), and while the front-engined roadsters were much faster on the long front and back straights, the rear-engined Cooper's superior handling through the turns and the shorter north and south sections kept the reigning World Champion competitive. Brabham ran as high as third before finishing ninth, completing all 200 laps. Although most of the doubters in the American Indycar scene claimed that rear-engine cars were for drivers who like to be pushed around, as Brabham put it, it [...] "triggered the rear-engined revolution at Indy" [...] and within five years most of the cars that raced at Indianapolis would be rear-engined.|$|E

The [...] "Brickyard" [...] thus became known for its [...] "Yard of Bricks". After being widely ignored by Formula One drivers when it was an F1 World Championship event, a wave of F1 drivers went to the speedway in the 1960s, and the rear-engine revolution that was started by the Cooper F1 team changed the face of the 500 as well, with [...] and [...] world drivers' champion Jack Brabham of Australia qualifying his Cooper in 13th for the 1961 race. The Cooper used a smaller (2.7-liter) and less powerful Coventry <b>Climax</b> <b>engine</b> compared to the 4.4-liter Offy engines used by the other 32 cars and was slower on the straights, but many took note of the British car's superior handling through the turns. Brabham qualified 17th and after running as high as third, would ultimately finish ninth after completing all 200 laps. Despite this, many doubters claimed the rear-engine cars were for drivers who liked to be pushed around, though as Brabham said [...] "It started the rear-engined revolution at Indy".|$|E

5000|$|Bob King had {{experience}} with the working on and selling of automobiles. When King acquired an Elva he had the intention to race the car himself. This evolved into preparing race cars for others. He founded Racing Preparations specializing in Coventry <b>Climax</b> <b>engines.</b> After the demand for <b>Climax</b> <b>engines</b> decreased King and business partner Alan Cornock decided to focus on constructing race cars. In 1968 King founded Royale, named after the Park Royal area in London. [...] The first car was the RP1, RP for Racing Preparations. The car was designed by Bob Marston, a future designer for Lola Cars. The RP2 was the first production Royale of which 30 were built.|$|R
50|$|As the Coventry <b>Climax</b> <b>engines</b> were {{enlarged}} in 1952 to 2.2-litres, Chapman {{decided to}} enter Grand Prix racing, running {{a pair of}} Lotus 12s at Monaco in 1958 for Graham Hill and Cliff Allison. These were replaced later that year by Lotus 16s.|$|R

50|$|The first Coventry <b>Climax</b> racing <b>engine</b> {{appeared}} at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans {{in the front of}} one of two Kieft 1100 sports racers, but both cars (one with an MG engine) failed to finish the race due to problems unrelated to the engines. The FWA became popular in sportscar racing and was followed by the Mark II and then by the FWB which had a capacity of nearly 1.5-litres. The new Formula Two regulations suited the 1.5-litre engine and it quickly became the engine to have in F2 racing. The following year, the first <b>Climax</b> <b>engines</b> began to appear in Formula One in the back of Cooper chassis.|$|R

50|$|In 1959 - {{by which}} time the Coventry <b>Climax</b> <b>engines</b> had been {{stretched}} to 2.5-litres - Chapman continued with front-engined F1 cars, but achieved little, so in 1960 Chapman switched to the milestone mid-engined Lotus 18. By then, the company's success had caused it to expand {{to such an extent}} that it had to move to new premises at Cheshunt.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{minimise}} costs, Clyno ended their agreement with their long term partner Rootes and stopped using Coventry <b>Climax</b> <b>engines</b> in favour of concentrating on the Hillman design and this hastened the demise of Clyno.

50|$|At 450 kg, the new BRM P57 was {{heavier than}} its British rivals, and the <b>Climax</b> <b>engine</b> {{was no match}} for the V6 in the Ferrari 156.
