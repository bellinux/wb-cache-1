40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{overview}} was to determine the factors influencing the removal of infectious agents from red cell <b>concentrates</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration.</b> In general, the efficacy of the filtration method depends on the physical as well as the functional properties of blood cells. These properties are highly influenced by the changes exerted on the blood cells during blood collection, processing and storage and the filtration method itself. In particular, the removal of infectious agents of red cell <b>concentrates</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> will be determined by the type of virus and therewith the binding towards leukocytes, the type of bacteria and holding period before filtration, the deformability of infected cells and the disintegration of cells in the filte...|$|R

40|$|A new {{radiometric method}} for the {{detection}} of coliform bacteria in water has been described. The method is based on the release of 14 CO 2 from [14 C]lactose by bacteria suspended in growth medium and incubated at 37 C. The evolved 14 CO 2 is trapped by hyamine hydroxide and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The method permits the detection of 1 to 10 organisms within 6 h of incubation. Coliform bacteria suspended in water for several days recover from starvation and may be quantitated by the proposed method. Bacteria from water samples may also be <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> through membrane filters and detected by the radiometric assay...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of white cell (WBC) reduction in 16 -hour-old CPDA- 1 red cell (RBC) <b>concentrates</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> on a column filter and on three different flatbed filters were studied by electron microscopy, with {{special emphasis on}} cell-to-cell interaction, cell damage, and interaction of blood cells with the material. Generally, lymphocytes were removed by mechanical sieving and monocytes by adherence and mechanical sieving. Granulocyte depletion occurred by mechanical sieving, direct adhesion to the fibers, and indirect adhesion to activated and spread platelets. In the column filter, most granulocytes were captured by adhesion. In the coarse layers {{of two of the}} flatbed filters, indirect adhesion was most prominent, whereas direct adhesion was most prominent in the other flatbed filter. For the most part, granulocytes were captured by direct adhesion in the fine layers, but in one flatbed filter, capture apparently occurred by mechanical sieving. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the efficiency and the mechanism of WBC reduction depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the non-woven materials in the filters as well as the cellular composition of the RBC concentrates...|$|R
40|$|Enzymatic {{digestion}} {{of proteins}} generates {{biologically active peptides}} which can be <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> with the appropriate membranes. This work uses a hydrolysate derived from the New Zealand geoduck Panopea zelandica and compares the effectiveness of membranes with varying molecular weight cut-offs (MWCOs) and surface charges for carrying out selective separations of the peptides. A membrane with a MWCO of 2. 5 kDa {{was found to be}} most effective for obtaining the greatest differences between the permeate and retentate from the membranes when separating by size alone. For separating peptides based on charge the choice of membrane and pH was important. The results obtained suggested that each hydrolysate has different optimum conditions for achieving separation. A challenge when analysing the effects of membranes on peptide mixtures is quantifying the changes that have occurred. The work presented here introduced a multivariate approach to interpretation of complete sets of HPLC data that had not previously been used for analysis of complex peptide mixtures. This approach was used to measure the effectiveness of the membrane separations, and allowed comparisons to be drawn between these separations and the peptide bioactivity as determined using the FRAP assay...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In situ salinity, {{turbidity}} {{and temperature}} were measured at discrete depths and water samples for radioanalysis were simultaneously {{collected in the}} Columbia River Estuary using a specially designed instrument package. Particulate radioactivity was <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> and the dissolved radioactivity by evaporation or ferric oxide bulk precipitation. Radioanalysis was by gamma-ray spectrometry and data reduction by computer. Chromium- 51 was mostly dissolved and conservative in brackish water, while zinc- 65 was mostly particulate and non-conservative. The intrusion of salt water into the estuary was seen to greatly increase the concentrations of particulate chromium- 51, zinc- 65 and scandium- 46 near the bottom. The fall and rise in estuarine radioactivity levels were followed during an infrequent pause in Hanford reactor operations. Changes in radioactivity levels of up to three orders of magnitude were recorded at Astoria, Oregon, some 380 miles from the reactors. The pause in reactor operations enabled the determination of river flow times from the reactors to Astoria.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{presence}} and annual distribution of adenoviruses and hepatitis A virus in domestic sewage in the city of Limeira, São Paulo. Fifty samples with a volume of 8 liters each were collected weekly from December 2004 to December 2005. The viruses were <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> through positively charged ZP 60 S filter membranes, followed by ultracentrifugation. Human adenoviruses (HAdV) were detected by PCR followed by nested-PCR and screening for species F was done by restriction of the PCR product with TaqI endonuclease. Virus infectivity assays were performed <b>by</b> inoculation of <b>concentrates</b> onto HEp- 2 cell monolayers. RT-PCR was used for the detection of hepatitis A virus. HAdV were detected in all samples, and 64 % of samples were positive for infectious virus. Species F was present in 82 % of the samples. Hepatitis A virus was detected in 48 % of the samples. These results demonstrate that HAdV and HAV were present in the domestic sewage of Limeira throughout the period of study, demonstrating the importance of an adequate treatment before the disposal in the environment.

40|$|Some {{techniques}} {{available at}} our laboratory were tested {{for their ability}} to aid in the morphological diagnosis of hydatid elements (Echinococcus granulosus [“Taenia echinococcus”]) isolated from cysts in humans and sheep. Unstained, methanol-fixed hooklets were fluorescent, most starkly so under violet light (excitation filter wavelength, 405 nm; long-pass filter wavelength, 495 nm). Auramine-rhodamine and Gram procedures failed to stain hooklets. Ziehl-Neelsen stain yielded indifferent results when organisms were viewed under transmitted light but resulted in a surprisingly intense red fluorescence when organisms were viewed under green light (excitation, 546 nm; long pass, 590 nm). Wheatley trichrome stain gave better and more uniform results than fuchsin. Ryan trichrome blue stain was the best under transmitted light; hooklets stained uniformly and intensely and were easily distinguishable from the background. Very satisfactory results were also obtained with a much simpler procedure (modified Baxby technique: no fixation, steaming hot 1 % safranin for 2 min, and malachite green for 30 s). Therefore, Ryan and modified Baxby stains are recommended for the examination of E. granulosus under transmitted light. For fluorescence microscopy, Ziehl-Neelsen stain under green excitation light, or violet light with no staining, is also very useful. Epifluorescence microscopy is especially convenient for examining samples <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration,</b> as it renders the filter pores inconspicuous...|$|R
40|$|Background: Legionella {{species are}} {{ubiquitous}} in natural aquatic environments, capable of existing in waters with varied temperatures, PH levels, and nutrient and oxygen contents. Of 49 known legionella species, 20 {{species have been}} linked to pneumonia in humans. Contamination by legionella has occurred in the distribution systems of many hospitals. Aerosol-generating systems such as faucets, showerheads, cooling towers, and nebulizers are responsible for their transmission from water to air. Methods: A total of 113 water samples were gathered from different wards of 32 hospitals in different geographical regions of Tehran city. These samples were <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration,</b> treated with the acid and temperature buffers, and isolated on a BCYE agar culture medium. Results: A total of 22 hospitals out of 33 (26. 5 %) were contaminated by legionella species, and 30 samples (26. 5 %) out of 113 were positive. Chlorine concentration and pH level of the water samples were 0. 18 - 2. 2 mg/l and 6. 6 - 7. 6, respectively. Conclusion: The high rate of waste water contamination in Tehran hospitals with Legionella indicates the resistance of this microorganism to chlorine and other disinfectants, or inadequate disinfection process, representing the insufficiency of the current decontamination of hospital water distribution system. Thus identifying legionella species and their controlling in water distribution system of hospitals is of great importance...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS:Our {{previous}} report showed that IgG levels are strongly {{correlated with the}} indocyanine green (ICG) retention rate in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). This correlation suggests that hyperglobulinemia in LC {{could be explained by}} impairment of hepatic removal function. To estimate IgG turnover in LC, in the present paper was determined the advanced glycation end-products (AGE) on IgG as a marker of half-life. METHODOLOGY:Serum samples were obtained from patients with LC, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sjögren syndrome (SjS), and from age-matched control patients. IgG was purified from serum by the protein G-based affinity method, <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration,</b> and used for assay of Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), a predominant AGE, by ELISA. RESULTS:CML on IgG was significantly lower in patients with LC than in control patients, whereas {{there was no significant difference}} in total serum CML levels among patients with LC, RA, and SjS, and control patients. CML levels on IgG were negatively correlated with serum IgG levels in patients with LC, RA, and Sjögren syndrome SjS. CONCLUSIONS:Based on these findings, it is suggested that IgG turnover is not likely to be prolonged but rather may be shortened in LC It may be concluded that, hyperglobulinemia is primarily caused by enhanced synthesis followed by up-regulation of catabolism of immunoglobulins. 博士（医学）・乙第 1301 号・平成 24 年 7 月 26 日Hepato Gastroenterology © 200...|$|R
40|$|During this study, {{the effect}} of {{different}} processing methods on the microcystin quota (microcystins per cell) was investigated. Microcystins from two Microcystis strains and one Planktothrix strain were quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) after processing via; (1) direct freezing (no prior cell concentration) and extraction by freeze-thaw cycles, (2) cell concentration by centrifugation and extraction in methanol and (3) cell concentration <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> and extraction in methanol. Microcystin quotas were lower for samples <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> compared {{with the other two}} methods. In order to distinguish between extracellular microcystins actively exported from cells and those that are present as a result of cell lysis, a comparative microcystin export (CME) assay was developed using LC-MS to compare the proportion of extracellular microcystins with the proportion of extracellular non-ribosomal peptide which does not get actively exported. A culture-based experiment using the CME assay demonstrated the utility of this method and indicated that export from one of the Microcystis strains had occurred. With further validation experiments, the CME assay {{has the potential to be}} a valuable new tool for determining the occurrence of microcystin export. An in situ experiment was carried out in Lake Rotorua, Kaikoura, New Zealand, using mesocosms to study {{the effect of}} Microcystis sp. cell density on microcystin production, while measuring a wide array of abiotic parameters (temperature, light intensity, pH, dissolved oxygen and nutrients). Lake water was added to ‘control’ mesocosms in which cells were concentrated to different levels and added to ‘medium cell addition’ and ‘high cell addition’ mesocosms. The microcystin quota remained relatively constant throughout the study, despite induced changes in cell density and associated environmental parameters. These results indicate that cell density is not the only factor responsible for increased microcystin synthesis and that further investigation into the effect of stress inducing abiotic parameters such as pH and dissolved oxygen concentration may be required...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{efficacy}} of the removal of WBCs from buffy coat-reduced RBC <b>concentrates</b> <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> is determined <b>by</b> many variables. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of the filtration temperature, the wettability of the filter material, and the timing of the filtration after collection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The investigation used commercially available filters: 3 dry "online" filters (Cellselect FR, Fresenius Hemocare; BioR- 01 -max, Fresenius; Leucoflex LCG 1, MacoPharma) and one wet "inline" filter (Leucoflex LCR 4, MacoPharma) that contained saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol additive solution for RBCs and differed from the online version only in wettability. After buffy coat removal and suspension in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol, filtrations were performed immediately at room temperature (RT) and after 2 hours' storage of the RBC concentrates at 4 degrees C, while the Leucoflex LCR 4 was also tested after 24 hours' storage of the RBC concentrates at 4 degrees C. Sets of 12 pooled experiments were performed to prevent donor-dependent differences. RESULTS: The Cellselect FR gave significantly better WBC removal from RBC concentrates at 4 degrees C than at RT, with residual WBCs of 1. 44 +/- 0. 58 x 10 (6) and 2. 78 +/- 1. 23 x 10 (6), respectively (p < 0. 001). The BioR- 01 -max gave no significant difference: 0. 62 +/- 0. 27 x 10 (6) WBCs (at 4 degrees C) versus 0. 61 +/- 0. 25 x 10 (6) WBCs (at RT). Filtration with the Leucoflex LCG 1 resulted in 0. 06 +/- 0. 03 x 10 (6) and 0. 07 +/- 0. 07 x 10 (6) WBCs at 4 degrees C and RT, respectively, which is not a significant difference. The Leucoflex LCR 4, however, gave 2. 08 +/- 0. 84 x 10 (6) WBCs at RT, 0. 52 +/- 0. 44 x 10 (6) WBCs at 4 degrees C after 2 hours' cooling, and 0. 05 +/- 0. 10 x 10 (6) WBCs at 4 degrees C after 24 hours' cooling (all p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Temperature, filter wettability, and timing of filtration after collection influence the {{efficacy of}} a filter for RBC concentrates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{initiate}} development of a nonrefrigerated dairy dessert product. Milk was <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> pressure-driven <b>filtration</b> and then sterilized using ultra-high temperature (UHT) processing. Following sterilization, samples were aseptically inoculated with rennet to coagulate the milk, which was then stored at room temperature. These processing steps produced a dairy dessert that did not require refrigeration. I investigated the influence of total solids, milk fat, rennet dosage, storage temperature, and storage time on curd firmness and syneresis. I investigated the effect on curd firmness and syneresis of giving the concentrate a heat treatment prior to UHT processing. Chocolate and vanilla dairy desserts were prepared, and a taste panel was conducted to compare the dairy dessert with a ready-to- eat starch-based pudding. Milk <b>concentrate</b> obtained <b>by</b> reverse osmosis did not form a gel, whereas <b>concentrate</b> obtained <b>by</b> ultrafiltration did gel. Increasing the solids content of the milk concentrate increased curd firmness, but increasing the fat content of the concentrate decreased curd firmness. Curd firmness and syneresis increased as the concentration of rennet was increased. Products stored at 21 °C yielded firmer gels with more syneresis than products stored at 4 °C. Moreover, products stored {{for longer periods of}} time produced firmer gels and greater amounts of syneresis. Concentrate that received a batch heat treatment prior to sterilization reduced syneresis. The addition of cocoa to the concentrate inhibited coagulation.

Results: The wild type form of cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi and its C-terminal fusion to cellulose binding domain N 1 from Cellulomonas fimi were produced by genetically modified Escherichia coli. The maximum activity of cutinases produced in Lactose Broth in the presence of ampicillin and isopropyl &# 946;-D- 1 -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was 1. 4 IU/mL. Both cutinases had an optimum pH around 7. 0 and they were stable between 30 and 50 ºC during 90 min.

40|$|Oligosaccharides are {{the third}} largest {{component}} in human milk. This abundance is remarkable because oligosaccharides are not digestible by the newborn, and yet they have been conserved and amplified during evolution. In addition to encouraging {{the growth of a}} protective microbiota dominated by bifidobacteria, oligosaccharides have anti-infective activity, preventing pathogens from binding to intestinal cells. Although it would be advantageous adding these valuable molecules to infant milk formula, the technologies to reproduce the variety and complexity of human milk oligosaccharides by enzymatic/organic synthesis are not yet mature. Consequently, there is an enormous interest in alternative sources of these valuable oligosaccharides. Recent research has demonstrated that bovine milk and whey permeate also contain oligosaccharides. Thus, a thorough characterization of oligosaccharides in bovine dairy streams is an important step towards fully assessing their specific functionalities. In this study, bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMOs) were <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> membrane <b>filtration</b> from a readily available dairy stream called "mother liquor", and analyzed by high accuracy MALDI FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The combination of HPLC and accurate mass spectrometry allowed the identification of ideal processing conditions leading to the production of Kg amount of BMO enriched powders.

Notably 6 oligosaccharides contained fucose, a sugar monomer that is highly abundant in human milk, but is rarely observed in bovine milk.

The solid media were incubated at 32 °C, at 35 °C, and at 35 °C with CO 2 and read weekly. The results suggest that filtration of water for the isolation of mycobacteria is a more sensitive method for concentration than centrifugation. The addition of sodium thiosulfate may not be necessary and may reduce the yield. Middlebrook M 7 H 10 and 7 H 11 were equally sensitive culture media.

The sensitivity of the unincubated cycle E. coli (aerobe) {{was found to be}} 30 to 35 cells/m 1, and that of the Cl. sporogenes (anaerobe) was 1000 to 10, 000 cells/m 1. The lower sensitivity toward Cl. sporogenes is attributed to several factors, namely the lower cytochrome content, the tendency to sporulate, long lag periods and the lower growth rate of Clostridia in general. The operational procedures used for processing the incubated and unincubated samples involved the following sequence: (1) <b>concentrating</b> the sample <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> through a membrane filter, (2) washing with Dextrose-Thioglycollate Broth (3) incubating (0 to 4 hrs as required), (4) washing with 4 M Urea, and (5) reacting with reagent in front of a photomultiplier tube. The signal output was recorded on a strip chart recorder...|$|R

These fluids were concentrated in Visking dialysis tubing under pressure and the filtrates <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> ultrafiltration. While γc-globulins were the only antigens in the Visking tubing (Vt) filtrates that could be detected with anti-CSF sera, three other proteins were revealed by disc gel electrophoresis. The smaller form of the colostral γc-globulin was separated from these impurities <b>by</b> <b>filtration</b> through Sephadex G- 75.

30|$|Stably {{transfected}} HEK 293 cells expressing Angptl 2 -GST were cultured in 175  cm 2 flasks and the conditioned media harvested every 2 – 3 days, centrifuged for 2  h at 40, 000  rpm and 4 °C (Beckman Type 45 Ti rotor) {{to remove}} dead cells and debris, {{and applied to}} 1  ml GSTrap columns at 0.2  ml/min, using an FPLC maintained at 5 °C. Columns were equilibrated with buffer comprising 50  mM Tris–HCl, 150  mM NaCl, 1  mM EDTA, pH  7.5 at 5 °C (TBSE). For each preparation of Angptl 2 -GST, 2 – 2.5 liters of conditioned media {{was applied to the}} columns. The columns were then washed with 10  ml TBSE and eluted with TBSE containing 10  mM reduced glutathione (pH  8.0 at 4 °C). Twenty fractions of 0.5  ml were collected. To determine the elution and purity of Angptl 2 -GST, aliquots of each fraction were subjected to both SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A 5 -μl aliquot of each fraction was resolved on 10 % acrylamide SDS-PAGE and the proteins revealed using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250. In addition, 0.1  μl was resolved on 12.5 % acrylamide SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and revealed using Angptl 2 -specific antisera (Figure  2 B). Once identified, the fractions containing Angptl 2 -GST were pooled, <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> centrifugal <b>filtration</b> (Amicon Ultra- 0.5 ml; nominal molecular weight cut-off 10 -kDa), and dialyzed against TBSE (4 buffer changes, 1000 -fold buffer volume, 10 -kDa NMWT cut-off Spectra/Por dialysis membranes) at 4 °C. The final concentration of Angptl 2 -GST in each preparation was determined by separating both Angptl 2 -GST and a standard curve of BSA (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 2  μg; Figure  2 C) on SDS-PAGE.|$|R
40|$|The human gut {{is known}} to be a {{reservoir}} {{of a wide variety of}} microbes, including viruses. Many RNA viruses are known to be associated with gastroenteritis; however, the enteric RNA viral community present in healthy humans has not been described. Here, we present a comparative metagenomic analysis of the RNA viruses found in three fecal samples from two healthy human individuals. For this study, uncultured viruses were <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> tangential flow <b>filtration,</b> and viral RNA was extracted and cloned into shotgun viral cDNA libraries for sequencing analysis. The vast majority of the 36, 769 viral sequences obtained were similar to plant pathogenic RNA viruses. The most abundant fecal virus in this study was pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV), which was found in high concentrations [...] up to 10 (9) virions per gram of dry weight fecal matter. PMMV was also detected in 12 (66. 7 %) of 18 fecal samples collected from healthy individuals on two continents, indicating that this plant virus is prevalent in the human population. A number of pepper-based foods tested positive for PMMV, suggesting dietary origins for this virus. Intriguingly, the fecal PMMV was infectious to host plants, suggesting that humans might act as a vehicle for the dissemination of certain plant viruses...|$|R

Oligosaccharides are the third largest component in human milk. This abundance is remarkable because oligosaccharides are not digestible by the newborn, and yet they have been conserved and amplified during evolution. In addition to encouraging the growth of a protective microbiota dominated by bifidobacteria, oligosaccharides have anti-infective activity, preventing pathogens from binding to intestinal cells. Although it would be advantageous adding these valuable molecules to infant milk formula, the technologies to reproduce the variety and complexity of human milk oligosaccharides by enzymatic/organic synthesis are not yet mature. Consequently, there is an enormous interest in alternative sources of these valuable oligosaccharides. Recent research has demonstrated that bovine milk and whey permeate also contain oligosaccharides. Thus, a thorough characterization of oligosaccharides in bovine dairy streams is an important step towards fully assessing their specific functionalities. In this study, bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMOs) were <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> membrane <b>filtration</b> from a readily available dairy stream called “mother liquor”, and analyzed by high accuracy MALDI FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The combination of HPLC and accurate mass spectrometry allowed the identification of ideal processing conditions leading to the production of Kg amount of BMO enriched powders. Among the BMOs identified, 18 have high-molecular weight and corresponded in size to the most abundant oligosaccharides present in human milk. Notably 6 oligosaccharides contained fucose, a sugar monomer that is highly abundant in human milk, but is rarely observed in bovine milk. This work shows that dairy streams represent a potential source of complex milk oligosaccharides for commercial development of unique dairy ingredients in functional foods that reproduce the benefits of human milk...|$|R
40|$|The {{horizontal}} transmission of Clostridium difficile {{in the hospital}} environment is difficult to establish. Current methods to detect C. difficile spores on surfaces are not quantitative, lack sensitivity, and are protracted. We propose a novel rapid method to detect and quantify C. difficile contamination on surfaces. Sponge swabbing was compared to contact plate sampling to assess the in vitro recovery of C. difficile ribotype 027 contamination (100, 101, or 102 CFU of spores) from test surfaces (a bed rail, a stainless steel sheet, or a polypropylene work surface). Sponge swab contents were <b>concentrated</b> <b>by</b> vacuum <b>filtration,</b> and the filter membrane was plated onto selective agar. The efficacy of each technique for the recovery of C. difficile from sites in the clinical environment that are touched at a high frequency was evaluated. Contact plates recovered 19 to 32 % of the total contam-ination on test surfaces, whereas sponge swabs recovered 76 to 94 % of the total contamination, and contact plates failed to detect C. difficile contamination below a detection limit of 10 CFU/ 25 cm 2 (0. 4 CFU/cm 2). In use, contact plates failed to detect C. diffi-cile contamination (0 / 96 contact plates; 4 case wards), while sponge swabs recovered C. difficile from 29 % (87 / 301) of the sur-faces tested in the clinical environment. Approximately 74 % (36 / 49) of {{the area in the}} vicinity of the patient was contaminated (1. 34 6. 88 CFU/cm 2 C. difficile spores). Reservoirs of C. difficile extended to beyond the areas near the patient: a dirty utility room sink (2. 26 5. 90 CFU/cm 2), toilet floor (1. 87 2. 40 CFU/cm 2), and chair arm (1. 33 4. 69 CFU/cm 2). C. difficile was pres-ent on floors in 90 % of case wards. This study highlights that sampling with a contact plate may fail to detect C. difficile con-tamination and result in false-negative reporting.
