5|$|In {{addition}} to painting and stained glass, Burne-Jones {{worked in a}} variety of crafts; including designing <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles,</b> jewellery, tapestries, mosaics and book illustration, most famously designing woodcuts for the Kelmscott Press's Chaucer in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{framework of}} the building utilises a simple system of reinforced concrete beams and slabs, and was originally clad in square mosaic and rectangular <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> on its walls and columns. The building's foundation comprises large diameter bored piles installed in decomposed sandstone. Beams span an average 7.6 metres except at the main entrance where post-tensioned concrete beams span 15 metres. The auditorium is roofed over by 24-metre long steel trusses with a composite reinforced concrete covering.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Preckwinkle {{decided to}} paint over two 36-year-old, unmaintained and {{severely}} damaged public murals in the 47th Street Metra underpass. The murals {{had been created}} by graffiti artists, working with permission from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, and had represented themes that included Latin-American, African, Mayan, Indian, and Native American spiritual practices. The walls were later covered with newly commissioned murals: one {{is made up of}} a series of <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> and the other is a traditional painted mural featuring the city and important historical South Side figures, including former Alderman Dorothy Tillman.|$|E
5|$|Shin used archival {{photographs}} of the 2nd and 3rd Avenue Elevated train (El) to create compositions in ceramic tile, glass mosaic, and laminated glass. The imagery is manipulated and re-configured with each level having a different design. On the south east-corner entrance at Third Avenue, there are <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s. At the mezzanine, a mosaic reveals the sky where the train had previously been present. The platform level features semi-transparent and reflective glass depicting vintage scenes of the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after, Gaudí {{received}} an important new commission from Güell: {{the construction of}} his family house, in the Carrer Nou de la Rambla in Barcelona. The Palau Güell (1886–1888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions {{such as those in}} Carrer Montcada. Gaudí designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent parabolic arch above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan Oñós. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it is the core of the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaudí used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here. He designed the interior of the palace with a sumptuous Mudejar-style decoration, where the wood and iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a remarkable feature, faced in vividly coloured <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles,</b> as is the tall spire {{in the form of a}} lantern tower, which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> and topped with an iron weather vane.|$|E

5|$|Taoist temples in {{southern}} China and Taiwan may often {{be identified by}} their roofs, which feature dragons and phoenixes made from multi-colored <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles.</b> They also stand for the harmony of yin and yang (with the phoenix representing yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, {{as well as on}} the hairpin of a Celestial Master. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church was {{unmatched}} in its ceramic decoration by any {{church in}} Preslav, {{and was the}} only known building {{in the city to}} rely heavily on polychrome <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles.</b> Ceramic and mosaic icons were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of the images were enclosed in ellipses.|$|E
5|$|The Parque D. Carlos I {{is a large}} park in {{the centre}} of town. The park {{contains}} a doughnut-shaped lake with a small island in the middle. Visitors can rent rowboats on the lake. The José Malhoa Museum sits {{in the middle of}} the park. The Jardim da Água (Water Garden) is a large-scale outdoor sculpture combining concrete, <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles,</b> and water. Caldas has three mid-18th-century baroque fountains which were declared properties of public interest in 1982: Chafariz da Estrada da Foz (Fountain of Foz do Arelho Road), Chafariz da Rua Nova (Fountain of the New Street), and Chafariz das Cinco Bicas (Fountain of the Five Spouts).|$|E

5|$|The church {{featured}} ample {{exterior and}} interior decoration. While the facades were decorated with arches and <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles,</b> the interior floor mosaics were made of white, yellow and pink marble as well as semi-precious gemstones like sapphire and porphyry. The interior walls were covered with frescoes and mosaics. However, none of the interior decoration has survived. During the church's 20th-century reconstruction, its interior was repainted by artist Teofan Sokerov, who depicted important moments of medieval Bulgarian history in a modernist style. Due to these murals, the church has never been reconsecrated and remains inactive. The facade of the cathedral also includes a stone with a donor's inscription of a Bulgarian ruler, which ended up {{as part of the}} building material.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were single-storey structures {{to allow for}} future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
5|$|La Giralda, {{located near}} Plaza de la Soledad, is {{a replica of}} the Giralda in Sevilla. The {{structure}} was completed in 1930 by a local businessman for commercial intent. Built in the neo-Arab Andalusian regionalist style, it is decorated with <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> and metal work and has the symbol of Mercury embossed on it as symbol of commerce. In 1978, Telefónica acquired the building and refurbished it, established operating offices. In 1998, Telefónica vacated the structure, and four years later, offered the structure to potential buyers for €4.2 million. No buyer was uncovered, and Telefónica announced plans to reestablish local offices in the Giralda but later abandoned it. Various proposals for the local government to acquire the building have been made, including plans for appropriating an expansion of the Museum of Fine Arts, a regional cultural centre, and an Easter-centric museum, Easter being a major touristic draw for the city.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles,</b> which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a fifth floor for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed <b>ceramic</b> <b>tiles</b> in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E

As the flooring industry grew, especially the Italian <b>ceramic</b> <b>tile</b> market, MAPEI recognized {{a need for}} setting materials that would make tile installation faster and more secure, and developed products accordingly.|$|R
