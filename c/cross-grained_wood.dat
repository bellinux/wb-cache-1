Don.) is not entirely satisfactory". Therefore, the timber will usually be complementary to that of Pinus radiata, not an alternative. Some of the special-purpose end uses advocated were; furniture, veneer, turnery, exterior joinery, boat building and tool handles. Puriri has fulfilled these roles in the past. Other potential roles for puriri include post, wharf and bridge pilings, as pine requires {{a high degree of}} preservative treatment and can break too readily under pressure due to lack of <b>cross-grained</b> <b>wood.</b> Indications are that puriri could coppice well, and, as it is one of New Zealand's most demanded burning timbers, it might prove suitable as a source of biomass or for charcoal production.|$|E
