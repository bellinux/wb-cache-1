40|$|The {{first step}} in {{developing}} or updating a licensure or certification examination is to conduct a job or task analysis. Following completion of the job analysis, a survey validation study is performed to validate {{the results of the}} job analysis and to obtain task ratings so that an examination blueprint may be created. Psychometricians and job analysts have spent years arguing over the choice of scales that should be used to evaluate job tasks, as well as how those scales should be combined to create an examination blueprint. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between individual and <b>composite</b> <b>rating</b> scales, examine how that relationship varied across industries, sample sizes, task presentation order, and number of tasks rated, and evaluate whether examination blueprint weightings would differ based on the choice of scales or composites of scales used. Findings from this study should be used to guide psychometricians and job analysts in their choice of rating scales, choice of <b>composites</b> of <b>rating</b> scales, and how to create examination blueprints based upon individual and/or <b>composite</b> <b>rating</b> scales. A secondary data analysis was performed to help answer some of these questions. As part of the secondary data analysis, data from 20 survey validation studies performed during a five year period were analyzed. Correlations were computed between 29 pairings of individual and <b>composite</b> <b>rating</b> scales to see if there were redundancies in task ratings. Meta-analytic techniques were used to evaluate the relationship between each pairing of rating scales and to determine if the relationship between pairings of rating scales was impacted by several factors. Lastly, sample examination blueprints were created from several individual and <b>composite</b> <b>rating</b> scales to determine if the rating scales that were used to create the examination blueprints would ultimately impact the weighting of the examination blueprint. The results of this study suggest that there is a high degree of redundancy between certain pairs of scales (i. e., the Importance and Criticality rating scale are highly related), and a somewhat lower degree of redundancy between other rating scales; but that the same relationship between rating scales is observed across many variables, including the industry for which the job analysis was being performed. The results also suggest the choice of rating scales used to create examination blueprints does not have a large effect on the finalized examination blueprint. This finding is especially true if a <b>composite</b> <b>rating</b> scale is used to create the weighting on the examination blueprint...|$|R

It is unknown whether TAVR can be safely introduced to lower-risk patients. ObjectivesThe NOTION (Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention Trial) randomized clinical trial compared TAVR with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in an all-comers patient cohort. MethodsPatients ≥ 70 years old with severe aortic valve stenosis and no significant coronary artery disease were randomized 1 : 1 to TAVR using a self-expanding bioprosthesis versus SAVR. The primary outcome was the <b>composite</b> <b>rate</b> of death from any cause, stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) at 1 year. ResultsA total of 280 patients were randomized at 3 Nordic centers. Mean age was 79. 1 years, and 81. 8 % were considered low-risk patients. In the intention-to-treat population, {{no significant difference in}} the primary endpoint was found (13. 1 % vs. 16. 3 %; p = 0. 43 for superiority). The result did not change in the as-treated population. No difference in the rate of cardiovascular death or prosthesis reintervention was found. Compared with SAVR-treated patients, TAVR-treated patients had more conduction abnormalities requiring pacemaker implantation, larger improvement in effective orifice area, more total aortic valve regurgitation, and higher New York Heart Association functional class at 1 year. SAVR-treated patients had more major or life-threatening bleeding, cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury (stage II or III), and new-onset or worsening atrial fibrillation at 30 days than did TAVR-treated patients. ConclusionsIn the NOTION trial, no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR was found for the <b>composite</b> <b>rate</b> of death from any cause, stroke, or MI after 1 year.

40|$|Issue no. 4 of >i>Economic Research>/i> (1979) {{published}} our article "Some Problems in the Formation of Socialist Planned Prices," {{in which}} we expressed the view that there were advantages but also disadvantages to formulating the planned price according to the average wage profit rate, the average cost profit rate, and the average capital profit rate of the entire society, {{and that it is}} inappropriate to take any of these factors as the sole criterion for determining prices. There we advocated using the average cost profit rate of the various sectors as the primary criterion in determining the profit rate in the planned price, while giving full consideration to the overall average capital profit rate of the society and the average wage profit of the sectors so as {{to take care of their}} different economic interests. The central theme of the proposition was to take all three profit rates into consideration and set the price according to a <b>composite</b> <b>rate</b> of profit. After two years of further discussion, we still maintain that price ought to be determined on the basis of a <b>composite</b> <b>rate</b> of profit, but we have made certain revisions of our proposition. We now believe that the average capital profit rate for society as a whole should be taken as the primary factor and the all-society average wage profit rate as the secondary factor, and thus we can calculate the cost profit rate of the different sectors and use it to determine the profit of the planned price and formulate the theoretical price. Here we would like to set forth some of our ideas and hope thereby to learn something more from our comrades. ...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—Quality of care {{delivered}} in the inpatient and ambulatory settings may be correlated within an integrated health system such as the Veterans Health Administration. We examined the correlation between stroke care quality at hospital discharge and within 6 months postdischarge. Methods—We conducted a cross-sectional hospital-level correlation analyses of chart-abstracted data for 3467 veterans discharged alive after an acute ischemic stroke from 108 Veterans Health Administration medical centers and 2380 veterans with postdischarge follow-up within 6 months in fiscal year 2007. Four risk-standardized processes of care represented discharge care quality: prescription of antithrombotic and antilipidmic therapy, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and tobacco cessation counseling along with a composite measure of defect-free care. Five risk-standardized intermediate outcomes represented postdischarge care quality: achievement of blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, international normalized ratio, and glycosylated hemoglobin target levels, and delivery of appropriate treatment for poststroke depression along with a composite measure of achieved outcomes. Results—Median risk-standardized <b>composite</b> <b>rate</b> of defect-free care at discharge was 79 %. Median risk-standardized postdischarge rates of achieving goal were 56 % for blood pressure, 36 % for low-density lipoprotein, 41 % for international normalized ratio, 40 % for glycosylated hemoglobin, and 39 % for depression management and the median risk-standardized composite 6 -month outcome rate was 44 %. The hospital <b>composite</b> <b>rate</b> of defect-free care at discharge was correlated with meeting the low-density lipoprotein goal (r= 0. 31; P= 0. 007) and depression management (r= 0. 27; P= 0. 03) goal but was not correlated with blood pressure, international normalized ratio, glycosylated hemoglobin goals, nor with the composite measure of achieved postdischarge outcomes (probability values > 0. 13).
