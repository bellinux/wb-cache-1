40|$|Criminal {{personality}} {{for thousands}} of years is the object of philosophical research. For philosophical anthropology, in particular, {{it is important to understand}} which components of human nature can be regarded as criminal. The term “hubris” that appears in ancient Greek culture, today received its second wind. It is widely used (especially in the West) to refer to the human outlook, which provokes too arrogant, defiant behavior, which is a public danger. The term “hubris” is often used in criticism of certain politicians. However, we propose to expand the scope of its application also in other spheres of public life. Іn the history of criminology there are many examples of people with hubris, especially among dangerous criminals. Therefore hubris can be considered as <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factor</b> that requires research and limitations of the society. In another case, there is a situation, by analogy with the term “intoxication of power”, can be called “intoxication of impunity”. This thesis is confirmed by authoritative theories developed in criminology, sociology, psychology too. It is also consistent with some modern philosophical views on the nature of the criminal personality. Analysis of factors that stimulate the emergence and growth of hubris, suggest that most are present in a mass society. It generates anomie (loss of values) that щаеут manifests as hubris that can act as <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factor.</b> Therefore, hubris reducing requires changes in the organization of social life...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of parole supervision {{is to help}} parolees live a more pro-social life in the community, that is, to desist from committing crime. Identifying factors that are perceived by parole officers and parolees {{to be important in}} crime desistance could improve success in parole supervision and the understanding of crime desistance. Thirty-four parole officers and 61 parolees from six major cities in western Canada completed a 30 item survey questionnaire on how much (on a five-point rating scale) they agree or disagree with different markers for crime desistance. In a semi-structured interview, the same participants were also asked to respond to the general question of what they would consider to be important markers for crime desistance. The interview responses were content analyzed using the smallest meaningful unit of analysis. Parolees and parole officers generally agreed on most factors related to crime desistance. Whereas parolees recognized important criminogenic and protective factors key to crime desistance when asked by way of the questionnaire, they tended, when interviewed, to place more emphasis on subjective and experiential factors such as motivation and encouragement than on external factors such as peer group and employment. Parole officers ’ views tended to be more balanced. The similarities in the views of parole officers and parolees provide further support for the use of current approaches in parole supervision (Bonta & Cormier, 1999). However, parole officers should also pay attention to the parolees ’ personal and subjective views of what they consider to be important to them in crime desistance, an important responsivity factor. For case management and service delivery in the community, parole officers with Correctional Service Canada use a general framework that includes a clear understanding of an offender’s criminogenic needs or factors related to offending (Bonta & Cormier, 1999). Parole officers in many other jurisdictions use similar approaches. Although this approach is supported by empirical research, its use in parole supervision has been criticized recently for focusing too much on <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E

We use a survey of crime analysts to identify sources of this disconnect between the two fields as well as discuss potential remedies to the problem. Increased interaction between the two fields and recognition of the valuable contributions of each will lead to better analysis and problem-solving by both environmental criminologists and crime analysts, and ultimately the reduction and prevention of crime...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the rising {{number of people with}} serious mental illness (PSMI) {{in the criminal justice system}} and suggests remedies for improving care and services for this troubled population. Of note, mental illness is not the prima-ry cause of criminal behavior nor is deinstitutionalization principally responsible for the disproportionate criminal justice system representation of PSMI. Rather, harsh crime control policies and draconian drug laws, in particular, account for the apparently large numbers of PSMI who are arrested and incarcerated. Recommendations are offered for service providers to focus on the ameliora-tion of <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factors,</b> not simply on treating mental illness among PSMI in the criminal justice system. Furthermore, larger investments should be made in treating co-occurring disorders and funding aftercare services, which are essential to maintaining treatment gains and sustaining recovery...|$|R

We also found that childhood animal abuse, personal distress (i. e., anxiety from interpersonal interactions), and empathetic concern were significant correlates of indirect forms of animal abuse (i. e., a person was the perceived provocateur, the animal an alternative outlet for aggression).

It is argued that this ongoing rejection of regulatory requirements provides evidence of an entrenched view in some areas, that the ‘penalties do not fit the crime’. The paper will also consider how, as part of a balanced approached to compliance, strategies that promote ‘trust’ between regulators and the regulated may ultimately assist in altering these attitudes and improve levels of voluntary regulatory compliance...|$|R

40|$|Human {{trafficking}} {{is considered}} one of the most serious criminal offences, which is presented as a contemporary form of slavery and which implies the most brutal violation of basic human rights, which are guaranteed by international and law and national law.

Therefore, this paper will focus on external <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factors</b> that influence the growth of this negative phenomenon, including the difficult economic situation, poverty and unemployment, poor housing, migration of people, domestic violence, the impact of mass media in society, lack of border control and insufficient effectiveness of institutions to deal with law enforcement.

Evidence from the theoretical and research literature {{will be used to}} highlight the extent of this problem and the significant role played by a coercive style of family interaction in its aetiology. We put forward our view that a useful approach to tackling non-sexual criminal and antisocial behaviour among juvenile sexual offenders is with reference to the "what works" literature concerning young people who present with Conduct Disorder. Consistent with ideas presenting an aetiological role for dysfunctional family interaction in sexual and nonsexual criminal and antisocial behaviour, the what works literature provides an evidence base that points to a continuum of therapeutic response ranging from parental behavioural training, to functional family therapy, multi-systemic therapy, and special foster care placement. We conclude the chapter by illustrating a functional family therapy approach to assessing, formulating, and intervening with a young person whose sexually abusive behaviour is part of more general criminal and antisocial activities with reference to a case example...|$|R
40|$|Spatial and spatiotemporal {{analyses}} are exceedingly relevant to determine <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factors.</b> The estimation of Poisson and negative binomial models (NBM) {{is complicated by}} spatial autocorrelation. Therefore, first, eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) is introduced as a method for spatiotemporal mapping to uncover time-invariant crime patterns. Second, it is demonstrated how ESF is effectively used in criminology to invalidate model misspecification, i. e., residual spatial autocorrelation, using a nonviolent crime dataset for the metropolitan area of Houston, Texas, over the period 2005 – 2010. The results suggest that local and regional geography significantly contributes to the explanation of crime patterns. Furthermore, common space-time eigenvectors selected {{on an annual basis}} indicate striking spatiotemporal patterns persisting over time. The findings about the driving forces behind Houston’s crime show that linear and nonlinear, spatially filtered, NBMs successfully absorb latent autocorrelation and, therefore, prevent parameter estimation bias. The consideration of a spatial filter also increases the explanatory power of the regressions. It is concluded that ESF can be highly recommended for the integration in spatial and spatiotemporal modeling toolboxes of law enforcement agencies...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that sex offenders (i. e., child abusers, rapists, sexual murderers) hold a set of distorted entrenched beliefs about themselves, others, and the world. Termed implicit theories (Ward, 2000), these constructs have been useful for conceptualising the development and treatment of cognitive distortions, {{as well as the}} etiology of sexual offending (Ó Ciardha & Gannon, 2011). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in child sexual exploitation material offenders (CSEMOs), with research indicating they are distinct from contact child abusers (Babchishin, Hanson, & VanZuylen, 2014). Thus, it is hypothesised that CSEMOs will possess their own set of implicit theories that guide their interpretation of intra- and interpersonal information. In this paper, a preliminary conceptualisation of the implicit theories held by CSEMOs will be presented. Drawing upon the empirical and theoretical insights within the literature, it is proposed that CSEMOs hold a set of core implicit theories that are linked to their offending behaviour. The content of these implicit theories will be outlined, as well as their relation to other <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factors.</b> Also, it is proposed that particular implicit theories will be associated with different CSEM subtypes.

Moreover, while a few specialized programs now serve these girls, the field tends to view young female offenders as a homogeneous group; what distinguishes particular female subpopulations and the characteristics associated with different criminal trajectories have gone largely unexplored. Employing data {{from the state of}} Missouri, this study examines girls who offend, identifying models that predict subsequent violent behavior that include indicators such as parental substance abuse and incarceration, and offender substance abuse, mental health, and school behavior. Special attention is given to the effects of child maltreatment, which we find significantly, but weakly correlated with violent behavior. The authors conclude by considering the possibility that maltreatment may be correlated with other <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factors,</b> and by discussing the implications of findings for future research and practice, especially services that take into account the trauma experienced by young women who come to the attention of state authorities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Problem solving courts (PSC) {{have been}} {{implemented}} internationally, with a common objective to prevent reoffending by addressing criminogenic needs and strengthening social determinants of health. There has been no empirical research {{on the effectiveness of}} community courts, which are a form of PSC designed to harness community resources and inter-disciplinary expertise to reduce recidivism in a geographic catchment area. Method: We used the propensity score matching method to examine the effectiveness of Vancouver’s Downtown Community Court (DCC). We focused on the subset of DCC participants who were identified as having the highest criminogenic risk and were assigned to a case management team (CMT). A comparison group was derived using one-to-one matching on a large array variables including static and dynamic <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factors,</b> geography, and time. Reductions in offences (one year pre minus one year post) were compared between CMT and comparison groups. Results: Compared to other DCC offenders, those triaged to CMT (9. 5 % of the DCC population) had significantly higher levels of healthcare, social service use, and justice system involvement over the ten years prior to the index offence. Compared to matched offenders who received traditional court outcomes, those assigned to CMT (n = 249) exhibited significantly greater reductions in overall offending (p, 0. 001), primarily comprised of significant reductions in property offences (p, 0. 001) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This chapter {{examines}} {{the relationships among}} place, space and the specific situations of Chicago taverns and liquor stores and crimes in those places, and suggests applications of these findings for crime prevention. With a GeoArchive data set of police, census and liquor license information from January to June 1993, we identify the densest concentrations (Hot Spot Areas) of places, events occurring at those places, and incidents occurring in the surrounding areas; compare place and space attributes of the 49 high-incident places {{to a sample of}} 49 low-incident places; and examine the relationship between places and incidents in two police districts. Three types of places emerged, each of which had a different relationship to crime attraction, generation, and control and each of which would require different strategies for intervention. The high-crime levels at these places reflect the general crime pattern of the area. A program of intensive police and citizen patrols to reduce street crime in such an area is currently being evaluated.

(1992 : 1) state the case clearly: "Considered separately, area and individual theories neglect the inter-relationship of <b>criminogenic</b> <b>factors</b> at the individual and community levels. " Current research is confronting the equally formidable tasks of developin...|$|R
