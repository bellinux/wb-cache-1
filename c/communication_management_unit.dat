40|$|Since {{the notion}} of {{strategic}} <b>communication</b> <b>management</b> had become popular in literature {{and as a result}} of the Excellence study (Dozier, Grunig & Grunig, 1995), many practitioners and <b>communication</b> <b>management</b> departments have attempted to implement all or some of the elements of the Excellence theory in order to change the negative reputation of <b>communication</b> <b>management</b> research. Improving the theoretical and practical knowledge within the <b>communication</b> <b>management</b> department is one way of rectifying the aforementioned situation. The new knowledge base would include a far better understanding of the strategic management process as well as basic and advanced research practices.

40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>communication</b> <b>management</b> {{and public relations}} in Europe has, according to theory, a reflective character. The key aspect of this reflective <b>communication</b> <b>management</b> is to view the organization {{from the perspective of}} the public sphere. Important aspects of reflective <b>communication</b> <b>management</b> are the extent to which communication recommendations are taken seriously by senior management, if and how communicative arguments and reputational considerations are factored into strategic decision making and planning in the organization, the involvement of communication professionals in corporate social responsibility, the use of research and equal positions for male and female practitioners.
