40|$|The {{title of}} this master's {{research}} is “semiotics of <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> and French didactics”. It is {{about the use of}} <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> in French teaching. The French people have a long story of <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> that they can share with the South Africans for the teaching and learning of French as foreign language. I want to prove that <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> are important for the teaching and learning of French, as foreign language. Foreign language teaching requires many methodologies from the teacher. Those skills and methodologies enable him/her to identify the needs of the learners and to teach them in the best possible ways. Cape Town is the field of my investigations because of its multilingualism. Most of South Africans can speak a first or/and a second language, French can only be a third language. So as teachers, our teachingmethods must vary according to the learners' knowledge or absence of knowledge of French. For {{a better understanding of the}} French language, we cannot use the same methods and approaches for those two groups of learners, given that South African learners are going to use English as their educational language. To this end, I went to investigate some learners at their schools to find out the way French has been taught. I also wanted to know their views on the use of <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> in the French class. There are two groups of learners, those who knew <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> before I arrived at their schools and those who only knew <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> because of my. I asked their teachers' views on the use of <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> as material. Some use <b>comics</b> <b>strips</b> and some do not use. Learners and teachers were asked why they did or didnot use <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> in class. <b>Comic</b> <b>strips</b> put together image and text...|$|R
