500|$|Helgoland was a Dutch {{brigantine}} {{armed with}} 12-pounder guns and a machine gun. Sanders, {{second in command}} to fellow New Zealander Lieutenant A.D. Blair, helped oversee its conversion to a Q-ship. [...] On its first patrol in September 1916 his ship participated in two actions against U-boats, and on its second the following month, it again engaged two U-boats. During the first engagement, the Helgoland was becalmed, without engines and extremely vulnerable. Surrounded by three submarines and with limited manoeuvrability it was forced to reveal its identity early in the engagement. On this occasion a screen concealing one of the guns jammed; Sanders and Blair exposed themselves to potential gun fire from the U-boat being attacked in order to cut away the screen with <b>axes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crowbars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On April 9, 1920, Guatemala City {{was awakened}} with machine-gun fire and shells {{dropping}} close in every {{quarter of the}} city. In [...] "La Palma" [...] French field-howitzers and seventy-fives with anti-aircraft sights, quick firing guns and machine guns were drawn up; on the other hand, in Guatemala City streets were deserted and bloodshed commenced in earnest. The Unionists were caught off-guard: their organization was deficient, and they had almost no weapons, but {{they were able to}} remedy the situation. Government buildings were systematically plundered and ransacked and they got arms and ammunition from the most unlikely places; this way they got knives, machetes, saloon rifles, shotguns, <b>axes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crowbars.</b> With enthusiasm, all men raised barricades and dug trenches in the streets.|$|R
60|$|Two {{of their}} number {{had gone down}} before the captain's revolver. They lay where they had fallen between the combatants. But then the first mate lunged forward upon his face, and at a cry of command from Black Michael the mutineers charged the {{remaining}} four. The crew {{had been able to}} muster but six firearms, so most of them were armed with boat hooks, <b>axes,</b> hatchets <b>and</b> <b>crowbars.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right, {{down with}} them!" [...] the captain shouted, {{and in a}} very few minutes the last tiles had fallen. As soon as the shower had ceased {{the whole of the}} {{contents}} of the houses were carried into the streets. Then the marines began with the <b>axes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crowbars</b> with which they were provided to tear up the floor-boards and break down the rafters and beams. Then grapnels fastened to long ropes were fixed {{on the top of the}} brickwork, a score of hands caught hold, and the lightly-built wall readily yielded to the strain, coming down in great masses. As soon as the walls had fallen the natives were set to work carrying away the beams and woodwork, and in a little more than half an hour from the time the operations commenced two heaps of brickwork and rubbish alone marked the spot where the eight houses had stood.|$|R
5000|$|Crockett, having stayed awake {{through the}} night, checks {{the walls and}} notices the {{approaching}} Mexican army. The Texans are awakened by his first shot and begin rushing to their posts. The Texans also hear the battle cry of the Mexican soldiers: [...] "Viva Santa-Anna!" [...] After a long, brutal battle the Mexicans, despite taking heavy casualties, breach the north wall of the mission where Travis is killed, {{shot in the head}} by a young Mexican soldier. A small group of Mexican engineers, armed with <b>axes</b> <b>and</b> <b>crowbars,</b> assault <b>and</b> break down the boarded-up doors and windows of the west wall, while another small group storms the southwest wall. The few surviving Texans fall back to the buildings, where they are all killed. Attackers discover the bedridden Bowie in his room, where he fires his pistols and attempts to fight with his knife, but is swiftly bayonetted to death. Crockett and the last 4 defenders retreat into the church where they fight their last stand. Crockett is taken prisoner. In a final act of defiance, he mockingly offers to lead Santa Anna and the Mexican Army to Sam Houston in order to ensure the formers' safety; Santa Anna thereupon angrily orders Crockett to be executed.|$|R
60|$|We {{are natural}} believers. Truth, or the {{connection}} between cause and effect, alone interests us. We are persuaded that a thread runs through all things; all worlds are strung on it, as beads; and men, and events, and life, come to us, only because of that thread; they pass and repass, only that we may know the direction and continuity of that line. A book or statement which {{goes to show that}} there is no line, but random and chaos, a calamity out of nothing, a prosperity and no account of it, a hero born from a fool, a fool from a hero,--dispirits us. Seen or unseen, we believe the tie exists. Talent makes counterfeit ties; genius finds the real ones. We hearken to the man of science, because we anticipate the sequence in natural phenomena which he uncovers. We love whatever affirms, connects, preserves; and dislike what scatters or pulls down. One man appears whose nature is to all men's eyes conserving and constructive; his presence supposes a well-ordered society, agriculture, trade, large institutions, and empire. If these did not exist, they would begin to exist through his endeavors. Therefore, he cheers and comforts men, who feel all this in him very readily. The nonconformist and the rebel say all manner of unanswerable things against the existing republic, but discover to our sense no plan of house or state of their own. Therefore, though the town, and state, and way of living, which our counselor contemplated, might be a very modest or musty prosperity, yet men rightly go for him, and reject the reformer, so long as he comes only with <b>axe</b> <b>and</b> <b>crowbar.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Conway's spirits rose at this discovery, and {{she sighed}} impatiently {{at the thought}} that another month must elapse before she could even {{commence}} the search. Brooding over the matter continually, there was one point that did not escape her. These old hiding-places were made either to conceal proscribed priests or hunted fugitives, and were constructed with the greatest care. As she had so easily discovered the spot where a hidden room might be situated, it would be discovered with the same ease by those who were on the search for fugitives, and who would naturally be well acquainted with the positions where hiding-places would be likely to be situated. The moment they looked into the cupboard, its shallowness would suggest to them that there must be a wide empty space behind it, and by setting to work with <b>axes,</b> picks, <b>and</b> <b>crowbars,</b> they would soon discover by force the secret she was trying to penetrate by stratagem.|$|R
60|$|Up {{rushed the}} assailants, one, two, three at a time, and {{as fast as}} they came, the <b>axe</b> <b>crashed</b> <b>and</b> the sword swung, and down they rolled again, dead or dying. And ever as the fight thickened, the old Zulu's eye seemed to get quicker and his arm stronger. He shouted out his war-cries and the names of chiefs whom he had slain, and the blows of his awful <b>axe</b> rained {{straight}} <b>and</b> true, shearing through everything they fell on. There was none of the scientific method he was so fond of about this last immortal fight of his; he had no time for it, but struck with his full strength, and at every stroke a man sank in his tracks, and went rattling down the marble steps.|$|R
60|$|After this {{discharge}} of spears which was kept {{up for some}} time, they rushed at us and there followed a great fight. The Zulus, throwing down their guns, rose {{to their feet and}} holding their little fighting shields which had been carried in their mats, in the left hand, wielded their axes with the right. Umslopogaas, who stood in the centre of them, however, had no shield and swung his great axe with both arms. This {{was the first time that}} I had seen him fight and the spectacle was in a way magnificent. Again <b>and</b> again the <b>axe</b> <b>crashed</b> down <b>and</b> every time it fell it left one dead beneath the stroke, till at length those Amahagger shrank back out of his reach.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crash</b> <b>axe</b> A short {{lightweight}} handheld emergency chopping tool {{with a sharp}} or serrated blade spanning {{a quarter}} circular from the axis of the handle, sometimes with a notch in the blade to catch on sheet metal, and often a short pick opposite the blade, this tool or a prybar is required to be carried in most large aircraft cockpits with 20 seats or more to quickly chop and pry walls and cabinets to gain access when extinguishing a fire while in flight or to escape when exits are unavailable. A <b>crash</b> <b>axe</b> is sometimes also used by crash rescue firefighter crews to chop through the airplane's sheet metal skin for a rescue opening; modern <b>crash</b> <b>axes</b> are often made with an electrically insulated handle.|$|R

60|$|So {{he turned}} {{one point of}} the island, and this brought him in view of a second; and there he remembered the wizard trees to have been growing by the score {{together}} in a wood. From this point there went up a hubbub of men crying not to be described; and {{by the sound of}} them, those that he ran with shaped their course for the same quarter. A little nearer, and there began to mingle with the outcry the <b>crash</b> of many <b>axes.</b> <b>And</b> at this a thought came at last into his mind that the high chief had consented; that the men of the tribe had set-to cutting down these trees; that word had gone about the isle from sorcerer to sorcerer, and these were all now assembling to defend their trees. Desire of strange things swept him on. He posted with the voices, crossed the beach, and came into the borders of the wood, and stood astonished. One tree had fallen, others were part hewed away. There was the tribe clustered. They were back to back, and bodies lay, and blood flowed among their feet. The hue of fear was on all their faces: their voices went up to heaven shrill as a weasel's cry.|$|R
