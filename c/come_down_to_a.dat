25|$|Few, if any, rivalries in the ACHA {{match the}} history and stakes of UMass' {{frequent}} showdowns with Rhode Island. The two teams were founding members of the Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League in 2003–04, and {{are the only two}} to remain in the league through its entire existence. No fewer than ten times in the 14 ECWHL seasons, the conference playoff title has <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> UMass-URI contest, with the Rams enjoying a 7–3 advantage in those games (although the Minutemen have won the last three). Among the more memorable ECWHL championship games were two overtime contests, both won by URI, including a 5–4 result in 2005. Three years later, Rhode Island stormed out to a 3–0 lead after the first period, only to see UMass reply with four unanswered {{to take the lead in}} the third period. However, the Rams forced overtime with a late equalizer, allowing URI's Justine Ducie to win the trophy in the sixth minute of the third extra period. Most recently, Amber Greene's 26-save shutout allowed second-period goals by Brittani Lanzilli, Lanzilli again and Michaela Tosone to produce a 3–0 win on February 26, 2017. Even when not competing head to head, the league nearly always runs through at least one of the teams, as there have been only three regular season or playoff titles in ECWHL history won by anyone else (Northeastern won the regular season and playoff championships in 2010–11, Penn State took the regular season in 2011–12).|$|E

500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{stage of}} the race was also its longest of the 2013 edition, with a [...] itinerary for the peloton as the race moved towards the coast and Nice itself.

London was originally seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin, but this situation began to reverse with the appointment of Sebastian Coe as the head of London 2012, on 19 May 2004. In late August 2004, reports emerged that predicted a tie between London and Paris. In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be in an increasingly close contest.

The sprinters' teams worked to chase down the morning breakaway, but the only effect this actually had was allowing Van Avermaet, and others, a shorter distance to bridge from the main field up {{to the front of the}} race. The leading group's advantage over the peloton never exceeded two minutes, but it proved to be enough as Van Avermaet took the win ahead of 's Marco Marcato, with the next rider a further 15 seconds down.

The twentieth stage saw the Giro race through the Alps {{and up to the}} summit of Les Deux Alpes for the stage finish. The lead group up Les Deux Alpes contained the likes of Evgeni Berzin, Marco Pantani, and Miguel Indurain who had attacked each other multiple times but to no avail. The trio was later joined by Vladimir Poulnikov and Nelson Rodriguez who both eventually left them to go on for the stage win. Poulkinov edged out Rodriguez to the stage win atop the mountain.
