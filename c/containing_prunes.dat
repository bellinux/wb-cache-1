5000|$|Prunes {{are used}} in {{preparing}} both sweet and savory dishes. Stewed prunes, a compote, are a common dessert. Prunes are an ingredient in North African tagines or tzimmes, a traditional Jewish dish (in which the principal ingredient is diced or sliced carrots), in the Nordic prune kisel, eaten with rice pudding, and in the traditional Norwegian dessert fruit soup. Prunes have also been included in other holiday dishes, such as stuffing and cake. Prune-filled Danish pastries, yogurt or ice cream <b>containing</b> <b>prunes</b> or prune juice are found in some countries. Chocolate-covered prunes are a traditional confectionery in Eastern Europe. Prunes are also used to make juice and kompot (uzvar), a traditional drink in Europe. In the Cotswolds, prunes were fermented to form a cider-like drink called jerkum which, due to the high sugar content of prunes, was considered particularly potent in alcohol content compared to contemporary ciders and beers.|$|E

There was no food to be procured in the village, except a little watery milk, and a few small watery potatos. The latter have only very recently been introduced amongst the Tibetans, from the English garden at the Nepalese capital, I believe, and their culture has not spread in these regions further east than Kinchinjunga, but they will very soon penetrate into Tibet from Dorjiling, or eastward from Nepal. My private stock of provisions --consisting chiefly of preserved meats from my kind friend Mr. Hodgson--had fallen very low; and I here found to my dismay that of four remaining two-pound cases, provided as meat, three <b>contained</b> <b>prunes,</b> and one [...] "dindon aux truffes!" [...] Never did luxuries come more inopportunely; however the greasy French viand served for many a future meal as sauce to help me to bolt my rice, {{and according to the}} theory of chemists, to supply animal heat in these frigid regions. As for my people, they were not accustomed to much animal food; two pounds of rice, with ghee and chilis, forming their common diet under cold and fatigue. The poorer Tibetans, especially, who undergo great privation and toil, live almost wholly on barley-meal, with tea, and a very little butter and salt: this is not only the case with those amongst whom I mixed so much, but is also mentioned by MM. Huc and Gabet, as having been observed by them in other parts of Tibet.|$|R

Aside from the single experiment reported by Blatherwick and Long (1) in 1923, there are likewise no data bearing on the effect of cranberries on urinary acidity. These investigators found both prunes and cranberries when ingested in large quantities (about 300 grams per day) produced marked increases in both the titratable and organic acid acidities of the urine. The <b>prunes</b> <b>contained</b> 0. 149 per cent benzoic acid and produced about double the acidity of a similar weight of cranberries with a benzoic acid content of. 096 per cent. These amounts of benzoic acid being far too small to account for the large amounts of hippuric acid found in the urine, Blatherwick and Long conclude that the principal source of hippuric acid in the urine is probably quinic acid. LÃƒcke(10) observed that the excretion of hippuric acid was elevated after the ingestion of many vegetables and fruits, es pecially cranberries.

Two aspects are examined, first the qualitative value of the organic materials as sources of nutrients and secondly the quantitative significance of the organic materials {{within the context of}} the Nigerian savanna. The results showed that cow dung, M. pruriens vines and L. leucocephala <b>pruning</b> <b>contained</b> sufficient nutrients to meet the N and K requirements of a maize crop at an application rate of 5 t ha - 1. Phosphorus contents of maize stover and L. leucocephala pruning were not in sufficient quantities to meet crop demand. The calcium and magnesium requirements can be adequately met by this rate for all the organic amendments used. When the organic materials were evaluated based on the contents of nutrients and deduced ratios, cow dung, M. pruriens vines and L. leucocephala pruning were characterized as high quality materials, while maize stover was considered to be a low quality material. Based on their nutrient concentrations and deduced ratios, cow dung, M pruriens vines and L. leucocephala pruning were characterized as high quality materials. Maize stover may be considered as a low quality material. This grouping of the organic materials was confirmed using principal component and correlation analysis.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{discovering}} interesting, useful and previously unknown knowledge from very large databases {{is known as}} data mining. Outlier or exception mining focuses {{on the problem of}} finding patterns that apply to a small percentage of data objects. Outliers are observations that show different characteristics from all other data objects to arouse suspicion that they were generated by a different mechanism. Density-based algorithms for mining outliers are the most effective in finding all forms of outliers. Density-based algorithms determine outliers based on the concentration of data objects at a location and declare objects with few neighbours as outliers. However, existing density-based algorithms have the following drawbacks: (1) computing the local reachability distance and density for every object before the few outliers are found; (2) computing local outlier factor (LOF) for every object in the dataset before declaring those with very high LOF as outliers. These are very expensive computations since outliers form {{only a small fraction of}} the entire data. This thesis proposes Local Sparsity Coefficient (LSC) and Enhanced Local Sparsity Coefficient (ELSC) algorithms based on the distance of an object and those of its k-nearest neighbours without computing reachability distance and density of every object. This reduces the number of computations and comparisons in LOF technique. In ELSC, data objects that can not possibly <b>contain</b> outliers are <b>pruned</b> (removed) based on their neighbourhood distances. The remaining set constitutes the candidate set on which outliers are determined resulting in an improved performance over LSC and LOF.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} approximation algorithms {{for some}} NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problems on graphs and networks; in particular, we study {{problems related to}} Network Design. Under the widely-believed complexity-theoretic assumption that P is not equal to NP, there are no efficient (i. e., polynomial-time) algorithms that solve these problems exactly. Hence, if one desires efficient algorithms for such problems, {{it is necessary to}} consider approximate solutions: An approximation algorithm for an NP-Hard problem is a polynomial time algorithm which, for any instance of the problem, finds a solution whose value is guaranteed to be within a multiplicative factor of the value of an optimal solution to that instance. We attempt to design algorithms for which this factor, referred to as the approximation ratio of the algorithm, is as small as possible. The field of Network Design comprises a large class of problems that deal with constructing networks of low cost and/or high capacity, routing data through existing networks, and many related issues. In this thesis, we focus chiefly on designing fault-tolerant networks. Two vertices u,v in a network are said to be k-edge-connected if deleting any set of k âˆ’ 1 edges leaves u and v connected; similarly, they are k-vertex connected if deleting any set of k âˆ’ 1 other vertices or edges leaves u and v connected. We focus on building networks that are highly connected, meaning that even if a small number of edges and nodes fail, the remaining nodes will still be able to communicate. A brief description of some of our results is given below. We study the problem of building 2 -vertex-connected networks that are large and have low cost. Given an n-node graph with costs on its edges and any integer k, we give an O(log n log k) approximation for the problem of finding a minimum-cost 2 -vertex-connected subgraph containing at least k nodes. We also give an algorithm of similar approximation ratio for maximizing the number of nodes in a 2 -vertex-connected subgraph subject to a budget constraint on the total cost of its edges. Our algorithms are based on a pruning process that, given a 2 -vertex-connected graph, finds a 2 -vertex-connected subgraph of any desired size and of density comparable to the input graph, where the density of a graph is the ratio of its cost to the number of vertices it <b>contains.</b> This <b>pruning</b> algorithm is simple and efficient, and is likely to find additional applications. Recent breakthroughs on vertex-connectivity have made use of algorithms for element-connectivity problems. We develop an algorithm that, given a graph with some vertices marked as terminals, significantly simplifies the graph while preserving the pairwise element-connectivity of all terminals; in fact, the resulting graph is bipartite. We believe that our simplification/reduction algorithm will be a useful tool in many settings. We illustrate its applicability by giving algorithms to find many trees that each span a given terminal set, while being disjoint on edges and non-terminal vertices; such problems have applications in VLSI design and other areas. We also use this reduction algorithm to analyze simple algorithms for single-sink network design problems with high vertex-connectivity requirements; we give an O(k log n) -approximation for the problem of k-connecting a given set of terminals to a common sink. We study similar problems in which different types of links, of varying capacities and costs, can be used to connect nodes; assuming there are economies of scale, we give algorithms to construct low-cost networks with sufficient capacity or bandwidth to simultaneously support flow from each terminal to the common sink along many vertex-disjoint paths. We further investigate capacitated network design, where edges may have arbitrary costs and capacities. Given a connectivity requirement R_uv for each pair of vertices u,v, the goal is to find a low-cost network which, for each uv, can support a flow of R_uv units of traffic between u and v. We study several special cases of this problem, giving both algorithmic and hardness results. In addition to Network Design, we consider certain Traveling Salesperson-like problems, where the goal is to find short walks that visit many distinct vertices. We give a (2 + epsilon) -approximation for Orienteering in undirected graphs, achieving the best known approximation ratio, and the first approximation algorithm for Orienteering in directed graphs. We also give improved algorithms for Orienteering with time windows, in which vertices must be visited between specified release times and deadlines, and other related problems. These problems are motivated by applications in the fields of vehicle routing, delivery and transportation of goods, and robot path planning...|$|R

These {{diseases are}} caused by a complex of wood-inhabiting fungi that infect mainly through pruning wounds. The management of these diseases relies on wound protection to prevent infection {{since there are no}} eradicative control measures to cure infected vines. There are few or no fungicides registered for grapevine pruning wound protection in most countries, while Trichoderma biocontrol agents are often available. This study aimed at improving grapevine wound protection by Trichoderma (T.) spp. and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the factors and mechanisms involved in biocontrol. The effect of pruning time (early or late) and five timings of application of the biocontrol agent after pruning on pruning wound colonisation by T. atroviride and T. harzianum were determined. Chenin blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards were pruned in July (early) and August (late) of 2011 and 2012, and pruning wounds were treated with suspensions of the Trichoderma spp. at various times (0, 6, 24, 48 and 96 hours) after pruning. Wound colonisation was depended on the physiological state of the vine at pruning for both cultivars. However, for the 2012 season in Chenin blanc, wound colonisation was similarly high for both pruning times, which was attributed to high rainfall and humidity. Application of the biocontrol agents 6 hours after pruning consistently resulted in high wound colonisation by the Trichoderma spp. in both cultivars and pruning times. In both cultivars, pruning wound infection due to natural inoculum was higher in wounds made in late winter than those made earlier. The effect of conidial formulation in nutritional (glucose, yeast extract and urea) and bio-enhancing (chitin and cell free culture filtrates) additives, on pruning wound colonisation by T. atroviride was also investigated. Nutritional additives increased the extent of pruning wound colonisation by T. atroviride compared to the un-amended conidial suspensions in a glass house study. The additives as well as Garrison, a fungicide <b>containing</b> <b>pruning</b> wound paint, and Eco 77 Â®, a registered T. harzianum biocontrol product, were tested in field trials for wound protection from infection by Phaeomoniella (Pa.) chlamydospora. In 2011, the pathogen was inoculated a day after pruning and all the Trichoderma spp. treatments similarly reduced Pa. chlamydospora infection by 75 % to 90 % in Thompson Seedless, while control was less in Chenin blanc and ranged from 40 % to 74 %. In 2012, the trial was carried out on Chenin blanc only and the pathogen was inoculated at intervals of 1, 3 and 7 days after pruning. Wound protection by the Trichoderma treatments was highest when wounds were inoculated with Pa. chlamydospora seven days after pruning. Two conidial formulations, a culture filtrate made from a chitin based medium and a combination of yeast extract, urea and glucose, consistently enhanced biocontrol efficacy. These formulations reduced Pa. chlamydospora infection to levels similar to those of Garrison. The integration of chemical and biological wound protection could provide both immediate and long term wound protection, but is limited by the sensitivity of the biocontrol agent to fungicides. Benzimidazole resistant Trichoderma strains were generated by gamma irradiation from the wild type isolates of T. atroviride (UST 1 and UST 2) and T. harzianum (T 77). Mutants from UST 1 and UST 2 were of similar biological fitness as the wild type isolates and retained their in vitro antagonistic activity against grapevine trunk pathogens, while the mutant from T 77 had reduced fitness and was not antagonistic to the pathogens. The wild type, UST 1, and its mutant were tested alone and in combination with thiophanate methyl and carbendazim, respectively, for their ability to prevent pruning wound infection by Pa. chlamydospora. The combination of the UST 1 mutant and carbendazim was the most effective treatment and gave the highest reduction in Pa. chlamydospora infection (70 % to 93 % control). Grapevine cell cultures were used to compare the response of grapevines to T. atroviride and Eutypa (E.) lata as a first step to determining the importance of Trichoderma-grapevine interactions in pruning wound bio-protection. The expression of genes coding for enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway and pathogenesis related (PR) proteins was profiled over a 48 -hour period using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The cell cultures responded to fungal elicitors in a hypersensitive-like response that lead to a decrease in cell viability. Fungal elicitors from both fungi triggered the same genes and caused up-regulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4 coumaroyl Co-A ligase (CCo-A), stilbene synthase (STS), chitinase class IV (CHIT IV), PR 3 and PR 4, and a down regulation of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes. Higher expression of PAL and CHIT IV in cell cultures treated with the T. atroviride elicitor led to a significantly higher (P < 0. 05) total phenolic content and chitinolytic enzyme activity of the cell cultures compared to cell cultures treated with the E. lata elicitor. The response of the cell cultures to the T. atroviride elicitor signifies that the induction of grapevine resistance may be involved in wound bio-protection. The role of secondary metabolites produced by Trichoderma spp. used in pruning wound protection was also investigated. A volatile antimicrobial compound, 6 -pentyl Î±-pyrone (6 PP), was isolated and found to be the major secondary metabolite from the T. atroviride (UST 1 and UST 2) and T. harzianum (T 77) isolates. This metabolite was found to inhibit mycelial growth, spore and conidia germination of E. lata, Neofussicocum (N.) australe, N. parvum and Pa. chlamydospora. The production of 6 PP was induced when the T. atroviride isolates were grown in a grapevine wood extract medium while for UST 1, the 6 PP concentration was further doubled when it was co-cultured with N. parvum. Results therefore, indicate that 6 PP is involved in the Trichoderma-pathogen interactions on pruning wounds. The results of this study have provided new information in regards to the application of Trichoderma-based pruning wound products. The best time of application proved to be 6 hours post pruning. The formulation of conidial suspensions of Trichoderma spp. with nutritional additives and in protein extracts of the biocontrol agent showed potential in reducing variability of wound bio-protection. However, further research would be necessary to develop commercial products. The application of a fungicide together with Trichoderma spp. in the field holds promise to improve control, but would require further trials for possible commercialisation. This study is the first to report on grapevine host defence genes that are activated by the Trichoderma spp. used in pruning wound protection. Together with the characterisation of the major secondary metabolite produced by these Trichoderma spp., this information aids in understanding the mechanisms involved in the complex interaction between the biocontrol agent, the host and the pathogen. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Wingerdstamsiektes veroorsaak terugsterwing en verlies aan produktiwiteit in wingerdstokke gedurende alle groeifases. Hierdie siektes word veroorsaak deur â€žn verskeidenheid van hout-koloniserende swamme wat die wingerdstok meestal deur snoeiwonde infekteer. Die bestuur van hierdie siektes is afhanklik van wondbeskerming om infeksie te verhoed, omdat daar geen uitwissende beheermetodes na infeksie bestaan nie. In meeste lande is daar min of geen swamdoders geregistreer vir snoeiwond beskerming, terwyl Trichoderma biobeheer agente gereÃ«ld beskikbaar is. Hierdie studie poog om wingerd wondbeskerming deur Trichoderma (T.) spp. te verbeter en â€žn meer volledige begrip van die faktore en meganismes betrokke by biologiese beheer te ontwikkel. Die effek van die tydsberekening van snoei (vroeg of laat) en vyf behandelingstye van die biobeheer agent na snoei op die kolonisering van snoeiwonde deur T. atroviride en T. harzianum is bepaal. Chenin blanc en Cabernet Sauvignon wingerde is gesnoei gedurende Julie (vroeg) en Augustus (laat) in 2011 en 2012, en snoeiwonde is behandel met Trichoderma spp. suspensies op verskillende tydspunte (0, 6, 24, 48 en 96 ure) na snoei. Wond-kolonisering was afhanklik van die fisiologiese toestand van die wingerdstok gedurende snoei vir albei kultivars. Gedurende die 2012 seisoen was wond-kolonisering ewe hoog vir albei snoeitye op Chenin blanc. Dit is verklaar deur hoÃ« reÃ«nval en humiditeit gedurende daardie seisoen. Die aanwending van biobeheer agente 6 ure na snoei het konsekwent hoÃ« kolonisering deur Trichoderma spp. tot gevolg gehad op albei kultivars en albei snoeitye. In albei kultivars is wondinfeksie as gevolg van natuurlike inokulum hoÃ«r gewees in wonde gemaak gedurende laat winter as in wonde wat vroeÃ«r in die seisoen gemaak is. Die effek van konidia formulasie in voeding (glukose, gisekstrak en urea) en bioverbetering (chitien en sel-vrye kultuurfiltraat) toevoegings op snoeiwond-kolonisering deur T. atroviride is ook ondersoek. Voeding toevoegings het die omvangs van snoeiwond-kolonisering deur T. atroviride vergroot in vergelyking met ongewysigde konidia suspensies gedurende â€žn glashuis studie. Die toevoegings, sowel as Garrison, â€žn snoeiwond verf wat â€žn swamdoder bevat, en Eco 77 Â®, â€žn geregistreerde T. harzianum biobeheer produk, is getoets in veldproewe vir wondbeskerming teen infeksie deur Phaeomoniella (Pa.) chlamydospora. In 2011 is die patogeen geÃ¯nokuleer â€žn dag na snoei en al die Trichoderma spp. behandelings het infeksie verminder met 75 % tot 90 % op Thompson Seedless. Beheer was minder suksesvol op Chenin blanc, waar slegs 40 % tot 74 % beheer behaal is. In 2012 is die proef uitgevoer slegs op Chenin blanc en die patogeen is geÃ¯nokuleer teen intervalle van 1, 3 en 7 dae na snoei. Wondbeskerming by die Trichoderma behandelinge was die hoogste wanneer wonde sewe dae na snoei geÃ¯nokuleer is met Pa. chlamydospora. Twee konidia formulasies, â€žn kultuurfiltraat wat bestaan het uit â€žn chitien-gebaseerde medium en â€žn kombinasie van gisekstrak, urea en glukose het deurlopend die effektiwiteit van biobeheer verbeter. Hierdie formulasies het Pa. chlamydospora infeksie verminder tot soortgelyke vlakke behaal deur Garrison. Die integrasie van chemiese- en biobeheer in wondbeskerming kan onmiddelike en langtermyn wondbeskerming bied, maar is beperk deur die sensitiwiteit van die biobeheer agent teen swamdoders. Benzimidazole-weerstandbiedende Trichoderma isolate is ontwikkel deur gamma-bestraling van die wilde-tipe isolate van T. atroviride (UST 1 en UST 2) en T. harzianum (T 77). Mutante van UST 1 en UST 2 het soortgelyke biologiese fiksheid getoon as die wilde-tipe en het hul in vitro antagonistiese aktiwiteit teen wingerd stampatogene behou, terwyl die mutant van T 77 verminderde fiksheid getoon het en nie meer antagonisties teen patogene was nie. Die wilde-tipe, UST 1, en sy mutant is apart en in kombinasie met thiofanaatmetiel en carbendazim, respektiewelik, getoets vir die vermoÃ« om snoeiwonde te beskerm teen Pa. chlamydospora. Die kombinasie van die UST 1 mutant met carbendazim was die mees effektiewe behandeling en het die hoogste vermindering in Pa. chlamydospora infeksie gelewer (70 tot 93 % beheer). As â€žn beginpunt om die belang van Trichoderma-wingerd interaksies in snoiewondbeheer te bepaal, is die invloed van T. atroviride en Eutypa (E.) lata op somatiese selkulture van wingerd vergelyk. Die effek van diÃ© behandelings op ensieme in die fenielpropanoÃ¯edweg en patogenese-verwante (PR) proteÃ¯ene is bepaal deur intydse PKR (real time PCR) van die korresponderende gene oor â€žn 48 uur tydperk. Die swam-afkomstige ontlokkers het â€žn hipersensitiewe-tipe reaksie in die selkulture ontlok, wat tot â€žn afname in sellewensvatbaarheid gelei het. Ontlokkers afkomstig van beide swamme het dieselfde gene aangeskakel en het induksie van fenielalanien ammoniak-liase (PAL), 4 kumaroÃ¯el Ko-A ligase (CCo-A), stilbeen sintase (STS), chitienase klas IV (CHIT IV), PR 3 en PR 4 veroorsaak en â€žn onderdrukking in chalkoon sintase (CHS) gene tot gevolg gehad. HoÃ«r uitdrukking van PAL en CHIT IV in selkulture behandel met die T. atroviride ontlokker het gelei tot â€žn beduidende hoÃ«r (P < 0. 05) totale fenoolinhoud en chitienolitiese aktiwiteit in selkulture in vergelyking met selkulture wat behandel is met die E. lata ontlokker. Die reaksie van die selkulture op die T. atroviride ontlokker dui daarop dat die induksie van wingerd weerstandbiedenheid betrokke mag wees in wond biobeheer. Die rol van sekondÃªre metaboliete geproduseer deur Trichoderma spp. wat gebruik word in snoeiwond beheer is ook ondersoek. â€žn Vlugtige antimikrobiese verbinding, 6 -pentiel Î±-pyroon (6 PP) is geÃ¯soleer en bepaal om die hoof sekondÃªre metaboliet afkomstig vanuit die T. atroviride (UST 1 en UST 2) en T. harzianum (T 77) isolate te wees. Hierdie metaboliet is betrokke by inhibisie van miselium groei, spoor en konidium ontkieming van E. lata, Neofusicoccum (N.) australe, N. parvum en Pa. chlamydospora. Die produksie van 6 PP is geÃ¯nduseer deur die T. atroviride in wingerd hout ekstrak te kweek. In die geval van UST 1, is die 6 PP konsenstrasie verdubbel deur die isolaat met saam met N. parvum te kweek. Hierdie resultaat is â€žn aanduiding dat 6 PP betrokke is in die Trichoderma-patogeen interaksie op snoeiwonde. Die resultate van hierdie studie het nuwe inligting met betrekking tot die aanwending van Trichoderma-gebaseerde snoeiwond produkte verskaf. Die beste tyd vir aanwending van sulke produkte was 6 ure na snoei. Die formulasie van konidia suspensies van Trichoderma spp. met voeding toevoegings en in proteÃ¯en ekstrakte van die biobeheer agent het potensiaal getoon in die vermindering van variasie in wondbeskerming deur biobeheer agente. Verdere navorsing sal nodig wees om kommersiÃ«le produkte te ontwikkel. Die aanwending van â€žn swamdoder saam met Trichoderma spp. in die wingerd is belowend om beheer te verbeter, maar het meer proewe nodig voor kommersialisering. Hierdie studie is die eerste om wingerd beskerming gene wat deur Trichoderma spp. geaktiveer word aan te meld. Laasgenoemde, saam met die beskrywing van die hoof sekondÃªre metaboliete wat deur hierdie Trichoderma spp. geproduseer word, dra by tot â€žn meer volledige begrip van die meganismes betrokke by die komplekse interaksie tussen die biobeheer agent, die gasheer en die patogeen...|$|R
