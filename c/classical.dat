5|$|Billboard ranked Evancho the No. 5 <b>Classical</b> Albums Artist of 2013, the No. 7 <b>Classical</b> Albums Artist of 2014 and the No. 4 <b>Classical</b> Albums {{artist of}} 2015, as Awakening was the No. 3 <b>classical</b> album of 2015. Evancho was ranked the No. 12 <b>Classical</b> Albums Artist of 2016, as her 2016 holiday album, Someday at Christmas, was the No. 27 best-selling <b>classical</b> album of 2016, and Awakening was the No. 31 best-selling <b>classical</b> album of 2016. Evancho's 2017 album, Two Hearts, was her seventh {{consecutive}} release to reach No. 1 on the Billboard <b>Classical</b> Albums chart.|$|E
5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by {{a wider range of}} people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how accurately the iconography of <b>classical</b> art mapped the reality of <b>classical</b> society.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>classical</b> singer, Turunen sings with <b>classical</b> vocal technique. She {{explained}} {{that in the}} early days of Nightwish, it was difficult to combine <b>classical</b> technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. <b>Classical</b> techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|As the {{tradition}} of <b>classical</b> Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While <b>Classical</b> poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the <b>Classical</b> tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E

5|$|Between the 2:3 and 1:2 {{resonances}} with Neptune, {{at approximately}} 42–48AU, the gravitational interactions with Neptune occur {{over an extended}} timescale, and objects can exist with their orbits essentially unaltered. This region {{is known as the}} <b>classical</b> Kuiper belt, and its members comprise roughly two thirds of KBOs observed to date. Because the first modern KBO discovered, , is considered the prototype of this group, <b>classical</b> KBOs are often referred to as cubewanos ("Q-B-1-os"). The guidelines established by the IAU demand that <b>classical</b> KBOs be given names of mythological beings associated with creation.|$|E
5|$|Billboard ranked Evancho the No. 1 <b>Classical</b> Albums Artist of 2011, as she {{released}} {{three of the}} top four albums on the Billboard 2011 year-end <b>Classical</b> Albums chart. She was the No. 10 Billboard 200 Artist of 2011, and the No. 3 Internet Albums Artist. Billboard ranked Evancho the No. 2 <b>Classical</b> Albums Artist of 2012, as three of her albums {{ranked in the top}} seven albums on the Billboard 2012 year-end <b>Classical</b> Albums chart. She was the No. 37 Billboard 200 Artist of 2012.|$|E
5|$|<b>Classical</b> {{music was}} brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European <b>classical</b> music is rooted in the {{tradition}}s of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common practice period. Many American <b>classical</b> composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American <b>classical</b> music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of <b>classical</b> music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E
5|$|Esolen {{has written}} {{translations}} of other <b>classical</b> texts, including Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered (reviewed in Translation and Literature, Sixteenth-Century Journal, and International Journal of the <b>Classical</b> Tradition) and Lucretius' De rerum natura. Both were published by Johns Hopkins University Press.|$|E
5|$|Her {{first solo}} album My Winter Storm (2007) {{contains}} rock and metal songs {{as well as}} songs that resemble <b>classical</b> songs. Turunen uses both her <b>classical</b> singing voice and a rock-sounding voice. In many songs she starts with a rock voice, and then switches for widely arching melodies into a distinctly <b>classical</b> singing voice.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Y.C. Liu, a {{colleague}} of Walter Simon's at SOAS, published Fifty Chinese Stories. These selections from <b>classical</b> texts were presented in both <b>classical</b> and modern Chinese, together with GR romanizations and romanized Japanese versions prepared by Simon (by that time Professor Emeritus of Chinese in the University of London).|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, {{after the}} release of Smith's second album, Faryl was {{nominated}} for a <b>Classical</b> BRIT Award in the album category. The category is voted for by the public, and the shortlist comprises the ten best-selling <b>classical</b> albums of the previous year. Faryl lost to Only Men Aloud's Band of Brothers. Smith also lost in the young British <b>classical</b> performer category to Jack Liebeck, a violinist. Smith became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination. In November, Smith was awarded the best <b>classical</b> award at the 2009 Variety Club awards, the youngest ever recipient in the awards' 57-year history.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, {{after the}} release of Wonderland, Faryl was {{nominated}} for a <b>Classical</b> BRIT Award in the album category. The category is voted for by the public, and the shortlist comprises the ten best-selling <b>classical</b> albums of the previous year. Faryl lost to Only Men Aloud's Band of Brothers. Smith herself was also nominated in the young British <b>classical</b> performer category, becoming the youngest ever double <b>Classical</b> BRIT nominee.|$|E
5|$|In artistic terms, {{there was}} a revival in mosaic, and {{regional}} schools of architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew {{on a range of}} cultural influences. During the 12th century, the Byzantines provided their model of early humanism as a renaissance of interest in <b>classical</b> authors. In Eustathius of Thessalonica, Byzantine humanism found its most characteristic expression. In philosophy, there was resurgence of <b>classical</b> learning not seen since the 7th century, characterised by {{a significant increase in the}} publication of commentaries on <b>classical</b> works. In addition, the first transmission of <b>classical</b> Greek knowledge to the West occurred during the Komnenian period.|$|E
5|$|Laucke's classical/flamenco musical {{style is}} {{a blend of}} his <b>classical</b> studies with Bream, Segovia, Valdès-Blain, and his {{friendship}} with deLucía. Although <b>classical</b> and flamenco guitar are two quite different musical styles, Québec's French-language newspaper Le Soleil chronicled Laucke's feelings and reasoning about performing both.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{initially}} {{planned to}} use a jazz soundtrack but found <b>classical</b> music more apt after completing the filming. He hired Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans to compose the film's score, which consisted of two main melodies, one a waltz {{and the other a}} more <b>classical</b> theme.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of the <b>classical</b> Fourier {{transformation is}} a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, {{it is necessary that}} these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in the neighborhood of infinity) in order to ensure the existence of the Fourier integral. For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the <b>classical</b> sense. The extension of the <b>classical</b> Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The new <b>classical</b> school {{culminated in}} real {{business}} cycle theory (RBC). Like early <b>classical</b> economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new <b>classical</b> economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new <b>classical</b> and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new <b>classical</b> and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E
5|$|The song {{begins with}} austere, <b>classical</b> strings while the chord {{progression}} emphasizes tonic, submediant and flattened leading-tone chords. For the second phrase, {{which includes a}} dramatic crescendo, rhythm and ambient electronic effects are added gradually. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors from Madonna's Drowned Worlds, commented that the song is strongly inspired by different forms of <b>classical</b> music, notably contemporary <b>classical</b> music such as neoromanticism, as well as Italian opera composers and pieces such as Puccini's Madama Butterfly and Verdi's Aïda. Madonna's vocals throughout the song lack vibrato, and have drawn comparisons to medieval music.|$|E
5|$|Though {{little known}} at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s {{established}} him as the first major U.S. composer in the <b>classical</b> tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to <b>classical</b> composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and <b>classical</b> music.|$|E
5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational field are the only <b>classical</b> fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of <b>classical</b> fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second quantization, the starting point is one or more <b>classical</b> fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as <b>classical</b> fields prior to (second) quantization. While second quantization and the Lagrangian formalism associated with {{it is not a}} fundamental aspect of QFT, it is the case that so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are <b>classical</b> versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E
5|$|After its release, Faryl {{became the}} fastest-selling <b>classical</b> solo album in British chart history, selling 20,000 copies {{in the first}} four days, and a total of 29,200 copies in the first week, higher than any other debut album of a <b>classical</b> singer. Faryl entered the UK Albums Chart at number 6, rising to number 4 the next week, and was the third album by a Britain's Got Talent {{contestant}} to reach the top ten in Britain. Smith subsequently embarked on a promotional tour in the US to publicise the album, where it reached number 6 on the <b>classical</b> chart.|$|E
5|$|Elmo Hope {{was born}} on June 27, 1923, in New York City. His parents, Simon and Gertrude Hope, were {{immigrants}} from the Caribbean, and had several children. Elmo began playing the piano aged seven. He had <b>classical</b> music lessons as a child, and won solo piano recital contests from 1938. Fellow pianist Bud Powell was a childhood friend; together, they played and listened to jazz and <b>classical</b> music. Hope attended Benjamin Franklin High School, which was known for its music program. He developed an excellent understanding of harmony, and composed jazz and <b>classical</b> pieces at school.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} can {{be understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from <b>classical</b> physics. The first step is the realization that <b>classical</b> mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.|$|E
5|$|He is {{best known}} for his {{association}} with the period-performance orchestra The English Concert which he helped found and directed from the keyboard for over 30 years in baroque and early <b>classical</b> music. He is a former artistic director of Canada's National Arts Centre Orchestra and founded The <b>Classical</b> Band in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Ilaiyaraaja began a music {{course with}} Professor Dhanraj in Madras (now Chennai), which {{included}} {{an overview of}} Western <b>classical</b> music, compositional training in techniques such as counterpoint, and study in instrumental performance. Ilaiyaraaja specialized in <b>classical</b> guitar and had taken a course in it at the Trinity College of Music, London.|$|E
