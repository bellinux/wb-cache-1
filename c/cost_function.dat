We establish upper bounds {{on the price of}} anarchy for three different settings of link <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> and demand distributions, namely, (a) affine <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> and general distributions, (b) polynomial <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> and general positive-valued distributions, and (c) polynomial <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> and the normal distributions. All the upper bounds are tight in some special cases, including the case of deterministic demands. Comment: 31 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract⎯Economic {{dispatch}} with discontinuous <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} functions of power generation operation and control. Two major non-smooth fuel <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> of units are; units with piecewise quadratic fuel <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> and fuel <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> with operating prohibited zones. An electrical power system must be operated most economically while stays within its security limits. This paper develops a hybrid evolutionary programming, Tabu search and direct compensation algorithm to solve the discontinuous economic dispatch (DED) problem. Effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated on three example systems and compared to that of genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming (EP) and hybrid EP, Tabu search and quadratic programming. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed method can provide accurate solutions with reasonable performance. Index Terms⎯Discontinuous <b>cost</b> <b>functions,</b> evolutionar...|$|R

25|$|A {{version of}} SVM for {{regression}} was proposed in 1996 by Vladimir N. Vapnik, Harris Drucker, Christopher J. C. Burges, Linda Kaufman and Alexander J. Smola. This method is called support vector regression (SVR). The model produced by support vector classification (as described above) depends {{only on a}} subset of the training data, because the <b>cost</b> <b>function</b> for building the model does not care about training points that lie beyond the margin. Analogously, the model produced by SVR depends only on {{a subset of the}} training data, because the <b>cost</b> <b>function</b> for building the model ignores any training data close to the model prediction. Another SVM version known as least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) has been proposed by Suykens and Vandewalle.|$|E

Specifically, we show how to obtain upper bounds for approximation factor alpha for a given class of <b>cost</b> <b>functions.</b> For example for concave <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> the factor is at most 3 / 2, for quadratic <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> it is at most 4 / 3, and for polynomial <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> of maximal degree d it is at at most d + 1.

40|$|This study {{includes}} {{an estimate of}} <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> for paddy farms in Formosa. Two types of estimational techniques are used; namely regression estimates and synthesized or budgeted cost curves. Long-run and short-run regression-derived curves are estimated for rice and sweet potato farms from samples which provide the observations. Estimates are for total <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> with average <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> computed per hectare. From sample observations, {{it was possible to}} derive, through regression estimates, only linear total <b>cost</b> <b>functions.</b> The non-linear average <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> have only slight (economically unimportant) slopes beyond 2 Â•- 5 hectares. Hence, large farms {{do not seem to be}} an important policy imperative. However, the steep slope of the average <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> for farms under 1 - 5 hectares suggest that further farm fragmentation should be prevented. The cost estimates based on synthesized functions result in conclusions paralleling those based on regression-estimated <b>cost</b> <b>functions.</b> The area at which minimum average costs occur differs among sets of fixed inputs. However, the level of costs at minimum points on the curves are similar for the numerous resource situations examined. Within the limitations of the data and results, we believe both estimational techniques imply similar policy prescriptions. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

25|$|Models may not {{consistently}} converge {{on a single}} solution, firstly because many local minima may exist, depending on the <b>cost</b> <b>function</b> and the model. Secondly, the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum. Thirdly, for sufficiently large data or parameters, some methods become impractical.|$|E
25|$|In {{the money}} market {{practitioners}} might use different techniques to solve for {{different areas of}} the curve. For example, at the short end of the curve, where there are few cashflows, the first few elements of P may be found by bootstrapping from one to the next. At the long end, a regression technique with a <b>cost</b> <b>function</b> that values smoothness might be used.|$|E
25|$|Head motion {{correction}} {{is another}} common preprocessing step. When the head moves, the neurons under a voxel move and hence its timecourse now represents largely that {{of some other}} voxel in the past. Hence the timecourse curve is effectively cut and pasted from one voxel to another. Motion correction tries different ways of undoing this to see which undoing of the cut-and-paste produces the smoothest timecourse for all voxels. The undoing is by applying a rigid-body transform to the volume, by shifting and rotating the whole volume data to account for motion. The transformed volume is compared statistically to the volume at the first timepoint {{to see how well}} they match, using a <b>cost</b> <b>function</b> such as correlation or mutual information. The transformation that gives the minimal <b>cost</b> <b>function</b> is chosen as the model for head motion. Since the head can move in a vastly varied number of ways, {{it is not possible to}} search for all possible candidates; nor is there right now an algorithm that provides a globally optimal solution independent of the first transformations we try in a chain.|$|E

This is a strong and particular property that can be useful for various image recovery problems. The minimization of such <b>cost</b> <b>functions</b> presents a computational challenge. We propose a fast minimization algorithm to solve this numerical problem. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
