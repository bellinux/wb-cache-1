2500|$|Ben {{believes}} {{the second part}} of the swing, the downswing, is initiated by the hips starting to turn. [...] A baseball player throws a ball by transferring his weight and rotates his hips. [...] Then his shoulders and arm follow after.

[...] The downswing is at a slightly shallower angle and therefore the arms and hands should come from the inside-out on the downswing. [...] The <b>club</b> <b>head</b> reaches its maximum speed, not at impact, but right after, when both arms are fully extended.|$|E
