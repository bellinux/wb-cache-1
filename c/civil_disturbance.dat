5|$|The Shaoguan {{incident}} was a <b>civil</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{which took place}} overnight on 25/26 June 2009 in Guangdong province, China. A violent dispute erupted between migrant Uyghurs and Han workers at a toy factory in Shaoguan {{as a result of}} allegations of the sexual assault of a Han female. Groups of Han set upon Uyghur co-workers, leading to at least two Uyghurs being killed (although other reports indicate a higher death toll), and some 118 people injured, most of them Uyghurs.|$|E
5|$|Complete {{independence}} from British rule was granted on 10 December 1963, with the ZNP/ZPPP coalition as the governing body. The government requested a defence agreement from the United Kingdom, {{asking for a}} battalion of British troops to be stationed on the island for internal security duties, but this was rejected as it was deemed inappropriate for British troops {{to be involved in}} the maintenance of law and order so soon after independence. Much of the cabinet which was seeking closer ties with Egypt (ruled by the radical, anti-Western nationalist Nasser) did not want British troops in Zanzibar anyway. British intelligence reports predicted that a <b>civil</b> <b>disturbance,</b> accompanied by increasing communist activity, was likely in the near future and that the arrival of British troops might cause the situation to deteriorate further. However, many foreign nationals remained on the island, including 130 Britons who were direct employees of the Zanzibar government.|$|E

The unrest began in South Central Los Angeles on April 29, after a trial jury acquitted four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department for usage of excessive force in the videotaped arrest and beating of Rodney King. It then spread throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area as thousands of people rioted over a six-day period following the announcement of the verdict.|$|E
25|$|The Dead Rabbits riot was {{a two-day}} <b>civil</b> <b>disturbance</b> in New York City {{resulting}} {{from what was}} originally a small-scale street fight between members of the Dead Rabbits and the Bowery Boys into a citywide gang war which occurred July 4–5, 1857. Taking advantage of the disorganized state of the city's police forcebrought about by {{the conflict between the}} Municipal and Metropolitan policethe fighting spiraled into widespread looting and damage of property by gangsters and other criminals {{from all parts of the}} city. It is estimated that between 800 and 1,000 gang members took part in the riots, along with several hundred others who used the disturbance to loot the Bowery area. It was the largest disturbance since the Astor Place Riot in 1849 and the biggest scene of gang violence until the New York Draft Riots of 1863. Order was restored by the New York State Militia, supported by detachments of city police, under Major-General Charles W. Sandford.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting a Gold Star {{in lieu of}} a Second Award of the Legion of Merit to Rear Admiral Charles Elliott Loughlin (NSN: 0-72307/1100), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States from October 1966 to June 1968 as Commandant, Naval District, Washington, D.C. Exercising outstanding leadership, tact, and judgment, Rear Admiral Loughlin successfully directed and supervised the efforts of the large, diversified complex of naval activities that comprise his command, all of which are dedicated to the mission of Fleet support. Under his command, military-civilian relationships have been enhanced, leading to an increased awareness of the important role played by the Navy in the community. Rear Admiral Loughlin maintained close contact with civilian leaders in his area of coordination with a resultant increase in integrated off-base housing for military personnel. Further, he coordinated the Navy Youth Opportunity Program and <b>Civil</b> <b>Disturbance</b> Plan for his area of command. He established policies which encourage, and has personally fostered, the closest cooperation among the Navy and the other services as well as with civilian groups. By his outstanding leadership, foresight, and keen intellect, Rear Admiral Loughlin has significantly enhanced the material effectiveness of his complex command, and has upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

25|$|Price {{undertook}} {{twenty years}} of service in India with several different regiments, during which time he was also seconded as a police superintendent. He retired from the army in 1883 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and returned to Australia, securing a plot of farm land around Heidelberg, Victoria. In 1885, he {{was appointed to the}} Victorian Military Forces, taking up a commission as an officer in its small permanent force. He subsequently formed the Victorian Mounted Rifles, an early light horse unit that helped establish the concept within the Australian military, which was raised from volunteers recruited from men based in rural Victoria. In establishing his new unit, Price obtained permission to dress them in khaki, instead of the red or blue uniforms that had been common at the time. He also instituted the slouch hat as an item of their uniform, which subsequently became a defining icon of the modern Australian Army. In 1888, he briefly took command of the Victorian Rangers, commanding them until 1889. During a <b>civil</b> <b>disturbance</b> in Melbourne in 1890 when maritime workers went on strike, Price's unit was called out to aid civilian police. The orders that he gave to his men to fire on the strikers if necessary later led to him being criticised by Premier Duncan Gillies and appearing before a court of inquiry. In the end, his actions were upheld and ultimately the strike was resolved peacefully.|$|E

Bizet decided that he was no longer safe in the city, and he and Geneviève escaped to Compiègne. Later, they moved to Le Vésinet where they sat out the two months of the Commune, within hearing distance of the gunfire that resounded as government troops gradually crushed the uprising: [...] "The cannons are rumbling with unbelievable violence", Bizet wrote to his mother-in-law on 12 May.|$|E
