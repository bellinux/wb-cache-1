Following this decision, a joint Norwegian-Swedish commission was established in December 1893. [...] This commission worked through a series of meetings to decide on the different measurements for the cartridge case. A rimless cartridge case of 55 mm length was approved, and each possible measurement (diameter at base, diameter at neck, angle of case, angle of shoulder etc.) was decided upon.

5000|$|The 3 inch gun was {{considered}} too heavy at about 1990 lb. New stronger steels [...] {{were used to}} create a weapon weighing about 1200 lb. It was a new gun with a breech {{similar to that of the}} 75 mm M3 Gun but with a new tube (barrel and <b>cartridge</b> <b>chamber)</b> design to accommodate a new cartridge. It fired the same projectiles as the 3 in M7 gun mounted on the 3in Gun Motor Carriage M10 tank destroyer and towed 3-inch Gun M5 anti-tank gun, but from a different cartridge case. The [...] "76-mm" [...] designation was chosen to help keep the supply of ammunition from being confused between the two cannon. The 76 mm also differed in that successive models received a muzzle brake and faster rifle twist.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 6.5-08 was a wildcat cartridge, {{variations}} {{existed between}} <b>cartridge</b> <b>chambers</b> {{depending on the}} reamer used to cut the chamber.

50|$|The Datach {{consists}} of a cartridge connection at its bottom, a central <b>cartridge</b> <b>chamber</b> on its back, with two spring-loaded pins on either side, which are pushed up when the unit is inserted into the Famicom, allowing the game to only be removed when the Datach {{has been removed from}} the Famicom. Its main feature is the card reading slot on the front. The cartridges resemble half-size Famicom cartridges. One side of the cartridge is flat with title sticker, while the other side is sloped inward with notches on the left and right, which correspond to the spring pins on the main Datach unit. The cards that come with the games are swiped from left to right along the card slot; they are glossy on the front with an image of the character and the backs are smooth usually having the title of the game and barcode. All cartridges, boxes, instructions have the standard FF (Famicom Family) insignia, showing they are officially licensed by Nintendo.|$|E
50|$|The GSh-301 has {{a rate of}} fire of 1,800 rounds per minute, customarily {{limited to}} 1,500 rounds per minute to reduce barrel wear. Despite that, its barrel life is quite short: 2,000 rounds. When firing a {{continuous}} burst of 100-150 rounds, the barrel is put under so much stress {{that it has to}} be replaced. The gun uses an evaporation cooling system to prevent the detonation of a high explosive round inside a heated barrel. This cooling system consists of a cylindrical water tank around the rear end of the barrel. The GSh-301 is equipped with a unique pyrotechnic mechanism to clear misfires: a small pyrotechnic cartridge is located to the left of the 30mm <b>cartridge</b> <b>chamber.</b> This pyrotechnic cartridge fires a small steel bolt through the side wall of the 30mm cartridge. The hot propellant gases following the bolt into the dud 30mm round ignite the powder charge of that round and firing continues.|$|E

2500|$|This {{revolver}} {{was thought}} of as a decent handgun for its time, but complaints arose from the military concerning the revolver's <b>cartridge</b> <b>chambering.</b> Beginning in 1899, combat reports arose from the Philippines campaign regarding the poor performance of the M1892's [...]38-caliber ammunition. [...] Specifically, users complained that the [...]38 bullet repeatedly failed to stop charging enemy tribesmen at close ranges, even when hit multiple times.

50|$|As {{with most}} semi-automatics, the pistol is readied for firing by pulling back and {{releasing}} the slide, which inserts a <b>cartridge</b> into the <b>chamber</b> and cocks the pistol.

40|$|Mechanical {{and burning}} {{characteristics}} of foamed propellants used as combustible cartridges {{have to be}} well composed {{in order to provide}} their proper function in a weapon. A basic problem, which emerges when mechanical stability at the shot is unsufficient, is a phenomenon called gas-slipping. Gas-slipping occurs when a cartrigde cannot withstand the boost caused by the igniting-process. In this case gas gets (“slips”) from the <b>cartridge</b> <b>chamber</b> into the gun barrel before the projectile arrives. This effect causes undesirable impacts on a weapon, like low projectile velocities and low reproducibility of shot-series. Especially the temperature behaviour of the mechanical properties of foamed propellants {{plays an important role in}} these considerations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} explore {{the rules of the}} {{deformation}} force during the launching of a small-diameter steel cartridge, the semi-closed bomb test method is used to test the greatest strains on chamber outer wall under the different chamber pressures. The pressure curves of <b>cartridge</b> <b>chamber</b> are measured in experiment, and the tensile test data of cartridge are loaded into the numerical calculation to compare with the experimental data. The conclusion was obtained that the calculated results match better with the experimental results by considering strain rate bilinear kinematic hardening material constitutive model. The forces on the various parts of the cartridge during launching and their deformation rules are achieved, in which the equivalent plastic strain decreases and the cylinder ring withstands the maximum equivalent stress when the cartridge case clings to the bore from the mouth to the bottom...|$|E
40|$|Particle seeding {{is a key}} {{diagnostic}} {{component of}} filter testing and flow imaging techniques. Typical particle generators rely on pressurized air or gas sources to propel the particles into the flow field. Other techniques involve liquid droplet atomizers. These conventional techniques have drawbacks that include challenging access to the flow field, flow and pressure disturbances to the investigated flow, and they are prohibitive in high-temperature, non-standard, extreme, and closed-system flow conditions and environments. In this concept, the particles are supplied directly within a flow environment. A particle sample cartridge containing the particles is positioned somewhere inside the flow field. The particles are ejected into the flow by mechanical brush/wiper feeding and sieving that takes place within the <b>cartridge</b> <b>chamber.</b> Some aspects of this concept are based on established material handling techniques, {{but they have not}} been used previously in the current configuration, in combination with flow seeding concepts, and in the current operational mode. Unlike other particle generation methods, this concept has control over the particle size range ejected, breaks up agglomerates, and is gravity-independent. This makes this device useful for testing in microgravity environments...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{caseless}} ammunition offers some advantages compared with conventional ammunition so that lighter, simpler {{and more powerful}} weapon systems can be developed. The basic principle of this concept {{is the use of}} foamed propellants based on crystalline explosives bonded in energetic reaction polymers. Due to their porous structures they are distinguished by high burning rates. Foamed propellants can be produced by the reaction injection moulding process (RIM). At Fraunhofer ICT a lot of firing tests with {{caseless ammunition}} based on foamed propellants in many configurations were successfully performed. It was possible to produce an ammunition system with high performance, e. g. a bullet velocity of about 1050 m/s at chamber pressures of about 4600 bar is reached. A very important feature of the propellant is a high thermal stability of the material. If the self-ignition of the material takes place at lower temperatures (about 160 °C) a cook-off may result, i. e. a premature ignition in a hot <b>cartridge</b> <b>chamber.</b> Therefore, in order to find thermally stable ingredients and formulations a lot of investigations by accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) are performed. In Fig. 1 the results of the ARC-measurements of different energetic materials are shown. Based on these investigations thermally stable formulations of foamed propellants for caseless ammunition can be found...|$|E

Older cameras from around the 1940 s (Kodak Brownie cameras) provided heavier clicks and clunks from their internal mechanisms.
