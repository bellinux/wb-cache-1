5|$|Balla's {{interest}} in capturing {{a single moment}} {{in a series of}} planes was inspired by his fascination with chronophotography. In later, more abstract works created during World War I, Balla used planes of <b>color</b> <b>to</b> suggest movement.|$|E

50|$|Map {{coloring}} is {{the act of}} assigning different <b>colors</b> <b>to</b> different {{features on}} a map. There are two very different uses of this term. The first is in cartography, choosing the <b>colors</b> <b>to</b> be used when producing a map. The second is in mathematics, {{where the problem is}} to determine the minimum number of <b>colors</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>color</b> a map so that no two adjacent features have the same colour.|$|R

5|$|Young {{specimens}} of Tylopilus rubrobrunneus have a purplish cap, but unlike T.plumbeoviolaceous, their stems are never purple. The species Tylopilus microsporus, known only from China, {{is characterized by}} pale violet to violet cap, paler purple to purplish brown stem, and flesh <b>color</b> <b>to</b> pale purplish red pores. In addition to its different distribution, it can be distinguished from T.plumbeoviolaceus by its smaller spores. Another similar Asian species, T.obscureviolaceus, is only known from the Yaeyama Islands in southwestern Japan. It differs from T.plumbeoviolaceous in having a cap that does not fade in <b>color</b> <b>to</b> grayish or brownish when mature, shorter spores (6–7.2 by 3.3–4µm), and other microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Chiller was repainted {{before the}} 2005 season began, giving a new dark blue <b>color</b> <b>to</b> the Batman side while {{touching}} up the Robin side's fading red.

5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their <b>color</b> <b>to</b> be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E

We will propose two relaxations based on Semi-Denite Programming models for graph and hypergraph <b>coloring,</b> <b>to</b> approximate those (generally) NP-hard problems, as well as a generalization of the works of Karger et al. for hypergraph <b>coloring,</b> <b>to</b> find good feasible solutions with a probabilistic approach...|$|R
5|$|Cobalt {{compounds}} {{have been}} used for centuries to impart a rich blue <b>color</b> <b>to</b> glass, glazes, and ceramics. Cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculpture and Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in 79 AD), and in China dating from the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) and the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD).|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds, cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue <b>color</b> <b>to</b> glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} {{are specific}} treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics of the stone {{in one or more}} ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy <b>color</b> <b>to</b> a white diamond.|$|E

Other modifications such as changing the red background <b>color</b> <b>to</b> orange led to the current design, in use since 1969. The National Assembly of Bhutan codified a code of conduct in 1972 to formalize the flag's design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions for flying the flag.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{commercial}} use of Se, accounting for about 50% of consumption, {{is for the}} production of glass. Se compounds confer a red <b>color</b> <b>to</b> glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and <b>color</b> <b>to</b> the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E

At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer {{a few feet from the}} gate, mauling him severely.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red <b>color</b> <b>to</b> flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E

5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant <b>color</b> <b>to</b> previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E
5|$|In early 1999, Yoshiki Okamoto, {{then head}} of Capcom's screenwriter {{subsidiary}} Flagship, proposed his idea of remaking the original The Legend of Zelda for the Game Boy <b>Color</b> <b>to</b> Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer at Nintendo who created the series. Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, and held on to his concept of bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience {{the merits of the}} original Zelda, but also as a test for the development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if {{it turned out to be}} successful.|$|E

The film features heavily stylized use of <b>color</b> <b>to</b> convey this sense of duality, {{and the nature of the}} characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E
