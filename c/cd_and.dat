5|$|All four cover sleeves for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer ND Chow. The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding {{the door to}} a red telephone box in Covent Garden, London, with the album title and her name superimposed on the booth. This marks Hamasaki's third album cover to be photographed and directed outside of Japan, after LOVEppears and (Miss)understood. The <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with parts of the British stripes across her face. The box set is coloured black with the red British cross near the corner; the album version is the <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> DVD format, with the <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> DVD cover imprinted onto the mug, red tea tin, and the bag. The digital release uses the standalone CD format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Chow, and the design was based on Hamasaki's first visit to the UK and Britannia. First pressing issues for both the standalone CD format, the <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> DVD format, and the box set included a 36–page photo album of Hamasaki roaming the streets and wondering around stores and markets in London.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) is a carbon (<b>C)</b> <b>and</b> {{nitrogen}} (N) reservoir comprising {{a continuum of}} overlapping pools of different sizes, composition, turnover times and levels of significance to <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N cycling in terrestrial systems. The mineralization of SOM provides <b>C,</b> N <b>and</b> energy to microorganisms and N to plants. Soil <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N dynamics are linked {{to each other and}} N is usually the limiting substrate for C microbial turnover. Soil <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N demand increase with higher crop yields and risks of depletion of soil reserves arise when removals are larger than inputs. Assessing the <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N dynamics in sensitive SOM pools is a key to measure changes in soil quality under intensive agriculture. Short-term (18 -month) <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N dynamics was studied using stable isotopes (15 N <b>and</b> 13 <b>C)</b> in four SOM pools under maize-soybean cropping systems. ^ Temporal changes in total soil <b>C</b> (TSC) <b>and</b> N (TSN) were related to the amount of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N inputs and removals each cycle. The LF and MHA were the most labile fractions with greater sensitivity to <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N of residue inputs. The LF displayed the largest seasonal fluctuation in <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N gains and removals. The change in 13 <b>C</b> <b>and</b> 15 N enrichment revealed the sequence of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N turnover as LF 3 ̆e MHA 3 ̆e CaHA 3 ̆e Humin. Biological activity dominates the <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N turnover in the LF and MHA due to their simpler chemical composition and reduced protection by minerals while the turnover of CaHA and Humin suggest that abiotic processes dominate turnover. The contribution of individual fractions to TSN follows Humin-N 3 ̆e CaHA-N 3 ̆e MHA-N 3 ̆e LF-N. Manipulation of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N cycling in agricultural ecosystems depends on the rate <b>and</b> timing of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N additions to soil, the removals at harvest and the changes in the physical environment. TSC gains were measured only in systems attaining high crop productivity. ...|$|R

40|$|The grazing {{exclusion}} in degraded grassland {{has been extensively}} used to prevent the loss of grassland resources and to improve grassland services. The effects of {{grazing exclusion}} on <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N balance, however, have not been well addressed but are essential for assessing grassland C sinks, the sustainable use of grassland resources {{and the support of}} grassland services. To understand the response of ecosystem <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N to grazing exclusion in semiarid grassland, we determined the <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N in litter, aboveground biomass, roots and soils from ungrazed grassland fenced at different times in northwest China. Our results showed that the aboveground biomass, root biomass and plant litter were 70 - 92 %, 56 - 151 % and 59 - 141 % higher, respectively, in grazer excluded grassland than in grazed grassland. Grazing exclusion significantly increased <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N stored in plant biomass and litter and increased the concentrations <b>and</b> stocks of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N in soils. Grazing exclusion thus significantly increased the <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N stored in grassland ecosystems. The increase in <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N stored in soil contributed to more than 95 % and 97 % of the increases in ecosystem <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N storage. The highest <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N stocks in ecosystems were observed in 17 -year grazer excluded grassland. The results from this study indicate that grazing exclusion has the potential to increase <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N storage in degraded semiarid grassland and that the recovery of ecosystem <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N was mainly due to the accumulation of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N in soils...|$|R
