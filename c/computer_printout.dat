25|$|Edward Lorenz was {{an early}} pioneer of the theory. His {{interest}} in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961. Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to run his weather simulation. He {{wanted to see a}} sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions {{in the middle of the}} original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the <b>computer</b> <b>printout.</b> The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome. Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine the {{challenges}} posed by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) developments {{on the law}} and practice of admissibility of documentary evidence by Tanzanian courts. Particular focus is put {{on the issues of}} admissibility of <b>computer</b> <b>printouts</b> in courts. The main argument advanced in this thesis is that the Tanzania Evidence Act, 1967 (the TEA), being developed without reference to digital technologies, is inadequate to govern the admissibility of <b>computer</b> <b>printouts</b> with sensible results. The methodology of data collection deployed in this thesis is predominantly documentary review. Throughout, I have made substantial reference to the landmark case in Trust Bank Tanzania Ltd versus Le-Marsh Enterprises Ltd and Others to analyze the legal issues emerging from dealing with <b>computer</b> <b>printouts</b> in the courtroom when their admissibility is at issue. This case is the only available decision in Tanzania to deal with admissibility of <b>computer</b> <b>printouts.</b> In fulfilling the above mission, this thesis is organized in five Chapters. Chapter One sets out the aims of the thesis, background information to the problem of admissibility of <b>computer</b> <b>printouts</b> in courts, and literature review of previous works on the subject. The notion of electronic document is treated in Chapter Two. Chapter Three specifically focuses on bankers’ books {{as a result of the}} landmark case cited above. Chapter Four briefly reviews the evidentiary rules of admissibility of documentary evidence: the best evidence rule, the rule against hearsay and authentication at common law and under the TEA, 1967. It also deals with an interpretative approach of Tanzanian courts in admitting <b>computer</b> <b>printouts</b> in the form of bankers’ books. Chapter Five comprises concluding remarks and recommendations...|$|R

5000|$|A major PDUFA goal {{is for the}} FDA {{to review}} and provide a ruling on {{applications}} within one year unless significant changes are made to the application {{during the last three}} months of the review cycle. In a 1997 speech given prior to leaving the FDA David Kessler said, [...] "So far we have reviewed 95% of the 1995 group on time.

[...] The PDUFA goal for the 1995 group called for a 70% on-time record. The 95% on-time rate more than doubled the pre-PDUFA on-time level of about 40%. Kessler said the FDA achieved similar positive results with other PDUFA goals, including in its review time for efficacy supplements (requests to add a new indication or a new group of patients to an already approved drug), submissions for manufacturing supplements (for making significant changes in the way a drug is made or using a new manufacturing facility) and resubmissions (responses provided to questions or alleged deficiencies raised by the FDA).|$|E
50|$|In early 1976 Rapoport chanced on {{a box of}} {{discarded}} computer printouts {{in the basement of}} the UC Berkeley Mathematics Department, a find which eventually lead to her reinvention as a digital artist. Printed in standard carbon-black dot matrix font on ruled, perforated, wide-format paper, these data sheets represent complex coded analyses of information. At this early stage, Rapoport did not have access to the meaning of the printouts. She used a limited palette of colored pencil and letter stencils to respond aesthetically to the printed data-sets and charts, resulting in dense, intricate abstract drawings. She soon began her collaboration with Professor of Anthropology Dorothy Washburn, creating drawings on printouts representing analysis of symmetry in Anasazi pottery design.Rapoport’s later computer drawings are the embodiment of a research-based practice in which she collaborated with many leading experts in the sciences and humanities. The long, linear nature of the <b>computer</b> <b>printout</b> paper facilitated her move towards an artmaking process involving the collection, synthesis, and presentation of information. These drawings include images, texts, and representations of data appropriated from primary sources, and explore current events, chemistry, art history, psychology, the history of science, and the role of women in society. Rapoport made use of reproduction technologies including stencils, solvent image transfers, and photocopies, and she used colored pencil to draw into the resulting densely layered imagery. Developed alongside her groundbreaking computer mediated interactive installations, many works turned her analytical eye on herself and her psychological constitution, exploring her personal history, her family, and domestic objects in her possession.Installations and PerformancesRapoport’s computer-assisted interactive installations of the early 1980’s are among the earliest artworks to use computers in gallery contexts. She collaborated with coders to create programs that gathered data about participants’ choices and used algorithms to analyze their personality. These works are startlingly prescient of our 21st century computer-mediated social life.|$|E
