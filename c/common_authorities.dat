Rather, they are groups of planetary systems that recognize <b>common</b> <b>authorities.</b> The Fourth Alliance, Phemus Circle, and Cecropia Federation also recognize a central authority in the Ethical Council, of which Julian Graves is a member.|$|E
5000|$|In 1642, {{during the}} early stages of the English Civil War, local forces were {{employed}} everywhere by all sides that could. They produced valid written authority, inducing them to assemble. The two most <b>common</b> <b>authorities</b> used were, on the side of the Parliament, its own recent [...] "Militia Ordinance"; or that of the king, the old-fashioned [...] "Commissions of Array". But the Royalist leader in Cornwall, Sir Ralph Hopton, indicted the enemy before the grand jury of the county as disturbers of the peace, and had the posse comitatus called out to expel them.|$|E
5000|$|Rhymes are {{sometimes}} classified into the categories [...] "rime pauvre" [...] ("poor rhyme"), [...] "rime suffisante" [...] ("sufficient rhyme"), [...] "rime riche" [...] ("rich rhyme") and [...] "rime richissime" [...] ("very rich rhyme"), {{according to the}} number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example, to rhyme [...] "parla" [...] with [...] "sauta" [...] would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme [...] "pas" [...] with [...] "bras" [...] a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and [...] "tante" [...] with [...] "attente" [...] a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute [...] "e" [...] in <b>common).</b> <b>Authorities</b> disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.|$|E

5000|$|The {{constitution}} prohibits {{discrimination based}} on race, sex, disability, age, ethnicity, religion, political opinion, or social status; however, {{the government does not}} consistently enforce these prohibitions. Corruption is widespread and is not vigorously combatted. The police forces are considered to be rife with corruption. Principals and teachers take bribes to admit students to schools. Nepotism is <b>common.</b> <b>Authorities</b> commit arbitrary and unlawful killings. Torture by police is not specifically prohibited by law, and a constitutional provision concerning torture is not enforceable; in practice, indeed, security officers use torture frequently, and the use of excessive force by the police is widespread. Mob violence is also a frequent occurrence, with rape suspects, especially, often being beaten by mobs, the members of which are rarely punished. Local government is principally in hands of tribal chiefs. [...] The constitution includes strongly worded guarantees of fundamental freedom, but it also permits the government to restrict or suspend these rights. Amnesty International maintains that these rights are especially threatened by “draconian security legislation such as the Sedition and Subversive Activities Act and the 2008 Suppression of Terrorism Act (STA),” and notes that “the provisions of the formerAct are vague and can be interpreted in such a manner as to severely curtail the enjoyment of freedom of expression, among other rights, and allow for punishments of up to twenty years’ imprisonment without the option of a fine.” Amnesty International points out that “provisions in the STA are sweeping and imprecise while the penalties for breaches are severe,” with the term “terrorist act” in particular being defined very broadly. Human Rights Watch, too, has used the word “draconian” to describe the Sedition and Subversive Activities Act.|$|E

Taking account of its present possibilities, each economy {{must try to}} orient its {{productive}} activities towards the hierarchy of world demand growth rates. So, logically, the State has to lead together a structural policy, an industrial policy, a trade policy and an exchange policy.

40|$|To {{speak of}} a {{relationship}} between the European Union {{on the one hand and}} Latin America and the Caribbean on the other (hereinafter EU-LAC) suggests a symmetry between the two partners that is difficult to substantiate. Actually, the EU is a treaty-based organization with legal personality and exclusive competences vested in <b>common</b> <b>authorities,</b> while the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC, as for its Spanish acronym) is an informal forum fully deprived of legal structure, headquarters, competences and budget. While the (now 28) European heads ofstatejointly integrate the European Council, a top EU decision-making body, their 33 LatinAmerican counterparts participate in nothing even remotely similar. Therefore, the biennial EU-LAC summits that have taken place since 1999 * and all things related - may bring together two regions, but not two organizations. If this distinction is relevant in several issue areas, it is even more so in the security and defence realm, where organization is crucial for decision-making, monitoring and enforcement...|$|E

40|$|Luther’s {{adoption}} of {{the theology of the}} via moderna (also called the Nominalists) varied during the late medieval period. This school of thought had developed during the 15 th century mainly as a method for interpreting Aristotle and relied on certain 14 th-century authorities, such as William of Ockham, John Buridan, Gregory of Rimini, and Peter of Ailly among others. Luther studied philosophy according to the via moderna in Erfurt, where his teachers Jodocus Trutfetter and Bartholomaeus Arnoldi of Usingen represented a position that tolerated the Thomist and Scotist views. The school also featured a specific kind of theology based on its interpretation of Aristotle. Among the most influential theologians in the German via moderna was Gabriel Biel in Tübingen, whose theology was crucial for Luther’s understanding of the school’s positions. Besides Ockham, whom Biel mentioned as his main authority in his Sentences commentary, Biel adopted the positions of several other authors, even outside the <b>common</b> <b>authorities</b> of the via moderna. Other influential theologians and philosophers affiliated with the via moderna were John Mair in Paris and John Eck in Ingolstadt. Later both became adversaries of Luther and the Lutherans, as did Luther’s former teacher Usingen. The University of Wittenberg did not support the via moderna at all. Thomist and Scotist forms of the via antiqua were predominant among its academics, including the later Reformer Andreas Bodenstein of Karlstadt. During his early years as a student in Erfurt, Luther remained largely among the camp of the via moderna. Soon after moving to Wittenberg, Luther developed his criticism of Aristotle and late medieval theology, where his main target was Biel’s theology, especially his doctrine of grace. However, during those years Luther retained much of his early education, including an interpretation of Aristotle in which he adopted several of Ockham’s ideas. During his later years, Luther made use of terminological tools of the via moderna, even when opposing some of its theological positions...|$|E
