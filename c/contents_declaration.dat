40|$|I {{would like}} to thank my supervisor, Professor Gerhard de Jager, for giving me the {{opportunity}} to work in the Digital Image Processing group, and for his enthusiasm and guidance throughout this project. I also wish to thank: • Trent Jacobs for his help and support. • All the members of the Digital Image Processing group who provided an interesting and stimulating working environment. ii This thesis presents a model-based algorithm that tracks hand movements for the recognition of gestures. The system makes use of a ‘free moving ’ visual approach, which is inexpensive compared to the cumbersome virtual reality data-gloves currently available. The approach to this thesis is twofold. First, a study of human generated gestures is undertaken to determine if gestures can in fact be used for communication and device control. The results also offer a few architectural guidelines for designing a recognition system. The second part discusses the development of the algorithm itself. This system does not make use of colour information, instead, edge detection is used to locate the various body features. Two categories of gestures are recognised: static eg. pointing, and motion eg. waving. A frame rate of 8 Hz has been achieved, and a total of 15 gestures can be recognised. iii <b>Contents</b> <b>Declaration...</b>|$|E

40|$|Many {{informal}} sector scholars discovered that small informal businesses do not grow and develop. However scholars who went further and investigated factors influencing growth of these businesses did not cover all possible hindrances to growth. There are minor investigations {{with regards to}} South African township home-based enterprises, {{and there is also}} less information on the way in which growth of these businesses is affected by the location of a business or entrepreneur‟s social context. The purpose of this research is to investigate the following gaps concerning the hindrances to growth of township home-based enterprises: the way in which these businesses are affected by their social context, their nature and the way they access land. It focuses only on South African township home-based enterprises. The factors that are investigated includes: factors that arise {{due to the nature of}} the businesses (being informal and operating at small scale), the factors that arise due to the businesses‟ social context and factors that arise due to the stigma attached to the {{informal sector}} businesses. Pimville was used as the case study for this research and the interviews conducted a census rather than sample. A Questionnaire was used as the tool for data collection but data collection was in the form of interviews. Interviews were in the interviewee‟s language of choice and translated to English by interviewers. A team of eleven interviewers was used and most of them could at least understand most spoken languages in the area. The findings of this research indicate that, factors that influence growth of township home-based enterprises are: growth objective, employee recruitment and development, product market, financial resources, local business collaboration or networking, owner‟s motivation, owner‟s education background and training qualification, past business experience, size of the founding team, environment/industry specific factors, characteristics of the firm or business and entrepreneur-community relationships. Although these factors either have a negative or positive influence on growth, negative influences overcome positive influences. However, some of the factors that have negative influence have a combine influence that create other factors. Therefore interventions should focus on addressing key factore and this will result in the trickle down to other negative factors. Page | vi TABLE OF <b>CONTENTS</b> <b>Declaration</b> [...] -...|$|E
40|$|Search engines hold online auctions among search {{advertisers}} who are {{bidding for}} the advertisement slots {{in the search}} engine results pages. Search engines employ a pay- per-click model in which advertisers are charged whenever their ads are clicked by users. If a user clicks on an ad and then takes a particular action, which the corresponding advertiser has deﬁned as valuable to her business, such as an online purchase, or signing up for a newsletter, or a phone call, then the user’s action is counted as a conversion. A naive estimate of the conversion rate (CR) of an ad is {{the average number of}} conversions per click. The average number of clicks and the average position of the ad also aﬀect its conversion rate. However, all such ad statistics are heuristics at best. The challenge here {{is that there is no}} performance statistics accrued for the newly created ads. In order to get any kind of performance data, new ads have to be advertised ﬁrst and precious marketing dollars have to be spent. If CR estimates are precise, then advertisers can manage their campaigns more eﬀectively and can have a better return on their invest- ments. Alternatively, one can use the available data for the existing ads and engineer a set of features that best characterize conversions for an advertisement campaign in general. We took the second approach and used probabilistic inference for extracting text features. Using these text features, we built a prediction model to estimate the true CRs of unknown ads. Our experiment results demonstrated that such text features improved the accuracy of our predictions. Furthermore, hybrid models that combine text and numeric features achieved a superior predictive power compared to using only text features or only numeric features. <b>Contents</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Authorship ii Abstract iii Oz iv Acknowledgments vi List of Figures ix List of Tables x 1 Introduction 1 1. 1 Online Advertising Overview......................... 1 1. 2 Goal and Motivations............................. 5 1. 3 Outline..................................... 6 2 Literature Review 7 3 Probabilistic Models 10 3. 1 Topic Models and LDA............................ 10 3. 1. 1 Introduction to LDA.......................... 11 3. 1. 2 Graphical Representation of LDA................... 12 3. 1. 2. 1 Bayesian Networks...................... 12 3. 1. 2. 2 Dirichlet Distribution.................... 14 3. 1. 2. 3 LDA Posteriori........................ 16 3. 1. 3 Approximation of Posterior Inference................ 16 3. 1. 3. 1 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)........... 17 3. 1. 3. 2 LDA Posterior Approximation............... 18 4 Methodology 21 4. 1 Problem Statement............................... 21 4. 2 Feature Extraction............................... 21 4. 2. 1 Numeric Features............................ 21 4. 2. 2 Average CR of Keywords in Same Ad-group............. 22 4. 2. 3 Average CR of Keywords in Same Campaign............ 22 4. 2. 4 Match Types.............................. 23 4. 2. 5 Non-linear Features.......................... 23 4. 2. 6 Topic based Features.......................... 23 4. 3 Model Construction.............................. 24 5 Experiments 26 5. 1 Experiment Settings.............................. 26 5. 1. 1 Data Description............................ 26 5. 1. 2 Pre-processing Data.......................... 28 5. 1. 2. 1 Cleaning Data........................ 28 5. 1. 2. 2 Scaling Attributes...................... 28 5. 1. 2. 3 Training, Cross Validation, and Testing.......... 29 5. 1. 3 Evaluation Rules............................ 30 5. 1. 3. 1 Evaluation Protocols.................... 30 5. 1. 3. 2 Evaluation Metrics..................... 30 5. 2 Experimental Results.............................. 30 6 Conclusion 32 A Terms and Evaluation Metrics 34 A. 1 Evaluation Metrics Used in Ranked Results... 34 A. 2 Evaluation Metrics Used in Regression Predictions............. 35 Bibliograph...|$|E
40|$|Electricityconsumptionincreasessubstantiallyovertheyearswhereresidentialusesignif- icantly {{contributes}} to the overall consumption. The growth in the population and variety of home appliances together with increasing comfort levels of the people results in higher levels of residential electricity use. In fact, nearly one fourth of Turkey’s total electricity consumption {{is due to the}} domestic use. To achieve global sustainability targets and re- duce the overall electricity use, focusing on the domestic consumption is crucial. In this research, the energy consumptions patterns of households are determined to identify the potential electricity savings existing in the residential sector, such as standby consump- tion and the potential electricity use which can be shifted to oﬀ-peak hours. Moreover, speciﬁc policy recommendations which can promote the behavioral change are driven by measuring the responsiveness of people to diﬀerent measures and the combinations of measures such as information, feedback, rewards, and social inﬂuences. A survey was conducted to determine the patterns and the responsiveness of the resi- dential customers. The results obtained from the survey are used to depict a general view of Turkish households towards electricity consumption behaviors and their energy eﬃciency attitudes. Responses indicate there should be more regulations and improve- ments in energy policy. Moreover, clustering technique is used to characterize the groups of households. Cluster analysis proved the importance of unique and more speciﬁc in- terventions on energy saving among households. In the end, an electricity allocation problem is solved in order to see possible impacts of behavioral change measures on the network. Scenarios are deﬁned for each policy and allocation problem is solved to see the possible generation cost reduction. Also, gas emissions for each scenario is recorded to understand the possible eﬀects of policies on the environment. Results show that behavioral change studies seem to be well worth to study. In order to reach residential eﬃciency, possible policy alternatives are suggested for Turkish households. Keywords: Energyeﬃciency, consumerbehaviors, behavioralchange, householdsurvey, cluster analysis, impacts on electricity network. <b>Contents</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Authorship ii Abstract iii Öz iv Acknowledgments v List of Figures viii List of Tables x 1 Introduction 1 1. 1 Motivation [...] 2 1. 2 Problem Deﬁnition [...] . 3 1. 3 Contribution [...] 4 2 Literature Survey 6 2. 1 Sustainable Energy [...] . 6 2. 1. 1 Energy Eﬃciency [...] 7 2. 1. 2 World Energy Outlook [...] . 8 2. 1. 3 Energy Overview of Turkey [...] 10 2. 1. 4 Turkish Electricity Market [...] . 13 2. 1. 5 Household Energy [...] . 14 2. 1. 6 Residential Electricity Consumption Trends [...] . 15 2. 2 Consumer Behavior [...] . 17 2. 3 Behavioral Change Measures [...] . 21 2. 3. 1 Information [...] . 22 2. 3. 1. 1 Workshops [...] 22 2. 3. 1. 2 Information leaﬂets and posters [...] . 22 2. 3. 1. 3 Mass media campaigns [...] . 23 2. 3. 1. 4 Tailored information [...] . 23 2. 3. 1. 5 modeling [...] . 24 2. 3. 1. 6 Energy labeling [...] 24 2. 3. 2 Feedback [...] 25 2. 3. 2. 1 Direct displays [...] 25 2. 3. 2. 2 Dynamic pricing [...] . 27 2. 3. 2. 3 Indirect feedback [...] . 29 2. 3. 3 Rewards and Incentives [...] 30 2. 3. 4 Goal Setting [...] 31 2. 3. 5 Commitment [...] 31 2. 3. 6 Social inﬂuences [...] 31 2. 4 Related Work [...] 33 3 Understanding Consumption Behaviors of Turkish Consumers 39 3. 1 Introduction to Research Analysis [...] . 39 3. 2 Survey Design [...] 41 3. 3 Factor Analysis of The Survey [...] . 43 3. 4 General Findings of the Survey [...] 45 3. 5 Cluster Analysis [...] 62 3. 5. 1 Overview of Clusters [...] 66 3. 5. 2 Proﬁling the Clusters [...] 66 3. 6 Discussion [...] 71 4 Application On Turkish Electricity Network 75 4. 1 Problem Deﬁnition [...] . 75 4. 2 Numerical Example [...] . 78 4. 3 Conclusion [...] 86 A Household Survey 88 B Tables for Factor Analysis 99 Bibliograph...|$|E

Consumers, the end users, are often addressed by informational instruments, e. g. pamphlets, campaigns, <b>content</b> <b>declarations</b> or labelling. However, consumers reliance in food products can vary for several reasons. They can dislike the price, the quality, the labelling process and organisation and the food products for ethical reasons. Consumer power can be activated for some or several of these reasons. Two types of consumer power will be discussed and analysed namely the social power of consumers, e. g. buying resistance, which can be unorganised as well as organised and secondly the political power of consumers, relying on an ideology, which can be ethical, e. g. animals rights movements. Consumer power and influence strategies will be analysed concerning reliance in products, information, labelling, shopping routines and exercised consumer power.

40|$|TSingle Wire Earth Return (SWER) {{electric}} distribution feeders {{are used}} extensively in remote parts of Queensland and other states, {{as an economic}} means to deliver electrical energy to small customer loads, scattered sparsely over vast areas. These SWER systems are normally supplied from very long three-phase distribution feeders. Due to recent strong load growth, voltage quality issues have arisen in these systems. The main SWER feeder problem is poor voltage regulation caused by increasing loads. Three-phase feeder problems include voltage unbalance and phase angle unbalance caused by increasing loads and uneven load distribution. High system network losses are also experienced, {{as a result of}} increasing loads. There are several available methods to combat these issues, however, most have not been applied to rural distribution previously. Developing simple, economic solutions to these problems is likely to dramatically improve customer power quality, resulting in reduced customer complaints, whilst improving distribution capacity and reducing losses. The emphasis of this research project is the power system modelling required to develop detailed equipment models {{that can be used to}} assess potential solutions identified in the literature. Ergon Energy Corporation in Central Queensland is supporting the project with field data and other information. This thesis has developed detailed models to study voltage regulation of SWER feeders and capacity enhancement of three-phase feeders.

Our interest leans over on the gesture of interpreting that process, not of {{the point of view of}} the analysis of the <b>contents</b> of the <b>declarations</b> of the largest agent of the country, but of observing how they are put in movement the imaginary and discursive formations (Pêcheux, 1969) on the library, that they appeared in the chosen statements for the constitution of our corpus...|$|R

40|$|Registration of new {{agents for}} the {{treatment}} of postmenopausal osteoporosis has been based {{over the past few years}} on placebo-controlled phase III trials with the incidence of patients with new vertebral/nonvertebral fractures as the most usual primary endpoint. The use of a placebo in diseases where an active treatment is available has been a matter of debate following the update of the Declaration of Helsinki by the World Medical Association which questioned this trial design. Current regulatory recommendations within the European Union suggest that placebo-controlled trials are still the best option when assessing the efficacy and safety of new drugs intended {{for the treatment}} of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This suggestion seems to be in apparent contradiction with the current <b>content</b> of the <b>Declaration</b> of Helsinki. This paper addresses the ethics and feasibility of placebo-controlled trials in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the light of available therapeutic options, and discusses possible alternative approaches in those patients where placebo treatment could be deemed to be unethical. It is concluded that placebo-controlled trials remain the most efficient design to establish the efficacy and safety of a new agent {{for the treatment of}} postmenopausal osteoporosis. Such trials are feasible and ethically acceptable in patients with osteoporosis but without prevalent vertebral fractures. Conversely, in patients with prevalent vertebral fractures, placebo-controlled trials are ethically questionable and non-inferiority trials are more appropriate. A relative margin of non inferiority of 20 - 30 % is suggested, to be discussed on a case by case basis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
