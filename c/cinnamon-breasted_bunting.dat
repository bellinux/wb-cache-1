Several aspects of song behaviour were addressed based on recordings of 58 males in the Bamenda Highlands (NW Cameroon). The song of the <b>Cinnamon-breasted</b> <b>Bunting</b> is discontinuous and consists of short (1. 2  s on average), relatively broadband (range 2. 5 - 9. 2  kHz) strophes repeated at a highly variable rate (2 - 14 strophes per minute). Each male sang a single song type consisting of 4 - 9 different syllable types. Syllable types differed in acoustic structure, and I describe a total of 40 discrete types. At the song type level, only 8 different song types were found. Males from local groups tended to have slightly more similar songs than strangers separated by a distance of more than 500  m. However, males with shared song types clearly did not aggregate. All males within the studied population shared a characteristic final whistle syllable, which resemble some other buntings. The birds sang from locations elevated above the surrounding vegetation, usually from trees or rocks. I found no significant relationship between song rate, time after sunrise, time of season and song post height...|$|E
