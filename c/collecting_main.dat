The deployment in the convergent access of local micro data-centers (DCs) nodes is one promising approach to successfully manage this challenge. These nodes {{will be responsible}} for switching enormous amounts of traffic and simultaneously performing heavy CPU tasks (such as video or radio base band processing). Only a flexible management of these nodes based on NFV, SDN and data analytics will enable to meet these tasks.

40|$|Many {{techniques}} {{have been devised}} for garbage <b>collecting</b> <b>main</b> memory heaps for programming languages, and there has more recently been progress on distributed garbage collection, for sets of long-lived processes in distributed systems. Little {{attention has been paid}} to garbage collecting large persistent stores, however. A persistent store is essentially a shared heap that outlives the execution of any given process; one can think of it as similar to a database, with object retention based on reachability (garbage collection) as opposed to explicit deletion. The Mneme 1 project is an effort to build a large distributed persistent store. Clearly, garbage collection is an issue Mneme must address. Here I consider some of the problems and solution approaches that might be taken. If invited to the workshop, I hope to convey the importance of the problem, how it is and is not related to single process and distributed garbage collection, to develop interest in the problem among ot [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Aim. Continuous {{subcutaneous}} insulin infusion (CSII) {{is used as}} {{an option}} in patients with diabetes failing to multiple daily injections (MDI). Psychological factors may play a relevant role in the failure to attain therapeutic goals in patients on MDI. This could lead to an overrepresentation of psychopathology in patients treated with CSII. Methods. A consecutive series of 100 patients with type 1 diabetes was studied, <b>collecting</b> <b>main</b> clinical parameters and assessing psychopathology with the self-reported questionnaire Symptom Checklist 90 -revised. Patients on CSII were then compared with those on MDI. Results. Of the 100 enrolled patients, 44 and 56 were on CSII and MDI, respectively. Among men, those on CSII were younger than those on MDI; conversely, no difference in age was observed in women. Women on CSII showed higher scores on most Symptom Checklist 90 subscales than those on MDI, whereas no differences were observed in men. Conclusion. Women with type 1 diabetes treated with CSII display higher levels of psychopathology than those on MDI. This is probably the consequence {{of the fact that}} patients selected for CSII are those failing to MDI. Higher levels of psychopathology could represent a limit for the attainment and maintenance of therapeutic goals with CSII...|$|E

40|$|Background. Hip {{fracture}} {{is common}} in the elderly. Previous studies suggest that psychiatric illness is common and predicts poor outcome, but have methodological weaknesses. Further studies are required to address this important issue. Methods. We prospectively recruited 731 elderly participants with hip fracture in two Leeds hospitals. Psychiatric diagnosis was made within 5 days of surgery using the Geriatric Mental State schedule and other standardized instruments, and data on confounding factors was <b>collected.</b> <b>Main</b> study outcomes were length of hospital stay, and mortality over 6 months after fracture. Results. Fifty-five per cent of participants had cognitive impairment (dementia in 40 % and delirium in 15 %), 13 % had a depressive disorder, 2 % had alcohol misuse and 2 % had other psychiatric diagnoses. Participants were likely to remain in hospital longer if they suffered from dementia, delirium or depression. The relative risks of mortality over 6 months after hip fracture were increased in dementia and delirium, but not in depression. Conclusions. Psychiatric illness is common after hip fracture, and has significant effects on important outcomes. This suggests a need for randomized, controlled trials of psychiatric interventions in the elderly hip fracture population...|$|R
