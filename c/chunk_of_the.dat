5|$|Prior to the game's events, Doctor Eggman {{builds a}} robotic {{assistant}} named Gemerl, using parts from the robot Emerl who {{was destroyed in}} Sonic Battle. Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.|$|E
5|$|No great {{compromise}} reached Taylor's desk {{during his}} presidency; instead, his last days were {{overshadowed by the}} Galphin affair. Before joining the Taylor cabinet, Secretary of War Crawford {{had served as a}} lawyer. He had been involved in a fifteen-year case, representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid {{at the time of the}} American Revolution. The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government, but Galphin's heirs only received payment on the debt's principal after years of litigation, and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration. Treasury Secretary Meredith, with the support of Attorney General Johnson, finally signed off on the payment in April 1850. To the president's embarrassment, this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $100,000 to Crawford; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public treasury to another. A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing, but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment. Taylor, who had already been sketching out a re-organization of his cabinet, now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation.|$|E

Mafiosi used their allies in government to avoid prosecution as well as persecute less well-connected rivals.

25|$|Christmas Island, due to {{its close}} {{proximity}} to Australia's northern neighbours, falls within many of the satellite footprints throughout the region. This results in ideal conditions for receiving various Asian broadcasts, which locals sometimes prefer to those emanating from Western Australia.

25|$|Parākramabāhu's constructions work {{made up a}} {{significant}} <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material history of Sri Lanka. Much of the remnants of Polonnaruwa date from his reign, as well as sites in western and south-eastern Sri Lanka. One of Parākramabāhu's first projects was the restoration of Anuradhapura, the ancient capital of Sri Lankan Kings which had been utterly destroyed by the Chola army, including the restoration of Thuparamaya (which had been lost to the jungle), Mihintale, and Ruwanwelisaya. Then, having founded an administrative center called Parakramapura, {{he turned his attention}} on Polonnaruwa. Unsurprisingly, due to the near-yearly sieges, the city had suffered and had reached a state that nothing but its name remained. It is perhaps because of this that so little of pre-12th century Polonnaruwa remains today.|$|E
25|$|The 2000–01 {{season was}} Redknapp's final year. They {{got off to}} a dismal start, {{hampered}} by further injuries (Sinclair notably, but also Ian Pearce continued absence), a number of failed loan transfers (Christian Bassila and Kaba Diawara) and unimpressive signings (Davor Šuker, reportedly on £50,000-a -week wages who only managed eight starts, Ragnvald Soma and the continued absence of Margas, who had turned up for half of the previous season). With the team in the doldrums, the board eventually accepted a bid for the team's prized asset – Rio Ferdinand – in an £18million move to Leeds United for both the British transfer record and a world record for a defender. The deal was later criticised – the fee was not paid upfront and sell-on bonus was not included, meaning the club missed out on his later £30million move to Manchester United and also a sizeable <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial transfer.|$|E
25|$|During this interregnum, 1836–1848, Americans {{nonetheless}} {{continued to}} settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan María Ponce de León, Anglo settlers such as Simeon Hart and Hugh Stephenson had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas. Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San José de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo and Hispanic settlement {{within the limits of}} modern-day El Paso, in 1844. Given the reclamations of the Texas Republic that wanted a <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Santa Fe trade, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river a formal American settlement, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side. The present Texas–New Mexico boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated {{in the past couple}} of years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; the result is that agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices.|$|E
25|$|Redknapp {{proceeded}} {{to spend a}} <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer money on a string of coolly received signings (in addition {{he was given a}} £300,000 bonus for agreeing not to spend the entire transfer sum and arranging the transfer to Leeds), forcing what was {{to be the end of}} his time at the club. Redknapp signed the Liverpool pairing of Rigobert Song (a solid, if erratic and unsuited to the physical Premiership, player with over 60 caps to his name for £2.6million) and Titi Camara (an exciting attacking player who arrived massively overweight, unfit and devoid of form after being forced out of the Liverpool first team for £2.2million), along with Scottish international Christian Dailly (who had never lived up to his great early promise for £1.75million), for a total of some £8million (including fees and final cost adjustments). These transfers were later used as ammunition against the departing Redknapp, with aspersions cast regarding agent fees and the expensive nature of Camara's alleged Pay-As-You-Play contract that would have seen further monies paid after a relatively small number of games. His only solid moves from a fan's point of view, the loan signings of Hannu Tihinen from Viking FK and Svetoslav Todorov, did little to improve the paucity in quality of the first team. The team's fortunes improved imperceptibly, but survival was ensured thanks to the poor performances of lower sides and the team finished in 15th place, comfortably out of the relegation zone.|$|E
25|$|Though Bermuda {{has been}} {{classified}} as a self-governed colony since 1620, internal self-government was bolstered by {{the establishment of a}} formal constitution in 1968, and the introduction of universal adult suffrage; debate about independence has ensued, although a 1995 independence referendum was soundly defeated. For many, Bermudian independence would mean little other than the obligation to staff foreign missions and embassies around the world, which would be a heavy obligation for Bermuda's small population, and the loss of British passports (which could severely restrict travel, as few enough countries have even heard of little Bermuda, and could regard travellers with suspicion). Another concern, which raised its head during the 1991 Gulf War, was the loss of the protection provided by the Royal Navy, especially, to the large number of merchant vessels on Bermuda's shipping register. The Bermuda government is unlikely to be able to provide naval protection to oil tankers plying the Persian Gulf, or other potentially dangerous waters. At present, Bermuda is {{able to take advantage of}} its status as part of the United Kingdom to attract overseas shipping operators to its register, although it does not contribute to the navy's budget. With independence, it was feared, a large <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money currently flowing into the Bermuda Government's coffers would disappear. The current government is promoting independence – by means of a general election (that is, the government of the day would have the power to decide whether to go independent or not) as opposed to a referendum (a direct vote by the people) – by establishing a committee to investigate (though the committee is notably staffed with party members, and without representation by the opposition party). This stance is being supported by the UN, who have sent delegations to the island claiming that Bermuda is being suppressed by the British.|$|E
