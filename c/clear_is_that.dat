5|$|Wighard (or Wigheard; died between 664 and 667) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What {{little is known}} about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but {{inconsistencies}} between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard's election and whether he was ever confirmed in that office. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome.|$|E
25|$|What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Miguel was the queen's {{favourite}} child. After {{the death}} of her firstborn, it was Miguel who received most of her attention, rather than Pedro, who was closer to his father.|$|E
25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities sometimes conflict as to who did what. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Fred was a manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, a tobacconist and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts of London.|$|E

25|$|The Aboriginal {{history from}} this area is not {{especially}} well recorded. There was a mountain clan, the Ja-itma-thang, centred on the Omeo area, but this clan would have interacted regularly with nearby tribes, including the Gunai or Kurnai of Gippsland proper. Population levels are uncertain, but were likely highly underestimated by European settlers, especially with consideration given {{to the fact that}} observation in the mountains and forests of Gippsland is far more difficult than in the more open parts of Australia. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> like elsewhere, population levels quickly declined following European occupation due to both disease and conflict, and people from this clan are no longer found in the area.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a {{standard}} gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so then perhaps {{it would have been}} cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is probably why it was permitted to use broad gauge. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster {{at about the same time}} as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway.|$|E
25|$|What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Harappan {{society was}} not entirely peaceful, with the human {{skeletal}} remains demonstrating {{some of the highest}} rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory. Paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at Harappa, with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from Area G (an ossuary located south-east of the city walls). Furthermore, rates of cranio-facial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilization collapsed amid illness and injury. The bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at Harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety, a basic feature of hierarchical societies world-wide.|$|E

25|$|In 1160, Malcolm {{returned}} to Scotland having spent months campaigning {{in the service}} of the English on the Continent. After successfully dealing with a considerable number of disaffected magnates at Perth, the Chronicle of Holyrood and the twelfththirteenth-century Chronicle of Melrose reveal that he launched three military expeditions into Galloway. The circumstances surrounding these invasions is unclear, although what is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Fergus submitted to the Scots before the end of the year. Specifically, according to Gesta Annalia I, once the Scots subdued the Gallovidians, the conquerors forced Fergus to retire to the abbey of Holyrood, and hand over his son, Uhtred, as a royal hostage. The Chronicle of Holyrood and the fifteenth-century Ordinale of Holyrood corroborate Fergus' monastic retirement, with the former source further recording Fergus' grant of the lands of Dunrod to the abbey.|$|E
25|$|In later {{books of}} the Old Testament, Aaron and his kin are not {{mentioned}} very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later. The books of Judges, Samuel and Kings mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The book of Ezekiel, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King David's priests. It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period. Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form early in this period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E

25|$|The {{fall of the}} Mauryas {{left the}} Khyber Pass unguarded, and a wave of foreign {{invasion}} followed. The Greco-Bactrian king, Demetrius, capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180BCE, forming the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, Menander, became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was {{to establish a new}} capital of Sagala, the modern city of Sialkot. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the Shungas, Satavahanas, and Kalingas are unclear, what is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Scythian tribes, renamed Indo-Scythians, brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of Mathura, and Gujarat.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of large numbers}} of bodies grouped together suggests the resistance was more protracted than originally thought, and a number of desperate last stands were made. Evidence shows that many of the bodies, today marked by cairns, were found in several large groups around the camp – including one stand of around 150 men. A Zulu account describes a group of the 24th forming a square on the neck of Isandlwana. Colonial cavalry, the NMP and the carabiniers, who could easily have fled as they had horses, died around Durnford in his last stand, while nearby their horses were found dead on their picket rope. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the slaughter was complete in the area around the camp and back to Natal along the Fugitive's Drift. The fighting had been hand-to-hand combat and no quarter was given to the British regulars. The Zulus had been commanded to ignore the civilians in black coats and this meant that some officers, whose patrol dress was dark blue and black at the time, were spared and escaped.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song on Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular, her second Thanksgiving television special which aired on ABC on November 28, 2013. She had invited singer Elton John as special guest star for the performance. After {{a performance of}} John's 1974 single [...] "Bennie and the Jets", the duo started singing [...] "Artpop". They were seated opposite {{to each other on}} piano, and Gaga was ornamented in a dress made of Coca-Cola cans. During the chorus, they were joined by The Muppets who aided with background vocals. Chris Willman from Billboard called John as the best guest performer of the special. Maricela Gonzales from Entertainment Weekly was impressed with the performance, saying that although she did not understand the message behind the song, [...] "hat is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Gaga and Elton John belong together. I'm serious, I want to go to that show." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the days}} leading to the programme's broadcast, the IOC Ethics Commission {{launched}} an enquiry to investigate the accusations made in the documentary. Even though the Panorama reporters clearly stated that the London bid was nowhere associated with the investigation, the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement, hoping {{to distance themselves from}} the scandal: [...] "What I have to make <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> London 2012 knew nothing about this—we have nothing to hide," [...] said Alan Pascoe, a London 2012 vice chairman, committing to [...] "do everything we can to co-operate [...] and take this story off the running order". Sebastian Coe, also a vice chairman at the time, reaffirmed Pascoe's words and assured [...] "London 2012 has acted properly and ethically throughout the bidding process." [...] After watching the documentary, IOC members and officials cleared London 2012 of any wrongdoing.|$|E
500|$|Abercrombie's next {{error was}} an {{apparent}} over-reliance on {{the analysis of}} Matthew Clerk. His lack of experienced engineers caused the state of French defences to be repeatedly misread. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Abercrombie, in his stated desire for haste, {{did not want to}} act on Clerk's recommendation to fortify Rattlesnake Hill, and then sought to blame Clerk, claiming he was merely acting on the engineer's advice. Clerk was one of the battle's casualties, so he was unavailable to defend himself against assignment of some of the blame. Captain Charles Lee of the 44th Foot wrote, on the prospect of using cannon on Rattlesnake Hill, [...] "There was one hill in particular, which seem'd to offer itself as an ally to us, it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the French {{in a very short time}} from their breast work [...] this was never thought of, which (one wou'd imagine) must have occur'd to any blockhead who was not absolutely so far sunk into Idiotism as to be oblig'd to wear a bib and bells." ...|$|E
500|$|The story, on {{the other}} hand, {{received}} mixed reviews though some critics looked past these flaws. GameSpot wrote that [...] "the story in Resonance of Fate is told in a drawn-out, stilted way that only reveals its agenda dozens of hours into your quest" [...] but what [...] "makes this story engaging even before your ultimate goal becomes <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the characters are well-developed and easy to relate to," [...] concluding that the [...] "quirky story provides laughs and drama." [...] Destructoid noted that [...] "Resonance of Fate builds its world mostly through inference and implication rather than exposition" [...] and added [...] "the main plot being somewhat threadbare, it never really ascends {{to the kind of}} epic scale one would expect from the genre." [...] RPGamer praised the storytelling, stating that it uses [...] "a futuristic sci-fi setting as a backdrop {{to tell the story of}} its main characters" [...] who are [...] "trying to survive in a futuristic world gone mad." [...] It chose the game as the runner-up for its Best Script award, for bringing the [...] "characters to life" [...] and [...] "doing an amazing job with the localization." [...] The game was also the runner-up for RPGamer's Best Voice Acting award.|$|E

500|$|Up to this point, {{soap operas}} used rape and its related archetypes to, like their nineteenth-century melodrama counterparts, [...] "critique power relationships, {{especially}} {{the oppression of}} the poor by the rich and of women by men". [...] Hayward believes that the storyline was initially flawed because two of the rapists, Todd and Zach, were demonized, which oversimplified rape and [...] "failed to capture the complex power relations underlying... violence towards women". [...] The perpetrators were [...] "simply evil or out control", so they and their mindsets they represented could be rejected. [...] The three characters represented three archetypes of the rapist: [...] "the evil instigator" [...] (Todd); [...] "the good resister" [...] (Powell), and [...] "the mediator between these polarized figures" [...] (Zach), but also represented a departure from how rape was treated in soap operas. [...] Brooks called the rapists [...] "a complicated alternative to the standard soap opera rapist", {{because they had a}} different relationship with their victim than in previous rape narratives and because they were multiple. Todd, whom Brooks called the [...] "evil 'other, was the leader and most villainous of the group and had a previous physical relationship with Marty. [...] Hayward said, [...] "What becomes especially <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for these characters the act of rape is not about sex, about women, or even about Marty. It is about what takes place... between men." ...|$|E
500|$|Walter was reputed for his bravery, {{bordering}} on recklessness, and was confident of success, {{as evidenced by}} his haughty reply to the 500 mercenaries. Walter's pride and arrogance, combined with his numerical advantage and his innate belief in the superiority of heavy noble cavalry over infantry, led him to fatally underestimate his opponent and order a charge across even such an adverse terrain. Impatient for action, according to Muntaner Walter formed a cavalry line of 200 Frankish knights [...] "with golden spurs", followed by the infantry, and placed himself with his banner in the vanguard. The Frankish attack failed, but the reason is unclear; Muntaner's description is short and provides no details, while Gregoras states that the heavy Frankish cavalry got completely stuck in the mud, with the Almogavars, lightly armed with swords and darts, dispatching the knights, encumbered by their heavy armour. This is the commonly accepted version among scholars as well. The Chronicle of the Morea {{on the other hand}} implies that the battle was hard-fought, which as military historian Kelly DeVries notes seems to contradict Gregoras, and that the marsh possibly simply reduced the impact of the charge instead of bogging it down entirely. What is <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Catalans held, and that the Duke and most of his men fell. As the two lines clashed, the Turkish auxiliaries, reassured {{that this was not a}} ruse, descended from their camp upon the Athenian army, panicking and routing what remained of it.|$|E
