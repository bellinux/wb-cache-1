The corresponding pounding forces are shown in Fig. 24 c, d, g and h, respectively, considering different structural weights and NF excitations. It seems evident that increasing the isolator hysteretic damping produces {{a decrease in the}} bearing displacement and consequently eliminates or at least alleviates the pounding intensity, although the heavier isolated structures are less responsive to increasing the isolators damping. Figure 24 also demonstrates that pounding is always more intense in the case of isolated heavy structures, even if they exhibit <b>closer</b> <b>bearing</b> displacements to those of isolated lighter structures. Moreover, the pounding intensity is directly proportional to the amount of extra base displacement beyond the bearing design displacement [...]...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study of dry sliding friction, {{which has a}} <b>close</b> <b>bearing</b> on the experiments done by using the atomic and friction force microscope. By performing atomic-scale calculations for the friction between a single atom and monoatomic infinite chain, we examined the effect of various material parameters on the stick-slip motion. We found that the perpendicular elastic deformation of the substrate that is induced by the sliding object is crucial for the energy damping in friction. In this case, the average friction force strongly depends on the perpendicular force constant of the substrate and the friction constant varies with the normal force. In particular, soft materials that continue to be elastic {{for a wide range}} of perpendicular compression may exhibit a second state. As a result, the hysteresis curve in the stick-slip motion becomes anisotropic...|$|R

To study this relationship, we are currently developing a compiler for Alpha [11], a functional, data parallel language based on SAREs defined over polyhedral index domains. The language semantics directly lead to sequential code based on demand driven evaluation. However, the resulting context switches can be avoided if the program is [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Several stratigraphic {{breaks and}} unconformities {{exist in the}} Mesoproterozoic {{successions}} in the northern margin of the North China Block. Geologic characters and spatial distributions of five of these unconformities, which have resulted from different geological processes, have been studied. The unconformity beneath the Dahongyu Formation is interpreted as a breakup unconformity, representing the time of transition from continental rift to passive continental margin. The unconformities beneath the Gaoyuzhuang and the Yangzhuang formations {{are considered to be}} the consequence of regional eustatic fluctuations, leading to the exposure of highlands in passive margins during low sea-level stands and transgressive deposition on coastal regions during high sea-level stands. The unconformity atop the Tieling Formation might be caused by uplift due to contractional deformation in a back-arc setting, whereas the uplift after the deposition of the Xiamaling Formation might be attributed to a continental collision event. It is assumed that the occurrences of these unconformities in the Mesoproterozoic successions in the northern margin of the North China Block had a <b>close</b> <b>bearing</b> on the assemblage and breakup of the Columbia and Rodinia supercontinents...|$|R
