40|$|Communicative <b>action</b> is the <b>coordination</b> {{mechanism}} of social actions. However, being a social action itself, it needs coordination {{in case of}} obstruction. Such obstruction is especially frequent in late modern constellation burdened with the “individualization of life forms” (Beck) and the “dissolution of a mutual ground” (Lash). I call the mechanism capable of overcoming such obstruction the “coordination of <b>action</b> <b>coordination.</b> ” In the following essay, this notion is elaborated. Firstly, {{on the level of}} formal pragmatics, situations that implicate <b>action</b> <b>coordination</b> are specified. Secondly, the coordinating {{mechanism of}} <b>action</b> <b>coordination</b> is elaborated in the frames of the Habermasian theory as the harmonization of different concepts of justice underlying <b>action</b> <b>coordination.</b> Thirdly, a paradoxical aspect of this solution is introduced, which originates from the strict linguistic-intentional character of Habermas’s theory.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{conception of}} ProteomeXchange {{stems from a}} meeting at the HUPO 2005 conference in Munich, where the main proteomics data repositories at the time agreed in principle to exchange their data, and thus provide a means for the user to find public proteomics data at any of the participating databases. In early times the name was written with a capital E (ProteomExchange), but then later (and currently) the X is capitalized (ProteomeXchange) instead. ProteomeXchange began to become reality in an HPP meeting in Barbados in 2009 where Lennart Martens, Eric Deutsch, and Phil Andrews agreed on a set of deliverables and registered the proteomexchange.org domain. ProteomeXchange was then fully developed through the 'ProteomeXchange' <b>Coordination</b> <b>Action</b> grant of the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (project reference 260558).|$|E
50|$|The ProteomeXchange {{consortium}} {{has been}} set up to provide a coordinated submission of MS proteomics data to the main existing proteomics repositories, and to encourage optimal data dissemination.

The earliest conception of ProteomeXchange stems from a meeting at the HUPO 2005 conference in Munich, where the main proteomics data repositories at the time agreed in principle to exchange their data, and thus provide a means for the user to find public proteomics data at any of the participating databases. Due to the rapid development of the field, and the need to first develop suitable standards for data exchange, it took almost ten years from that meeting to actually implement this system, an effort that was funded by the 'ProteomeXchange' <b>Coordination</b> <b>Action</b> grant of the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (project reference 260558).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Delegating the {{coordination}} role to proxy agents {{can improve the}} overall outcome of the task {{at the expense of}} cognitive overload due to switching subtasks. Stability and commitment are characteristics of human teamwork but must not prevent the detection of better opportunities. In addition, coordination proxy agents must be trained from examples as a single agent but must interact with multiple agents. We apply machine learning techniques to the task of learning team preferences from mixed-initiative interactions and compare the outcome results of different simulated user patterns.
