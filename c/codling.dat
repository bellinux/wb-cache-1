5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. <b>Codling</b> moths and apple maggots are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the <b>codling</b> moth, among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{corn earworm}} {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest, with a large host range encompassing corn and many other crop plants. H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the <b>codling</b> moth. The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The moth’s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{been implicated in}} the spread of weeds by {{consuming}} and dispersing fruit and seed. In {{the first half of}} the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting in the spread of the prickly pear. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the <b>codling</b> moth.|$|E

He proposed and drafted the first California Insecticide Law in 1906, was largely instrumental in securing its passage in 1911, and administered the law until July 1, 1923. Entomological campaigns which he conducted in California concerned the <b>codling</b> moth, the peach twig-borer, citrus insects, grasshoppers, and citrus white fly eradication.|$|E
25|$|Some moths, {{particularly}} their caterpillars, can {{be major}} agricultural pests {{in many parts}} of the world. Examples include corn borers and bollworms. The caterpillar of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) causes severe damage to forests in the northeastern United States, where it is an invasive species. In temperate climates, the <b>codling</b> moth causes extensive damage, especially to fruit farms. In tropical and subtropical climates, the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is perhaps the most serious pest of brassicaceous crops.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{following}} {{the recruitment of}} keyboard player Neil <b>Codling,</b> Suede went on to greater commercial success with Coming Up. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK, producing five top ten singles and becoming Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide. Despite problems within the band, Suede's fourth album Head Music (1999) was a British chart-topper. The album was promoted heavily with the band receiving considerable press coverage on its release, however the response from fans and critics was less enthusiastic than for previous records. <b>Codling</b> left the band in 2001, citing chronic fatigue syndrome and was replaced by Alex Lee. The band's fifth album, A New Morning (2002), the first {{following the}} collapse of Nude Records, was a commercial disappointment, and the band disbanded the following year. After much speculation Suede reformed in 2010 for a series of concerts. Three years on from their reunion gigs, Suede released their sixth album, Bloodsports. It was well received by critics and returned the band to the top ten in the UK. Their seventh album Night Thoughts followed in 2016 and became an even bigger critical and commercial success than its predecessor.|$|E

The recipe for Tart de brymlent, a fish pie from the recipe collection Forme of Cury, includes {{a mix of}} figs, raisins, apples and pears with fish (salmon, <b>codling</b> or haddock) and pitted damson plums under the top crust. It was considered important {{to make sure that}} the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics. This meant that food had to be [...] "tempered" [...] according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, condiments and spices; fish was seen as being cold and moist, and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it, such as frying or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; beef was dry and hot and should therefore be boiled; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted. In some recipe collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste. In a recipe for quince pie, cabbage is said to work equally well, and in another turnips could be replaced by pears.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Head Music, Nude Records {{effectively}} ceased to exist. Like many of their labelmates, Suede ended up signing to Nude's parent company/distributor Sony to record the band's fifth album, A New Morning. Between the release of Head Music and A New Morning, Suede wrote and recorded [...] "Simon" [...] as the title theme for the film Far From China. The long and troubled gestation of the new album saw the keyboard player, <b>Codling,</b> leave the band, citing chronic fatigue syndrome, to be replaced by Alex Lee, formerly of Strangelove. In concert, Lee played keyboards, second guitar, backing vocals and occasionally harmonica. The album title, according to Anderson, referred to [...] "a fresh start, a new band and a new fresh outlook" [...] – the singer had been addicted to heroin and crack cocaine, which was having an increasingly deleterious effect on his health. Anderson claimed that A New Morning [...] "...was the first ever Suede record that wasn't influenced in its making by drugs".|$|E

2500|$|The {{next three}} singles {{released}} from the album failed to enter the top 10, breaking a run stretching back to the 1996 single [...] "Trash". Anderson also attracted more criticism from fans for his frequent use of redundant vocabulary and limited lyrical themes. The track which received the most attention and criticism was [...] "Savoir Faire". Some critics felt that the album's lyricism could be linked to Anderson's heavy drug use at the time, especially when he later admitted that he [...] "was a crack addict for ages". Speaking of his addiction, which plagued him {{for two and a}} half years, Anderson said, [...] "Anyone who has ever tried crack will know exactly why I took it. It's the scariest drug in the world because the hit you get from it is so, so seductive. I wanted to experience that, and I did – repeatedly." [...] Suede headlined the Roskilde and V Festivals in July and August 1999 respectively. During 2000, there was press speculation that Suede were on the verge of disbanding, which was not helped by Codling's absence from some European gigs. Anderson denied these claims and insisted that <b>Codling</b> was healthy and that they were keen to record the next album. For the whole of 2000, Suede retreated from the public and played only one gig, in Reykjavik, Iceland. The band premiered several new songs that eventually appeared on the final album.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1996, {{the band}} was joined by new member Neil <b>Codling,</b> a cousin of Gilbert who played {{keyboards}} and second guitar. His first appearance was at a fanclub gig at the Hanover Grand, {{which turned out to}} be one of Suede's most important gigs. A short set devoid of Butler songs was well received by critics, [...] "...A set that says. 'No Need'," [...] observed Steve Sutherland in NME. Suede's third album, Coming Up, was released in 1996. Anderson said that in contrast to the band's previous albums, which he felt [...] "suffered at certain times from being quite obscure", he intended Coming Up to be [...] "almost like a 'greatest hits'". The lead single, [...] "Trash", was popular and tied with [...] "Stay Together" [...] as the band's highest-charting UK single, reaching number three, which helped to make the album the band's biggest mainstream success. The album brought the band five straight top-10 singles and was a hit throughout Europe, Asia and Canada. Coming Up never did win an audience in America, partially because it appeared nearly a year after its initial release and partially because Suede only supported it with a three-city tour. Nevertheless, the album topped the UK chart and became the band's biggest-selling release, setting expectations high for the follow-up. In May 1997, Suede fell upon more bad fortune in the US when their truck full of equipment was stolen after playing a gig in Boston, Massachusetts. With the success of the album, Suede secured top billing at the 1997 Reading Festival. Suede's next release was Sci-Fi Lullabies, a collection of B-sides, which reached number nine on the UK Album Chart. The compilation was well received, with disc one of two being described by Scott Plagenhoef in Stylus Magazine as the band's strongest collection of songs.|$|E

It is also the safest part to take a serpent by. And as for Cod, that was derived directly from that [...] "great store of codfish" [...] which Captain Bartholomew Gosnold caught there in 1602; which fish appears to have been so called from the Saxon word codde, [...] "a case in which seeds are lodged," [...] either from the form of the fish, or the quantity of spawn it contains; whence also, perhaps, <b>codling</b> (pomum coctile?) and coddle,--to cook green like peas.

6000|$|Midas, {{we are in}} story told,[2] Turn'd {{every thing}} he touch'd to gold: He chipp'd his bread; the pieces round Glitter'd like {{spangles}} on the ground: A <b>codling,</b> ere it went his lip in, Would straight become a golden pippin. He call'd for drink; you saw him sup Potable gold in golden cup: His empty paunch that he might fill, He suck'd his victuals thro' a quill. Untouch'd it pass'd between his grinders, Or't had been happy for gold-finders: He cock'd his hat, you would have said Mambrino's[3] helm adorn'd his head; Whene'er he chanced his hands to lay On magazines of corn or hay, Gold ready coin'd appear'd instead Of paltry provender and bread; Hence, we are by wise farmers told[4] Old hay is equal to old gold:[5] And hence a critic deep maintains We learn'd to weigh our gold by grains. [...] This fool had got a lucky hit; And people fancied he had wit, Two gods their skill in music tried And both chose Midas to decide: He against Ph[oelig]bus' harp decreed, And gave it for Pan's oaten reed: The god of wit, to show his grudge, Clapt asses' ears upon the judge, A goodly pair, erect and wide, Which he could neither gild nor hide. [...] And now the virtue of his hands Was lost among Pactolus' sands, Against whose torrent while he swims The golden scurf peels off his limbs: Fame spreads the news, and people travel From far, to gather golden gravel; Midas, exposed to all their jeers, Had lost his art, and kept his ears. [...] This tale inclines the gentle reader To think upon a certain leader; To whom, from Midas down, descends That virtue in the fingers' ends. What else by perquisites are meant, By pensions, bribes, and three per cent.? By places and commissions sold, And turning dung itself to gold? By starving {{in the midst of}} store, As t'other Midas did before? [...] None e'er did modern Midas chuse Subject or patron of his muse, But found him thus their merit scan, That Phoebus must give place to Pan: He values not the poet's praise, Nor will exchange his plums [6] for bays. To Pan alone rich misers call; And there's the jest, for Pan is ALL. Here English wits will be to seek, Howe'er, 'tis all one in the Greek. [...] Besides, it plainly now appears Our Midas, too, has ass's ears: Where every fool his mouth applies, And whispers in a thousand lies; Such gross delusions could not pass Thro' any ears but of an ass. [...] But gold defiles with frequent touch, There's nothing fouls the hand so much; And scholars give it for the cause Of British Midas' dirty paws; Which, while the senate strove to scour, They wash'd away the chemic power.[7] While he his utmost strength applied, To swim against this popular tide, The golden spoils flew off apace, Here fell a pension, there a place: The torrent merciless imbibes Commissions, perquisites, and bribes, By their own weight sunk to the bottom; Much good may't do 'em that have caught 'em! And Midas now neglected stands, With ass's ears, and dirty hands.|$|E

New-River Walk, with friendly shade, Shall keep my host in ambuscade; While you, from where the basin stands, Shall scale the rampart with your bands.

Sly hunters thus, in Borneo's isle, To catch a monkey by a wile, The mimic animal amuse; They place before him gloves and shoes; Which, when the brute puts awkward on: All his agility is gone; In vain to frisk or climb he tries; The huntsmen seize the grinning prize. [...] But let us on our first assault Secure the larder and the vault; The valiant Dennis,[9] you must fix on, And I'll engage with Peggy Dixon:[10] Then, if we once can seize the key And chest that keeps my lady's tea, They must surrender at discretion! And, soon as we have gain'd possession, We'll act as other conquerors do, Divide the realm between us two; Then, (let me see,) we'll make the knight Our clerk, for he can read and write. But must not think, I tell him that, Like Lorimer [11] to wear his hat; Yet, when we dine without a friend, We'll place him at the lower end. Madam, whose skill does all in dress lie, May serve to wait on Mrs. Leslie; But, lest it might not be so proper That her own maid should over-top her, To mortify the creature more, We'll take her heels five inches lower.
