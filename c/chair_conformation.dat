25|$|In hexaferrocenylbenzene, C66, all six {{positions}} on a benzene molecule have ferrocenyl substituents (R). X-ray diffraction {{analysis of this}} compound confirms that the cyclopentadienyl ligands are not co-planar with the benzene core but have alternating dihedral angles of +30° and −80°. Due to steric crowding the ferrocenyls are slightly bent with angles of 177° and have elongated C-Fe bonds. The quaternary cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms are also pyramidalized. Also, the benzene core has a <b>chair</b> <b>conformation</b> with dihedral angles of 14° and displays bond length alternation between 142.7pm and 141.1pm, both indications of steric crowding of the substituents.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{rotation}} {{of a given}} enantiomer of ketamine can vary between its salts and free base form. The free base form of (S)‑ketamine exhibits dextrorotation and is therefore labelled (S)‑(+)‑ketamine. However, its hydrochloride salt shows levorotation and is thus labelled (S)‑(−)‑ketamine hydrochloride. The difference originates from the conformation of the cyclohexanone ring. In both the free base and the hydrochloride, the cyclohexanone ring adopts a <b>chair</b> <b>conformation,</b> but {{the orientation of the}} substituents varies. In the free base, the o-chlorophenyl group adopts an equatorial position and the methylamino group adopts an axial position. In the hydrochloride salt, the positions are reversed, with the o-chlorophenyl group axial and the methylamino group equatorial. Not all salts of ketamine show different {{optical rotation}} to the free base: (S)-ketamine (R,R)-tartrate is levorotatory, like (S)‑ketamine.|$|E

25|$|The 6-vertex {{edge ring}} does {{not conform to}} the shape of a perfect hexagon. The {{conformation}} of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable angle strain because its bonds are not 109.5 degrees; the torsional strain would also be considerable because all of the bonds would be eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce torsional strain, cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the <b>chair</b> <b>conformation.</b> There are also two other intermediate conformers; half chair, which is the most unstable conformer, and twist boat, which is more stable than the boat conformer. This was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation. If cyclohexane is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the slightly more stable conformation.|$|E
2500|$|The aza-Cope/Mannich reaction, when {{participating}} in ring-expanding annulations, follows the stereochemistry {{dictated by the}} most favorable <b>chair</b> <b>conformation,</b> which generally places bulky substituents quasi-equatorially. [...] The vinyl and amine components can have either syn or anti relationships when installed on a ring[...] [...] While anti vinyl and amine substituents generally only have one favored transition state, leading to a cis fused ring system, the favored product of syn substituents can change, dictated by steric interactions with solvents or large N-substituents, which may take preference over bulky substituents and change the transition state.|$|E
2500|$|Overman has {{reported}} {{the use of}} oxizolidines to generate the iminium ion requisite for the reaction. [...] Upon formation, Overman showed that cyclohexanones {{can be used for}} the carbonyl component in pyrrolidine synthesis. [...] This reaction proceeded with various forms of cyclohexanones. [...] When an acyclic ketone was substituted, the reaction proceeded with low yield, highlighting the thermodynamic favorability of releasing cyclohexanone from the double bonded carbonyl, as it creates unfavorable bond strain in the <b>chair</b> <b>conformation.</b> [...] This represents one of the most convenient constructions of the 1-azaspirodecane ring system, a useful natural product.|$|E
50|$|The half-chair state (2, below) is the {{transition}} {{state in the}} interconversion between the <b>chair</b> and twist-boat <b>conformations.</b> Due to the D2 symmetry of the twist-boat, there are two energy-equivalent pathways that it can take to two different half-chair conformations, leading to the two different <b>chair</b> <b>conformations</b> of cyclochexane. Thus, at a minimum, the interconversion between the two <b>chair</b> <b>conformations</b> involves the following sequence: chair - half-chair - twist-boat - half-chair' - chair'. The energies {{of the boat and}} half-chair states are 6.6 kcal mol&minus;1 (28 kJ mol&minus;1) and 10.8 kcal mol&minus;1 (45 kJ mol&minus;1) higher than that of the <b>chair.</b> The <b>conformations</b> involve following order of stability: chair form > twist boat form > boat form > half-chair form.|$|R

[...] If a boat transition state was operative, the opposite results would have been obtained (detailed in image below). [...] As is the trend with many reactions, conversion of the Z-enolate affords lower selectivity due to 1,3 diaxial steric interactions between the enolate and the ring, {{as well as the}} fact that substituents prefer quasi-equatorial positioning.
