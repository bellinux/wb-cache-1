We introduce a test based on a "substitution effect," focusing on how {{the end of a}} sale affects sales not of the good itself, but a substitute good. Such an effect cannot be easily confounded with consumer stockpiling. Using a unique dataset from an online hardware retailer, we find evidence consistent with <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> aversion. Moreover, we find that less experienced consumers suffer a more prominent loss aversion bias compared to more experienced consumers...|$|E

[17] developed a multinomial logit formulation of a reference-dependent choice model. They assumed that consumer choice {{is influenced by the}} position of brands relative to multiattribute reference points and loss aversion is exhibited. Weng [18] considered the sequential search problem where sellers search for the best price from a known distribution and exhibit asymmetric regretting and rejoicing. Zhou [19] considered a consumer search model and examined the implications of consumer reference dependence for market competition. He also finds that <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> aversion in the price dimension intensifies competition while that in the product dimension softens competition. Kuksov and Wang [20] also examined how the competitive strategy and profitability of firms are affected by the presence of <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> aversion in the price dimension. The above literature has neither studied any consumer’s search strategy in conjunction with nonlinear prospect utility nor discussed the probabilistic stockout of products.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that loss aversion leads {{individuals}} to dislike risk and, {{as has been}} argued by many researchers, in many instances this creates an incentive for firms to shield consumers and employees against economic risks. Comple-menting previous research, we show that <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> aversion can also have the opposite effect: it can lead a firm to optimally introduce risk into an otherwise deterministic environment. We consider a profit-maximizing monopolist selling to a loss-averse consumer, where (following Kőszegi and Rabin 2006) {{we assume that the}} consumer’s reference point is her recent rational expectations about the purchase. We establish that for any degree of <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> aversion, the monop-olist’s optimal price distribution consists of low and variable “sale ” prices and a high and atomic “regular ” price. Realizing that she will buy at the sales prices and hence that she will purchase with positive probability, the consumer chooses to avoid the painful uncertainty in whether she will get the product by buying also at the regular price. This pricing pattern is consistent with several recently docu-mented facts regarding retailer pricing. We show that market power is crucial for this result: when firms compete ex ante for consumers, they choose deterministic prices...|$|E

40|$|Whether {{antitrust}} {{policy should}} pursue {{a goal of}} 2 ̆ 2 general welfare 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 consumer welfare 2 ̆ 2 has been debated for decades. The academic debate is much more varied than the case law, however, which has consistently adopted consumer welfare as a goal, almost never condemning a practice found to produce an actual output reduction or price increase simply because productive efficiency gains accruing to producers exceeded <b>consumer</b> <b>losses.</b> While some practices such as mergers might produce greater gains in productive efficiency than <b>losses</b> in <b>consumer</b> welfare, identifying such situations would be extraordinarily difficult. First, these efficiencies {{would have to be}} 2 ̆ 2 transaction specific, 2 ̆ 2 meaning that they could not be attained by other means. Given the widespread availability of alternatives such as nonexclusive licensing, transaction specific efficiencies are {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Second, these would necessarily be gains that accrue at lower output levels than previous to the practice; otherwise there would be no consumer harm to balance. But most efficiency gains accrue at higher rather than lower output levels. Third, collusion facilitating practices spread welfare losses across an entire industry, while production gains typically accrue only to the participants in a merger or similar practice. Fourth, the reigning tradeoff models generally assume a market that was competitive prior to the practice and became monopolized after. Most practices that facilitate the exercise of market power occur in markets that were noncompetitive to begin with. In these situations <b>consumer</b> <b>losses</b> are relatively larger and producer gains smaller. Finally, the administrative problems of computing actual efficiency gains and netting them against actual <b>consumer</b> <b>losses</b> would be heroic. It would require estimates about <b>loss</b> of <b>consumers</b> 2 ̆ 7 or producers 2 ̆ 7 surplus in an area of the demand curve where there is currently no production. Computing deadweight loss is far more difficult than computing a simple overcharge on already made sales. As a result, antitrust analysis without significant exception proceeds by condemning practices that result in lower output and higher prices. Efficiencies change outcomes only when they are sufficient to keep output at or above pre-practice levels, which means that there is no consumer harm at all and nothing to trade off. In contrast to the voluminous literature on welfare tests for antitrust policy, relatively little has been written about consumer welfare and intellectual property law. A well functioning IP system would increase consumer welfare in both the short and long run. That is, no tradeoff need be made between lost consumer surplus and productive efficiency. In the imperfect system that we have, however, <b>consumer</b> <b>losses</b> do occur, mainly when exclusive IP rights are given in excess of what optimal innovation policy requires, or when the rights are given to things that would have been developed (or have already been developed) anyway by ordinary market processes. Unfortunately, producer capture in the IP law making process has largely excluded consumer interests...|$|R

40|$|The recent <b>loss</b> of key <b>consumers</b> to {{exploitation}} and habitat degradation has significantly altered community dynamics and ecosystem function across many ecosystems worldwide. Predicting {{the impacts of}} <b>consumer</b> <b>losses</b> requires knowing the level of functional diversity that exists within a consumer assemblage. In this study, we document functional diversity among nine species of parrotfishes on Caribbean coral reefs. Parrotfishes are key herbivores that facilitate the maintenance and recovery of coral-dominated reefs by controlling algae and provisioning space for the recruitment of corals. We observed large functional differences among two genera of parrotfishes that were driven by differences in diet. Fishes in the genus Scarus targeted filamentous algal turf assemblages, crustose coralline algae, and endolithic algae and avoided macroalgae, while fishes in the genus Sparisoma preferentially targeted macroalgae. However, species with similar diets were dissimilar in other attributes, including the habitats they frequented, the types of substrate they fed from, and the spatial scale at which they foraged. These differences indicate that species {{that appear to be}} functionally redundant when looking at diet alone exhibit high levels of complementarity when we consider multiple functional traits. By identifying key functional differences among parrotfishes, we provide critical information needed to manage parrotfishes to enhance the resilience of coral-dominated reefs and reverse phase shifts on algal-dominated reefs throughout the wider Caribbean. Further, our study provides a framework for predicting the impacts of <b>consumer</b> <b>losses</b> in other species rich ecosystems...|$|R

The main message of the Heidhues-Koszegi model, namely that this form of <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> aversion leads to rigid price responses to cost ‡uctuations, carries over. I demonstrate the usefulness of this “cover version”of the Heidhues-Koszegi-Rabin model by obtaining new results: (1) loss aversion lowers expected prices; (2) the …rm’s incentive to adopt a rigid pricing strategy is stronger when ‡uctuations are in demand rather than in costs. ...|$|E

While relaxing the assumption of normality, it is important to estimate the density of the inspected characteristic at the specification limit correctly. It is investigated whether larger parametric models provide a useful improvement. Simulations are carried out for several such models. It turns out that for estimating a density at a fixed point, the parametric estimators give improvements compared to application of the normal density. However, for small or moderate sample sizes Rosenblatt’s estimator is, in general, more accurate than the parametric density estimators...|$|E

Microsoft's messenger tying hurts consumers because it enables Microsoft to monopolize messenger market and so fully exploit consumer's willingness to pay to the OS-messenger bundle. However, since tying saves installing costs, <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> is not so serious that total surplus improves under messenger tying.

We use a micro-founded New Keynesian model which incorporates persistence in inflation, non-Ricardian consumers {{as well as a}} frictional labor market. We find in line with recent literature that in presence of a frictional labor market, tax smoothing may not necessarily be the optimal choice but that taxes should rather tackle inefficiencies on the labor market. Still, a countercyclical stance for a tax rule seems preferable. Under a progressive tax system, the role of smoothing is weaker than under proportional taxation. The focus on the level of debt is relatively small in both rules. Our welfare matrix, calculated as an average <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> function for the aggregated shocks, suggests that progressive taxation under the optimal tax rule is welfare-better...|$|E

40|$|When {{screening}} {{a production}} process for nonconforming items {{the objective is}} to improve the average outgoing quality level. Due to measurement errors specification limits cannot be checked directly and hence test limits are required, which meet some given requirement, here given by a prescribed bound on the <b>consumer</b> <b>loss.</b> Classical test limits are based on normality, both for the product characteristic and for the measurement error. In practice, often nonnormality occurs for the product characteristic {{as well as for the}} measurement error. Recently, nonnormality of the product characteristic has been investigated. In this paper attention is focussed on the measurement error. Firstly, it is shown that nonnormality can lead to serious failure of the test limit.

40|$|Low-quality {{products}} {{may cause}} consumer harm. A firm {{can reduce the}} probability of low quality through ex ante investment before sales, and can take remedy actions such as product recalls if it learns after sales that product quality is low. An increase in the firm's product liability increases its incentive for ex post remedy; more ex post remedy, however, may reduce the firm's ex ante quality investment. On the other hand, higher product liability increases consumer demand for the product, resulting in high output and hence greater return to ex ante investment. The trade-off between these two effects, the "substitution effect" and the "output effect", can lead to an inverted U-shaped relationship between ex ante investment and product liability. We find that the firm always prefers full liability whereas consumers {{might be better off}} with less than full liability. Full product liability tends to be socially optimal when the potential <b>consumer</b> <b>loss</b> from low quality is sufficiently high; otherwise partial liability can be socially optimal. ...|$|E

The second essay examines how consumers regulate embarrassment-avoidant behavior by taking the perspective of an observer. The third essay examines how consumers regulate stress in social contexts.
