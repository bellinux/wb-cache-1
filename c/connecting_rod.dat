5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and VideoDisc in pan and scan only, and on laserdisc in both pan and scan and widescreen. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in THX and made available in widescreen. The outer package was retitled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for consistency with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent DVD release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection in the glass partition separating Ford from the cobra in the Well of Souls was removed. Shortly before the theatrical release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Raiders (along with The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade) was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008. The film {{was released on}} Blu-ray Disc in September 2012. Previously, only Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had been available on Blu-ray.|$|E

25|$|The {{grasshopper}} or 'half-lever' {{engine was}} {{a variant of}} the side-lever engine. The grasshopper engine differs from the conventional side-lever in that the location of the lever pivot and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> are more or less reversed, with the pivot located {{at one end of the}} lever instead of the centre, while the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is attached to the lever between the cylinder at one end and the pivot at the other.|$|E
25|$|The Air Ministry {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the accident under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations, 1922. The investigation opened on 25 June at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, with Sir Arthur Colefax in charge. The cause of the engine failure was the fracture of No. 4 <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> in the starboard engine. The engine had run for 126 hours since its last overhaul, with the permitted time between overhauls being 300 hours. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> had failed due to the failure of the big end bearing studs.|$|E

25|$|The Hierapolis sawmill was a Roman water-powered stone {{saw mill}} at Hierapolis, Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). Dating {{to the second}} half of the 3rd century AD, the sawmill is the {{earliest}} known machine to combine a crank with a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E

25|$|Further crank and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> mechanisms, without gear train, are archaeologically attested for the 6th century AD water-powered stone sawmills at Gerasa, Jordan, and Ephesus, Turkey.

50|$|There {{have been}} {{flat-twin}} engines with one crank pin shared by both <b>connecting</b> <b>rods,</b> thereby {{have only one}} crank throw.

25|$|Built in Fishponds, Bristol by Brazil-Straker {{under the}} {{direction}} of Roy Fedden, the Mercury featured an unusual crankshaft and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> arrangement that dispensed with the more normal design of a single master rod linking to individual rods for each cylinder. It was said to run well without vibration and set an unofficial time to climb record while fitted to the Bristol Scout F, the aircraft achieving 10,000ft (3,000 m) in 5.4 minutes and 20,000ft (6,000 m) in 16.25 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Evidence for {{the crank}} {{combined}} with a <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> appears in the Hierapolis sawmill in Asia Minor from the 3rd century and two stone sawmills at Gerasa, Roman Syria, and Ephesus, Asia Minor (both 6th century). On the pediment of the Hierapolis mill, a waterwheel fed by a mill race is shown powering via a gear train two frame saws which cut rectangular blocks by the way {{of some kind of}} connecting rods and, through mechanical necessity, cranks. The accompanying inscription is in Greek.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations {{took place on}} the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a crank and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.|$|E
25|$|The Nordberg Manufacturing Company of the United States {{developed}} {{and produced a}} series of large two-stroke radial diesel engines from the late 1940s for electrical production, primarily at aluminium smelters and for pumping water. They differed from most radials in that they had an even number of cylinders in a single bank (or row) and an unusual double master <b>connecting</b> <b>rod.</b> Variants were built that could be run on either diesel oil or gasoline or mixtures of both. A number of powerhouse installations utilising large numbers of these engines {{were made in the}} U.S.|$|E
50|$|Diesel engines {{usually have}} longer stroke lengths chiefly to {{facilitate}} achieving the necessary compression ratios. As a result, piston and <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> are heavier and more force must be transmitted through the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> and crankshaft {{to change the}} momentum of the piston. This is another reason that a diesel engine must be stronger for the same power output as a petrol engine.|$|R
