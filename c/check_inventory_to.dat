40|$|The Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) treats spent {{nuclear fuel}} using an electrometallurgical process that {{separates}} the uranium from the fission products, sodium thermal bond and cladding materials. Material accountancy is necessary at FCF for two reasons: first, it provides a mechanism for detecting a potential loss of nuclear material for safeguards and security; second, it provides a periodic <b>check</b> of <b>inventories</b> <b>to</b> ensure that processes and material are under control. By weighing material entering and leaving a process, and using sampling results to determine composition, an inventory difference (ID) results when the measured <b>inventory</b> is compared <b>to</b> the predicted <b>inventory.</b> The ID and its uncertainty, based on error propagation, determines the degree of assurance that an operation proceeded according to expectations. FCF uses the ID calculation in two ways: closeout, which is the ID and uncertainty for a particular operational step, and material accountancy, which determines an ID and its associated uncertainty for a material balance area through several operational steps. Material accountancy over the whole facility for a specified time period assists in detecting diversion of nuclear material. Data from depleted uranium operations are presented to illustrate the method used in FCF...|$|R

40|$|Inventory record {{inaccuracies}} are {{an issue}} in both retail and warehousing {{and can lead to}} considerable costs due to stock-outs and excess <b>inventory.</b> In order <b>to</b> ensure that <b>inventory</b> record inaccuracies are minimised, warehousing organisations conduct <b>inventory</b> <b>checks</b> on items in the warehouse to identify and then rectify misalignments between the data records and the actual physical items. The challenge is that <b>inventory</b> <b>checks</b> are extremely time-consuming activities, especially when all items need to be checked. In order to reduce this effort, cycle counting methods can be employed which check only a sample of the items. In this paper we propose a new cycle counting method which aims to identify inaccurate items using historical <b>inventory</b> <b>checking</b> data. The method aims to discover correlations between various properties of the items (e. g. storage location, frequency of movement etc.) and inaccuracies. These correlations can then be used to identify which items {{are most likely to be}} inaccurate so <b>inventory</b> <b>checking</b> can focus on those items. The approach is evaluated based on actual data from warehousing companies...|$|R
