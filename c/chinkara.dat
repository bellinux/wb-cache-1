5|$|Ahmedabad's Kamla Nehru Zoological Park {{houses a}} number of {{endangered}} species including flamingoes, caracals, Asiatic wolves and <b>chinkara.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{blackbuck}} numbers declined sharply due {{to excessive}} hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. Some blackbucks are killed illegally especially {{where they are}} sympatric with nilgai. Until India's independence in 1947, blackbuck and <b>chinkara</b> were hunted in many princely states with specially trained captive Asiatic cheetahs. By the 1970s, blackbuck were extinct in several areas. Nevertheless, populations in India have increased from 24,000 in the late 1970s to 50,000 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The <b>chinkara,</b> a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chinkaras</b> mate once a year. Males {{compete for}} access to females.|$|R
50|$|Fauna include tigers, leopards, wolves, sloth bears, chitals, <b>chinkaras,</b> {{and many}} species of birds.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, {{the area}} around the village is {{notified}} as a wildlife sanctuary, Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary. The red antelopes or <b>chinkaras</b> are found in the sanctuary.|$|R
25|$|The main herbivores of Gir are chital, nilgai, sambar, four-horned antelope, <b>chinkara</b> {{and wild}} boar. Blackbucks from the {{surrounding}} area are sometimes seen in the sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|The {{large areas}} of {{remaining}} forest on the plateau are still home {{to a variety of}} grazing animals from the four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), <b>chinkara</b> (Gazella bennettii), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) to the large gaur and wild water buffalo (Bubalus arena).|$|E
25|$|Deer House {{contains}} more mammals {{than any other}} house in the zoo, including axis deer (chital), blue bull (nilgai), fallow deer, Indian gazelle (<b>chinkara),</b> red deer, sika deer, the near-threatened species of blackbuck and mouflon as well as threatened species of hog deer, sambar and urial. It also houses red-necked wallabies.|$|E
50|$|Tera {{and its environs}} are {{furthermore}} {{noted for}} a variety of wildlife, including <b>chinkaras,</b> blue bulls, wild boars, hyenas, great Indian bustards, peacocks, black partridges, desert foxes, Indian wolves and caracals.|$|R
50|$|The Kaimur Range and Rohtas Plateau {{cover the}} {{southern}} part of this district. The Karmnasha and Durgawati rivers run through the district. A large forest covers part of Kaimur; it measures 1,06,300 hectares and contains the Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary which is home to tigers, leopards and <b>chinkaras.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kaila Devi Sanctuary: The Kaila Devi Wildlife Sanctuary {{begins right}} after the temple and runs along {{both sides of the}} road all the way to Karanpur, and further on to join the Ranthambhore National Park. <b>Chinkaras,</b> nilgai, jackals and leopards are to be found here, as are birds such as {{sandpipers}} and kingfishers.|$|R
25|$|There {{are around}} 500 {{varieties}} of mammals, 2000 species of birds, 30,000 types of insects {{and a wide}} variety of fish, amphibians and reptiles in the region. Animal species in North India include elephant, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, sambar (Asiatic stag), chital (spotted deer), hangul (red deer), hog deer, <b>chinkara</b> (Indian gazelle), blackbuck, nilgai (blue bull antelope), porcupine, wild boar, Indian fox, Tibetan sand fox, rhesus monkey, langur, jungle cat, hyena, jackal, black bear, Himalayan brown bear, sloth bear, and the endangered caracal.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife include Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, bison, leopard, gaur, tiger, and crocodiles, {{as well as}} many bird species. Migratory birds come to {{the state}} during the winter. The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, <b>chinkara,</b> takin, serow, pangolin, minivet and Kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project conserving the {{endangered}} Bengal tiger, although the forest hosts many other endangered species, such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin and estuarine crocodile. The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal. Recognizing its special conservation value, Sundarban area has been declared as a Biosphere Reserve.|$|E
25|$|The {{flagship}} {{species of the}} sanctuary is the near threatened blackbuck antelope, {{one of the four}} antelope species in India (<b>Chinkara,</b> Chausingha and Nilgai being the other three) and the most numerous large animal in the sanctuary. The population estimate of the blackbuck at Point Calimere more than doubled in thirty years, from 750â€“800 in 1967 to 1,908 in 1998/99. This isolated population of blackbuck probably survived unmolested throughout the centuries due to the locals' now declining belief that eating its meat causes leprosy. The predators of the blackbuck at Point Calimere are jackals, and sometimes village dogs. Competition for food is from domestic and feral cattle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chinkaras</b> are shy {{and avoid}} human habitation. They can go without water {{for long periods}} and can get {{sufficient}} fluids from plants and dew. Although most are seen alone, they can sometimes be spotted in groups of up to four animals.They share their habitat with several other herbivores, such as nilgai, blackbuck, chausingha, wild goats, and wild pigs.|$|R
50|$|In August 1995, the Gujarat state {{legislative}} assembly {{taking advantage of}} the court's reluctance to support the sanctuary approved a reduction {{in the size of the}} sanctuary area from 765.79 km2 to 444.23 km2 thus stripping protection from more than 40 per cent of the original protected area of the sanctuary and maintained that there were around 1200 <b>chinkaras</b> and that the smaller area was more than adequate for them.|$|R
50|$|This area {{is known}} to be a {{breeding}} ground for flamingoes and staging ground for pelicans, cranes, storks and many species of waterfowl. It is also an important site for animals like blue bulls, <b>chinkaras</b> and desert wolves, which have been sighted over here regularly. The site supports many species of birds and mammals which are locally and globally threatened. The site is also a wintering area for water birds. It is estimated that this wetland regularly supports over 40,000 water birds.|$|R
25|$|Some {{wildlife}} species, {{which are}} fast vanishing {{in other parts}} of India, are found in the desert in large numbers such as the blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), <b>chinkara</b> (Gazella bennettii) and Indian wild ass (Equus hemionus khur) in the Rann of Kutch. They have evolved excellent survival strategies, their size is smaller than other similar animals living in different conditions, and they are mainly nocturnal. There are certain other factors responsible for the survival of these animals in the desert. Due to the lack of water in this region, transformation of the grasslands into cropland has been very slow. The protection provided to them by a local community, the Bishnois, is also a factor. Other mammals of the Thar Desert include a subspecies of red fox (Vulpes vulpes pusilla) and the caracal.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps 1,500 LCAs {{survived the}} war in {{serviceable}} condition. But many of these LCAs were discarded, as when the LSI HMS Persimmon, returning to Britain from the Far East in 1946, dumped her lower deck LCAs overboard to lighten ship and make better speed. Many LCAs used in the Far East were not {{sent back to the}} United Kingdom. Damaged LCAs, along with other damaged landing craft, were sunk rather than repaired. In Cochin, India, at the shore establishment HMS <b>Chinkara</b> (home of the Landing Craft Storage, Section 21), many LCA were towed out to the 10 fathom mark and sunk by various means from axe to Bofors gun fire. In home waters, {{the end of the war}} meant the merchant ships and passenger liners that had served as LSIs were returned to their owners and refitted to civilian trim. This left an LCA surfeit that was sold off for civilian uses. They were popular acquisitions among riparian holiday-makers and canal enthusiasts in Britain. Their holds covered and ramps sealed, LCAs became charming little houseboats.|$|E
500|$|Fights {{take place}} in both sexes and involve pushing their necks against each other or ramming into one another using horns. Fights can be gory; despite the {{protective}} skin deep, lacerated wounds and even deaths might occur. Display behaviour focuses on the throat patch and the beard, and threatening opponents by pointing the horns toward them. A young male was observed making a submissive display in the Sariska Reserve by kneeling before an adult male, who stood erect. The nilgai mark their territories by forming dung piles as much as [...] in radius. The defecation process is elaborate-the antelope stands with his legs about a metre apart, with the rump lowered and the tail held almost vertical; it stays in the same posture for at least ten seconds after relieving itself. The process is not as elaborate in the females {{as it is in}} the males.In India, the nilgai shares its habitat with the four-horned antelope, <b>chinkara,</b> chital and blackbuck; its association with the gaur and the water buffalo is less common. In the Ranthambore National Park (Rajasthan, India) the nilgai and the <b>chinkara</b> collectively prefer the area rich in Acacia and Butea species, while the sambar deer and the chital preferred the forests of Anogeissus and Grewia species. In India, the Indian tiger and the lion may prey on the nilgai but they are not significant predators of this antelope. Leopards prey on the nilgai, though they prefer smaller prey. Dholes generally attack juveniles. Other predators include wolves and striped hyenas.|$|E
50|$|It takes name {{after the}} {{impressive}} historic fort of Kumbhalgarh, which {{comes into view}} over the Park. It is 578 km2 in area, and {{at an altitude of}} 500 to 1300 m. Kumbhalgarh's natural environment attracts tourists, and is accessible from Udaipur, which is 100 km from here. Foot tracking and horse safari organised by local tour operators are also available. A typical safari route enters the sanctuary from the Kumbhalgarh Fort and cuts across the sanctuary it reaches Ghanerao, and then borders an old abandoned road. On this road, one can see <b>chinkaras,</b> neelgais, four horned antelope and birds.|$|R
50|$|The Indian {{wild ass}} {{population}} has been increasing in numbers and extending its range from Little Rann of Kutch, where the world's last population of this subspecies had got confined to in recent years, and has gradually started moving out and colonizing the Greater Rann of Kutch, also extending into the neighboring Indian State of Rajasthan in the bordering villages in Jalore district bordering the Rann of Kutch of Gujarat and Khejariali and its neighbourhood where a 60 km2 area {{was transferred to the}} Rajasthan Forest Department by the revenue authorities in 2007.

500|$|The {{state has}} an {{abundance}} of natural resources. In 2011 the recorded forest area in the state was [...] which is about 6.88% of the state's geographical area. In spite of rapid deforestation and poaching of wildlife, a diverse flora and fauna continue {{to exist in the}} state. Several species of trees, large and small mammals, reptiles, and insects are found in the belt of temperate upper mountainous forests. Medicinal plants are found in the wild and are also grown in plantations. The Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands support cattle. Moist deciduous trees grow in the upper Gangetic plain, especially along its riverbanks. This plain supports a wide variety of plants and animals. The Ganges and its tributaries are the habitat of large and small reptiles, amphibians, fresh-water fish, and crabs. Scrubland trees such as the babool and animals such as the <b>chinkara</b> are found in the arid Vindhyas.|$|E
500|$|... 3.26% of the {{geographical}} area of West Bengal is protected land, comprising fifteen wildlife sanctuaries and five national parksSundarbans National Park, Buxa Tiger Reserve, Gorumara National Park, Neora Valley National Park, and Singalila National Park. Extant wildlife include Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, leopard, gaur, tiger, and crocodiles, {{as well as}} many bird species. Migratory birds come to the state during the winter. The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, <b>chinkara,</b> takin, serow, pangolin, minivet, and kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project devoted to conserving the endangered Bengal tiger although the forest hosts many other endangered species such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin, and estuarine crocodile.

500|$|The cheetah is a {{carnivore}} that prefers medium-sized prey with a {{body mass}} ranging from [...] Blesbok, duiker, Grant's gazelle, impala, reedbuck, springbok, and Thomson's gazelle {{are some of the}} common targets of the cheetah. Other prey animals include the bat-eared fox, bushbuck, kudu, hartebeest, nyala, oribi, roan antelope, steenbok, sable antelope, and waterbuck; they prey less frequently on African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, ostrich, warthog, wildebeest, and zebra. A study showed that a major proportion of the diet of Asiatic cheetahs consists of livestock; local species such as <b>chinkara,</b> desert hare, goitered gazelle, ibex, rodents, and wild sheep are also hunted. Generally, only groups of cheetahs will attempt to kill large animals such as hartebeest, although mothers with young cubs will attempt to secure a large prey all by themselves. There are no records of cheetah killing human beings. The diet of a cheetah depends on the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle, somewhat smaller than the cheetah. In contrast, in Kwa-Zulu Natal the preferred prey is the significantly larger nyala, males of which can weigh up to [...] They do, however, opt for young and adolescent targets, which make up about 50% of the cheetah diet despite constituting {{only a small portion of}} the prey population.|$|E
5000|$|While Phet moved ashore Pakistan, its {{convection}} spread {{ahead of}} the center into India, bringing heavy rainfall up to 180 mm in western Rajasthan. The rains helped alleviate drought conditions, but the associated floods killed several animals, including 11 <b>chinkaras</b> and 35 blackbucks, and many livestock. Heavy rains also knocked down trees and power lines, while also covering highways and rail lines; 250 people became stranded when four train lines going to Jaisalmer were canceled. Near Pokhran, floodwaters 10 ft deep washed away 35 houses. This led to the Indian Armed Forces to evacuate about 300 villagers and to rescue 60 people from a flooded mosque. Phet killed five people in India, all in Gujarat [...] - [...] three of the fatalities by electrocution, one by a lightning strike, and one by drowning.|$|R

50|$|In India, the cheetah {{occurred}} in Rajputana, Punjab, Sind, {{and south of}} the Ganges from Bengal to {{the northern part of the}} Deccan Plateau. It was also present in the Kaimur District, Darrah and other desert regions of Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat and Central India. Akbar the Great was introduced to cheetahs around the mid-16th century and used them for coursing blackbucks, <b>chinkaras</b> and antelopes. He allegedly possessed 1,000 cheetahs during his reign but this figure is exaggerated since there is neither evidence of housing facilities for so many animals, nor of facilities to provide them with sufficient meat every day.Trapping of adult cheetahs, who had already learned hunting skills from wild mothers, for assisting in royal hunts is said to be another major cause of the species' rapid decline in India as there is only one record of a litter ever born to captive animals. By the beginning of the 20th century, wild Asiatic cheetahs were so rare in India, that between 1918 and 1945, Indian princes imported cheetahs from Africa for coursing. Three of India's last cheetahs were shot by the Maharajah of Surguja in 1948. A female was sighted in 1951 in Koriya district, northwestern Chattisgarh.|$|R

African lions prefer prey weighing [...] They generally avoid fully grown adult elephants, hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses, as well as very small prey like dik-dik, hyrax, hare and vervet monkey. However, Thomson's gazelles may be hunted and warthogs are often taken depending on availability, despite being below the preferred weight range. In most areas, {{a small number of}} species may make up around three-fourths of the lion's diet. In Serengeti National Park, wildebeest, zebras and gazelle are the majority of prey. In Kruger National Park, giraffes are the most common prey, and in Manyara Park, Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62% of the lion's diet, due to the high number density of buffaloes. At the Okavango Delta, with its strong seasonal changes in prey, up to eight species may make up three quarters of a lion's diet. Occasionally adult hippopotamus are taken at Gorongosa National Park and calves are commonly hunted at Virunga National Park. In addition to size, the aquatic nature of hippos makes them normally unavailable as prey. [...] The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting young elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. [...] Lions also attack domestic livestock and in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet. Unusual prey items include porcupines and small reptiles. Lions will kill other predators such as leopards, cheetahs, and hyenas, but they seldom devour them.|$|E
