5|$|Jet streams {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. On Earth, the main jet streams are {{located near the}} altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape. Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, <b>combine</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to {{the direction of the}} remainder of the jet.|$|E
500|$|Most {{human use}} of the {{watershed}} {{is limited to the}} upper basin. Despite the semiarid climate, dams have been built, irrigation water has been supplied from the Klamath and Lost rivers, and plentiful groundwater has been drawn to transform most of the upper Klamath Basin to farmland. At least 11,000years ago, Lower Klamath and Tule Lakes in the rainy season would <b>combine</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> giant freshwater marsh that was nearly [...] large. This, combined with the over [...] of Upper Klamath Lake, formed a temporary habitat for millions of migratory birds. These lakes are all remnants of a large Ice Age lake, Lake Modoc, that covered about [...] Although all of the marshlands have been developed with the exception of Upper Klamath Lake, about 3.7million migrating birds still pass through the watershed each year.|$|E

2500|$|Like the English clause, {{the nominal}} {{group is a}} {{combination}} of three distinct functional components, or metafunctions, which express three largely independent sets of semantic choice: the ideational (what the clause or nominal group is about); the interpersonal (what the clause is doing as a verbal exchange between speaker and listener, or writer and reader); and the textual (how the message is organised—how it relates to the surrounding text and the context in which it is occurring/ it occurs). In a clause, each metafunction is a virtually complete structure, and the three structures <b>combine</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> in interpretation. However, beneath the clause—in phrases and in groups, such as the nominal group—the three structures are incomplete of themselves and need to be interpreted separately, [...] "as partial contributions to a single structural line". In nominal groups, the ideational structure {{is by far the most}} significant in premodifying the head. To interpret premodification, it is necessary to split the ideational metafunction into two dimensions: the experiential and the logical.|$|E
2500|$|The Rapids {{had strong}} fan {{attendance}} in 2002 when they {{led the league}} in average fans per game. For 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League (CCL) games, the Supporters Terrace was officially closed. CONCACAF regulations require [...] "all-seater" [...] stadiums, and the terraces at Dick's Sporting Goods Park are standing-only areas with no stadium seating. CCL group stage fixtures have seen the Pid Army and the Bulldog Supporters Group relocated to either midfield in the East stands (against Isidro Metapán) or directly behind the South goal in sections 117 and 118 (against Santos Laguna and Real España). In 2012, it was revealed that the Rapids had 3,561 season ticket holders after the club's front office mistakenly emailed a spreadsheet that contained a list of every season ticket holder in the season ticket base. The front office admitted to the mistake in a follow-up email to the season ticket holders. On February 9, 2013, the leaders of the club's three supporters groups—Class VI, the Pid Army and the Bulldog Supporters Group—announced that they would <b>combine</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> group going forward: Centennial 38.|$|E

60|$|We {{have said}} that Darwins {{hypothesis}} is the natural complement to Lyells uniformitarian theory in physical geology. It is for the organic world what that is for the inorganic; and the accepters of the latter {{stand in a position}} from which to regard the former in the most favorable light. Wherefore the rumor that the cautious Lyell himself has adopted the Darwinian hypothesis need not surprise us. The two views are made for each other, and, like the two counterpart pictures for the stereoscope, when brought together, <b>combine</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> apparently solid whole.|$|E
60|$|Until one observes {{starlings}} in {{this close}} way, even to their minutest actions--I had indeed little {{else to do}} during my three winter months in this nursing-home--it is only natural to believe that among gregarious species the starling {{is one of those}} least likely to pair for life, seeing that in it the gregarious instinct is intensified and more highly developed than in most others. One would suppose that the flock, which is like an organism--that is to say, the attachment to the flock--would, out of the breeding season, take the place of the close relation or companionship between bird and bird seen in species known to pair for life. Only the pairing passion, one would suppose, could serve to dissolve the company of birds and this only for a brief season of about a couple of months' duration. There is but one brood raised in the season, and the whole business of reproduction is well over before the end of June. Later breeders are those that have lost their first eggs or broods. And no sooner are the young brought off and instructed in the starling's sole vocation (except his fruit-eating) of extracting the grubs it subsists on from the roots of the grass--a business which detains them for a week or two--than the married life is apparently over and the communal life resumed. The whole life of the bird is then changed; the sole tie appears to be that of the flock; home and young are forgotten: the birds range hither and thither about the land, and by and by migrate to distant places, some passing oversea, while others from the northern counties and from Scotland and the islands come down to the south of England, where they winter in millions and myriads. There they form the winter habit of congregating in immense numbers in the evening at their favourite roosting-places, and hundreds and thousands of small flocks, which during the daylight hours exist distributed over an area of hundreds of square miles all make to one point and <b>combine</b> <b>into</b> <b>one</b> flock. At such times they actually appear to rejoice in their own incalculable numbers and gather earlier than they need at the roosting-place, so that the whole vast gathering may spend an hour or so in their beloved aerial exercises.|$|E
