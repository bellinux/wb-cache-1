40|$|In {{recent decades}} layered natural and {{synthetic}} clay minerals {{have been used}} in a multitude of applications including rheology modifiers, functional additives for polymers, coatings, cosmetics and even medical device components. To aid in optimisation of performance and study of biological impacts, it would be most advantageous to have a series of well-defined nano-sized clay particles of the same chemistry with controlled aspect ratio. To date previous studies into milled materials have limited analysis by advanced microscopic techniques, and have also not correlated the impact of processing the materials at laboratory versus pilot/commercial scales. In this study semi-synthetic Na+ fluoromica was exposed to high-energy milling using lab scale and commercial scale milling systems, using several configurations and separated into size fractions using centrifugation. These fractions were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) which were employed to characterise the differences in morphology, particle size and structural changes between the unmilled and milled samples to fully assess the impacts of scale and energy on the process. The effect of a small lab-scale batch mill and a larger semi-commercial scale mill connected to a continuous flow reservoir was compared. The microscopy results showed that the particle size was reduced significantly after high-energy milling using both batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>mill</b> configurations on the lab scale mill, and in addition highly reproducible results were obtained using the larger mill. FTIR spectra revealed that no significant fluoromica crystalline structural changes were detected. Finally, DLS, SEM and TEM techniques were compared in order to identify the most reliable method for determining particle size distribution, and we propose that SEM has more advantages when it comes to characterising clay platelets. Furthermore, according to the SEM results, the larger semi-commercial scale mill resulted in a greater size reduction, which is consistent with existing concepts and theory of horizontal bead mill scale up.

40|$|In this thesis, {{experimental}} and modelling techniques {{were used to}} investigate the breakage of a typical South African platinum group minerals ore in a ball mill to optimize product size distribution (PSD) for flotation purposes. Batch milling experiments were conducted on three narrow-sized feeds using three different ball sizes to determine the milling parameters of the platinum ore. Verification of the parameters was done by doing additional tests beyond the previous experimental range. This confirmed that the parameters were good estimates for the ore. A scale-up procedure for batch grinding data was used to obtain parameters for an industrial mill on which a performance survey had been done. The survey data was used to verify the scale-up parameters. Following this, the effects of mill rotational speed, ball filling level, slurry filling and ball sizes on milling kinetics were explored and analysed using the attainable region (AR) technique. The outcomes of the simulations showed that a finer product is achieved when small balls are used. Lower mill hold-up and fewer grinding balls were also shown to enhance finer grinding. However, factors that produced a coarser product {{as shown by the}} particle size analysis were shown to yield the greatest amount of the desired size class when analysed using AR. Next, the AR technique was used to analyse simulation outputs of a <b>continuous</b> <b>mill</b> over a wide range of operating conditions. The analysis was limited to plug-flow and well-mixed mill transport models without exit classification. The AR analysis showed that industrial milling conditions could be tailored to the desired product by reducing residence time, mill speed while increasing ball size. Extension of the AR framework to a more realistic transport model also produced similar results. The importance of optimally controlling the residence time of material inside a mill as well as energy was demonstrated when maximising the desired size range. The results showed that operating the ball mill at lower speeds and higher ball filling saves energy. Finally, combining the population balance modelling technique and the AR enabled a better understanding and effective optimisation of milling for downstream processes, particularly for flotation...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{strength}} {{delivery and}} related fields {{have so far}} concentrated on finding the locations in the mill where fibres are damaged and what the damages consist of. However, fibres will invariably encounter mechanical stresses along the fibreline and in this thesis a new concept is introduced; the vulnerability of fibres to mechanical treatment. It is hypothesised that fibres with different properties have different abilities to withstand the mechanical forces they endure as they are discharged from the digester and transported through valves, pumps and various washing and bleaching equipment. In the thesis, results are presented from trials where pulps with significantly different hemicellulose compositions were high-intensity mixed at pH 13, 70 °C and 10 % pulp consistency and pulp strength evaluated. By varying alkalinity and temperature, pulps with different carbohydrate composition could be obtained. High alkali concentration and low temperature resulted in high glucomannan content and low xylan content, whereas cooking at low alkali concentration and high temperature rendered a pulp with low glucomannan and high xylan content. The high alkalinity pulp was stronger, determined as tear index at given tensile index. The pulp viscosity was also higher for this pulp. However, when the pulps were subjected to high-intensity mixing, the high alkalinity pulp lost in tear strength and the re-wetted zero-span tensile strength was substantially reduced. The pulp cooked at high alkalinity was thus interpreted as being more vulnerable to mechanical treatment than the pulp obtained by cooking at low alkalinity. Another pair of pulps was manufactured at high and low sodium ion concentrations, but otherwise with similar chemical charges. The pulp obtained by cooking at low sodium ion concentration became stronger, evaluated as tear index at a given tensile index and the curl index was substantially lower, 8 % compared to 12 % for the pulp cooked at a high sodium ion concentration. The viscosity was 170 ml/g higher for the pulp manufactured at low sodium ion concentration. When the pulps were subjected to high-intensity mixing, the tear strength of the pulp manufactured at high sodium ion concentration was reduced. The re-wetted zero-span tensile index decreased also after mixing. The pulp obtained by cooking at higher sodium ion concentration was thus interpreted as being more vulnerable to mechanical treatment than the pulp manufactured at lower sodium ion concentration. In the thesis, two reasons for the low strength delivery of industrially produced pulps compared to laboratory-cooked pulps are put forward. Since the ionic strength of mill cooking liquor systems {{is much higher than}} is normally used in laboratory cooking, this can partly explain the difference in strength between mill- and laboratory-cooked pulp. A higher sodium ion concentration was shown in this thesis work to give a pulp of lower strength. Secondly, it is suggested that the difference in retention time of the black liquor in laboratory cooking and <b>continuous</b> <b>mill</b> cooking systems can explain the difference in tensile strength between laboratory-cooked and mill-produced pulp. The black liquor in a continuous digester has a longer retention time in the digester than the chips. This gives a longer time for the dissolved xylan to degrade and, as a consequence, the xylan deposited on the mill pulp fibres will be more degraded than the xylan deposited on the laboratory-cooked pulp fibres. In the thesis, results are also presented from studies using different strength-enhancing chemicals. The fibre surfaces of bleached never-dried and once-dried pulp were modified by the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique using cationic and anionic starch. Although the pulps absorbed the same amount of starch, the never-dried pulp reached a higher tensile index than the once-dried pulp. When the starch-treated never-dried pulp was dried and reslushed it still had higher tensile index than the never-dried untreated pulp. The starch layers were thus able to counteract part of the hornification effect. The never-dried starch treated pulps were subsequently dried, reslushed and beaten. Pulp with starch layers had a better beatability evaluated as the tensile index obtained after given number of PFI revolutions than dried untreated pulp. Hence, there is a potential to increase the tensile index of market pulp by utilising the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique before drying. Addition of CMC to bleached mill pulp and laboratory-cooked pulp increased the tensile strength to the same degree for both pulps. CMC addition had a straightening effect on the fibres, the shape factor increased and this increased the zero-span tensile strength also. QC 2010051...|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} balance concept {{has provided a}} useful framework for {{the description of the}} operating behavior of the ball mill. This approach finds expression in the so-called selection breakage function model for batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>mills.</b> This model produces veru good descriptions of the size distribution of the products from ball milling operations and the model is very useful for the description of batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>mills</b> and, when combined with models for classifiers and other unit operations, provides a solid basis for flowsheet simulation procedures. The breakage and selection function model is essentially descriptive and not predictive because the parameters in the model cannot as yet be related to the fundamental material properties of the material that is broken and to the fracture mechanics that govern the comminution of brittle particulate material during the rapid impact and compression events that occur with high frequency in a ball mill. The {{population balance}} approach smears over the individual processes and regards the ball mill as a continuum with breakage occurring continuously in time and space. New experimental techniques, particularly the adaptation of the Hopkinson bar as the ultrafast load cell (UFLC) to the problem of observing the extremely rapid impact fracture of particulate solids, have made it possible to make accurate and consistent measurements of aprticle strength, particle fracture energy and the single-impact breakage function. These quantitative measurements have been incorporated into a new conceptual model of the description of the ball mill. The model is based on identifying events that give rise to particle breakage, and using the fundamental experimental data obtained on the UFLC and other single-particle fracture tests, the probabilities of these events can be independently determined. The distribution of impact energies that occur in the ball mill has been established by discrete element simulation of the media motion. The probabilistic description of the individual fracture events and the description of impact energies are combined to make a priori predictions of ball mill performance under a variety of operating conditions. The new model is used to calculate the selection and breakage functions for quartz in a small batch mill...|$|R
