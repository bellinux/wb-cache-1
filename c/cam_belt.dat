50|$|The bike {{comes in}} three {{equipment}} levels, the base, the S-Sport and the S-Touring. The S models include ABS (optional on standard model) and electronically adjustable suspension, called DES (Ducati Electronic Suspension). The S Sport model features carbon fiber air intakes, <b>cam</b> <b>belt</b> covers and rear hugger, while the S Touring model comes with heated grips, hard luggage and a center stand.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the unit during its production, {{including}} an uprated oil pump around mid-1997, with the addition of larger oilways in the head machining (T-Vents), and modified valve lifters to reduce top-end valve noise, at which point the <b>cam</b> <b>belt</b> arrangement also changed with the lower idler moving. Around 1998, the spin-on metal canister oil filter was changed to a disposable paper element.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{transmission}} requires fewer mechanical parts. The {{problem of}} breakage of parts like gears, <b>cams,</b> <b>belts</b> and chains is not involved.|$|R
50|$|Some {{maintenance}} {{tasks are}} hampered by limited access, common in FWD cars, {{particularly in the}} Rover 45/ MGZS with its smaller engine bay. Significant dismantling of the engine bay is {{required in order to}} access some components such as <b>cam</b> <b>belts,</b> water pump and thermostat. Routine servicing is straightforward and can be carried out by the owner.|$|R
50|$|However, the company’s {{finances}} {{were already}} precarious {{and in order}} to save on development costs it was decided instead to use the manufacturer’s 1290 cc four-cylinder engine as the basis for a new V8 engine, which is why the size of the new engine, at 2580 cc, was precisely twice that of the existing engine. The engine had two overhead camshafts — one for each bank of cylinders — and these were driven using two <b>cam</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 4.0 L (...) all-alloy 1UZ-FE {{debuted in}} 1989 {{in the first}} {{generation}} Lexus LS 400/Toyota Celsior and the engine was progressively released across {{a number of other}} models in the Toyota/Lexus range. The engine is oversquare by design, with a bore size of 87.5 mm and stroke of 82.5 mm. It {{has proved to be a}} strong, reliable and smooth powerplant with features such as 6-bolt main bearings and belt-driven quad-camshafts. The water pump is also driven by the <b>cam</b> <b>belt.</b> The connecting rods and crankshaft are constructed of steel. The pistons are hypereutectic.|$|E
50|$|The smaller Bedford CF {{was less}} successful, {{competing}} {{directly with the}} market-dominating Ford Transit, although used by many of Britain's major utility companies, including British Telecom and British Gas plc. However, the CF was much less popular with fleet operators than the Transit, which was more popular with its drivers and seen as cheaper to operate and maintain. Part {{of the reason for}} the CF's relative unpopularity was the use of the slant 4 SOHC petrol engine from the FD and FE Vauxhall Victor - which was notoriously rough running, had high fuel consumption, and was susceptible to <b>cam</b> <b>belt</b> breakage. However, the CF became very popular as a base of special-bodied ice cream vans and mobile shops. The later CF2 used the more reliable Opel Ascona engine.|$|E

5000|$|At his trial, Sandy testified {{for four}} hours about his actions in the {{standoff}} and a comment he made before the shooting to another officer {{about how he was}} going to shoot Boyd, whom Sandy referred to as a [...] "lunatic." [...] Two hours before the shooting, officer Keith Sandy encountered New Mexico State Police Sergeant Chris Ware on Piedra Vista, the street closest to Boyd's campsite. Sandy knew Ware from his prior employment with the State Police, and greeted him. Ware's dash <b>cam</b> and <b>belt</b> recorder continued to record as they spoke. Sandy told Ware that Boyd was [...] "a fucking lunatic" [...] and threatened to shoot him during a conversation about Taser shotguns. Sandy had responded to the standoff because a police sergeant had requested a Taser shotgun, and he was carrying one.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{deals with}} the kineto-elastodynamic {{modelling}} of a mechanism for rocking motion with a <b>cam</b> and timing <b>belt</b> drives, used in a high-performance automatic packaging machine. A lumped-parameter model is presented, having five degrees of freedom and taking account of non-linearities. Equations of motion are numerically integrated, using the finite difference method. Model parameters are evaluated {{on the basis of}} design data and measurements of the actual motion of the output link. Finally the model is satisfactory validated by comparison with experimental results. The model makes it possible to relate the design and functional parameters of the mechanism to its dynamic behaviour; thus it is used to detect the causes of the dynamic phenomena that reduce performances...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, Henry {{was never}} artistically {{inspired}} by the graphic potential of the modern digital computer. (O'Hanrahan 2005) He much preferred the direct interaction afforded by the clearly visible interconnecting mechanical components of the earlier analogue computer {{and as a consequence}} of his drawing machines also. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} invisible and indirect workings of the later digital computer: [...] "the mechanical analogue computer, was a work of art in itself, involving a most beautiful arrangement of gears, <b>belts,</b> <b>cams</b> differentials and so on- it still retained in its working a visual attractiveness which has now vanished in the modern electronic counterpart; … I enjoyed seeing the machine work…".

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{construction}} of device for inpection of final casting for machine casting dedicated for tension of car <b>cam</b> <b>belt.</b> Device for inpection of final casting is operated by pneumatic parts and is intended to check operational parts of the machine casting. Control is designed directly to enterprise production. It is constructed according to the custom requirements and it’s operability was confirmed on a prototype. It’s construction solves the problems with manual checking. General analysis of machine cast checking as well as analysis of machine casting dedicated for tension of car <b>cam</b> <b>belt</b> in the submitting company {{is included in the}} thesis. Moreover, the thesis comprises of discussion of the construction itself, discussion of pneumatic operating elements and economical and technological review...|$|E
50|$|Motors that {{directly}} produce linear motion are called linear motors. The advantage of linear motors {{is that they}} can produce linear motion without the need of a transmission system, such as ballscrewsleadscrew, rack-and-pinion, <b>cam,</b> gears or <b>belts,</b> that would be necessary for rotary motors. Transmission systems are known to introduce less responsiveness and reduced accuracy. Direct drive, brushless DC linear motors consist of a slotted stator with magnetic teeth and a moving actuator, which has permanent magnets and coil windings. To obtain linear motion, a motor controller excites the coil windings in the actuator causing an interaction of the magnetic fields resulting in linear motion. Tubular linear motors are another form of linear motor design operated in a similar way.|$|R
