5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|Burial 85 {{dates to}} the Late Preclassic and was {{enclosed}} by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones. The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, {{has been linked to}} this tomb, which lies {{deep in the heart of}} the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> textiles to form an upright bundle. The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three-pointed royal headband. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king. Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a spondylus shell and twenty-six ceramic vessels.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid complications from over-inflation, many {{of which can be}} traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E

5|$|Burial 85 {{dates to}} the 1st century AD, in the Late Preclassic, and was {{enclosed}} by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault. It was the first royal burial that characterised the shift in ceremonial focus from the Mundo Perdido complex to the North Acropolis. The tomb was centrally located upon the north-south axis of the North Acropolis, under what would later become Temple 26, and contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones. The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, {{has been linked to}} this tomb, which lies {{deep in the heart of}} the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers.

Hydroxyzine should be administered <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> the elderly with consideration given to possible reduced elimination.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about Hawtrey's early years or later private life. He guarded his {{relationships}} very <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> an era (lasting until 1967 in the UK) when male homosexual behaviour was illegal and punishable by a prison sentence. His outrageous drunken promiscuity did not attract sympathy, nor did his general peevish demeanour and increasing eccentricity earn him many (if any) close friends.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{sorbitol}} added to sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS, used {{in the treatment of}} hyperkalemia) can cause complications in the GI tract, including bleeding, perforated colonic ulcers, ischemic colitis and colonic necrosis, particularly in patients with uremia. Risk factors for sorbitol-induced damage include immunosuppression, hypovolemia, postoperative setting, hypotension after hemodialysis, and peripheral vascular disease. SPS-sorbitol should therefore be used <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> the management of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{beneficial}} to select the cover material <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> order to not only cover the feces but also to inoculate them with beneficial soil microbes.

25|$|In an {{era when}} women had to tread <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> society's orbit, Seward struck a middle ground. In her work, Seward could be {{alternately}} arch and teasing, as in her poem entitled Portrait of Miss Levett, {{on the subject of}} a Lichfield beauty later married to Rev. Richard Levett. She contributed to Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson (1791) but was not particularly happy with the way her material was treated by Boswell. Her work was widely circulated.|$|E

25|$|The {{occupants}} of both graves were warriors, {{as indicated by}} their accompanying material: swords and weaponry. The chamber with the inhumation was extremely well preserved and had never been looted. For this reason, {{it was decided to}} remove the whole chamber en bloque and excavate it more slowly and <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> the State Service laboratory at Wiesbaden. The finds from the main burial chamber, each carefully wrapped in cloth, include a fine gold torc and a bronze tubular jug that had contained mead.|$|E
25|$|Method of storing the material. Wrap the scabs <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> {{paper and}} put them into a small {{container}} bottle. Cork it tightly so that the activity is not dissipated. The container must not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to carry it for some time on the person so that the scabs dry naturally and slowly. The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken from the patient.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this time that the centre of native power on Ceylon began to shift to the south. During Magha's reign the chief priests of Pulatthinagara took two of Rajarata's most sacred relics - the Buddha's alms bowl and the sacred Tooth Relic - and 'on the {{mountain}} Kotthumala in a safe region...buried both the relics <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> the earth and so preserved them'. This {{was not the first}} time this had happened; it was, however, to be the last, as neither was ever returned to the north.|$|E

25|$|The interrater {{reliability}} of the PCL-R can be high when used <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> research but tend to be poor in applied settings. In particular Factor 1 items are somewhat subjective. In sexually violent predator cases the PCL-R scores given by prosecution experts were consistently higher than those given by defense experts in one study. The scoring may also be influenced by other differences between raters. In one study {{it was estimated that}} of the PCL-R variance, about 45% was due to true offender differences, 20% was due to which side the rater testified for, and 30% was due to other rater differences.|$|E
25|$|Sewage and fecal sludge management: In cholera-affected areas, {{sewage and}} fecal sludge {{need to be}} treated and managed <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> order {{to stop the spread}} of this disease via human excreta. Provision of {{sanitation}} and hygiene is an important preventative measure. Open defecation, release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from pit latrines or septic tanks into the environment need to be prevented. In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of sewage treatment. Therefore, the implementation of dry toilets that do not contribute to water pollution, as they do not flush with water, may be an interesting alternative to flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|She {{was educated}} at Miss Murphy's {{private school in}} Melbourne, and in 1873 married Captain Charles Rowan, who had fought in the New Zealand wars. Her husband was {{interested}} in botany and he encouraged her to paint wild flowers. She had had no training but working conscientiously and <b>carefully</b> <b>in</b> water-colour; her work is noted for being botanically informative as well as artistic. Rowan returned to Melbourne in 1877, and for many years travelled in Australia painting the flora of the country, at times {{in the company of}} her painting companion, Margaret Forrest. She published in 1898 A Flower-Hunter in Queensland and New Zealand, largely based on letters to her husband and friends.|$|E
