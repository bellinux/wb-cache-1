40|$|Background/Objective: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and {{hyaluronic acid}} (HA) {{injection}} are both therapeutic options for osteoarthritis and chronic tendinopathy. Although several comparative {{studies on the}} two have been published, the effects of mixing PRP and HA are not fully understood. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the influence of HA on platelets in PRP by measuring releasing growth factors. Methods: PRP was produced from nine healthy adult volunteers (mean age, 32. 8 ± 2. 9 years; range, 29 – 37) with a commercial separation system. HA of weight-average molecular weight of 50 – 120  kDa was used. PRP group (PRP 1  mL + phosphate buffered saline 0. 2  mL) and PRP + HA group (PRP 1  mL + HA 0. 2  mL) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 hours. The amounts of transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β 1) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AA) released from the PRP and PRP + HA samples were measured on Day 0, Day 3, and Day 5. In addition, the same growth factors on Day 5 were measured for PRP + high HA group (PRP 1  mL + HA 0. 6  mL) with five donors. After collecting all of the samples on Day 5, the remaining gels were observed with Giemsa stain. Statistical analyses were performed using paired t tests to compare the PRP and HA groups at each time point, and a one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc tests was used to compare the PRP, PRP + HA, and PRP + high HA groups. Results: The TGF-β 1 concentrations in the PRP and PRP + HA were 24. 3 ± 7. 2  μg/mL and 22. 4 ± 1. 8  μg/mL (p= 0. 689) on Day 0, 17. 2 ± 13. 9  μg/mL and 25. 4 ± 7. 1  μg/mL (p= 0. 331) on Day 3, and 12. 7 ± 10. 5  μg/mL and 33. 7 ± 8. 3  μg/mL (p= 0. 034) on Day 5. The TGF-β 1 concentrations on Day 5 were 24. 1 ± 5. 2  μg/mL (PRP group), 28. 3 ± 2. 4  μg/mL (PRP + HA), and 31. 9 ± 4. 8  μg/mL (PRP + high HA; one-way ANOVA: p= 0. 003; post hoc PRP vs. PRP + HA: p= 0. 016). The PDGF-AA concentrations in the PRP and PRP + HA groups were 2. 30 ± 1. 21  μg/mL and 2. 32 ± 0. 79  μg/mL (p= 0. 931) on Day 0, 2. 03 ± 0. 53  μg/mL and 2. 13 ± 0. 73  μg/mL (p= 0. 500) on Day 3, and 1. 51 ± 0. 40  μg/mL and 2. 00 ± 0. 52  μg/mL (p= 0. 003) on Day 5. The PDGF-AA concentrations were 1. 48 ± 0. 46  μg/mL (PRP group), 1. 94 ± 0. 57  μg/mL (PRP + HA), and 2. 69 ± 0. 70  μg/mL (PRP + high HA; one-way ANOVA: p= 0. 0002; PRP vs. PRP + high HA: p= 0. 002; PRP + HA vs. PRP + high HA: p= 0. 011) on Day 5. The PRP showed larger coagulated masses than the PRP + HA. The high concentration HA group had the smallest <b>coagulated</b> <b>mass</b> of all of the group. Conclusion: The levels of growth factors released by PRP on Day 5 were increased by the addition of HA. A mixture of PRP and HA may be a more effective therapy than PRP or HA alone for osteoarthritis and tendinopathy...|$|E
40|$|Herein {{we report}} {{a case of}} primary paraganglioma of the urinary bladder. A 21 -year-old woman was {{admitted}} to an emergency hospital, because of gross hematuria, dysuria and complete urinary retention. Pelvic CT scan and ultrasonic examination revealed a bladder tumor and <b>coagulated</b> blood <b>mass,</b> then she was referred to our clinic for further treatment. On cystoscopy a dark brown lobular tumor was seen on the anterior wall. The bladder tumor was removed by partial cystectomy. The operative specimen measured 6 X 4 X 3 cm and weighed 50 g. Histological examination showed {{it to be a}} paraganglioma of the urinary bladder, which was chromaffin positive. Her serum and urinary catecholamine level were within the normal range after operation. She is now ten months postoperative, free from hematuria, and showing no other symptoms or signs of disease including metastasis...|$|R
40|$|A 38 -year-old male was {{admitted}} to our emergency ward on Oct. 27, 1982, because of severe pain at his penoscrotum. Upon physical finding on admission, his penis {{was found to have}} been completely amputated 2 cm distally near the root with a razor by himself to commit suicide a few days before admission. On the affected part were much <b>coagulated</b> blood <b>mass</b> and slough and moreover there were 50 maggots about 5 mm long swarming and wrigling, but no bleeding yet and little sign of inflammation. After exclusion of these maggots and cleaning the slashed surface, cutaneous urethrostomy was performed. Postoperative course was favorable but we could not prevent the patient from leaping to his death 45 days after the operation. Self-amputation of the penis with subsequent complication of myiasis is a very rare condition. Since the report of self-amputation of the penis by Matsushita in 1937, this case is the 16 th in Japan. In most cases the patients had mental disorder. In this case the patient was schizoid. On the other hand, 133 cases of myiasis were reported in Japan from 1903 to 1983. In the present case the species that caused myiasis was Lucilia ampullacea. A very rare case of self-amputation of the penis with subsequent complication of myiasis is documented with {{a review of the literature}} on this subject...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective Since the 1960 s, lasers {{have been}} used in {{neurosurgery}} for surgical removal of intracranial tumors. Because of its limited penetration (2 mm) through tissues and its wavelength, which is useful in water medium, the 2 -mu thulium laser has been applied primarily in urology. Its features are attractive for application under microscope magnification during neurosurgical procedures. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of the 2 -mu thulium laser during microsurgical removal of intracranial meningiomas. Materials and Methods Twenty patients with a diagnosis of intracranial meningiomas were treated with surgical intervention using a 2 -mu thulium laser together with bipolar forceps, cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) and traditional microdissection instruments. Surgical removal was divided in four phases: (1) dissection from the external structures; (2) coagulation and debulking; (3) dissection from the deep structures; and (4) coagulation and removal of the basal implant. During all these steps, we evaluated the percentage of usage of the 2 -mu thulium laser comparing them with bipolar forceps and ultrasonic aspirator and blunt dissection. Results Thulium laser was used mainly during phases 2 and 4 for 43 % and 48. 7 % of the total removal, respectively. Although also useful during phases 1 and 3, it was only used for 2. 2 % and 31. 3 %, respectively: traditional dissection with scissors and forceps was preferred. Conclusions Thulium laser seems to be a useful aid in the surgery of intracranial meningiomas, especially to debulk, shrink, and <b>coagulate</b> the <b>mass</b> and the basal implant. Lasers Surg.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Obstruction {{of a major}} airway by tumour causes serious morbidity. There {{is still}} scope for a widely applicable, simple and {{effective}} treatment to provide rapid palliation. METHODS [...] A fibreoptic bronchoscope prototype with an insulated inner sheath was used under local anaesthesia in 17 patients with locally advanced tracheobronchial malignancies. An insulated flexible electro-surgery probe was used to <b>coagulate</b> intraluminal tumour <b>mass</b> using standard electrosurgery equipment. RESULTS [...] Immediate reopening of the airway was obtained in 15 of the 17 patients. Two appeared to have extraluminal disease. Eleven patients had an obvious bronchoscopic response in whom a > 75 % reopening of the normal airway diameter was achieved. Eight patients had subjective improvement of their dyspnoea, but only in four cases was there an objective improvement in physiological parameters. Haemoptysis resolved in four. There were no deaths resulting from treatment. Minor bleeding occurred in one patient and an aspiration pneumonia occurred in one. Three patients received additional treatment. CONCLUSIONS [...] Fibreoptic bronchoscopic electrosurgery is a simple technique for rapid palliation and immediate tumour debulking in patients with central tracheobronchial tumours. Further work is needed to compare its efficacy with other techniques...|$|R
40|$|Freeze-fracturing {{can be used}} {{effectively}} to study pasta microstructure both in the dry and cooked state. Aft er a walerglycerol soaking. conventional raw wheat pasta shows an uncoagulated protein matrix in which the starch granules are uniformly dispersed. Starch granules appear unswollen with a spherulitic structure. Extensive protein denaturation and starch swelling may occur during processing when a temperature greater than 60 °C is attained in drying. Extensive structural transformations take place in cooking. A fibrillar protein network which envelops gelatinized starch is the typical structure observed in cooked durum wheat spaghetti. Whereas. in soft wheat products, there is a less extensive protein framework with more diffuse starch particles. Pasta cooking quality is determined by a physical competition between protein coagulation into a continuous network (I) and starch swelling with spherulite scattering (II) during cooking. If the former (I) prevails, starch particles are trapped in the network alveoli promoting firmness in cooked pasta : Whereas if the latter (II) prevails, the protein <b>coagulates</b> in discrete <b>masses</b> lacking a continuous framework and pasta will show softness and usually stickiness. High temperature-low moisture (HT-LM) drying partially overcomes this competition by producing a coagulated protein framework in dry pasta without starch swelling. HT-LM treatment induces protein-starch interactions and conformational changes in the starch granule fine structure during cooking. Linear and branched chain-like fibrils appear {{in the core of}} the granules and particle groupings in the outer area. The better understanding of the role of controlled starch modification which optimizes pasta processing permits better use of non-conventional raw materials in pasta preparation...|$|R
