40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} on {{the impacts of}} closing a national dialling plan. It clarifies the differences between numbering plans and dialling plans, and shows that the closure of a dialling plan fosters a more efficient use of a numbering plan. The report draws the following conclusions: <b>Closing</b> the dialling <b>plan</b> facilitates more efficient use of the numbering plan as it releases additional numbers for use for operators, subscribers and services. Geographic significance in numbers is not automatically removed when <b>closing</b> the dialling <b>plan.</b> Removing the geographic significance in numbers fosters an even more efficient use of numbering capacity within a numbering <b>plan.</b> <b>Closing</b> the dialling <b>plan</b> may be a prerequisite for further possible evolution of a national numbering plan, {{but there is no}} link between a dialling plan and geographic numbering significance, i. e. a country may choose to <b>close</b> its dialling <b>plan,</b> but still keep the geographic significance of numbers. Although in many countries location portability is considered as a voluntary service aspect, <b>closing</b> the dialling <b>plan</b> and removal of geographic significance of numbers will widen the scope of location number portability to the whole country. This means that the geographic information of a number will graduall...|$|R
