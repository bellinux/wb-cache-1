5|$|Ermac plays a {{supporting}} role in the plot of Mortal Kombat X (2015), in which he remains loyal to Shao Kahn's successors to the Outworld throne, first Mileena and then Kotal Kahn as they fight for the realm's rule {{in the midst of}} a civil war. He ultimately sides with Kotal Kahn upon the revelation that Mileena is not the true heir to the throne, as she is a genetic creation and not Shao Kahn's biological daughter. Ermac joins forces with Kotal Kahn, Reptile, Erron Black, and Ferra/Torr, and during a battle between the Outworlders and Cassie Cage's Special Forces unit, he is immune to Kenshi's son Takeda's telepathy due to the cacophony of souls inside his body, but he is then beaten by Takeda. Near the conclusion, Jax's daughter Jacqui Briggs exacts revenge on Ermac for destroying her father's arms when she defeats him in combat. In his ending, Ermac returns to Shao Kahn's abandoned fortress in search of a voice summoning him when his souls are suddenly consumed by a resurrected Shang Tsung, leaving Ermac in a weakened state. He additionally appears in the <b>closing</b> <b>panel</b> of Kotal Kahn's ending as one of Kahn's chosen warriors (with Reptile, Erron Black, Ferra, and Torr) who fight in Mortal Kombat every decade in attempt to regain Kahn's Outworld sovereignty from Raiden.|$|E
25|$|The Superman of pre-Crisis Earth-17 was the {{original}} Overman, created by the government as were the other heroes of this Earth. Likewise, all other heroes that were created were modified clones of Overman's cell scrapings, such as versions of Wonder Woman, Flash, and Green Lantern. Some time later, Overman went on a homicidal rampage (due to an STD which had affected his mind) and murdered everyone on the planet before he decided to commit suicide and destroy the planet {{at the same time}} with a doomsday bomb. This world was destroyed, and Overman was wiped out by the Crisis, until the Psycho-Pirate began bringing back characters which the Crisis had killed in Animal Man #23, Overman and bomb included, despite trying not to remember him. Overman fought against Ultraman and Animal Man, before Overman was dragged out of the comic book panels and wiped out by a <b>closing</b> <b>panel,</b> ranting that it wasn't his fault he was like that before Animal Man disarmed the bomb. In The New 52 DC Multiverse, Earth-17 is the world of the Atomic Knights and lacks a known Superman analogue.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of industrialized steel construction, new constructive elements have been brought {{not only to the}} market, but to the everyday construction site as well and, in this way professionals and users have questioned their efficiency. In respect to vibrations in floors, what can be detected is that floor structures are thinner and a decrease of the mass in the horizontal <b>closing</b> <b>panels</b> and the utilization of new materials and systems have led them to have lower natural frequencies, and so are nearer to the frequencies produced by walking. This decrease of mass of the <b>closing</b> <b>panels</b> also lead to a considerable weakness in terms of acoustical insulation, which can cause unfavorable conditions and discomfort. Thus, it becomes necessary to do detailed studies of the efficiency of the vibration and acoustical performance of the new systems to obtain the characterization and the qualification parameters in order to optimize their use. This study does a comparative evaluation of some kinds of horizontal and vertical closing systems in respect to the vibrational and acoustical insulation performance...|$|R

Scott Bukatman and Thierry Smolderen saw the monotony of Sammy Sneeze as an attempt by McCay at parody—one that, in Smolderen's words, [...] "chuckles at the absurdity of... doing the same thing ad nauseam". Noah Berlatsky objected to the idea, calling the strip [...] "excessive and infantile, linked, not to a sense of irony, but a sense of wonder", which he compared to the [...] "eternal appetite of infancy" [...] that G.K.

5000|$|Social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, WordPress and Blogspot, {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role in democratic deliberations. The role of social media in e-democracy has been an emerging area for e-democracy, as well as related technological developments, such as argument maps and eventually, the semantic web. Another related development consists in combining the open communication of social networking with the structured communication of <b>closed</b> <b>panels</b> including experts and/or policy-makers, such as for example through modified versions of the Delphi method (HyperDelphi) to combine the open communication of self-organized virtual communities with the structured communication of <b>closed</b> <b>panels,</b> including members of the policy-community. [...] This approach addresses the question of how, in electronic democracy, to reconcile distributed knowledge and self-organized memories with critical control, responsibility and decision. The social networking entry point, for example, is within the citizens' environment, and the engagement is on the citizens' terms. Proponents of e-government perceive government use of social networks as a medium to help government act more like the public it serves. Examples of state usage {{can be found at}} The Official Commonwealth of Virginia Homepage, where citizens can find Google tools and open social forums. Those are seen as important stepping stones in the maturation of the concept of e-democracy.|$|R
