The paper presents the results of pesticide monitoring in 47 samples of wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) of the 2006 vintage from the vineyards included in IPM. The grape samples were analysed for the presence of 67 pesticides. Among them, 20 were allowed in IPM in 2006. Grapes were sampled at the harvest. Two internal analytical methods were used for determination of pesticides: GC-MS method for determination of dithiocarbamates and multiresidual GC-MS method. One grape sample (2. 1 %) contained no residues or they were below limit of detection, 28 samples (59. 6 %) contained residues lower or equal than maximum residue levels (MRLs) and 18 samples (38. 3 %) exceeded national MRLs for <b>cyprodinil</b> (concentration range was 0. 03 - 0. 40 mgkg- 1 of <b>cyprodinil)</b> and fludioxonil (concentration was 0. 03 mgkg- 1 of fludioxonil). Multiple residues were found in 41 samples (87. 2 %). The highest number of pesticides detected per sample was seven. No violation of pesticides allowed in IPM was observed.

With regard {{to the use of}} fungicides in the vineyard at two stages of the grapevine growth we followed four different spontaneous fermentations: control, iprodione, pyrimethanil and f ludioxonil plus <b>cyprodinil.</b> The fungicide residues in the grapes were determined by GC/MS system and the fermentations were followed by changes in yeast, sugar, and ethanol concentrations using colony counting and HPLC. The karyotype analysis of 473 isolates was done by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The fungicide residues in the grapes at the harvest were below the maximum residue limits. Isolates of S. cerevisiae were classified into 15 karyotype groups. The duration of the processes and the populations of the karyotypes differed between the fermentations. The iprodione and control fermentations lasted 36 days with the prevalence of karyotype A while the fludioxonil plus <b>cyprodinil</b> fermentation lasted 50 days and karyotype D led the process. In the pyrimethanil fermentation, none of the karyotypes prevailed in the must and the fermentation lasted much longer than others did (68 days).

The method allowed the determination of azoxystrobin, <b>cyprodinil,</b> fenehexamid, fludioxonil, folpet, iprodione, and tolyfluanid in lettuce at concentrations between 0. 8 and 25. 6 mg/kg, i. e., bellow the maximum residues levels allowed for those compounds in lettuce. Lettuce samples that suffered pesticide treatments with folpet and fenehexamid were analysed during days to harvest to study the dissipation behaviour of the pesticides used. Concentration of folpet was 92. 8; 53. 4; 22. 9; 17. 9; 7. 45; 1. 85 mg/kg and concentration of fenhexamid was 158. 1; 76. 2; 31. 0; 27. 3; 7. 24; 0. 87 mg/kg, respectively for t 0, t 1, t 3, t 6, t 7, t 9 days, and not detected at t 14 days for the two pesticides.

40|$|Many {{pesticides}} {{are used}} increasingly in combinations during crop protection and their stability ensures {{the presence of}} such combinations in foodstuffs. The effects of three fungicides, pyrimethanil, <b>cyprodinil</b> and fludioxonil, were investigated together and separately on U 251 and SH-SY 5 Y cells, which can be representative of human CNS glial and neuronal cells respectively. Over 48 h, all three agents showed significant reductions in cellular ATP, at concentrations that were more than tenfold lower than those which significantly impaired cellular viability. The effects on energy metabolism were reflected in their marked toxic effects on mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, evidence of oxidative stress was seen {{in terms of a}} fall in cellular thiols coupled with increases in the expression of enzymes associated with reactive species formation, such as GSH peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. The glial cell line showed significant responsiveness to the toxin challenge in terms of changes in antioxidant gene expression, although the neuronal SH-SY 5 Y line exhibited greater vulnerability to toxicity, which was reflected in significant increases in caspase- 3 expression, which is indicative of the initiation of apoptosis. <b>Cyprodinil</b> was the most toxic agent individually, although oxidative stress-related enzyme gene expression increases appeared to demonstrate some degree of synergy {{in the presence of the}} combination of agents.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{fungicides}} on grape (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinot noir) pollen germination and tube growth were stud-ied in vitro, and a related field trial examined effects of time of fungicide application during flowering on seed number and fruitset. Fungicides pyrimethanil, <b>cyprodinil</b> + fludioxonil and chlorothalonil incorporated into in vitro ger-mination medium at the recommended mixing rate for field application all prevented pollen germination. When the fungicides were diluted to 10 % of the recommended mix-ing rate, pollen grain germination was still completely in-hibited. Further dilution to 1 %, resulted in some pollen grains germinating but the level was {{significantly less than}} the control, and the grains that did germinate had stunted pollen tubes (< 100 µm in length), compared with controls not exposed to fungicide (800 µm in length). In a 0. 1 % dilution of the fungicides, germination percent was not sig-nificantly different to untreated control, however pollen tube length was still slightly suppressed in media containing pyrimethanil (523 µm) and <b>cyprodinil</b> + fludioxonil (366 µm). In spite of these marked effects on pollen germi-nation and tube growth in vitro, plants sprayed with pyrimethanil at either 5 or 80 % cap fall, resulted in no significant reduction in fruitset.

Some extracts of vegetables, found positive for pesticides with GC, were subjected to Ames test and SOS Chromotest to evaluate the possible antimutagenic and/or antigenotoxic effects of vegetable matrices. The same bioassays were also performed on the mixtures of pesticides found in these samples to evaluate whether interactions could occur between pesticides and be responsible of the possible antimutagenic and/or antigenotoxic effects of the contaminated matrices. Experiments were also carried out to compare the results found for the contaminated vegetables to their contents in antioxidant components. Significant differences in mutagenicity and genotoxicity were found among the pesticides selected for this study. Of the twelve pesticides tested only Azinphos methyl, <b>Cyprodinil,</b> Fludioxonil and Iprodione {{were found to be}} positive both for S. typhimurium and for E. coli. No mutagenic/genotoxic activity was found in the extracts of vegetables contaminated by pesticides. The S. typhimurium TA 1535 showed a strong positive mutagenic effect for the mixtures of pesticides while they were not able to induce the SOS system.

40|$|International audienceA {{study to}} {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} application of several fungicide treatments used in Spanish vines, on Aspergillus carbonarius growth and ochratoxin A (OTA) production was developed. Three trials were designed in order to: i) screen 26 fungicides at the doses recommended by manufacturers on grape-like synthetic medium (SNM) at 20 şC and 30 şC; ii) find out the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each fungicide for A. carbonarius growth on synthetic medium, and iii) investigate the effect of several fungicides on A. carbonarius-inoculated grapes. In synthetic medium, nine fungicides significantly reduced A. carbonarius growth rate, meanwhile 13 completely inhibited its growth. In general, growth was faster at 30 şC than at 20 şC, contrary to OTA production. Fungicides that stopped fungal growth also inhibited OTA production, but not all the fungicides that reduced growth reduced the OTA synthesis. In general, fungicides that contained copper or strobilurins reduced both growth and OTA production, contrary to sulfur fungicides. At the optimum temperature for A. carbonarius growth, 30 şC, higher amounts of fungicide were needed to prevent fungal growth than at 20 şC. Among the fungicides that inhibited A. carbonarius growth on SNM at the initial doses, <b>cyprodinil</b> seemed to be the active ingredient more effective to stop fungal growth when testing reduced doses. Fungicide effect on grapes was similar than that on synthetic medium. Both infection and OTA production were reduced when using <b>cyprodinil</b> 37. 5 % +fludioxonil 25 % and azoxystrobin 25 %. Penconazole 10 % also showed a clear reduction of the OTA production at both temperatures, although infection was only reduced at 20 şC. OTA reduction was strain and temperature-dependent. In general, fenhexamid 50 %, mancozeb 80 % and copper hydroxide 80 %+copper 50 % enhanced infection and OTA production...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays in Ukraine {{there is}} a trend of {{increased}} use of mixed fungicides, containing compounds of certain classes in the formulation and new classes of active substances including anilinopyrimidines compounds. The aim of our work was hygienic assessment of dynamics of anilinopyrimidines pesticide residues in the soil, pit fruits, pomes fruits, vegetables, grapes and estimation of their risk for population. The content of tested substances in the samples was determined by gas-liquid and high performance liquid chromatography. Full-scale field {{studies have shown that}} in soil and climatic conditions of Ukraine dynamics of residues of anilinopyrimidines obeys an exponential dependence. Mean values of anilinopyrimidines fungicides  50 were equal to 10. 7 ± 0. 8 days in soil, 7. 9 ± 0. 2 days – in fruits, 5. 7 ± 0. 6 days – in verdurous plant mass. Pyrimethanil and <b>cyprodinil</b> (according to SsanN&R 8. 8. 1. 002 - 98) were referred to class III of hazard by persistency in soil, and valifenal – to IV class; tested substances were classified as hazard pesticides class III by persistency in plants. Comparative analysis of degradation rates of tested compounds in different matrices showed that degradation processes occur significantly faster in the verdurous mass of plants than in the fruits (p< 0. 05; t= 3, 75); and in fruits – significantly faster than in the soil (p< 0. 05; t= 3. 35). 0. 0413 mg of <b>cyprodinil,</b> 0. 0555 mg of valifenal and 0. 0385 mg of pyrimethanil can get into human body with daily food allowance, which is 3. 3 %, 26. 4 % and 4. 6 % of the acceptable daily intake, correspondingly.

40|$|Chemical {{control of}} gray mold of {{strawberry}} caused by Botrytis cinerea Pers. {{is essential to}} prevent pre- and postharvest fruit decay; however, resistance to multiple chemical classes of fungicides including APs (<b>cyprodinil),</b> DCs (iprodione), MBCs (thiophanate-methyl), PPs (fludioxonil), QoIs (pyraclostrobin), SBIs (fenhexamid), or SDHIs (boscalid) is a well-known and well-described phenomenon in B. cinerea from strawberry fields in Florida, Germany, North Carolina, and South Carolina. As part of a resistance-monitoring program conducted during 2012 and 2013, a total of 1, 890 B. cinerea isolates where collected from 10 states in the eastern USA. The isolates were analyzed for fungicide resistance using a mycelial growth assay. The overall resistance frequencies in 2012 for thiophanate-methyl, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, <b>cyprodinil,</b> fenhexamid, iprodione, and fludioxonil were 76, 42, 29, 27, 25, 3, and 1 %, respectively. Frequencies in 2013 were 85, 59, 5, 17, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. Isolates were resistant to either one (23 %), two (18 %), three (19 %), four (14 %), five (3 %) or six (0. 1 %) chemical classes of fungicides in 2012. In 2013 this distribution was 24 %, 29 %, 26 %, 8 %, 2 %, 0. 3 %, respectively, and also 0. 3 % (6 isolates) were resistant to all classes of fungicides. Resistance to thiophanate-methyl, iprodione, boscalid, pyraclostrobin and fenhexamid was based on target gene mutations in β-tubulin, bos 1, sdhB, cytb, and erg 27, respectively. Isolates were MDR 1 or MDR 1 h dependent on sensitivity to fludioxonil and variations in transcription factor mrr 1. Expression of ABC transporter atrB was highest in MDR 1 h isolates. The discovery of B. cinerea isolates resistant to all registered site-specific fungicides for gray mold control represents an unprecedented milestone of resistance development in B. cinerea that signals a failure of current anti-resistance management strategies.
