Objectives Using decision analysis {{within the context of}} cervical cancer screening in Norway, we aimed to aid decision makers in identifying a subset of relevant strategies that are simultaneously efficient, feasible, and optimal. Methods We developed an age-stratified probabilistic decision tree model following a cohort of women attending primary screening through one screening round. We enumerated detected precancers (i. e., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or more severe (CIN 2 +)), <b>colposcopies</b> performed, and monetary costs associated with 10 alternative triage algorithms for women with abnormal cytology results. As efficiency metrics, we calculated incremental cost-effectiveness, and harm-benefit, ratios, defined as the additional costs, or the additional number of <b>colposcopies,</b> per additional CIN 2 + detected. We estimated capacity requirements and uncertainty surrounding which strategy is optimal according to the decision rule, involving willingness to pay (monetary or resources consumed per added benefit).

40|$|Background: Persistent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) -infection {{can cause}} {{cervical}} cancer through a gradual process of 10 - 15 years, indicating that cervical cancer {{is suitable for}} secondary prevention in terms of screening. Currently, Norwegian health authorities are considering alternative triage strategies in the Norwegian Cervical Cancer Screening Program in attempt to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} program. In the absence of a formal consequence analysis, our objectives were to enumerate the number of detected precancerous lesions (so-called CIN 2 +) and the resource use required of alternative screening strategies. Methods: We developed a probabilistic decision tree simulation model to estimate age-stratified (ages 25 - 33 and 34 - 69) outcomes of different screening algorithms. The model uses epidemiologic data from the Cancer Registry of Norway and follows a cohort of women attending primary screening through one screening round (i. e., 3 years), allowing for loss-to-follow-up and spontaneous regression of CIN 2 +. We compared the current Norwegian strategy entailing primary cytology with co-testing (HPV and cytology) for delayed triage of atypical and low-grade cytology results, with nine alternative strategies involving reflex HPV testing of women with low-grade and/or inadequate cytology results, and various triage strategies according to the co-test result. Primary outcomes were CIN 2 + detected, total costs, total number of tests and consultations, and number of colposcopies/biopsies performed. In addition, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and harm-benefit ratio (IHBR) for each strategy compared with the next most costly/harmful strategy, defined as the additional cost, and the additional <b>colposcopies</b> required, per additional CIN 2 + detected, respectively. Results: Among 100, 000 women, the current Norwegian guidelines would detect 1, 325 and 473 CIN 2 + for ages 25 - 33 and 34 - 69, respectively. For the alternative strategies, these outcomes ranged from 1, 365 to 1, 725 and 462 to 525. For all ages, four strategies gave more value (i. e., CIN 2 + detection) for money in terms of ICERs than the current strategy. For ages 25 - 33, five strategies provided more value for use of <b>colposcopies</b> than the current strategy, while for ages 34 - 69, the current strategy was among the four strategies that yielded most value for use of <b>colposcopies,</b> in terms of IHBRs. Across the alternative strategies for ages 25 - 33 and 34 - 69, respectively, the ICERs ranged from NOK 7, 729 - 68, 059 and NOK 16, 544 - 180, 483, while the IHBRs ranged from 3. 75 - 12. 22 and 0. 67 - 28. 93 <b>colposcopies.</b> Conclusions: There is a potential for improving the current screening algorithm, in terms of both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, by adding reflex HPV testing in primary screening. A larger number of precancers can be detected with fewer resources. Even more resources may be justified depending on society s willingness to pay costs and accept harms in terms of unnecessary <b>colposcopies.</b> Ultimately, the differential effectiveness of the alternative algorithms in terms of preventing invasive cancer will depend {{on the extent to which}} precancerous lesions regress or progress into cancer...|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, community-based physicians have a technology which is safe, noninvasive and relatively inexpensive. It allows immediate access to visual data inside the body for the evaluation of health and disease. Prenatal ultrasound is vital for the efficient provision of preventive care even in community health centers, where physicians may not be the delivering physicians.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the second most common cancer in women around the world, and the human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is universally known as the necessary agent for developing this disease. Through early detection of abnormal cells and HPV virus types, cervical cancer incidents can be reduced and disease progression prevented. We propose a finite-horizon Markov decision process model to determine the optimal screening policies for cervical cancer prevention. The optimal decision is given in terms of when and what type of screening test to be performed on a patient based on her current diagnosis, age, HPV contraction risk, and screening test results. The cost function considers the tradeoff between the cost of prevention and treatment procedures and the risk of taking no action while taking into account a cost assigned to loss of life quality in each state. We apply the model to data collected from a representative sample of 1141 affiliates at a health care provider located in Bogotá, Colombia.

The characteristics of the patients {{and the status of}} the HPV infection were correlated. Results: A total of 706 (90. 1 %) of the 784 women were positive for HPV infection, including 641 patients with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV). Among the patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), {{the average age of the}} 273 patients with other HR-HPV types (48. 6  ±  13. 8 years) was significantly older than the 222 patients infected with HPV 16 / 18 (39. 8  ±  11. 8 years) (p <  0. 001). The proportion of patients with HSILs who were older than 40 years and infected with other HR-HPV types (76. 6 %) was also significantly higher than those with HPV 16 / 18 (20. 3 %) (p <  0. 001).

40|$|Background To {{estimate}} {{the proportion of}} and characterize women who had received cervical and breast screening and to quantify the associated preventable burden of disease and potential iatrogenic harm. Methods A total of 3484 Hong Kong Chinese women were interviewed in person. Screening prevalence and associated predictors, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), the numbers of false-positive tests and the resultant confirmatory procedures and related complications were estimated. Results A total of 6. 2 % of women (? 18) reported regular pap but no mammography or clinical breast examination (CBE) as per local evidence-based guidelines, whereas among women aged ? 40 years, 5. 2 % reported regular screening by all three modalities and 55. 3 % had never been screened for either cancer. Women who underwent regular health checkups were consistently {{the most likely to}} have been screened, as were younger, married and socially advantaged respondents. Triennial pap screening would save 708 DALYs annually, or 528 more DALYs compared with the status quo. However, this would generate 28 600 repeat smears and 390 <b>colposcopies</b> from false-positive screens. Opportunistic mammographic screening averted 100 DALYs currently, but could have potentially reduced a further 546 with biennial screening. Mass screening mammography (CBE) would lead to 33 700 (20 200) false-positives per year requiring 29 900 (8300) repeat mammograms or ultrasonograms, 6800 (3000) biopsies and 620 (270) biopsy-related complications.

All the women underwent Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and <b>colposcopies,</b> and some also underwent cervical or loop electrosurgical excision procedure biopsy. HR HPV was detected in scrape specimens (Amplicor HPV test; Roche Molecular Systems), and the individual genotypes in these specimens were identified (HPV GenoArray test kit; Hybribio Ltd., Hong Kong). Forty-one (49 %) specimens were positive by the Amplicor HPV test. Sixty-four samples (41 positive and 23 negative by the Amplicor HPV test) were also assayed by use of the HPV GenoArray kit. The overall level of agreement between the two assays was 93. 8 % (Cohen's kappa = 0. 98). HR genotypes were found in 37 / 41 (90 %) HPV-positive samples. The prevalences of the HR HPV genotypes in the 37 HPV-positive samples were 41 % of patients for HPV type 16 (HPV- 16), 22 % for HPV- 39, 19 % for HPV- 52, and 14 % for HPV- 18. Forty-one percent of these patients were infected with a single HR genotype, whereas 59 % were infected with mixtures of HR genotypes. The presence of a relatively high percentage of HPV types 39 and 52 and the relatively high incidence of infections with mixtures of genotypes may be one of the reasons for the low rate of conversion from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to invasive carcinoma in Israeli women. Larger and more comprehensive studies are warranted to investigate this issue in greater detail...|$|R
