For this research, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) is used as the analytical technique, while it is useful in detecting functional groups, so it allows the identification of significant changes in the cured mechanism of the system prepared.

30|$|Verdigris is {{currently}} used {{to indicate a}} variety of blue-green compounds resulting from the exposure of copper to various acidic media (vinegar, for example) [1, 143]. The instability of verdigris is well known [50]. Improved performances seem related to oil/oil-resin rich paint layers, or to {{the selection of the}} neutral respect to the basic form (less reactive towards the acidity of the oil), or by adding yellow glazes on top of it [1, 144]. Verdigris is less stable than malachite and azurite to salt solutions, forming Cu 2 + salts when the appropriate anions are present, such as nitrates, sulphates, chlorides [119, 123]. It promotes oil curing and it retards its oxidation [20]. Verdigris (neutral and basic), as well as the copper carbonate pigments azurite and malachite, shows the tendency to react with the oil binding media to form copper soaps [35, 67, 145], to brown and darken, as Cu+ is formed by ambient light absorption (photoreduction), and oxygen promotes the formation of brown peroxide species [146]. Cu-salts of organic acidic compounds are formed in verdigris-containing paint layers (or at the interface with the varnish), as fatty and resin acids can extract copper ions from the verdigris pigment [133, 147]. It seems important to mention that such reactions are equilibria, and therefore the addition of overpaint, or the removal of paint or varnish layers during restoration, might affect the chemical structure of the aged layer [133]. <b>Copper</b> <b>acetates</b> and resinates catalyse the oxidation process of oil films and influences the curing of the oil [133, 134, 147, 148]. In tempera, verdigris seems less prone to discolouration, but still reactions of Cu-extraction can take place [133, 146]. <b>Copper</b> <b>acetates</b> are very soluble in acidic conditions, and copper oxalates are formed in presence of oxalic acid from various sources [32]. In alkaline conditions, blue copper hydroxides are formed [20]. When exposed to H 2 S, the pure pigment turns dark, as covellite is formed; however, this compound has not been identified yet in paint layers [20, 124]. Verdigris should not be mixed with orpiment or leadwhite, as darkening occurs [50]. Verdigris is not sensitive to lasers [141, 142, 149, 150], but it darkens during particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) analysis [151]. It is involved in cellulosic materials degradation, especially for critic conditions of illumination and SO 2 concentrations [20].|$|R
