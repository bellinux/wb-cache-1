500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} of the {{experience}} in his autobiography, Moonwalk.

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair {{described}} the song as a [...] "veritable prayer that explicitly references God", and highlighted the lines [...] "Sometimes this {{life can be}} so cold / I pray you'll come and <b>carry</b> <b>me</b> home, <b>Carry</b> <b>me</b> higher, higher, higher." [...] According to Carey, the song holds deep lyrical meaning for herself, {{as well as her}} fans. She compared it to older emotional ballads from her career, and {{described the}} sentiment they held for many fans [...] "Usually, I'll have an introspective bleak-outlook-on-life song. In the past it's been 'Petals' or 'Close My Eyes'. Those were the ones that the hard-core fans related to most. But this has a hopefulness to it. That's why it's one of my favorites, too." [...] Additionally, Carey outed Keaton's verse during the song's introduction as her favorite part of the song, and included it as a guide for fans, due to the help it had given her in the past: ...|$|E

500|$|The album's {{style and}} themes are {{exemplified}} by the bookending track [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features a dreamy, moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes the In a Silent Way-era jazz of Miles Davis. [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking for {{a way out of this}} confusion/I'm looking for a sign, <b>carry</b> <b>me</b> home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you <b>carry</b> <b>me</b> home." [...] The narrator beseeches the [...] "river" [...] to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers [...] "Africa".|$|E
500|$|... "Fly Like a Bird" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, first released on February 13, 2006 by Island Records as the sixth single from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Written and produced by Carey and James [...] "Big Jim" [...] Wright, the song is influenced by Gospel, soul, and R music genres. Its arrangement is built on piano chords and guitar melodies, and features Carey's pastor Clarence Keaton, who recites two Biblical verses during the song's introduction and bridge. Carey described [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] as the most personal and religious track from The Emancipation of Mimi, with its lyrics featuring a veritable prayer to God: [...] "Fly like a bird, take to the sky, I need you now Lord, <b>carry</b> <b>me</b> high!".|$|E
500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving. There is a real, human yearning for mercy in it — Mariah’s true cry for help from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) I pray you'll come and [...] <b>carry</b> <b>me</b> home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the opening}} verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking {{for a way}} out of this confusion/I'm looking for a sign, <b>carry</b> <b>me</b> home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you <b>carry</b> <b>me</b> home." [...] In his {{interpretation}} of Scott-Heron's lyrics, music writer and author Mtume ya Salaam explained [...] "Gil sings of 'looking {{for a way out}}' out of the cold, hard city; he wants to 'lay down by a stream' that is 'miles away from everything.' But he’s too far away from home, there is no way out—instead of warm, open fields and flowing waters, there is only brick, asphalt and mortar." [...] Following several vocal deliveries of whole choruses, the narrator pleads to the [...] "river" [...] to take him home, which is revealed at closing seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently says [...] "Africa".|$|E

2500|$|Their first EP, <b>Carry</b> <b>Me,</b> was {{released}} in 1989 and contained the songs [...] "Carry Me" [...] and [...] "England My Home", which received Radio 2 airplay. At that time the band recruited Alan Miles to play harmonica, guitar, and mandolin and to perform backing vocals. This lineup produced the EP Outside/Inside and toured throughout 1989 and most of 1990.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Carry</b> <b>Me</b> Back was {{released}} July 17, 2012 on According to Our Records (or ATO Records). Founded by Dave Matthews {{and his business}} manager Coran Capshaw in 2000 as a division of RCA Records. Recorded at Sound Emporium Studios in Nashville, the album was produced by Ted Hutt {{who had worked with}} Gaslight Anthem, Dropkick Murphys, and Flogging Molly. The name derives from [...] "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny", former official state song of Virginia.|$|E

[...] "He got the gig" [...] because Secor [...] "knew that anyone who worked at Augusta knew all about old-time music." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{released}} 50 Years of Blonde on Blonde on April 28, 2017, {{their first}} album on Columbia Nashville. Previous studio albums were O.C.M.S. (2004), Big Iron World (2006), Tennessee Pusher (2008), <b>Carry</b> <b>Me</b> Back (2012), and Remedy (2014). Their song [...] "Wagon Wheel", written by frontman Ketch Secor through a co-authoring arrangement with Bob Dylan, was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 2013 {{and has been}} covered {{by a number of}} acts, including Darius Rucker, who made the song a top 40 hit.|$|E
2500|$|Warren {{presided over}} the Court's October 1968 term and retired in June 1969; Nixon named Warren E. Burger to succeed him. Warren regretted his decision, {{reflecting}} [...] "If I had ever known {{what was going to}} happen to this country and this Court, I never would have resigned. They would have had to <b>carry</b> <b>me</b> out of there on a plank". Burger, despite his distinguished profile and conservative reputation, proved to be quite ineffective in stopping Brennan's influence within the court, so the [...] "Warren Court" [...] legacy continued in many respects until about 1986, when William Rehnquist became Chief Justice and took firmer control of the agenda.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{recorded}} with the working title of All at Once and then renamed Carry Her, <b>Carry</b> <b>Me</b> after {{a line in}} closing track [...] "The Blanket of Night", the band changed their mind shortly before the album's release and settled on naming the album after one of its tracks. Singer Guy Garvey explained, [...] "It's {{to do with the}} fact that there have been [...] life events. There are five members of the band—people have split up, got together, had children. It never stops, this stuff. Especially round the [...] 40 mark... and yet I wanted to remain celebratory about that. Everybody's feeling relief, with remorse, next to joy, next to loss. But I think laughing very hard and worrying very little is a good way to keep young." ...|$|E
