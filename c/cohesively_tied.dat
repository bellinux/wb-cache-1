30|$|This {{analysis}} has revealed {{the limitations of}} existing accounts of late indefinites and challenged and extended Hasan’s co-extensional framework. Co-extensional analysis can provide a means of illustrating how the referents of these complex indefinite expressions are <b>cohesively</b> <b>tied</b> to the preceding text and on-going discourse. The writer does not simply rely on textual cohesion, but also taps into the cultural knowledge assumed as shared by the readership, i.e. the writer makes out that the information is ‘hearer-old’, given the likely readership of this of kind of article. Another strategy to guide interpretation is {{the continuation of the}} identity chain of reference. In each of the expressions, there is something to link the expression to the specific participant, whether it is textual ties, contextual/discoursal ties or continuity of reference. Thus, there is an assumption of cooperation and adherence to the principle of distant responsibility towards the reader (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986 : 34), through the provision of a platform for the interpretation of the expression as referring to the established participant.|$|E
30|$|Co-extension, {{the third}} meaning relation, {{and the one}} we are most {{concerned}} with here, is a semantic relation between members of a cohesive tie, where members refer to something within the same general field of meaning (Hasan 1985 : 74). For example, lunch, restaurant and meal are all <b>cohesively</b> <b>tied</b> to the semantic field of food, and if presented in a text, would form a ‘similarity chain’ (as opposed to an identity chain). Co-extension differs from co-classification and co-reference in that the meaning of one member is not elicited only by reference to its relation to another, but rather the relationship arises from some contiguity of meaning. Co-extension is usually realised by lexical items or content words, which form a semantic grouping (a similarity chain) {{within the context of}} a specific text items can refer to related actions, events and objects and their attributes and the semantic grouping they form is genre-specific (Hasan 1985 : 85). The field of discourse 3 determines, to a large extent, what items may form the semantic groupings which make up the similarity chains.|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{presentation}} was better received. Various critics praised {{the way that}} the game's storyline <b>ties</b> <b>cohesively</b> with the missions, allowing for better and more involving gameplay. GameSpot praised the game for its [...] "captivating storyline." [...] IGN applauded that the game recognizes the player's accomplishments, adding a [...] "sense of worth" [...] to the campaign. Although GameSpy felt that the menu interface was not optimized in terms of usability, it lauded the look of the game's cinematics and briefing screens. Although others believed that the player's responses to wingmen had little effect on gameplay, Game Informer felt that the feature was a [...] "brilliant way to create atmosphere." ...|$|R
30|$|English {{does not}} have an {{explicit}} linguistic way of exhibiting simultaneously the relationship between old and identifiable and new and non-identifiable, so the relation has to operate outside of language, perhaps in cognition only. It is difficult to engineer a way in which language is responsive to this relation (in English anyway), as it only responds to the construal of the ‘virtual’ referent as non-identifiable (c.f. Du Bois: Definiteness, reference and analogues, unpublished). However, the writers of the texts analysed have found a way of ensuring that the association to the old, identifiable referent remains explicit, {{through the use of a}} RRC which contains already established information which is <b>tied</b> <b>cohesively</b> to the cotext, context or on-going discourse about the specific entity.|$|R
