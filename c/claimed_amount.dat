[...] He was ill {{for the first few}} months of his term, but when he recovered, he threw a feast for his children and received many gifts, although he sent most of the gifts given to him by the wealthy back. While he was governor, the flooding of the Nile caused widespread drought in Egypt, leading to his dismissal from the office in March or April 1622. His defterdar (finance minister) Hasan, having become the acting governor (kaymakam) after Hüseyin Pasha's removal, accused him of having embezzled money from the treasury and crops from the granary and prevented him from leaving Cairo. Hüseyin Pasha paid 25,000 gold pieces (dinars; half of the <b>claimed</b> <b>amount)</b> and claimed that a local Jew, who had disparaged him after his removal from office, should pay the rest, claiming that the Jew was indebted to Hüseyin Pasha in the same amount, with this obtaining permission to leave. However, when the authorities went to the Jew to demand payment of the money that Hüseyin Pasha had said he owed him, the Jew claimed that he had already paid Hüseyin Pasha. When this response was made known to Hüseyin Pasha, he claimed that he was not at fault and the Jew was lying, but agreed to pay the remaining 25,000 gold pieces in exchange for the Jew being brought to him. The acting governor accepted this proposal and delivered the Jew to Hüseyin Pasha, who tortured and killed him and took the 25,000 gold pieces by force. After these events, Hüseyin Pasha traveled to Romania, then under Ottoman rule.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Random {{numbers are}} {{essential}} for cryptography. In most real-world systems, these values come from a cryptographic pseudoran-dom number generator (PRNG), {{which in turn is}} seeded by an entropy source. The security of the entire cryptographic system then relies on the accuracy of the <b>claimed</b> <b>amount</b> of entropy provided by the source. If the entropy source provides less unpredictability than is expected, the secu-rity of the cryptographic mechanisms is undermined, as in[10, 5, 7]. For this reason, correctly estimating the amount of entropy available from a source is critical. In this paper, we develop a set of tools for estimating entropy, based on mechansims that attempt to predict the next sample in a sequence based on all previous samples. These mechanisms are called predictors. We develop a framework for using predictors to estimate entropy, and test them experimentally against both simulated and real noise sources. For comparison, we subject the entropy estimates defined in the August 2012 draft of NIST Special Publication 800 - 90 B[4] to the same tests, and compare their performance...|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} the following statistical distributions as possible {{models for the}} distribution of <b>claim</b> <b>amounts</b> in general insurance: 1 - The lognormal 2 - The Weibull 3 - The inverse Gaussian (A new 3 -parameter form is introduced) 4 - The Pareto 5 - The truncated lognormal {{as a model for}} large <b>claim</b> <b>amounts)</b> 6 - The gamma (as a model for the distribution of the square root of <b>claim</b> <b>amounts)</b> The properties. of the above distributions are investigated and various methods of estimation of their parameters are explored. The method of multinomial maxim mt likelihood for estimating the parameters is favoured because data on <b>claim</b> <b>amounts</b> is generally in grouped frequency format. To find these estimates a computing technique is proposed which avoids solving a complicated set of non-linear equations. A procedure which avoids solving non-linear equations is also suggested for the least squares estimation of the 3 -parameter lognormal, 3 -param_etor Weibull and the Pareto distribution of the second kind. In order to show how the various methods work in practice they are applied to an actual set of accidental damage <b>claim</b> <b>amounts.</b> Goodness-of-fit tests are used to judge the agreement between the model and sample valuos. The Chi-square and the Kolmogorov-Sriirnov tests are reviewed and a new test statistic is proposed which measures the overall agreement between the model and sample values in monetary terms. The application procedures for all these tests are described. Inflation {{is likely to be the}} main cause of the increase in the size of claim over time. Therefore, its effects on the parameters of various models are examined. A method is suggested for predicting the future distribution of <b>claim</b> <b>amounts</b> which uses the parameters of a past model after being adjusted for inflation.
