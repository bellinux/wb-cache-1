5|$|<b>Cantor</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below <b>Cantor</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E
5|$|After the crash, the North Tower burned for 102minutes before {{collapsing}} at 10:28A.M. Although {{the impact}} itself caused extensive structural damage, the long-lasting fire ignited by jet fuel was {{blamed for the}} structural failure of the tower. In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed. <b>Cantor</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> L.P., an investment bank on floors 101–105 of the World Trade Center One, lost 658employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{initially}} {{failed to}} attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of the World Trade Center, such as the State of New York. In the 1980s, the city's perilous financial condition eased, after which {{an increasing number of}} private companies—mostly financial firms related to Wall Street—became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of the World Trade Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center, and a PATH station. The North Tower became the main corporate headquarters of <b>Cantor</b> <b>Fitzgerald,</b> and it also became the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.|$|E

[...] None of the employees who were in the Cantor offices that morning survived the attacks. In total, 658 of Cantor’s 960 employees died that day, including Lutnick’s brother Gary Lutnick. [...] Lutnick himself {{would have been in the}} office as well that morning, but on September 11 he was taking his son Kyle to his first day of kindergarten.|$|R

2500|$|The {{process for}} {{arranging}} the names was finalized in a 2006 agreement, replacing an earlier plan {{to arrange the}} names randomly. According to Edith Lutnick (executive director of the <b>Cantor</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> Relief Fund), [...] "Your loved ones' names are surrounded by {{the names of those}} they sat with, those they worked with, those they lived with and, very possibly, those they died with." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the attacks, media reports suggested that tens of thousands might have been killed in the attacks, as over 50,000 people could be inside the World Trade Center, although the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that approximately 17,400 occupants were in the towers at the time of the attacks. Ultimately, 2,753 death certificates (excluding those for hijackers) were filed relating to the 9/11 attacks in New York City, including one filed for Felicia Dunn-Jones, who was added to the official death toll in Dunn-Jones died five months later from a lung condition linked to exposure to dust during the collapse of the World Trade Center. Three other victims were then added to the official death toll by the city medical examiner's office: Dr. Sneha Anne Philip, who was last seen the day before the attacks; Leon Heyward, a man who developed lymphoma and subsequently died in 2008 as a result of dust ingestion during the events following the attacks to the Twin Towers; and Jerry Borg, who died in December 2010 of pulmonary sarcoidosis determined in June 2011 to be the result of dust from the attacks. 2,192 civilians died in and around the World Trade Center, including 658 employees of <b>Cantor</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> L.P. (an investment bank on the 101st–105th floors of One World Trade Center), 295 employees of Marsh & McLennan Companies (which was located immediately below <b>Cantor</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> on floors 93–101, the location of Flight 11's impact), and 175 employees of Aon Corporation.

Ten years after the attacks, remains of only 1,629 victims had been identified. Of all the people who were still in the towers when they collapsed, only 20 were pulled out alive.|$|E
