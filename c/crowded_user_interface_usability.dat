40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work {{is to develop a}} method that could help to {{evaluate}} web site <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability.</b> The solution is based on existing usability evaluation methods, theory-defined guidelines and outlined ideas of usability experts. 	The method is implemented by creating an online system that can be used by any user with internet access. System allows evaluating <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability</b> of a chosen web site. After answering evaluation questions user can view and analyze identified problems and offered recommendations. 	The method is final, and its data can be continuously increased and improved through the administration zone which allows experts to create new evaluation criteria, recommendations and questions. Created method is used by proposing a specific set of data (questions, problems, recommendations, etc.), which allows to evaluate <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability</b> of e-commerce systems. Suggested data is not final, but it helps to evaluate the quality of the method. 	Developed solution could be useful for both system developers and owners...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{physical}} <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability</b> of {{embedded systems}} has received less attention {{in contrast to}} software aspects by the field of software engineering. Physical <b>user</b> <b>interfaces</b> and interaction offer difficulty in usage, both physically and cognitively. We study, investigate, and evaluate the complexities found in embedded system interactions and try to tame or manage these by using suitable physicality principles. Final objective is to propose an interaction framework based on the lessons learned. Our aim is to introduce natural interaction with physical <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> of embedded systems whilst bridging the gap between human-computer interaction and software engineering.

To its detriment, usability testing is more expensive and time intensive than heuristic evaluation.

40|$|The most {{important}} aspect of modern interactive computer systems is the level of support they provide for the underlying human activity. This level of support is encompassed in the <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> with which the user interacts with the system. <b>User</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability</b> is an important factor but is often considered only in terms of the ease of use of the <b>user</b> <b>interface.</b> In this paper, a new framework is designed for the <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> which will evaluate the quality of design before the final design is formalized. This paper emphasizes on the fact that usability as an objective is synonymous with the quality of use. Usability as an attribute must be designed into a product and must be considered as the highest level quality objective.

40|$|Guidelines for <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> {{design is}} one {{possible}} source for improving <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability,</b> but manipulating guidelines manually or automatically induces {{two types of}} problems: problems which are intrinsic to guidelines themselves and problems which are originated by tools for working with guidelines.

Mobile health (m-health) applications for developing countries seek to improve access to healthcare and health-related information, especially {{in the rural areas}} with limited resources. Various healthcare initiatives have been undertaken, both from the governmental and non-governmental organizations, including the Mobile Based Vaccine Stock Monitoring System for rural parts of Ethiopia for timely intervention of out-of-stock and wastage of vaccines.

Heuristic evaluations {{are one of the most}} informal methods of usability inspection in the field of human-computer interaction. There are many sets of usability design heuristics; they are not mutually exclusive and cover many of the same aspects of <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> design. Quite often, usability problems that are discovered are categorized—often on a numeric scale—according to their estimated impact on user performance or acceptance. Often the heuristic evaluation is conducted in the context of use cases (typical user tasks), to provide feedback to the developers on the extent to which the interface is likely to be compatible with the intended users’ needs and preferences.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Developing {{smart home}} systems that {{properly}} fit end-user needs {{is not always}} an easy task {{due to the lack}} of understanding that may exist between end-users and system developers. In the context of Software Product Lines, several approaches have been presented to improve the development of smart home system functionality. However, little support is provided to improve the interaction with end-users. In this work, we extend a Software Product Line based on Model-Driven Development with an interactive design tool that allows end-users to actively participate in the SPL. This tool allows end-users to configure the decision model that drives the production process of the software product line by themselves. In order to develop this tool we have been inspired by well-known and tested enduser techniques and interaction patterns that improve the <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability.</b> I...|$|R

The primary goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the educational usefulness of etextbooks. The secondary goal was to evaluate the <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability</b> of e-textbooks. Two methods of evaluation were used in this study. A web-based survey was used and the sample included current student users of e-textbooks in a variety of business topics in four-year undergraduate business schools. Survey requests were provided to instructors identified as using e-textbooks, who forwarded the survey to the students. There were 166 student responses to the web-based survey. A user review was used and included a 2 ̆ 2 think-aloud 2 ̆ 2 method of evaluation in which participants were asked to perform tasks with one business e-textbook and complete a questionnaire. The participants used included seven undergraduate business students enrolled at Southern Oregon University in a business course in which an e-textbook was used and presented in the Adobe Acrobat Reader 7. 0 format. The investigator expected to provide insight to what ways e-textbooks enable students to meet learning objectives. The web-based survey results showed students are satisfied with the criteria presented and deemed important in evaluating the educational usefulness of e-books. A key finding in the web-based survey was the dissatisfaction that users reported on the ability to edit, mark and annotate when using e-textbooks.

40|$|The {{use of the}} Internet {{and social}} {{applications}} has many benefits for the elderly, but numerous investigations {{have shown that the}} elderly do not perceive online social networks as a friendly social environment. Therefore, TreeIt, a social application specifically designed for the elderly, was developed for this study. In the TreeIt application, seven mechanisms promoting social interaction were designed to allow older adults to use social networking sites (SNSs) to increase social connection, maintain the intensity of social connections and strengthen social experience. This study's main objective was to investigate how <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> design affects older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. Fourteen <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> evaluation heuristics proposed by Zhang et al. were adopted as the criteria to assess <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> <b>usability</b> and further grouped into three categories: system support, <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> design and navigation. The technology acceptance model was adopted to assess older people's intention and attitude related to using SNSs. One hundred and one elderly persons were enrolled in this study as subjects, and the results showed that all of the hypotheses proposed in this study were valid: system support and perceived usefulness had a significant effect on behavioral intention; <b>user</b> <b>interface</b> design and perceived ease of use were positively correlated with perceived usefulness; and navigation exerted an influence on perceived ease of use.
