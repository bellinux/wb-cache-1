The attenuation of the radiometric data identifies the main areas of water saturation in the very near surface. The radiometric data have the potential to identify additional areas where similar degrees of saturation exist. The data may therefore be used to help define extensions to existing site boundaries and to provide information in the assessment of new wetland areas. The radiometric data also show regional-scale transition from the Carboniferous Limestone in the east, important for water supply to the wetlands, to older more impermeable strata to the west. The conductivity data appear capable of mapping the lateral extent of <b>clay</b> <b>accumulations,</b> concealed below peat cover which can act as a confining layer to the bedrock aquifer. At the regional scale the data reveal the extent of a former Holocene lake system and the hydrogeological control of a Carboniferous limestoneâ€“sandstone contact. The data therefore provide a non-invasive spatially continuous, characterization of the sites, improving the understanding of their dynamic water balances and, potentially, guiding further ground assessments and invasive investigations...|$|R

Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive system and X-ray diffractometry were {{used to describe the}} nature and properties of mineral accumulations on the rock surface. Results showed that organic salts such as calcium oxalate and calcium formate are associated with Aspicilia caesiocinera (Nyl. ex Malbr.) Arnold, Caloplaca sp., Xanthoria elegans (Link) Th. Fr., and Lecidea plana (Lahm) Nyl. Secondary accumulations of 2 : I clays minerals are found in A. caesiocinera while oxides of manganese are associated with X. elegans. Coatings of goethite (iron oxides) are believed to form from biological activity associated with the presence of hyphae and rodlet structures on the flakes. Calcium oxalate crystallizes into several morphologies such as druse, hexagonal plates, and lenticular containing between 20 and 48 per cent calcium by weight. Calcium formate and iron oxide (goethite) occur together in the form of 'red' desert varnish. Observed 'black' coatings contain as much as 37 per cent manganese and 22 per cent iron. <b>Clay</b> <b>accumulations</b> have plate-like morphology and contain c. 2 : 1 silicon to aluminium contents. We argue that organic acids from the activities of biotic crusts contribute to the breakdown of granitic rocks.

This study {{focuses on the}} relative age of inactive dunes in northern Illinois on the late Wisconsinan Bloomington Moraine. If these dunes were active during the Holocene, they could be an important geomorphological proxy for Holocene climate change. Soils on one dune and in adjacent loesscovered areas were studied to determine the relative degree of soil development and to identify any buried soils under the dune. Ten soil profiles were described and analyzed for particle size, color, pH, and other physical properties. Wind speed and climatic data from a nearby station were used to calculate a mobility index and a sand rose to quantify the potential for eolian sand movement. The result was th a t there was enough wind energy for sand movement; however the P/PE is high enough for stable vegetation cover and therefore stable dunes. The orientation of the dunes indicates northwest winds during their formation. Soils in the dune sand and in the loess both have <b>clay</b> <b>accumulations</b> in Bt horizons, although those in the dune sand are much more weakly developed. This may reflect differences in parent material rath e r th an age. The presence of a Bt horizon indicates the soils {{are more than a}} few hundred years old, probably significantly older. There are no buried soil horizons under the dune, which rests on unweathered late Wisconsinan glacial till. This means the sands were deposited not long after the till or if there were soils on the till before the sands, they were completley eroded away before the sands migrated in.

40|$|The Ain Settara section, {{located in}} the Kalaat-Senan area of north^central Tunisia, spans the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) {{boundary}} which {{is characterized by a}} red layer and a thin non-bioturbated boundary <b>clay.</b> Sediment <b>accumulation</b> across the K^T boundary at Ain Settara was probably interrupted by three short hiatuses and/or condensed sedimentation. The first hiatus occurs {{at the top of the}} CF 1 Zone; the second hiatus/condensation occurred just below the boundary clay and the third hiatus at the P 0 /P 1 a boundary, in the earliest Danian. These hiatuses are marked by weak unconformities, bioturbation and sudden disappearances/appearances of species which are known to disappear/evolve sequentially in continuous sections. Quantitative high-resolution planktonic foraminiferal analysis across zones CF 1 (upper), P 0 and P 1 a (1) reveals an extended and selective mass extinction. All 41 % of the species which disappeared at or below the K/T boundary are rare to very rare and primarily ecologically specialized keeled deeper-dwelling tropical^subtropical forms (Globotruncana, Globotruncanita, Gublerina, Planoglobulina, Rosita (Contusotruncana), Racemiguembelina). Their combined relative abundance varies between 10 % and 15 % of the total population at the end of the Maastrichtian. The K/T crisis thus appears more catastrophic when viewed in tropical^subtropical assemblages and based on analysis of larger species (s 200 Wm) which preferentially includes the more specialized forms, though, in fact, the K^T mass extinction actually involved a relatively small part of the foraminiferal population in terms of relative abundance. The pattern of extinction and changes in dominant population at Ain Settara appear to be very similar to the planktonic foraminiferal turnover of the other north-central Tunisian sections (El Kef, Elles). The selective mass extinction pattern suggests that the catastrophic effects of the bolide impact superimposed those related to long-term environmental changes, such as variations in temperature, sea-level and associated water-mass changes...|$|R

The minerals in LTAs of Niuchang-Yigu coals are mainly quartz, kaolinite, chamosite, mixed-layer I/S, pyrite, and calcite, with trace amounts of marcasite, dolomite, and bassanite. Quartz is mainly embedded in collodetrinite and occurs as cleat- and cell-fillings. The silica was primarily transported by aqueous solutions originated from the weathering of basaltic rocks in the Kangdian Upland and by hydrothermal fluids. The presence of Î²-quartz paramorph grains, distributed in collodetrinite, probably indicates that quartz from volcanic ash was deposited during peat <b>accumulation.</b> <b>Clay</b> minerals generally occur in collodetrinite and as fill in coal-forming plant cells.

5000|$|Many {{subsurface}} diagnostic horizons {{are used}} to characterize different soils in soil taxonomy. Each diagnostic horizon provides a characteristic that helps place a soil in its proper class in the system. A soil {{may or may not}} have a subsurface diagnostic horizon. There are approximately 20 subsurface diagnostic horizons, of which include the argillic horizon, natric horizon, kandic horizon, oxic horizon, spodic horizon, and albic horizon. The argillic horizon (designated as Bt) is characterized by a thick accumulation of silicate clays that have moved downward from the upper horizons or have formed in place. The argillic horizon often contains clays with shiny coatings termed [...] "argillans" [...] or [...] "clay skins", and accompanied by less than 15% exchangeable sodium on the colloidal complex. The natric horizon (designated as Btn) similarly has silicate <b>clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> with clay skins, but the clays are accompanied by more than 15% exchangeable sodium on the colloidal complex and by columnar or prismatic soil structural units. The natric horizon is most commonly found in arid and semiarid regions. The kandic horizon (designated as Bt, Bts), sometimes referred to as [...] "old" [...] clays, has an accumulation of Fe and Al oxides as well as low-activity silicate clays (e.g., kaolinite), but clay skins need not be evident. The clays are low in activity as shown by their low cation-holding capacities. The oxic horizon (designated as Bo) is a very weathered horizon with a high content of Fe/Al oxides and low-activity silicate clays. It is generally physically stable, crumbly, and not very sticky, despite its high clay content. It is found most commonly in humid tropical and subtropical regions. The spodic horizon (designated as Bh, Bhs) is an illuvial and dark-colored horizon that is characterized by the accumulation of colloidal organic matter and aluminium oxide with or without iron oxide. It is commonly found in highly leached forest soils of cool humid climates, typically on sandy-textured parent materials. The albic horizon (designated as E) is an eluvial and light-colored horizon that is characterized by a low content of clay and Fe/Al oxides.|$|E

40|$|The geomorphic {{evolution}} of the south-eastern Brazilian landscape is attributed to climatic changes coupled with tectonic activity. Soils developed on the resulting surfaces are mainly deep polygenetic Oxisols. The combination of stable landscapes (with continuously exposed soils) and neo-Cenozoic graben zones (episodically filled with sediments that may have undergone soil formation) offers the possibility to unravel {{the history of the}} soils that are found at the present day surface. Soil-sediment sequences {{in the southern part of}} the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil were investigated by micromorphology and mineralogy in order to understand the genesis of the soils. Erosion (profile thinning), weathering, biological activity, <b>clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> and iron translocation are the main soil forming processes imprinted in the various pedosedimentary layers. Strong weathering is shown by dissolution of quartz and weathering of ilmenite. Bioturbation is ubiquitous even in older and deeper buried layers. <b>Clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> is observed as illuviation and precipitation features which were micromorphologically differentiated. Accumulation and movement of iron are represented by gley and pseudogley features, related to groundwater and surface-water saturation processes. These features and the layering of sediments and soils play key roles in understanding the evolutionary phases undergone by the soils and sediments. As main soil formation episodes, the graben fillings show two phases of clay formation and illuviation, separated by a phase of ferralitization, interrupted by various episodes of erosion. The whole material was eventually overprinted by a phase of ferralitization and plinthite formation. Apart from water saturation, these processes also appear to have acted on the soils of the stable areas (not affected by tectonic activity), but overprinting and erosion prevents recognition of the separate evolutionary phases...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{results of}} a multidisciplinary and multi-analytical study of Holocene archaeological soils around Cecita Lake (Sila massif, Calabria, southern Italy), which represents a typical upland Mediterranean environment. It is focused on assessment of climatic and environmental changes that took place since late Neolithic to Roman times, trying to discriminate natural from anthropogenic signals. Based on an integration of archaeological, geomorphological, stratigraphic, pedological, volcanological and soil charcoal (pedoanthracological) data, the following paleoclimatic/environmental reconstruction is proposed: a warm and humid, seasonally contrasted climate, with an overall geomorphological stability suited for soil development, characterized the late prehistoric environment (Holocene climatic optimum), dominated by a widespread oak forest. The main pedogenetic processes consisted in organic matter <b>accumulation,</b> <b>clay</b> illuviation, phyllosilicate and short-range order mineral neogenesis from weathering of granite and volcanic ash, sourced from late Pleistocene-Holocene eruptions of the Aeolian Islands. One or more mid-Holocene episodes of climate deterioration towards drier conditions (indicated by a decrease of clay translocation processes and possible irreversible dehydration of poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates into phyllosilicate clay minerals) promoted intense land degradation. This was in turn enhanced by increasing human activities for settlement and resource exploitation (among which deforestation and ploughing for agriculture), {{which led to a}} shift of the vegetation cover towards a dominant pine forest between 3 kaBP and the Roman epoch. Humid and possibly cooler climatic conditions during the late Holocene are indicated by the decrease of clay illuviation, coupled with short-range order components prevailing over phyllosilicate clays during Roman soil formation...|$|R

The enrichment parallels that for Ir and elemental carbon (soot); all decrease over the next 6 mm of the boundary clay. The C/N ratio, assuming the nitrogen {{to be associated with}} organic rather than elemental carbon, is approximately 5 for the basal layer compared to 20 to 30 {{for the remainder of the}} boundary clay. The correlation between N and Ir abundances appears to persist above the boundary, implying that the N is intimately associated with the primary fallout and remained with it during the secondary redeposition processes that kept the Ir abundance relatively high into the lowermost Tertiary. Apparently the basal {{layer of the}} boundary <b>clay</b> represents the <b>accumulation</b> of a substantial quantity of N with an isotopic composition approximately 10 percent heavier than background delta value of N- 15 values. If the boundary clay represents an altered impact glass from a meteorite impact than it probably denotes a time period of less than 1 year. Therefore, the changes in nitrogen geochemistry apparently occurred over a very short period of time. The high abundance of N and the correspondingly low C/N ratio may reflect enhanced preservation of organic material as a result of the rapid sweepout and burial of plankton by impact ejecta, with little or no bacterial degradation. It is conceivable that the shift in delta value of N- 15 may represent an influx of nitrogen from a different source deposited contemporaneously with the impact ejecta. An interesting possibility is that it may be derived from nitrate, produced from the combustion of atmospheric nitrogen...|$|R

While the influence of soil C content or tillage on aggregation has been documented, much less {{is known about the}} role of soil mineralogy. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine quantitatively if different clay minerals of a temperate soil contribute differently to aggregation and if their contribution is modulated by soil management. We compared the aggregate-size distribution of three cropping systems in a silt loam soil in Versailles (France) : organic cropping system (ORG, tilled yearly), direct seeding mulch-based cropping system (DMC, tilled every 4 years), both from a long-term trial, and a nearby grassland. Soil samples from 0 - 5 cm were wet-sieved to 5 mm and air-dried before aggregate-size separation. For each aggregate class, fraction < 2 Âµm was separated and analysed using X-ray diffraction. Organic C content was determined both in aggregates and < 2 -Âµm fractions. C content was lower in ORG than in the two other treatments. The proportion of large-macroaggregates (500 - 5000 Âµm) was greater in DMC and grassland; while microaggregates (50 - 250 Âµm) showed greater proportions in ORG. In the three treatments, microaggregates had the greatest amount of <b>clays,</b> with preferential <b>accumulation</b> of smectitic phases. In grassland, clays from all aggregated fractions showed more smectitic phases than free-clay fraction. The results indicate that smectitic phases contributed particularly to the microaggregates dynamics. Their contribution to aggregation was lower for larger aggregate sizes where the influence of organic matter was preponderant. Moreover, it was observed that cultivation (ORG and DMC treatments) reduced the relative enrichment of smectitic phases in stable aggregates which makes them more vulnerable to slaking erosion and alters their physico-chemical function...|$|R

40|$|The {{disposal}} of olive mill wastewaters (OMWs) {{is a major}} problem that affects soil and groundwater. Different papers have discussed the effects of OMW discharge on soil characteristics, plant production and phytotoxicity. In this work, a holistic approach is proposed and the main research studies regarding the effects of OMWs on crops and soils are reviewed. Generally, direct application of OMWs exerts a temporary positive effect on soil physical properties. However, in <b>clay</b> soils, the <b>accumulation</b> of salts from these wastewaters could lead to the disintegration of the soil structure. Deterioration of soil structure would decrease the soil hydraulic conductivity, which is a key parameter for determining the volume of OMW that can be spread on a soil. Organic matter (OM) makes up approximately 65 % of the OMW dry weight. Among the soil chemical characteristics, the soil pH remains almost constant following OMW applications. Polyphenols are the most limiting factor for spreading OMWs on soils because of their antimicrobial and phytotoxic effects. Nevertheless, these polyphenols are rapidly degraded depending on environmental conditions. Due to the highly variable chemical composition of the OMWs, these effluents provide variable macronutrient inputs (especially potassium and phosphorus), which potentially reduce necessary fertilizer inputs. Regarding soil microflora, the OMWs exert the following two contrasting actions: stimulating microflora development by temporarily enriching soil carbon and inhibiting certain microorganisms and phytopathogenic agents by adding antimicrobial substances to the soil. For many crops, spreading OMWs benefits crop yield. However, the application of OMWs may also damage germination. Thus, the application of OMWs should adequately precede sowing. The beneficial effects of OMWs on crop yields indicate that these wastewaters may become very important sources of OM and nutrients in agriculture soils and positively impact soil fertility. However, to improve their effectiveness, some use restrictions based on soil characteristics were outlined...|$|R

We present data on clay mineralogy, major element, stable and radiogenic isotope abundances from Lower Miocene-Pleistocene sediments from ODP Leg 116. Nd and Sr isotope {{data show that}} the Himalayan provenance for the eroded material has varied little since > 17 Ma. However, from 7 to 1 Ma smectite replaces illite as the dominant <b>clay,</b> while sediment <b>accumulation</b> decreased, implying an interval of high chemical weathering intensity but lower physical erosion rates in the Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) basin. O and H isotopes in clays are correlated with mineralogy and chemistry, and indicate that weathering {{took place in the}} paleo-Gangetic flood plain. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of pedogenic clays (vermiculite, smectite) record the isotopic composition of Sr in the weathering environment, and {{can be used as a}} proxy for 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in the paleo-GB basin. The Sr data from pedogenic clays shows that river 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values were near 0. 72 prior to 7 Ma, rose rapidly to <= 0. 74 in the Pliocene, and returned to 5 0. 72 in the middle Pleistocene. These are the first direct constraints available on the temporal variability of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in a major river system. The high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values resulted from intensified chemical weathering of radiogenic silicates and a shift in the carbonate-silicate weathering ratio. Modeling of the seawater Sr isotopic budget shows that the high river 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values require a ca. 50 % decrease in the Sr flux from the GB system in the Pliocene. The relationship between weathering intensity, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Sr flux is similar to that observed in modem rivers, and implies that fluxes of other elements such as Ca, Na and Si were also reduced. Increased weathering intensity but reduced Sr flux appears to require a late Miocene-Pliocene decrease in Himalayan erosion rates, followed by a return to physically dominated and rapid erosion in the Pleistocene. In contrast to the view that increasing seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr results from increased erosion, Mio-Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene changes in the seawater Sr budget were the result of reduced erosion rates and Sr fluxes from the Himalaya...|$|R

A soil profile exhibiting strong textural differentiation between surface and subsurface horizons at Keyneton, South Australia, was sampled for {{quantitative and qualitative}} analyses of the processes responsible for development. From constant resistant mineral ratios throughout the profile it was concluded that the soil had formed from uniform parent material, suggesting that pedological processes had heavily influenced formation. Particle size distribution, clay mineralogy determined by XRD, and microstructural features indicated that <b>clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> in the subsurface was accompanied by a greater intensity of weathering in the surface horizons. The presence of void argillans in the B horizon provided strong evidence for the translocation of clay. Mass balance calculations showed significant volumetric expansion and mass gain throughout the entire profile, but greatest in the B horizons. Al, Fe, Na and Si were all gained in large quantities. The results indicate that clay translocation by illuviation is a dominant process in the development of textural differentiation, with some clay likely to have formed in situ. Thesis (B. Sc.

40|$|Complexity theory {{predicts that}} local {{feedback}} processes may strongly affect {{the organization of}} ecosystems on larger spatial scales. Whether complexity leads to increased resilience and stability or to increased vulnerability and criticality {{remains one of the}} dominant questions in ecology. We present a combined theoretical and empirical study of complex dynamics in mineralogenic salt marsh ecosystems that emerge from a positive feedback between <b>clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> and plant growth. Positive feedback induces self-organizing within the ecosystem, which buffers for the strong physical gradient that characterizes the marine-terrestrial boundary, and improves plant growth along the gradient. However, as a consequence of these self-organizing properties, salt marshes approach a critical state as the edge of the salt marsh and the adjacent intertidal flat becomes increasingly steep and vulnerable to wave attack. Disturbance caused, for instance, by a storm may induce a cascade of vegetation collapse and severe erosion on the cliff edge, leading to salt marsh destruction. Our study shows that on short timescales, self-organization improves the functioning of salt marsh ecosystems. On long timescales, however, self-organization may lead to destruction of salt marsh vegetation. [KEYWORDS: emergence; positive feedback; salt marsh development; self-organization...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the soil forming processes of representative vineyard soils, and to discuss the implications on a soil-based viticultural zoning at very detailed scale. The study area is located in Priorat, Penedes and Conca de Barbera viticultural areas (Catalonia, North-eastern Spain). The studied soils belong to representative soil map units determined at 1 : 5, 000 scale, according to Soil Taxonomy classification. The soil forming processes, identified through morphological and micromorphological analyses, have significant effects on some soil properties. For example, the different processes of <b>clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> in soils developed from granodiorites in Priorat or gravel deposits in Conca de Barbera, are primarily responsible for significant differences in clay content, available water capacity and cation exchange capacity. These soils properties, especially those related to soil moisture regime, have a direct influence on vineyard management and grape quality. However, soil forming processes are not always reflected on soil classification, especially in soils modified by man. We show that climate or geology alone cannot be used in viticultural zoning at very detailed scale, unless soil forming processes are taken into account...|$|E

Our results, together with data from 5 cores reported in the literature, show that boundary scavenging {{plays a major role in}} the removal of 1 Â°Be from the Pacific Ocean. Deposition rates of 1 Â°Be at three margin sites are more than an order of magnitude greater than at sites of red <b>clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> in the deep central Pacific. Deposition of 231 pa is 4 to 5 -fold greater at the margin sites. The residence time of 1 Â°Be with respect to chemical scavenging, defined as its inventory in the water column divided by its rate of removal to the sediments, varies regionally from > 1000 years at the red-clay sites in the deep central Pacific to - 100 years at the margin sites. Different factors control boundary scavenging of Pa and Be. For example, scavenging of 231 pa is enhanced by metal-oxide coatings of particles, whereas this seems to have little influence on the scavenging of lÂ°Be...|$|E
40|$|In the Peri-Adriatic Apulia Carbonate Platform (southern ltaly), late Cretaceous karst bauxites mark an {{emergence}} period during a wet tropical climate. Bauxite formed through <b>clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> in the karst, â€˜â€˜in situâ€™â€™ bauxitization and late formation of iron-rich concretions in a water-unsaturated pedogenic environment. The concretions, which are geochemical recorders {{of the environment}} of formation, have a large core of Al-hematite surrounded by a cortex of alternating Al-hematite and boehmite. Boehmite forms instead of Al-hematite at lower water activity values. Using a model of molecular diffusion and assuming the fluid flow negligible, the time necessary for growth of the concretions has been calculated. The average-sized core grew in f 180 ka. The Al-hematite accretionary band grew in f 8 ka whereas the boehmite accretionary band grew in f 4. 5 ka. The average bulk concretions possibly formed in 300 â€“ 400 ka. The growth of the concretions {{is assumed to be}} a two-stage process. In the first stage, the core grew in a relatively long period of wet tropical climate. In the second stage, drier conditions favouring boehmite stability alternated to a wetter climate favouring Al-hematite stability. The growth of the bulk concretions is consistent with the Earthâ€™s long eccentricity cycle...|$|E
40|$|In Nampula province, Mozambique, {{there is}} a high number of water wells {{considered}} as having failed for having too low a pumping yield. Two Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurement campaigns were conducted in the area for evaluating the reasons of failures. However, in some cases it was difficult to verify and interpret the ERT results by only using the inadequate lithological description presented in drilling reports. In this paper the integration of borehole logging and slug testing is presented as a solution to add more information and to enhance the interpretation of ERT models. The borehole logging tool measured resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and natural gamma. The logging results proved that the ERT models are accurate in estimating the resistivity for basement (> 1400 â„¦m), fractured layer (220 â€“ 1400 â„¦m), semi-weathered layer with <b>clay</b> <b>accumulation</b> (10 â€“ 220 â„¦m), and weathered and leached layer (220 â€“ 2700 â„¦m). The slug testing gave results of high hydraulic conductivity (K) values where the ERT indicates well-developed weathered and fractured layers, and low K values where these are less developed. The borehole interpretation can be extrapolated using the ERT model to give a geometric characterization of the aquifer. Therefore, the implementation of the ERT method in groundwater exploration is encouraged...|$|E
40|$|Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 199, "The Paleogene Equatorial Transect" (Sites 1215 - 1222), was {{designed}} to study {{the evolution of the}} equatorial Pacific current and wind system as Earth went from maximum Cenozoic warmth to initial Antarctic glaciations. The drilling program was primarily devoted to a transect along the 56 - to 57 -Ma crust, old enough to capture the Paleocene/Eocene boundary in the basal, more carbonate-rich sediments. The Leg 199 transect extends from a paleolatitude of ~ 4 Â°N- ~ 4 Â°S to encompass a relatively thick lower Eocene sediment section perhaps 8 Â° north of the paleoequator. One site (1218) was also drilled on ~ 40 -Ma crust to collect a near-equatorial sediment sequence from the middle Eocene to the Oligocene in order to investigate the transition in global climate from the Eocene "greenhouse" to Oligocene "icehouse. " The Pacific plate has drifted northward through Cenozoic time transporting biogenic sediments deposited under the high-productivity equatorial belt into a zone of extremely slow sediment (red <b>clay)</b> <b>accumulation.</b> Thus, the central tropical North Pacific Ocean is an ideal region in which to sample shallowly buried Paleogene sequences of equatorially deposited biogenic sediments. The thin Neogene cover of red clay in the area means that the entire Paleogene sediment section is potentially drillable by ODP advanced piston coring and extended core barrel methods...|$|E
