5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} <b>cataloguer</b> at Sotheby's, which {{provided}} him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Chatwin {{moved to}} London {{to begin work}} as a porter in the Works of Art {{department}} at Sotheby's. Chatwin was ill-suited for this job, which included dusting objects that had been kept in storage. Sotheby's moved him to a junior cataloger position working in both the Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. This position enabled him to develop his eye for art, and he quickly became known {{for his ability to}} discern forgeries. His work as a <b>cataloguer</b> also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects. Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby's expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments. Many of Chatwin's colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house.|$|E

5|$|Stearn {{was largely}} self-educated and his widowed mother {{worked hard to}} support him while at school but could not afford a {{university}} education for him, there being no grants available then. When not at the Botany School, he attended evening classes to develop linguistic and bibliographic skills. His classes there included German and the classics. He obtained his first employment {{at the age of}} 18 in 1929, a time of high unemployment, to support himself and his family. He worked as an apprentice antiquarian bookseller and <b>cataloguer</b> in the second-hand section at Bowes & Bowes bookshop, 1 Trinity Street (now Cambridge University Press), between 1929 and 1933 where he was able to pursue his passion for bibliography. During his employment there, he spent much of his lunchtimes, evenings and weekends, at the Botany School and Botanic Garden. This was at a time when botany was thriving at Cambridge under the leadership of Seward and Humphrey Gilbert-Carter.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, the Folger {{commissioned}} Peter Michaels {{to restore}} the portrait. In removing the overpaint, he uncovered the coat of arms, and his assistant Lisa Oehrl made a sketch of it, unaware of the sitter's identity. It was Lilly Lievsay, Folger <b>cataloguer</b> of manuscripts, and Folger curator Laetitia Yeandle who, {{on the basis of}} this drawing, linked the image of the sketch conclusively to the armorial coat of Hamersley. The restorative work also clarified the date, which had been tampered with to yield the year 1611 (when Shakespeare was 47). Beneath the second 1 of that date a 2 is clearly visible, indicating it was executed in 1612, 8 years after Oxford's death, when Hamersley was 47 years old. Above the date is written aetatis suae.47 (aged 47). He had not, at that time, been granted his coat of arms, and art historian William Pressly conjectures that they were either included in anticipation of the honour, or painted in later.|$|E

2500|$|Conder tokens {{are named}} after James Conder {{who was an}} early {{collector}} and <b>cataloguer</b> of these tokens. [...] Building {{on the work of}} Conder and a few other intermediary reference works, the definitive and exhaustive work on attributing Conder tokens used by modern collectors is that of Dalton and Hamer. [...] Each token is identified based on one of four large geographic regions (England, Anglesey and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland), then further by county. Within the county of issue, each unique combination of obverse and reverse design is assigned a number (referred to as the D number), and variations in edge lettering are further differentiated by a lower case letter following the number designation. [...] In general, the tokens are organized within each county such that pennies are listed first (lowest D numbers), then halfpennies, and finally farthings (highest D numbers). [...] It is also quite common for collectors to refer to a token by the specific city, business, or series of the issue within the larger county category. [...] A few tokens were issued in denominations other than the penny, halfpenny, and farthing, and these less common denominations are also indexed in Dalton and Hamer. [...] The vast majority of tokens indexed in D from the period were struck in copper, even those in odd denominations of threepence, one shilling, and others.|$|E

60|$|The first {{complete}} {{satisfaction of}} it was really in the long hours that I spent in the little shop on the quay. There I filled my mind with him, and there too, at no great cost, I could make a big parcel of these cheap reproductions of his work. This work had been shown in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts as it came from his hand; M. Champfleury, his biographer, his <b>cataloguer</b> and devotee, having poured forth the treasures of a precious collection, as I suppose they would be called {{in the case of}} an artist of higher flights. It was only as he was seen by the readers of the comic journals of his day that I could now see him; but I tried to make up for my want of privilege by prolonged immersion. I was not able to take home all the portfolios from the shop on the quay, but I took home what I could, and I went again to turn over the superannuated piles. I liked looking at them on the spot; I seemed still surrounded by the artist's vanished Paris and his extinct Parisians. Indeed no quarter of the delightful city probably shows, on the whole, fewer changes from the aspect it wore during the period of Louis-Philippe, the time when it will ever appear to many of its friends to have been most delightful. The long line of the quay is unaltered, and the rare charm of the river. People came and went in the shop: it is a wonder how many, in the course of an hour, may lift the latch even of an establishment that pretends to no great business. What was all this small, sociable, contentious life but the great Daumier's subject-matter? He was the painter of the Parisian bourgeois, and the voice of the bourgeois was in the air.|$|E
