Although his ability to operate quickly varying processes has been extensively studied, his ability to control slowly varying processes has been largely neglected.

Thus {{the primary goal of}} this study is to investigate man's ability to forecast future values of numerical time series from historical data and to determine how his performance varies with the display modes. The non-stationary time-series model is applied to produce three sets of discrete data corrupted with a high level of white noise.

40|$|Abstract — Power {{has become}} a burning issue in modern VLSI design. In modern {{integrated}} circuits, the power consumed by clocking gradually takes a dominant part. Given a design, we can reduce its power consumption by replacing some flip-flops with fewer multi-bit flip-flops. However, this procedure may affect {{the performance of the}} original circuit. Hence, the flip-flop replacement without timing and placement capacity constraints violation becomes a quite complex problem. To deal with the difficulty efficiently, we have proposed several techniques. First, we perform a co-ordinate transformation to identify those flipflops that can be merged and their legal regions. Besides, we show how to build a <b>combination</b> <b>table</b> to enumerate possible combinations of flip-flops provided by a library. Finally, we use a hierarchical way to merge flip-flops. Besides power reduction, the objective of minimizing the total wirelength is also considered. The time complexity of our algorithm is �(n 1. 12) less than the empirical complexity of �(n 2). According to the experimental results, our algorithm significantly reduces clock power by 20 – 30 % and the running time is very short. In the largest test case, which contains 1 700 000 flip-flops, our algorithm only takes about 5 min to replace flip-flops and the power reduction can achieve 21 %.

40|$|Reducing {{the energy}} {{consumption}} by wireless communication devices {{is perhaps the}} most important issue in the widely-deployed and exponentially-growing IEEE 802. 11 Wireless LANs (WLANs). TPC (Transmit Power Control) and PHY (physical layer) rate adaptation have been recognized as two most effective ways to achieve this goal. The emerging 802. 11 h standard, which is an extension to the current 802. 11 MAC and the high-speed 802. 11 a PHY, will provide a structured means to support intelligent TPC. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called MiSer, that minimizes the communication energy consumption in 802. 11 a/h systems by combining TPC with PHY rate adaptation. The key idea is to compute offline an optimal rate-power <b>combination</b> <b>table,</b> and then at runtime, a wireless station determines the most energyefficient transmission strategy for each data frame by a simple table lookup. Another key contribution {{of this paper is to}} provide a rigorous analysis of the relation among different radio ranges and TPC’s effect on the interference in 802. 11 a/h systems, which justifies MiSer’s approach to ameliorating the TPC-caused interference by transmitting the CTS frames at a stronger power level. Our simulation results show that MiSer delivers about 20 % more data per unit of energy consumption than the PHY rate adaptation scheme without TPC, while outperforming single-rate TPC schemes significantly thanks to the excellent energy-saving capability of PHY rate adaptation...|$|E
40|$|Many {{companies}} use product platforms {{to achieve}} {{economy of scale}} benefits while they simultaneously offer customized product variants. The strategy to realise this is often to share ready designed parts and sub-systems with fixed interfaces between product variants. This strategy provides flexibility, but it {{is limited by the}} bandwidth defined by the fixed parts and sub-systems comprised in the platform. To fulfil new demands on increased variability, redefinition of the platform and/or addition of new platform elements are required. To address this issue Claesson [1] has presented a new way of describing platforms which are built of generic, autonomous and configurable sub-systems called configurable components, CCs. Such systems carry knowledge not only about the finally used part instances, but also about how and why an instance came into being. This makes the product knowledge carried by a CC possible to be reused to configure platform-based variants as well as to develop future designs. Until now the work done on the CC concept has focused on the internal building blocks, i. e. what it needs to consist of in order to work as intended. In short, the focus so far has been on how the product platform can be represented, not the process and methods to create it. This paper addresses this latter issue. An "engineer-to-order" scenario is considered and the design process as well as supporting design methods are emphasised. The results show that well-known concept design methods such as the concept <b>combination</b> <b>table</b> (the morphological matrix) and evaluation matrices can be adopted for redesign of configurable platform system elements representing a whole system family...|$|E
