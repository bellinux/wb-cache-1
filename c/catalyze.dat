5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that <b>catalyze</b> oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can <b>catalyze</b> oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme's name {{is often}} derived from its {{substrate}} or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, {{with the word}} ending in -ase. Examples are lactase, alcohol dehydrogenase and DNA polymerase. Different enzymes that <b>catalyze</b> the same chemical reaction are called isozymes.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are known}} to <b>catalyze</b> more than 5,000 {{biochemical}} reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are catalytic RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.|$|E

First, copper-catalyzed allylic substitutions are conducted with different types of nucleophiles than most allylic substitutions <b>catalyzed</b> by other metals. Second, the regioselectivity of the copper-catalyzed reactions is typically {{different from that of}} reactions <b>catalyzed</b> by complexes of other metals, particularly of reactions <b>catalyzed</b> by complexes of palladium. Thus, this last section of the chapter describes studies on allylic substitution <b>catalyzed</b> by copper, with an emphasis on enantioselective examples...|$|R
40|$|New {{concepts}} are outlined for reductive C–C- C–H-bond formations <b>catalyzed</b> by early transition metals in low oxidation states {{based on the}} use of chlorosilanes, silicon hydrides, or related oxophilic additives as mediators of the catalytic cycles. Amongst other examples, these new protocols account for the first instances of intramolecular carbonyl coupling reactions <b>catalyzed</b> by titanium, Nozaki–Hiyama–Kishi reactions <b>catalyzed</b> by chromium, pinacol couplings <b>catalyzed</b> by titanium, vanadium, or samarium, and reactions of enals or epoxyalkenes <b>catalyzed</b> by "Cp 2 Ti". A similar approach also permits catalysis of Barton–McCombie reductions by Bu 3 SnH...|$|R
5|$|In 1967, Carl Woese {{hypothesized}} that RNA might be catalytic {{and suggested that}} the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to <b>catalyze</b> biochemical reactions—an RNA world.|$|E

40|$|Analysis {{of medium}} chain of fatty acids in coconut oil becomes {{important}} {{due to their}} roles in health issues. The present analysis methods for fatty acids present in food mainly focused to the overall fatty acid concentration. The analytical method for specific medium chain fatty acids {{is not so much}} be given attention. This research is focused to the analytical methods for these particular fatty acids in coconut oil. Several analytical methods were compared including acid <b>catalyzed,</b> basic <b>catalyzed</b> and acid boron trifluoride <b>catalyzed</b> derivatization. The response of each fatty acid toward the derivatization methods are different. Formation of the fatty acid methyl ester from caprylic and capric was low for acid <b>catalyzed</b> method compared to basic <b>catalyzed</b> method and acid boron trifluoride <b>catalyzed</b> methods. This finding shows that the kinetics of the esterification among the fatty acids are not the same. The analysis of all fatty acids in coconut oil is better using basic <b>catalyzed</b> than the other methods...|$|R
5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER {{can also help}} detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually {{involves}} {{the addition of a}} hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which <b>catalyze</b> water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Many {{methods of}} {{decreasing}} the response time of ALFs have been developed. Even {{in the late}} 1980s, certain gases were used to <b>catalyze</b> the decay of the electrons of the vapor cell.

50|$|Dopamine can be metabolized {{into one}} of three {{substance}}s. One such substance is DOPAC. Another is 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT). Both of these substances are degraded to form homovanillic acid (HVA). Both degradations involve the enzymes monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), albeit in reverse order: MAO <b>catalyzes</b> dopamine to DOPAC, and COMT <b>catalyzes</b> DOPAC to HVA; whereas COMT <b>catalyzes</b> dopamine to 3-MT and MAO <b>catalyzes</b> 3-MT to HVA. The third metabolic end-product of dopamine is norepinephrine (noradrenaline).|$|R

No oligoamides, but two other products, were formed from the enzymatic reaction of dimethyl terephthalate and p-xylylenediamine.

5|$|An {{example for}} the fission and fusion {{mechanism}} {{can be found in}} nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases. These are membrane-bound enzymes that <b>catalyze</b> the transfer of a hydride ion between NAD(H) and NADP(H) in a reaction that is coupled to transmembrane proton translocation. They consist of three major functional units (I, II, and III) that can be found in different arrangement in bacteria, protozoa, and higher eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three groups of domain arrangements were acquired and fused independently.|$|E
5|$|H2 is {{a product}} of some types of {{anaerobic}} metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes <b>catalyze</b> the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that <b>catalyze</b> reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E

These enzymes and intact microsomes <b>catalyzed</b> NAD(P) H oxidation in {{the presence}} of either ortho- or polyvanadate. Antibody to P 450 reductase inhibited orthovanadate-dependent NADPH oxidation <b>catalyzed</b> by either purified P 450 reductase or rat liver microsomes and had no effect on the rates of NADH oxidation <b>catalyzed</b> by b 5 reductase. NADPH-cytochrome P 450 reductase <b>catalyzed</b> orthovanadate-dependent NADPH oxidation five times faster than NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase <b>catalyzed</b> NADH oxidation. Orthovanadate-dependent oxidation of either NADPH or NADH, <b>catalyzed</b> by purified reductases or rat liver microsomes, occurred in an anaerobic system, which indicated that Superoxide is not an obligate intermediate in this process. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibited orthovanadate, but not polyvanadate-mediated, enzyme-dependent NAD(P) H oxidation. SOD also inhibited when pyridine nucleotide oxidation was conducted anaerobically, suggesting that SOD inhibits vanadate-dependent NAD(P) H oxidation by a mechanism independent of scavenging Of O 2 minus sign, dot belo...|$|R

30|$|Rhamnolipid {{biosynthesis}} {{is believed}} to be <b>catalyzed</b> by the rhamnosyltransferase 1 chain A (RhlA) and chain B (RhlB) and rhamnosyltransferase 2 (RhlC). RhlA <b>catalyzes</b> the formation of β-hydroxyalkanoyl-β-hydroxyalkanoic acid (HAA) from β-hydroxyacyl-APC or β-hydroxyacyl-CoA (Rehm et al. 1998). RhlB <b>catalyzes</b> the formation of monorhamnolipid from HAA and dTDP-l-rhamnose (Ochsner et al. 1994 a, b). And RhlC <b>catalyzes</b> the formation of dirhamnolipid from monorhamnolipid and dTDP-l-rhamnose (Rahim et al. 2001). Exogenous expression of those genes in E. coli permits synthesis of rhamnolipids (Ernst 1997; Meyer 1994).|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to this metabolic diversity, prokaryotes also possess a range of isozymes– different enzymes that <b>catalyze</b> the same reaction. For example, in E. coli, {{there are two different}} types of ubiquinol oxidase using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Under highly aerobic conditions, the cell uses an oxidase with a low affinity for oxygen that can transport two protons per electron. However, if levels of oxygen fall, they switch to an oxidase that transfers only one proton per electron, but has a high affinity for oxygen.|$|E
5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals <b>catalyze</b> the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E

In March 1945 a Seabee battalion of 1,000 African-American men staged a hunger strike at their base, Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, California, in protest of discriminatory conditions. In the weeks following the latter incident, Fleet Admiral Ernest King and Secretary Forrestal worked with civilian expert Lester Granger on a plan for total integration of the races within the Navy. The Port Chicago disaster had helped <b>catalyze</b> the drive to implement new standards.|$|E
50|$|Valine is {{produced}} by a four-enzyme pathway. It begins with the reaction of two pyruvate molecules <b>catalyzed</b> by Acetohydroxy acid synthase yielding α-acetolactate. Step two is the NADPH+ + H+ - dependent reduction of α-acetolactate and migration of the methane groups to produce α, β-dihydroxyisovalerate. This is <b>catalyzed</b> by Acetohydroxy isomeroreductase. The third reaction is the dehydration reaction of α, β-dihydroxyisovalerate <b>catalyzed</b> by Dihydroxy acid dehydrase resulting in α-ketoisovalerate. Finally, a transamination <b>catalyzed</b> either by an alanine-valine transaminase or a glutamate-valine transaminase results in valine.|$|R

50|$|In humans, {{phenylalanine}} hydroxylase deficiency {{can cause}} phenylketonuria, {{the most common}} inborn error of amino acid metabolism. Phenylalanine hydroxylase <b>catalyzes</b> the conversion of L-phenylalanine to L-tyrosine. Tyrosine hydroxylase <b>catalyzes</b> the rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis: the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA. Similarly, tryptophan hydroxylase <b>catalyzes</b> the rate-limiting step in serotonin biosynthesis: the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan.|$|R
5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can <b>catalyze</b> the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of genes of related function—such as enzymes that <b>catalyze</b> steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E
5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway.

The enzymes that <b>catalyze</b> these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
