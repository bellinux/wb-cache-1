40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{research}} project aimed at assessing whether a particular management process of housing delivery correlates with an improvement or reduction {{in the state of}} development of <b>housing</b> <b>recipients.</b> The construct 'state of development' refers {{to the extent to which}} recipients have the capacity and power to deal with the challenges of a dynamic environment and utilise its opportunities in a responsible and sustainable manner. 'Housing management' refers to the execution of management functions to process housing inputs into outputs. The authors explored the correlation between these two variables in a case study involving the Delft housing project in Cape Town. They measured indicators using questionnaires, an analysis of project data, and by observing and evaluating the environments of experimental group members. The results indicated that the extent of the appropriateness of housing management caused a corresponding change in the state of development of <b>housing</b> <b>recipients.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the long-term effect of project-based housing assistance-public housing and private assisted housing-on work, earnings, and welfare receipt. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Assisted Housing Database to identify women ever living in project-based assisted housing {{and to create}} comparison groups using propensity scores. Analyses show no evidence that moving into this type of assisted housing is associated with sustained reductions in employment rates, work hours, or earnings. Although welfare rates decline, they remain higher for assisted <b>housing</b> <b>recipients</b> compared with nonrecipients. Overall, these findings align with those of recent experimental and nonexperimental studies that include other forms of housing assistance and cover different time periods. © 2009 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Mariano {{took steps}} to convert a number of {{properties}} to be entirely smoke-free. [...] Later that same year, he instituted an innovative program to require public <b>housing</b> <b>recipients</b> under age 50 to either be working full-time or to be in school full-time, or face rent increases. He argued that public housing has become generational, rather than the short-term solution for families that {{it was intended to}} be. Mariano, a former resident of Worcester public housing himself, pitched the program as one that was designed to “make residents self-sufficient and to motivate them to move out of public housing.” [...] The program is already seen as a [...] "public housing revolution" [...] that could be replicated across the country.|$|R

Dong believes that difference, or 70 percent of the county welfare fund, went [...] "directly to the hotel owners in the form of cash payments and capital improvements that they would not otherwise have received." [...] Dong also said that the CNC Program did not actually decrease the numbers of homeless, since in the same year, the numbers of homeless in the surrounding communities swelled commensurately.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{this study}} aims to reframe the common concept of {{post-disaster}} reconstruction 'building back better' especially {{in the context of}} post-disaster housing design. Design/methodology/approach: an Aceh post-tsunami housing reconstruction project is used as a case study with qualitative methodology through in-depth interviews of selected respondents. Findings: the study findings have shown that the term 'building back better' is not a familiar term for <b>housing</b> <b>recipients.</b> Whichever different personal background post-disaster survivors come from, whether they are housewife, civil servant, fisherman, university student, businessman or a professional, none have ever heard this phrase. All found it hard to understand the term. This study argues that the 'building back better' concept is good in policy but not working in practice. As a result, <b>housing</b> <b>recipients</b> were not only dissatisfied with their new houses, but also found that the new housing configurations profoundly altered their traditional way of life. In light of these findings, the paper argues that the concept of 'building back better' needs to be reframed to take account of the cultural individual and communal needs and wants of post-disaster survivors. Research limitations/implications: this study discusses only one aspect of post-disaster reconstruction that is the design of housing reconstruction. Practical implications: results from this study provide a practical contribution for reconstruction actors especially designers, architects and planners. It helps them to reconsider the common concepts they have used for post-disaster reconstruction processes particularly in designing housing reconstruction projects. Originality/value: this study focuses on the question of how tsunami survivors in Aceh reacted to the design of their new post-tsunami houses, and what they had done themselves to make their homes a better and nicer place to live within their own cultural needs. This study also sought to understand what motivated the opinions the respondents had about the design of housing reconstruction after the tsunami in Aceh generally. In addition, the study investigated whether survivors knew the phrase and the credo of 'building back better' in a post-disaster context...|$|R

40|$|The rate of {{employment}} participation {{has been consistently}} lower among <b>housing</b> assistance <b>recipients</b> than non-housing assistance recipients {{over the past two}} decades. In the period 1982 - 2000 employment outcomes among public housing tenants has deteriorated, despite an improving employment outlook for the general working age population during most of the 1990 s. In this paper, we report the findings from the first stage of a collaborative research venture that examines the impacts of housing assistance, that is public housing concessional rents and Commonwealth Rent Assistance, on economic participation outcomes. Research directions that will be followed in the remainder of the collaborative research venture are also outlined in this paper. The first stage of the collaborative research venture comprises four main components. Firstly, <b>housing</b> assistance <b>recipients</b> are profiled against appropriate benchmark groups in the Australian population. Secondly, the contribution of housing assistance programmes to poverty and unemployment traps are measured. Thirdly, data sources that will enable researchers to conduct analysis into the causal links between housing assistance and economic participation are examined. Fourthly, an inventory of housing policy initiatives that encourage economic participation is provided. We find that working age adults eligible for housing assistance generally confront deeper poverty and unemployment traps than other income support <b>recipients.</b> Among public <b>housing</b> tenants concessional rents make a significant contribution to the depth of both poverty and unemployment traps. We also find evidence of multiple barriers to economic participation faced by <b>housing</b> assistance <b>recipients</b> that include lack of access to computers and the Internet, inferior educationa...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} from a natural field experiment designed {{to shed light}} on whether individual behavior is consistent with a neoclassical model of utility maximization subject to budget constraints.

In conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera House, we mailed 25, 000 regular opera attendees a letter describing a charitable fundraising project organized by the opera <b>house.</b> <b>Recipients</b> were randomly assigned into one of five treatments designed to provide ten tests of revealed preference theory. We find that the behavior of at least 80 % of individuals, on both the extensive and intensive margins, can be rationalized within a standard neoclassical choice model in which individuals have preferences defined over own consumption and their contribution towards the charitable good, and their preferences satisfy the axioms of revealed preference. The analysis highlights that in a real world environment in which individuals make simple decisions they are familiar with, standard microeconomic theory works well in explaining observed individual choices...|$|R

40|$|We present {{evidence}} from a natural field experiment designed {{to shed light}} on the efficacy of fundraising schemes in which donations are matched by a lead donor. In conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera House, we mailed 14, 000 regular opera attendees a letter describing a charitable fundraising project organized by the opera <b>house.</b> <b>Recipients</b> were randomly assigned to treatments designed to explore behavioral responses to linear matching schemes, as well as the mere existence of a substantial lead donor. We use the exogenous variation in match rates across treatments to estimate the price elasticities of charitable giving. We find that straight linear matching schemes raise the total donations received including the match value, but partially crowd out the actual donations given excluding the match. If charitable organizations can use lead gifts as they wish, our results show that they maximize donations given by simply announcing the presence of a lead gift. We contrast our price elasticity estimates with those based on changes in rules regarding tax deductions for charitable giving, {{as well as from the}} nascent literature using large-scale natural field experiments on giving.

40|$|As a {{countermeasure}} to the debilitating physiological {{effects of}} weightlessness, astronauts could live continuously in an artificial gravity environment created by slow rotation {{of an entire}} spacecraft or be exposed to brief daily "doses" in a short radius <b>centrifuge</b> <b>housed</b> within a non-rotating spacecraft. A potential drawback to both approaches is that head movements made during rotation may be disorienting and nauseogenic. These side effects are more severe at higher rotation rates, especially upon first exposure. Head movements during rotation generate aberrant vestibular stimulation and Coriolis force perturbations of the head-neck motor system. This article reviews our progress toward distinguishing vestibular and motor factors in side effects of rotation, and presents new data concerning the rates of rotation up to which adaptation is possible. We have studied subjects pointing to targets during constant velocity rotation, because these movements generate Coriolis motor perturbations of the arm but do not involve unusual vestibular stimulation. Initially, reaching paths and endpoints are deviated {{in the direction of}} the transient lateral Coriolis forces generated. With practice, subjects soon move in straighter paths and land on target once more. If sight of the arm is permitted, adaptation is more rapid than in darkness. Initial arm movement trajectory and endpoint deviations are proportional to Coriolis force magnitude over a range of rotation speeds from 5 to 20 rpm, and there is rapid, complete motor adaptation at all speeds. These new results indicate that motor adaptation to high rotation rates is possible. Coriolis force perturbations of head movements also occur in a rotating environment but adaptation gradually develops over the course of many head movements...|$|R

40|$|We present {{evidence}} from a natural field experiment designed {{to shed light}} on the efficacy of alternative fundraising schemes. In conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera House, we mailed 25, 000 regular opera attendees a letter describing a charitable fundraising project organized by the opera <b>house.</b> <b>Recipients</b> were randomly assigned to six treatments designed to explore behavioral responses to fundraising schemes varying in two dimensions: (i) the presence of a lead donor; (ii) whether and how individual donations would be matched using the lead donation. We provide reduced form {{evidence from}} the field experiment on the causal impact of each fundraising scheme on the extensive and intensive margins of giving. We then develop and estimate a structural model of giving behavior that simultaneously estimates individual responses on both margins. We utilize the structural model to predict giving behavior in counterfactual fundraising schemes. The evidence suggests the optimal fundraising scheme is one in which the charitable organization merely announces the existence of a significant and anonymous lead donor, and does not use the lead donation to match donations in any way, be it through linear matching, non-linear matching, threshold matching, or some combination of the three. We conclude by discussing evidence from a follow-up field experiment designed to probe further the question why lead donors are effective...|$|R
