The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E
25|$|Tetrafluoromethane, {{also known}} as <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride,</b> is the {{simplest}} fluorocarbon (CF4). It has a very high bond strength {{due to the nature}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. It can also be classified as a haloalkane or halomethane. Because of the multiple carbon–fluorine bonds, and the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbon in tetrafluoromethane has a significant positive partial charge which strengthens and shortens the four carbon–fluorine bonds by providing additional ionic character. Tetrafluoromethane is a potent greenhouse gas.|$|E
500|$|Five {{nitrogen}} fluorides are known. Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3, first {{prepared in}} 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily {{produced by the}} electrolysis of molten ammonium fluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Like <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride,</b> {{it is not at}} all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with copper, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine (N2F4). The cations [...] and [...] are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride), as is ONF3, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF2•. Fluorine azide (FN3) is very explosive and thermally unstable. Dinitrogen difluoride (N2F2) exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN3.|$|E
2500|$|Haloalkanes {{generally}} {{resemble the}} parent alkanes in being colorless, relatively odorless, and hydrophobic. Their boiling points {{are higher than}} the corresponding alkanes and scale with the atomic weight and number of halides. This {{is due to the}} increased strength of the intermolecular forces—from London dispersion to dipole-dipole interaction because of the increased polarity. Thus carbon tetraiodide (...) is a solid whereas <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (...) is a gas. As they contain fewer C–H bonds, halocarbons are less flammable than alkanes, and some are used in fire extinguishers. Haloalkanes are better solvents than the corresponding alkanes because of their increased polarity. Haloalkanes containing halogens other than fluorine are more reactive than the parent alkanes—it is this reactivity that is the basis of most controversies. Many are alkylating agents, with primary haloalkanes and those containing heavier halogens being the most active (fluoroalkanes do not act as alkylating agents under normal conditions). The ozone-depleting abilities of the CFCs arises from the photolability of the C–Cl bond.|$|E

50|$|The common carbon halides are <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> (CF4), carbon {{tetrachloride}} (CCl4), carbon tetrabromide (CBr4), carbon tetraiodide (CI4), {{and a large}} number of other carbon-halogen compounds.|$|E
50|$|Tetrahalomethanes are on {{the border}} of {{inorganic}} and organic chemistry, thus they can be assigned both inorganic and organic names by IUPAC: tetrafluoromethane - <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride,</b> tetraiodomethane - carbon tetraiodide, dichlorodifluoromethane - carbon dichloride difluoride.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{reactive}} atmospheres {{are also}} in use. Vapors of formic acid and acetic acid are the most commonly used. Carbon monoxide and halogen gases (e.g. <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride,</b> sulfur hexafluoride, or dichlorodifluoromethane) require fairly high temperatures for several minutes to be effective.|$|E
5000|$|Silicoids: John Clark, in the {{introduction}} to the 1952 shared-world anthology The Petrified Planet, outlined the biologies of the planet Uller, with a mixture of siloxane and silicone life, and of Niflheim, where metabolism is based on hydrofluoric acid and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ionization {{processes}} require energy above 10 eV, while splitting {{covalent bonds}} in molecules and generating free radicals requires only 3-4 eV. The electrical discharges {{initiated by the}} ionization events by the particles result in plasma populated by large amount of free radicals. The highly reactive free radicals can recombine back to original molecules, or initiate a chain of free-radical polymerization reactions with other molecules, yielding compounds with increasing molecular weight. These high molecular weight compounds then precipitate from gaseous phase, forming conductive or non-conductive deposits on the electrodes and insulating surfaces of the detector and distorting its response. Gases containing hydrocarbon quenchers, e.g. argon-methane, are typically sensitive to aging by polymerization; addition of oxygen tends to lower the aging rates. Trace amounts of silicone oils, present from outgassing of silicone elastomers and especially from traces of silicone lubricants, tend to decompose and form deposits of silicon crystals on the surfaces. Gaseous mixtures of argon (or xenon) with carbon dioxide and optionally also with 2-3% of oxygen are highly tolerant to high radiation fluxes. The oxygen is added as noble gas with carbon dioxide has too high transparency for high-energy photons; ozone formed from the oxygen is a strong absorber of ultraviolet photons. <b>Carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> {{can be used as}} a component of the gas for high-rate detectors; the fluorine radicals produced during the operation however limit the choice of materials for the chambers and electrodes (e.g. gold electrodes are required, as the fluorine radicals attack metals, forming fluorides). Addition of <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> can however eliminate the silicon deposits. Presence of hydrocarbons with <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> leads to polymerization. A mixture of argon, <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride,</b> and carbon dioxide shows low aging in high hadron flux.|$|E
50|$|The {{systematic}} name fluoride, the valid IUPAC name, is determined {{according to the}} additive nomenclature. However, the name fluoride is also used in compositional IUPAC nomenclature which does not take the nature of bonding involved into account. Examples of such naming are sulfur hexafluoride and <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride,</b> which contain no fluoride ions whatsoever, although they do contain fluorine atoms.|$|E
50|$|Silicon tetrafluoride, {{similar to}} <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> and {{germanium}} tetrafluoride, adopts a molecular tetrahedral structure. SiF4 is stable against heating or electric spark, but reacts with water (even moist air), metals, and alkalies, thus demonstrating weak acidic character. Reactions with organomagnesium compounds, alcohols, amines, and ammonia yield adduction compounds.

50|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is a polar {{covalent}} bond between carbon and fluorine {{that is a}} component of all organofluorine compounds.

50|$|Fires {{with high}} {{availability}} of oxygen burn {{at a high}} temperature and with small amount of smoke produced; the particles are mostly composed of ash, or with large temperature differences, of condensed aerosol of water. High temperature also leads to production of nitrogen oxides. Sulfur content yields sulfur dioxide, or in case of incomplete combustion, hydrogen sulfide. Carbon and hydrogen are almost completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. Fires burning with lack of oxygen produce a significantly wider palette of compounds, many of them toxic. Partial oxidation of carbon produces carbon monoxide, nitrogen-containing materials can yield hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen gas can be produced instead of water. Content of halogens such as chlorine (e.g. in polyvinyl chloride or brominated flame retardants) may lead to production of e.g. hydrogen chloride, phosgene, dioxin, and chloromethane, bromomethane and other halocarbons. Hydrogen fluoride can be formed from fluorocarbons, whether fluoropolymers subjected to fire or halocarbon fire suppression agents. Phosphorus and antimony oxides and their reaction products can be formed from some fire retardant additives, increasing smoke toxicity and corrosivity. Pyrolysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), e.g. from burning older transformer oil, and to lower degree also of other chlorine-containing materials, can produce 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a potent carcinogen, and other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. Pyrolysis of fluoropolymers, e.g. teflon, in presence of oxygen yields carbonyl fluoride (which hydrolyzes readily to HF and CO2); other compounds may be formed as well, e.g. <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride,</b> hexafluoropropylene, and highly toxic perfluoroisobutene (PFIB).|$|E

Attention was focused on three principal characteristics of single component spectra; (1) the line width i. e. the full width at half maximum, (2) the shift in peak frequency relative to that at the triple point and (3) the degree of asymmetry observed in the line shape. Light from Ar⁺ ion laser incident on the sample cell and scattered at 90 ° was analysed by a Fabry-Perot interferometer and recorded by photon counting systems. In case of methane, the line width remains practically constant from the triple point to the boiling point and increases from the boiling point onwards to the critical point, while in case of <b>carbon</b> <b>tetrafluoride</b> the line width is maximum at triple point and decreases up to the boiling point and afterwards remains constant up to the critical point. The observed variation in line width can be explained {{on the basis of}} a hydrodynamic theory of vibrational dephasing due to Hills and Madden.
