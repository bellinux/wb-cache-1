It is a single adult male individual preserved as a compression fossil in the fine-grained lacustrian rock and thus has been flattened from its dimensions in life. The <b>compression</b> <b>specimen</b> was mentioned in publication by Dr. Mark Wilson in his 1977 paper discussing the paleoecology of the Horsefly Lagerstätte fossil sites. P. thaleri was first studied by Paul A. Selden and David Penney, with their 2009 type description being {{published in the journal}} Contributions to Natural History. The generic name was coined by P. Selden and D. Penney as a combination of the Greek word palaios meaning [...] "ancient" [...] and Perenethis, a modern Nursery web spider genus. This is in reference to the age of the type specimen and the African-Asian genus which Palaeoperenethis is similar in appearance to. The specific epithet [...] "thaleri" [...] was designated by P. Selden and D. Penney in honor of the late Dr. Konrad Thaler, past president of the International Society of Arachnology.|$|E

40|$|A new <b>compression</b> <b>{{specimen}}</b> {{was applied}} to woven glass/epoxy laminates. The specimen consists of epoxy layers cast {{on the sides of}} the laminate in order to prevent buckling. Thin sheet Al ends enable alignment and avoid crushing under end loading, which does not require any special fixture. The compression stress-strain behavior of the laminate was obtained from the specimen’s by discounting the previously measured stress-strain curve of the epoxy backings. In spite of the higher scatter in compression tests, the average modulus was practically identical to the tensile modulus. Moreover, failure occurred away from the ends in nearly all of the specimens tested. The average compressive strength was 84 % of the tensile strength and consistent with the flexural strength measured in 4 -point bending tests. The present <b>compression</b> <b>specimen</b> could therefore become an interesting alternative to the more elaborate standard test methods available.

40|$|ABSTRACT—The shear <b>compression</b> <b>specimen</b> (SCS), {{which is}} used for large strain testing, is {{thoroughly}} in-vestigated numerically using three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element simulations. In this {{first part of the}} study we address quasi-static loading. A bi-linear material model is as-sumed. We investigate the effect of geometrical parameters, such as gage height and root radius, on the stress and strain distribution and concentration. The analyses show that the stresses and strains are reasonably uniform on a typical gage mid-section, and their average values reflect accurately the prescribed material model. We derive accurate correlations between the averaged von Mises stress and strain and the applied experimental load and displacement. These relations depend on the specimen geometry and the material proper-ties. Numerical results are compared to experimental data, and an excellent agreement is observed. This study confirms the potential of the SCS for large strain testing of material.

40|$|An {{understanding}} was developed {{of the factors}} that determine the semi-circular edge-notched compressive strength and the associated failure mode(s) were identified of thermoplastic composite laminates with multidirectional stacking sequences. The experimental observations and the detailed literature review suggest at least four factors that affected the determination of the strain levels at which fiber microbuckling initiates and thus, partially control the composite's compression strength. The dependent variables studied are the compressive strength of a reduced gage section <b>compression</b> <b>specimen</b> and the compression strength of a <b>compression</b> <b>specimen</b> with two semi-circular edge notches (no opposite free edges) centered along the gage section. In this research, specimens containing two semi-circular edge notches (no opposite free edges) were loaded in compression at a relatively slow rate to provide more stable development of fiber microbuckling damage. The results indicate that the local constraints (free surfaces, supporting ply orientation, and resin-rich regions) significantly affect the strain level for the initiation of in-plane fiber microbuckling. Preliminary results at an elevated temperature, 77 C, showed the shear stress yield strength of the resin was reduced and consequently, the resistance to fiber microbuckling was also reduced. The finite element analysis of the perfectly straight fiber problem indicates that the free surface effect causes a 10 percent reduction in the critical buckling strain. However, the experimentally measured reduction for fibers with an initial fiber curvature, was 35 percent...|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that MOE exited {{significant}} difference between the specimen compressed in different direction in both Poplar and Chinese fir, and MOR existed {{significant difference between the}} specimens compressed in different compression direction in Chinese fir (Table  1), the mechanical properties showed a slight loss or increase compared with the controlled specimens (Fig.  3, middle). For Chinese fir, MOR and MOE in 45 ° <b>compression</b> <b>specimen</b> showed the maximum value (77.31  MPa and 10.53 GPa), compared with that in tangential (66.44  MPa and 9.06 GPa) and radial (66.32  MPa and 8.98 GPa). During compression, suppose that all the lumen could be totally compressed, the opposite wood cell wall of the same cell is moved to the other cell wall along the compression direction. In 45 ° compression, the movable distance is the diagonal of the nearly rectangle shaped tracheid, which owns the maximum movable distance compared with T and R compression. The compression stress would not obviously increase until the corner of wood cell along compression direction contacts each other. In this way, wood cell wall was well protected. This is probably one reason that the mechanical properties in 45 ° <b>compression</b> <b>specimen</b> showed the maximum value. In addition, the highest density resulted from lowest RR at 45 ° compression compare with 2 other compression directions (Fig.  1) is one more reason that the specimens at 45 ° compression had a maximum mechanical value.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—Part I of {{this work}} {{addressed}} quasi-static load-ing of the shear <b>compression</b> <b>specimen</b> (SCS), which has been especially developed to investigate the shear dominant response of materials at various strain rates. The stress and strain states were characterized numerically. Approximations were presented to reduce the measured load, P, and displace-ment, d, into equivalent stress σ̂eq and strain ε̂eq. This paper addresses dynamic loading of the SCS. Several simulations were made for representative materials, whose stress–strain behavior {{is assumed to be}} rate-independent. The results show that stress wave loading induces strong oscillations in the P − d curve. However, the σ̂eq − ε̂eq curve remains smooth in the gage section. The oscillations are about the quasi-static load values, so that with suitable filtering of the dynamic P−d curves, the quasi-static ones are readily recovered. Con-sequently, the approach that was developed for quasi-static loading of the SCS is now extended to dynamic loading situ-ations. The average strain rate is rather constant and scales linearly with the prescribed velocity. As the plastic modulus be-comes smaller, the strain rate reaches higher values. Friction at the end pieces of the specimen is also investigated, and shown to have a small overall influence on the determined mechanical characteristics. This paper thereby confirms the potential of the SCS for large strain testing of materials, us-ing a unified approach, over a large range of strain rates in a seamless fashion.
