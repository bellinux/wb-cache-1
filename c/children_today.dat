5|$|The breed was {{originally}} developed for general {{use on the}} farms of the Appalachian foothills, where it was found pulling plows and buggies, working cattle and being ridden by both adults and <b>children.</b> <b>Today,</b> it is still used for working cattle, as well as endurance riding and pleasure riding. The breed's gait and disposition make it sought out by elderly and disabled riders. Each September, the Kentucky Horse Park hosts the International Rocky Mountain Horse Show.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the common}} people, who have {{suffered}} from high child mortality, children were often given amyeong (childhood name), to wish them long lives by avoiding notice from the messenger of death. These sometimes-insulting nicknames are used sparingly for <b>children</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|While {{speakers}} {{without an}} Anabaptist background in general do not pass the dialect to their <b>children</b> <b>today,</b> the Old Order Amish and horse-and-buggy Old Order Mennonites {{do so in}} the current generation and there are no signs that this practice will end in the future. There are only two car driving Anabaptist groups who have preserved the dialect: The Old Beachy Amish and the Kauffman Amish Mennonites, also called Sleeping Preacher Churches. Even though Amish and Old Order Mennonites were originally a minority group within the Pennsylvania German-speaking population, today they form the vast majority. According to sociologist John A. Hostetler, less than 10 percent of the original Pennsylvania German population was Amish or Mennonite.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} 'Full Circle' {{summarizes the}} change in the women's view of equality on the kibbutz. The original Utopian goal of the founders was complete gender equality. Children lived in the children's houses. Freed from domestic duties, women participated in the industrial, agricultural and economic sectors alongside men. However, in the 1960s, {{while the rest of the}} Western world demanded equality of the sexes and embraced feminism, the second generation of kibbutz born women began to return to more traditional gender roles. They rejected the ideal achieved by their grandparents and returned to domestic duties such as cooking, cleaning and taking care of <b>children.</b> <b>Today,</b> most women do not participate in the economic and industrial sectors of the kibbutz. They even embraced traditional marriage.|$|E
25|$|The logo for {{the company}} showed Fun Ho! in a script like form within an oval that {{included}} an odd portrait of a clown-like face that looks {{kind of like a}} laughing child with a beanie cap...or...a yelling oriental martial arts specialist. The riddle is solved when looking at a company catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company Christmas cards once upon a time (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an advertising gimmick, the design would probably would not work well with <b>children</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{environment}} in which the Inuit lived inspired a mythology filled with adventure tales of whale and walrus hunts. Long winter months of waiting for caribou herds or sitting near breathing holes hunting seals gave birth to stories of mysterious and sudden appearance of ghosts and fantastic creatures. Some Inuit looked into the aurora borealis, or northern lights, to find images of their family and friends dancing in the next life. However, some Inuit believed that the lights were more sinister and if you whistled at them, they would come down and cut off your head. This tale is still told to <b>children</b> <b>today.</b> For others they were invisible giants, the souls of animals, a guide to hunting and as a spirit for the angakkuq to help with healing. They relied upon the angakkuq (shaman) for spiritual interpretation. The nearest thing to a central deity was the Old Woman (Sedna), who lived beneath the sea. The waters, a central food source, were believed to contain great gods.|$|E

2500|$|The Archbishop of Cologne's {{forces were}} wiped out {{by the forces of}} the count of Berg who were {{supported}} by citizens and farmers of Cologne and Düsseldorf, paving the way for Düsseldorf's elevation to city status, which is commemorated today by a monument on the Burgplatz. The custom of turning cartwheels is credited to the children of Düsseldorf. There are variations of the origin of the cartwheeling <b>children.</b> <b>Today</b> the symbol (Der Radschläger) represents the story and every year the Düsseldorfers celebrate by having a cartwheeling contest. After this battle the relationship between the four cities deteriorated, because they were commercial rivals; it is often said that {{there is a kind of}} hostility between the citizens of Cologne and Düsseldorf. Today, it finds its expression mainly in a humorous form (especially during the Rhineland Karneval) and in sports.|$|E

[...] In addition, the couple has been allowed the type of physical intimacy not previously allowed between same-sex couples within the series.

2500|$|Barbara Bush's {{cause as}} First Lady was family literacy, {{and she called}} it [...] "the most {{important}} issue we have". She became involved with many literacy organizations, served on literacy committees and chaired many reading organizations.

She continues to be dedicated to eliminating the generational cycle of illiteracy in America by supporting programs where parents and their young children are able to learn together.
