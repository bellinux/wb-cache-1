40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, the {{synthesis}} of new pyridine bis(imine) ligands modified with halogens (Cl, Br, CF 3) or alkyl groups (Heptyl, tert-butyl, Phenyl, [...] .) is reported. When coordinated with iron or <b>cobalt</b> <b>dichloride,</b> they yielded complexes which were associated to methylaluminoxane (MAO) to achieve the polymerization of ethylene. It was shown that cobalt catalysts are generally {{more sensitive to the}} ligand substitutions than the iron ones. The addition of a chlorine atom on the ligand frame is generally unfavorable. On the contrary, the presence of a bromine atom seems more favorable. Phenyl rings lead to almost completely inactive catalysts, probably because of a too weak coordination to the metal. It was also demonstrated that a mono-substitution of the aryl groups with an electron-withdrawing group (-CF 3) is sufficient to yield polymers, whereas, considering the bulkiness of this substituent only, oligomers would have been expecte...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} or physico-chemical methods available {{for studying the}} various properties of chemical compounds. These methods can be conveniently classified into classes which {{are determined by the}} purpose of the investigation. Those used to elucidate molecular structure fall into two classes. The first, which includes x-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction yields detailed information about the whole structure of the molecule. These techniques introduce a metrical element into the understanding of the complex, revealing the lengths of the chemical bonds, the angles between them, and other structural details such as the various forms of isomerism in the topological and conformational arrangements of polydentate ligands about the metal centre. The second gives fragmentary information concerning individual bonds of a particular group of atoms in the molecule. This class includes optical rotatory dispersion, circular dichrosism, the measurement of electric and magnetic moments, and various kinds of spectroscopy of the region ranging from microwave to ultraviolet. The last two groups should yield information mostly {{in the area of the}} electronic structure of the molecule. The last group covers vibrational spectroscopy which originates in the vibrations of the nuclei constituting a molecule. Vibrational spectra are observed both as infrared and Raman spectra, and the frequencies of the vibrational transitions are determined by the masses of the constituent atoms, the molecular geometry and the interatomic forces. The intensities of infrared and Raman spectra are related to the changes in dipole moment and polarisability, respectively. Attempts have been made to analyse the vibrational spectra quantitatively. Though there has been some success, work on many aspects (such as intensity in relation to bonding) is sparse. Nevertheless, the understanding of the molecular and the electronic structure of some molecules can be much extended by employing a combination of methods. This thesis consists of two main sections. The first describes the vibrational spectral studies of diarsine complexes. Most of the spectral work is centred around the low infrared frequency region. Raman spectra of two complexes are reported and characterised by their metal-ligand sensitive absorptions. The frequencies of these assignments are used to calculate the frequencies of the infrared active metal-ligand vibrations. The frequencies assigned to the metal-ligand vibration of diarsine complexes are analysed in terms of the change in electronic configuration of the transition element. It is hoped that the inferences obtained from the vibrational may elucidate the bonding in these complexes. These results are checked against those derived from the data given in x-ray and electron spin resonance (e. s. r.) spectral studies. The second main section gives a description of the crystal and the molecular structure of <b>cobalt</b> triethylenetetramine glycinato <b>dichloride,</b> - 2 '-(RS) -(Co(trien) (gly)) Cl 2. H 2 O. It belongs to a series of cobalt(III) polyamino compounds containing asymmetric nitrogen centres. These polyamino complexes can display various forms of isomerism in their topological and confrontational arrangements. The reasons for the study of this particular complex are many, and are given in the Introduction to Crystal Studies. However, the primary reason is that precise molecular geometry is of great importance as a check on the predicted molecular geometry derived from energy minimisation techniques...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{describe}} the synthesis of two new pyridine-bis(imine) s { 4 -chloro- 2, 6 -bis[1 -(2, 6 -diisopropylphenylimino) ethyl]pyridine and 2, 6 -bis[1 -(2, 6 -dimethylcyclohexylimino) ethyl]pyridine} and their complexation with iron and <b>cobalt</b> <b>dichloride.</b> The solid-state structure of the iron complexes was solved and found to be very close to catalysts already described by Brookhart and Gibson. Their ability to polymerize ethylene was investigated after activation with MAO. It was thus shown that the substitution of the pyridine ring of the ligand is unfavorable: their catalytic activity is rather low. The replacement of the aromatic rings on the imine functions by dimethylcyclohexyl rings resulted in a complete loss of activity of the iron complex for oligomerization and polymerization of ethylene. With the cobalt analog, polymerization of ethylene could be achieved under the same conditions. ((c) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{population-based}} {{epidemiological data}} relating to occupational contact allergies in the Chinese clothing industry are limited. To investigate {{the prevalence of}} occupational allergic contact dermatitis (OACD) and to identify the causative allergens among clothing employees in China, a cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 529 clothing employees at 12 clothing factories in Beijing. All employees were subjected to an interview using self-administered questionnaire and skin examination, and those who were diagnosed with occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) were patch tested. In the present survey, we found that the overall 1 -year prevalence of OACD among the clothing employees was 8. 5 %. The 1 -year prevalence of OACD among workers (10. 8 %) was significantly higher than that among managers (3. 2 %). The lesions were primarily on the hands and wrists in workers, but the face and neck in managers. The major allergens were nickel sulfate and <b>cobalt</b> <b>dichloride</b> in workers and colophony and p-tert-butylphenol formaldehyde resin in managers. In conclusion, workers are at a higher risk of OACD compared with managers in the Chinese clothing industry. In addition to hand dermatitis in workers, airborne contact dermatitis on the face and neck should be also addressed in managers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Malaria rapid {{diagnostic}} tests (RDTs) are protected from humidity-caused degradation by a desiccant {{added to the}} device packaging. The present study assessed malaria RDT products for the availability, type and design of desiccants and their information supplied in the instructions for use (IFU). Methods Criteria were based on recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Community (CE) and own observations. Silica gel sachets were defined as self-indicating (all beads coated with a humidity indicator that changes colour upon saturation), partial-indicating (part of beads coated) and non-indicating (none of the beads coated). Indicating silica gel sachets were individually assessed for humidity saturation and (in case of partial-indicating silica gels) {{for the presence of}} indicating beads. Results Fifty malaria RDT products from 25 manufacturers were assessed, 14 (28 %) products were listed by the “Global Fund Quality Assurance Policy” and 31 (62 %) were CE-marked. All but one product contained a desiccant, mostly (47 / 50, 94 %) silica gel. Twenty (40 %) RDT products (one with no desiccant and 19 with non-indicating desiccant) did not meet the WHO guidelines recommending indicating desiccant. All RDT products with self- or partial-indicating silica gel (n[*]=[*] 22 and 8 respectively) contained the toxic <b>cobalt</b> <b>dichloride</b> as humidity indicator. Colour change indicating humidity saturation was observed for 8 / 16 RDT products, at a median incidence of 0. 8 % (range 0. 05 %- 4. 6 %) of sachets inspected. In all RDTs with partial-indicating silica gel, sachets with no colour indicating beads were found (median proportion 13. 5 % (0. 6 % - 17. 8 %) per product) and additional light was needed to assess the humidity colour. Less than half (14 / 30, 47 %) IFUs of RDT products with indicating desiccants mentioned to check the humidity saturation before using the test. Information on properties, safety hazards and disposal of the desiccant was not included in any of the IFUs. There were no differences between Global Fund-listed and CE marked RDT products compared to those which were not. Similar findings were noted for a panel of 11 HIV RDTs that was assessed with the same checklist as the malaria RDTs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{coordination}} of two heterofunctional P,P,S ligands of the N-functionalized DPPA-type bearing an alkylthioether or arylthioether N-substituent, (Ph 2 P) 2 N(CH 2) 3 SMe (1) and (Ph 2 P) 2 N(p-C 6 H 4) SMe (2), respectively, toward <b>cobalt</b> <b>dichloride</b> was investigated {{to examine the}} influence of the linker between the PNP nitrogen and the S atoms. The complexes [CoCl 2 (1) ] 2 (3) and [CoCl 2 (2) ] 2 (4) have been isolated, and 3 was shown by X-ray diffraction to be a unique dinuclear, zwitterion containing one CoCl moiety bis-chelated by two ligands 1 and one CoCl 3 fragment coordinated by the S atom of a thioether function. The FT-IR, UV-vis, and EPR spectroscopic features of 3 were analyzed as the superposition of those of constitutive fragments identified by a retrosynthetic-type analysis. A similar approach provided insight into the nature of 4 for which no X-ray diffraction data could be obtained. A comparison between the spectroscopic features of 4 and of its constitutive fragments, [CoCl(2) 2]PF 6 (7) and [H 2 '] 2 [CoCl 4] (8) (2 ' = NH 2 (p-C 6 H 4) SMe), and between those of 4 and 3 suggested that 4 could either have a zwitterionic structure, similar to that of 3, or contain a tetrahedral dicationic bis-chelated Co center associated with a CoCl 4 dianion. Magnetic and EPR studies and theoretical calculations were performed. Doublet spin states were found for the pentacoordinated complexes [CoCl(1) 2]PF 6 (5) and 7 and anisotropic quadruplet spin states for the tetrahedral complexes [CoCl 3 (H 1 ') ] (6) (1 ' = NH 2 (CH 2) 3 SMe) and 8. A very similar behavior was observed for 3 and 4, consisting in the juxtaposition of noninteracting doublet and quadruplet spin states. Antiferromagnetic interactions explain the formation of dimers for 6 and of layers for 8. The EPR signatures of 3 and 4 correspond to the superposition of low-spin nuclei in 5 and 7 and high-spin nuclei in 6 and 8, respectively. From DFT calculations, the solid-state structure of 4 appears best described as zwitterionic, with a low-spin state for the Co 1 atom...|$|E
