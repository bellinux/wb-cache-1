40|$|Restraints {{are a part}} {{of nursing}} {{education}} and is considered an essential skill which generally requires competency <b>checkoffs</b> in most educational programs and patient care facilities. Restraints may be mechanical or chemical, however, the focus of this presentation will be on mechanical restraints and determining the best practice for patient safety in restraint use through the exploration of evidence found in research. Nursing actions that may have the potential to compromise patient safety warrants further investigation. Since restraints serve a purpose in patient care, the goal is for the hospital policy to better reflect sound nursing practice and provide patient safety without further endangering the patient. The current hospital policy provides sufficient guidelines for restraints in nursing care, however, improvements to the policy may help protect both patients and nurses. Areas in which the current policy will be expounded through further research include: when to apply restraints, how to apply restraints, monitoring the patient, documentation of restraints, and post-restraint evaluation...|$|R
25|$|Seventh, some {{scholars}} {{point out that}} the Beck ruling may lead to unanticipated outcomes. At least one commentary on Beck concludes that Beck rights, if successfully implemented, may lead large numbers of workers to resign from a union during a strike. These workers will be able to continue to work during a strike (incurring none of the disadvantages a strike brings), and yet will still be able to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining (assuming the strike is successful and an agreement is negotiated). The strike is the most powerful weapon unions have, and undermining the union's ability to strike would put labor unions at a distinct disadvantage in collective bargaining. The NLRB and Supreme Court have acknowledged the role that agency fee payers can play in undermining strikes. In NLRB v. Textile Workers Union, 409 U.S. 213 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled that once a union member had resigned, the union could not punish that worker for crossing picket lines. And in Pattern Makers' League v. NLRB, (as noted above) the Court said unions must permit members to resign at any time. Decisions like these have informed the NLRB's rulings on the issue as well. The Board found that an employer did not commit an unfair labor practice when it distributed notices to employees prior to a strike that outlined an employee's rights during a strike (including the right to become an agency fee payer and cross picket lines). The Board also held that, once a single employee has inquired about their right to become an agency fee payer, it is legal for an employer to notify all workers about this right. But {{in the absence of an}} employee-initiated iniquiry, it is not, the Board says, legal for employers to approach striking workers and ask them to become agency fee payers. The negative implications of widespread worker resignation from unions prior to or during a strike is clear, some argue. This may be changing, however, as more unions turn away from strikes and toward comprehensive campaigns. It is also unclear how Beck may impact dues <b>checkoff</b> (an agreement between the employer, union, and employee under which the employer agrees to deduct union dues directly from the employee's paycheck and turn it over to the union). In 1991, the NLRB held that dues <b>checkoff</b> agreements create an obligation to pay dues in the same way that becoming a union member does. It is possible that Beck and subsequent rulings could also undermine dues <b>checkoff</b> agreements.|$|E

40|$|Using a multi-market {{equilibrium}} displacement model (EDM) framework, {{the precision}} of market parameters (elasticities) measured using econometric methods, can be combined with prior beliefs from economic theory, to calculate how precisely changes in producer welfare from generic advertising are estimated. This EDM approach enables the benefits and costs of simulated small changes in the <b>checkoffs</b> and advertising on producer welfare to be measured. To calculate the associated precision for changes in producer welfare measures, Monte Carlo integration is used, in a Bayesian approach, imposing inequality restrictions from theory, to generate empirical posterior distributions {{of the changes in}} producer welfare measures. These empirical distributions can be used to place confidence intervals around the posterior means and to test whether estimates are statistically significantly different from zero. Alternatively, the probability that a welfare measure change is greater than zero can be calculated, which may serve to even be more informative.

5000|$|Congress has {{permitted}} {{producer groups}} to make <b>checkoffs</b> mandatory, and this aspect has generated legal challenges by some producers, who contend they must pay taxes for activities {{they would not}} underwrite voluntarily. The U.S. Supreme Court United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 412 (2001) ruled that the mushroom check-off violated the Constitutional free speech provisions (First Amendment), creating uncertainty {{about the future of}} other check-offs. Since then, separate lower federal courts have ruled that various check-offs also are unconstitutional. However, on May 23, 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that the beef check-off does not violate the First Amendment. In its decision, Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association and Nebraska Cattlemen v. Livestock Marketing Association (Nos. 03-1164 and 03-1165), a majority of the Court agreed with check-off defenders that the programs are in fact [...] "government speech" [...] (an issue that was not considered in the mushroom decision)."Compelled funding of government speech does not alone raise First Amendment concerns,"..."Citizens may challenge compelled support of private speech, but have no First Amendment right not to fund government speech." [...] Most legal observers predict that this decision will be used to defend other challenges to check-offs.|$|R
2500|$|On December 20, 2005, another strike occurred. Workers {{walked off}} at 3 a.m. and the NYCTA stopped operating. Later that day, State Supreme Court Justice Theodore Jones warned the transit union {{that there would}} be a fine of $1 million for each day the TA is shut down. Also for each day the workers missed during the strike they would be fined two days pay. Ultimately, the Judge fined the union $2.5 million, charged {{employees}} two days' wages for every day they were out on strike, and imposed individual fines on the union’s officers. [...] Most significantly, the courts indefinitely suspended the Union’s dues <b>checkoff</b> and refused to restore it for nearly 18 months. The strike was over by December 23, after several contract negotiations; the original contract, agreed to by Local 100 and the Transit Authority as a result of the strike, was ultimately imposed on both parties by an arbitrator. More than four months after the strike ended, the courts imposed a brief jail term on Local 100 President Toussaint for his role in the strike.|$|E
2500|$|Other Supreme Court rulings since Lehnert {{have focused}} more {{narrowly}} on technical issues. [...] In Air Line Pilots Association v. Miller, 523 U.S. 866 (1998), the Supreme Court {{addressed the issue}} of whether non-members must use the union's arbitration process in order to challenge the calculation of agency fees. In a 7-to-2 decision, the Court held that agency fee payers did not have to exhaust the union's challenge procedures. The same year, the Court {{addressed the issue of}} whether a union committed an unfair labor practice if its collective bargaining agreement contained the original NLRA language on union shops but no additional information (such as information about the Supreme Court's rulings in Beck and other cases). A unanimous Supreme Court held in Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild, 525 U.S. 33 (1998) that a union did not breach its duty of fair representation by merely including the language of the NLRA, as amended. The Marquez Court relied heavily on its ruling in NLRB v. News Syndicate Co., 365 U.S. 695 (1961), where it had previously held that the NLRB had no authority invalidate a contract clause solely because the clause mirrored statutory language but did not go further to advise members to not violate the law. About a decade later, the high court revisited the agency fee issue three more times. [...] It upheld in Davenport v. Washington Education Association, 551 U.S. 177 (2007), a Washington state ballot initiative which required public employee unions to obtain each member's and nonmember's prior authorization before spend their dues or agency fees for election-related purposes. The decision was moot even before it was handed down, because the Washington State Legislature had already changed the law {{to make it easier for}} unions to comply. The ruling was very narrowly decided, however, leading to much criticism. [...] "Correctly understood, this decision promises little and delivers even less because it fails to deal decisively and comprehensively with the issues that both earlier private sector and public sector union dues disputes illuminated but failed to settle." [...] Other legal scholars expressed dismay that the Davenport Court did not confront the First Amendment issues raised by the case. A year later, in Locke v. Karass, 07-610 (2008), the Supreme Court held that it was not unconstitutional for a local union to charge nonmembers for national litigation expenses unrelated to local collective bargaining activities. In 2009, the Supreme Court held in Ysursa v. Pocatello Education Association, 07-869 (2009), that a state's refusal to agree to dues <b>checkoff</b> did not abridge a union's First Amendment rights.|$|E
