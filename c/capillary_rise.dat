40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{capillary}} effects in laser-engraved grooves filled with ordinary liquids and self-rewetting fluids, i. e. dilute aqueous solutions of high carbon number alcohols that show surface tension minima versus temperature. Two different geometries of grooves have been realized and investigated, with triangular and trapezoidal sections. The research activity {{has been focused}} on the experimental study of <b>capillary</b> <b>rising</b> in both types of grooves, using pure and self-rewetting liquids with well characterized surface tension and contact angle properties. In particular, self-rewetting fluids exhibit improved wettability, especially on aluminium surfaces, in comparison to water; {{this is a very important}} property to guarantee inflow into micro-channels. Using theoretical models available in the recent literature <b>capillary</b> <b>rising</b> has been predicted in the capillary structure for of the different fluids, including Ethanol and self-rewetting solutions of Water-Butanol at several concentrations. The experiments carried out using Ethanol show a good agreement with the theoretical predictions; on the contrary, in the case of self-rewetting solutions, higher values of experimental <b>capillary</b> <b>rising</b> eights are obtained. In the latter case, when evaporation occurs, the concentration of the more volatile component is reduced and the surface tension increases. This effect may be the main responsible of the higher <b>capillary</b> <b>rising</b> of the self rewetting solutions. In addiction, the difference in surface tension, caused by evaporation of the more volatile component, causes a Marangoni flow towards the region with a lower alcohol concentration. The coupled effect of increasing capillary pressure at liquid-vapour interface and the inverse Marangoni flow could justify the experimental results. Numerical simulations are carried out to explain the different phenomena...|$|R

The layers are fabricated with the Flame-Spray-Pyrolysis process and consist of aggregated TiO 2 nanoparticles. Measurements {{of the pore}} structure reveal that these layers {{have a very high}} porosity and a broad pore size distribution. Imbibition experiments show a deviation of the {{imbibition process}} from the classical <b>capillary</b> <b>rising</b> theory (Bell, Cameron, Lucas and Washburn). Therefore, a new <b>capillary</b> <b>rising</b> model is developed that accounts for the complex pore structure within layers of aggregated particles through the implementation of the fractal dimension of tortuosity. Comparison of the new model and the performed imbibition experiments enable the determination of the equivalent pore diameter for the imbibition process. The resulting pore diameter agrees well with the mean pore diameter of the nitrogen physisorption measurements. Hence, the new model enables the prediction of the imbibition process into highly porous layers of aggregated particles...|$|R

25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal <b>capillary</b> <b>rise</b> in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E

40|$|Salt {{crystallisation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} harmful decay problems in porous materials. Especially ancient building and archaeological sites can show very intense damage (e. g. detachment and pulverization of the materials) that produce a strong loss of matter and so cultural identity. Mainly hypogea show salt crystallisation due to <b>capillary</b> <b>rising.</b> However also anthropic sources like pollution or cement can be found in these sites producing decay. Sodium sulphate is very common where there is the combination between cement and pollution. This salt is very harmful for porous materials due to his high crystallization pressure and the possibility to change to anhydrous phase to hydrated one. When microclimatic variations occur due to semi-confined environment, phase transitions of sodium sulphate take place with consequence on porous material decay. This research studied sodium sulphate crystallisation on a Mediterranean biomicritic limestone and the action of crystallisation inhibitors to mitigate it. The early Christian burial of Munazio Ireneo was studied to understand sodium sulphate crystallisation in biomicritic limestone. Diagnostic investigation and microclimatic monitoring were carried out to understand decay phenomena. The hypogeum is a semi-confined environment and high damage can be found due to phase transition of sodium sulphate. Crystallisation of a Mediterranean biomicric limestone was also studied in laboratory by XRD, OM, SEM, MIP and NMR analysis. Crystallisation inhibitors were tested on the limestone in sodium sulphate solution <b>capillary</b> <b>rising.</b> Two different inhibitors were applied with two distinct system (immersion and poultice). XRD, MIP and SEM analysis were carried out to understand the modification of the inhibitor on the stone microstructure. The loss of material was evaluated to understand the effect of the inhibitors comparing the loss of material in the blank sample. A greater loss of material than the blank sample was found when the first inhibitor was applied through both of the system; the second inhibitor had a minor loss of material but chromatic variations could be found on the stone...|$|R

The phase field obeys the Cahn-Hilliard equation. The fluid dynamics is described with the Stokes equations with an additional source term in the momentum equation {{taking into account the}} capillary forces. A discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is used to solve the coupled Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard equations. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is treated as a system of two coupled equations corresponding to the advection-diffusion equation for the phase field and a non-linear elliptic equation for the chemical potential. First, the variational formulation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation is presented. A numerical test is achieved showing the optimal-order in error bounds.

Carbonate occurrences within the upper Miocene-Pliocene deposits forming the subsidence basins surrounded by the Kırşehir massive, are described as caliche. These caliche deposits in the alluvial fan-meandering river and lacustrine environments are found in three different zones. In the measured, sections, conglomerate comprises the basement and is overlain by a transition zone made of sandy mudstone (Zone I). Above them is the rarely nodular carbonaceous zone with horizontal and vertical positions in the reddish mudstone-siltstone (Zone II). Finally, laminated caliche (calcrite) comprises the upper most part (Zone III). Carbonates in the basement, country rocks, and in the soil are dissolved in the acidic environment and become a solution saturated with calcium bicarbonate. This solution is transported to the sediments and <b>capillary</b> <b>rises</b> through the sediments during arid-semi arid seasons.

Following, the use of tracers is considered for the study of pollutant sources and migration, including neoformation minerals (that might also constitute markers of environmental conditions) and chemical tracers, giving special attention to isotopic tracers, namely to proposals regarding the use of some stable and radioactive isotopes for the study of pollutants that have strong potential but have not been tested yet are also presented.

40|$|The Early Christian Munazio Ireneo cubicle in Cagliari (Sardinia) is {{carved into}} the rock {{and is one of}} the rare monuments of Sardinia {{belonging}} to Early Christian Age. It is 166 Â cm under the planking level and is a semi-confined chamber in which a gate allows exchange with the outside. In 1888, when it was discovered, it was completely painted, but over the years, it suffered a serious damage and all the paintings are nearly disappeared. Now the site shows a high moisture and a differential damage characterised by delamination, powdering, salt crystallisation and biological colonisation. The research offers a multidisciplinary approach to study the salt crystallisation damage, which is a phenomenon still not completely understood today. Studies and analyses highlight that different kinds of damage can be recognised. The cement mortar and the air pollution cause crystallisation of the sulphates. Constant <b>capillary</b> <b>rising</b> and the presence of water infiltration due to the rains, which travelled into the site from the vault, were detected during qualitative inspection. Although the microclimate did not change much in the site and the humidity was almost constant during the monitoring period, the variations in temperature allowed the phase transitions of sodium sulphate, especially in summer.

40|$|The {{cutaneous}} microcirculation {{is organized}} as two horizontal plexuses. One is situated 1 – 1. 5 [*]mm below the skin {{surface and the}} other is at the dermal–subcutaneous junction. Ascending arterioles and descending venules are paired as they connect the two plexuses. From the upper layer, arterial <b>capillaries</b> <b>rise</b> to form the dermal papillary loops that represent the nutritive component of the skin circulation. There are sphincter-like smooth muscle cells {{at the point where the}} ascending arterioles divide to form the arteriolar component of the upper horizontal plexus. At the dermal–subcutaneous junction, there are collecting veins with two cusped valves that are oriented to prevent the retrograde flow of blood. Laser Doppler flowmetry has demonstrated vasomotion of red cell flux localized to the sites of ascending arterioles. The simultaneous recording by laser Doppler flowmetry of red cell flux and the concentration of moving red blood cells from individual sites allows one to construct topographic maps of these two values. These two maps, based on initial studies using correlative skin biopsies, can define 1 mm 3 volumes of skin that are predominantly arteriolar in composition, venular in composition, or essentially devoid of all microvascular elements. The electron and light microscopic features that define the microvascular segments, when coupled with that ability of laser Doppler flowmetry to define the predominant microvascular segments under the probe, allow one to study both the mechanisms of normal physiologic states and the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying pathologic skin disorders in which the microvasculature plays a predominant role...|$|R
40|$|The {{components}} of the building envelopes have to provide performances of different types: {{it is supposed to}} resist to the weather agents, to have a good water vapor permeability in order to prevent some degradation phenomena, and to inhibit the <b>capillary</b> <b>rising</b> dampness. But it must also maintain all these features over the time, in other words it must have a high durability. The designers, when they have to choose finishing solutions, are put in front of very complex evaluations, with the aim of finding the most appropriate one, given the specific context stress factors. To provide a useful guide for those frequent situations, two Departments of University of Naples Federico II conducted combined tests in the laboratories and on the field, on four types of finishing solutions (plaster + painting) for tuff masonry, which is typical of Southern Italy. In the DICMAPI laboratory the specimens were subjected to tests of water absorption by capillarity, tests of water vapor permeability, tests of water absorption at a low pressure, and tests of accelerated aging in a QUV machine. The field assessments were carried out on 500 sampled buildings in the city of Naples, over 10 years of monitoring, showing the different behavior of the four types of selected specimens: for example, the characteristics of the finishing solutions of macroporous plaster + silicate paint and cement plaster + quartz paint have remained almost the same, without significant performance decay.

40|$|The {{interfacial}} tension of immiscible liquids {{is an important}} thermophysical property that is useful {{in the behavior of}} liquids both in microgravity (Martinez et al. (1987) and Karri and Mathur (1988)) and in enhanced oil recovery processes under normal gravity (Slattery (1974)). Many techniques are available for its measurement, such as the ring method, drop weight method, spinning drop method, and capillary height method (Adamson (1960) and Miller and Neogi (1985)). Karri and Mathur mention that many of the techniques use equations that contain a density difference term and are inappropriate for equal density liquids. They reported a new method that is suitable for both equal and unequal density liquids. In their method, a capillary tube forms one of the legs of a U-tube. The {{interfacial tension}} is related to the heights of the liquids in the cups of the U-tube above the interface in the capillary. Our interest in this area arose from a need to measure small interfacial tension (around 1 mN/m) for a vegetable oil/silicon oil system that was used in a thermocapillary drop migration experiment (Rashidnia and Balasubramaniam (1991)). In our attempts to duplicate the method proposed by Karri and Mathur, we found it quite difficult to anchor the interface inside the capillary tube; small differences of the liquid heights in the cups drove the interface out of the capillary.

The method is based on the combined <b>capillary</b> <b>rises</b> of both liquids in the tube...|$|R
