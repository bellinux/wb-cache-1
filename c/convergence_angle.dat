Using this technique for catalytic materials has been especially beneficial – the improved signal-to-noise ratios now allow for detection of quantities of some elements as small as a single atom, giving a complete picture of particle size distribution. Wider probe-forming apertures θ used in aberration-corrected STEMs also result in reduced depth of field (Δz = λ/θ 2), making it possible to optically section through a sample, similar to widefield optical microscopy. For modern C 3 - and C 3, C 5 -corrected instruments, <b>convergence</b> <b>angles</b> are in the rage of 20 to 35 mrad or more, resulting in the depth of field of low single nanometers (in amorphous and off-axis media).

Whenever original surveys made {{on the surface of the}} Earth need to be reduced to a mapping reference surface, surveyed distances and angles (azimuths) need to be corrected.

40|$|Two-photon {{fluorescence}} microscopy {{is a powerful}} method for many applications. Because of the ability of strong attenuation of the background fluorescence, total internal reflection {{fluorescence microscopy}} (TIRFM) has been the major technique in the fluorescence imaging and single molecule detections. Recently, we have developed {{a new type of}} TIRFM called scanning TIRFM (henceforth abbreviated STIRFM) which combines the advantages of two-photon fluorescence microscopy and TIRFM [2]. In this system, a high numerical aperture objective is illuminated by a collimated wave and it is thus focused through an interface between a glass cover slip and a sample. An evanescent wave can be produced immediately below the interface due to the total internal reflection caused by the rays of <b>convergence</b> <b>angles</b> larger than the critical angle. The propagating wave produced by the rays of low <b>convergence</b> <b>angles</b> can be suppressed by apodising the objective. As a result, an evanescent focal spot can be formed and an image can be recorded by scanning the sample. This type of STIRFM has higher transverse resolution than conventional TIRFM because of the tight confinement of the evanescent field. Compared with far-field fluorescence microscopy, it has a better suppression of background fluorescence, as its imaging depth is less than 100 nm. The enhancement of the longitudinal polarization at the evanescent focus is also proved useful in fluorescence polarization microscopy. Furthermore, with a highly focused beam, it is ppossible to induce a non-linear effect such as two-photon absorption (see Fig. 1) at the focus.
