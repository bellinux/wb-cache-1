Typical plots of pressure, temperature, and area ratios as functions of Mach number are given. From the plots, {{it can be seen}} that there exists a range of reservoir conditions that require the gas to be treated as nonideal if an accurate solution is to be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Data are {{presented}} for two-phase critical flow through nozzles. Test results from two <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> and two separate test facilities are in excellent agreement. The critical flow rate and critical flow pressure ratio data conclusively {{demonstrate that the}} principle of corresponding states {{can be applied to}} two-phase choked flow through nozzles. Normalizing parameters were developed to correlate these data, and current theories can provide an adequate means for extrapolating to other fluids.

5000|$|It {{uses the}} Venturi {{effect of a}} <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> on a steam jet to convert the {{pressure}} energy of the steam to velocity energy, reducing its pressure to below atmospheric which enables it to entrain a fluid (eg. water). After passing through the convergent [...] "combining cone", the mixed fluid is fully condensed releasing the {{latent heat of evaporation}} of the steam which imparts extra velocity to the water. The condensate mixture then enters a divergent [...] "delivery cone" [...] which slows the jet, converting kinetic energy back into static pressure energy above the pressure of the boiler enabling its feed through a non-return valve.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, to {{accelerate}} a flow to Mach 1, a nozzle must {{be designed to}} converge to a minimum cross-sectional area and then expand. This type of nozzle - the <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> - is called a de Laval nozzle after Gustaf de Laval, who invented it. As subsonic flow enters the converging duct and the area decreases, the flow accelerates. Upon reaching the minimum area of the duct, {{also known as the}} throat of the nozzle, the flow can reach Mach 1. If the speed of the flow is to continue to increase, its density must decrease in order to obey conservation of mass. To achieve this decrease in density, the flow must expand, and to do so, the flow must pass through a diverging duct. See image of de Laval Nozzle.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, a {{class of}} thermal spray {{processes}} called high velocity oxy-fuel spraying was developed. A mixture of gaseous or liquid fuel and oxygen is fed into a combustion chamber, where they are ignited and combusted continuously. The resultant hot gas at a pressure close to 1 MPa emanates through a <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> and travels through a straight section. The fuels can be gases (hydrogen, methane, propane, propylene, acetylene, natural gas, etc.) or liquids (kerosene, etc.). The jet velocity at the exit of the barrel (>1000 m/s) exceeds the speed of sound. A powder feed stock is injected into the gas stream, which accelerates the powder up to 800 m/s. The stream of hot gas and powder is directed towards the surface to be coated. The powder partially melts in the stream, and deposits upon the substrate. The resulting coating has low porosity and high bond strength.|$|E

50|$|A {{stationary}} normal {{shock wave}} {{is classified as}} going in the normal direction of the flow direction. For example, when a piston moves at a constant rate inside a tube, sound waves that travel down the tube are produced. As the piston continues to move, the wave begins {{to come together and}} compresses the gas inside the tube. The various calculations that come alongside of normal shock waves can vary due {{to the size of the}} tubes in which they are contained. Abnormalities such as <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> and tubes with changing areas can affect such calculations as volume, pressure, and Mach number.|$|R
40|$|The RPLUS 2 D code, {{capable of}} calculating high speed {{reacting}} flows, {{has been adopted}} to design a compressible shear layer facility. In order to create reacting shear layers at high convective Mach numbers, hot air streams at supersonic speeds, render by <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles,</b> must be provided. A finite rate chemistry model is used to simulate the nozzle flows. Results are compared with one-dimensional, chemically equilibrium solutions. Additionally, a two equation turbulence model with compressibility effects has been successfully incorporated with the RPLUS code. The model {{has been applied to}} simulate a supersonic shear layer. Preliminary results show favorable comparisons with the experimental data...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{interesting}} that the exit pressure [...] is able to be greater than the receiver pressure [...] Nature allows this by providing the streamlines of a gas {{the ability to make}} a sudden change of direction at the exit and expand to a much greater area resulting in a reduction of the pressure from [...] to [...] The case of a <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> allows a supersonic flow to occur, providing the receiver pressure is sufficiently low. This is shown in Fig. 9.6 assuming a constant reservoir pressure with a decreasing receiver pressure. If the receiver pressure is equal to the reservoir pressure, no flow occurs, represented by curve [...] If pr is slightly less than p_0, the flow is subsonic throughout, with a minimum pressure at the throat, represented by curve B. As the pressure is reduced still further, a pressure is reached that result in M =1 at the throat with subsonic flow throughout the remainder of the nozzle.There is another receiver pressure substantially below that of curve C that also results in isentropic flow throughout the nozzle, represented by curve D; after the throat the flow is supersonic. Pressures in the receiver in between those of curve C and curve D result in non-isentropic flow (a shock wave occurs in the flow) and will be considered in the next section. If pr is below that of curve D, the exit pressure pe is greater than pr. Once again, for receiver pressures below that of curve C, the mass flux remains constant since the conditions at the throat remain unchanged. It may appear that the supersonic flow will tend to separate from the nozzle, but just the opposite is true. A supersonic flow can turn very sharp angles, since nature provides expansion fans that do not exist in subsonic flows. To avoid separation in subsonic nozzles, the expansion angle should not exceed 10°. For larger angles, vanes are used so that the angle between the vanes does not exceed 10°.|$|E
40|$|AbstractNozzle {{effects on}} thrust and inlet {{pressure}} of a multi-cycle air-breathing pulse detonation engine (APDE) are investigated experimentally. An APDE with 68 mm {{in diameter and}} 2 050 mm in length is operated using gasoline/air mixture. Straight nozzle, converging nozzle, <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> and diverging nozzle are tested. The results show that thrust augmentation of <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle,</b> diverging nozzle or straight nozzle is better than that of converging nozzle on the whole. Thrust augmentation of straight nozzle is worse than those of <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> and diverging nozzle. Thrust augmentations of diverging nozzle with larger expansion ratio and <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> with larger throat area range from 20 % to 40 % on tested frequencies and are better than those of congeneric other nozzles respectively. Nozzle effects on inlet pressure are also researched. At each frequency it is indicated that filling pressures and average peak pressures of inlet with diverging nozzle and <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> with large throat cross section area are higher than those with straight nozzle and converging nozzle.

Thrust measurements of two <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> with an area ratio of 140 and an orifice plate flowing unheated nitrogen and hydrogen were taken over a wide range of vacuum facility pressures and nozzle throat Reynolds numbers. In the Reynolds number range of 2200 to 12 000 there was no discernable viscous effect on thrust below an ambient to total pressure ratio of 1000.

40|$|Isentropic {{expansion}} of subsonic-supersonic moist steam flow in 1 D <b>converging–diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> is studied numerically. The equilibrium thermodynamic {{model has been}} used to predict moisture generation. To discretize the convective terms, Roe’s density-based scheme has been used. For dry regions, the pressure (p), temperature (T), and velocity (u) are extrapolated to cell faces by the MUSCL approach using a third-order upwind-biased scheme, while in wet regions T, u and the quality (χ) are used for extrapolation purposes. Pressure in moist regions is, therefore, equated to saturation pressure at the local temperature. The Roe-averaged value at the cell faces is obtained based on mixture (liquid + vapor) properties at the sides of the cell faces.

40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of the effect of}} wall roughness on turbulent flows is important in many engineering applications. The roughness can affect both skin-friction and pressure drag through such factors as the thrust ratios, discharge coefficients, and static pressure distributions. The effect of roughness height on the performance of two-dimensional, <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> is studied computationally. It is observed that while the total thrust decreases as the wall roughness increases, there is a tradeoff between the losses associated with the shock system and those associated with the skin-friction. However, the normalized skin-friction coefficient is seen to be virtually independent of the Mach number variation. An empirical correlation is proposed to fit the observed variation of skin-friction coefficient {{as a function of the}} roughness height...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} static conditions to determine the internal performance effects of nozzle throat contouring, the result of increasing the circular-arc throat radius. Five nonaxisymmetric <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> were tested at nozzle pressure ratios up to 9. 0. Data are presented as internal thrust ratios, discharge coefficients, and static-pressure distributions. Comparisons of internal performance data for the five nozzles show that throat contouring increases the value of discharge coefficient but has no significant effect on internal thrust ratio except in cases of internal flow separation. To illustrate {{the use of the}} two dimensional converging-diverging (2 -D C-D) nozzle data base, a two dimensional inviscid theory was applied to the five configurations.

A blowdown system was designed, built, and used for conducting the experiments. This system included a special test section containing a unique <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzle</b> system designed for this investigation.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} {{for the two}} phase choked flow of three cryogenic fluids - nitrogen, methane, and hydrogen - in four <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The data cover a range of inlet stagnation conditions, all single phase, from well below to well above the thermodynamic critical conditions. In almost all cases the nozzle throat conditions were two phase. The {{results indicate that the}} choked flow rates were not very sensitive to nozzle geometry. However, the axial pressure profiles, especially the throat pressure and the point of vaporization, were very sensitive to both nozzle geometry and operating conditions. A modified Henry-Fauske model correlated all the choked flow rate data to within + or - 10 percent. Neither the equilibrium model nor the Henry-Fauske model predicted throat pressures well over the whole range of data. Above the thermodynamic critical temperature the homogeneous equilibrium model was preferred for both flow rate and pressure ratio. The data of the three fluids could be normalized by the principle of corresponding states...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} intense sound {{radiation}} from supersonic jets {{is a concern}} for both civil and military applications. As a result, many experimental and computational efforts are focused at evaluating possible noise suppression techniques. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is utilized in many computational studies to simulate the turbulent jet flowfield. Integral methods such as the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) method are then used for propagation of the sound waves to the farfield. Improving the accuracy of this two-step methodology and evaluating beveled <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> for noise suppression are the main tasks of this work. First, a series of numerical experiments are undertaken to ensure adequate numerical accuracy of the FWH methodology. This includes an analysis of different treatments for the downstream integration surface: with or without including an end-cap, averaging over multiple end-caps, and including an approximate surface integral correction term. Secondly, shock-capturing methods based on characteristic filtering and adaptive spatial filtering are used to extend a highly-parallelizable multiblock subsonic LES code to enable simulations of supersonic jets. The code is based on high-order numerical methods for accurate prediction of the acoustic sources and propagation of the sound waves. Furthermore, this new code is more efficient than the legacy version, allows cylindrical multiblock topologies, and is capable of simulating nozzles with resolved turbulent boundary layers when coupled with an approximate turbulent inflow boundary condition. Even though such wall-resolved simulations are more physically accurate, their expense is often prohibitive. To make simulations more economical, a wall model is developed and implemented. The wall modeling methodology is validated for turbulent quasi-incompressible and compressible zero pressure gradient flat plate boundary layers, and for subsonic and supersonic jets. The supersonic code additions and the wall model treatment are then utilized to simulate military-style nozzles with and without beveling of the nozzle exit plane. Experiments of beveled <b>converging-diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> have found reduced noise levels for some observer locations. Predicting the noise for these geometries provides a good initial test of the overall methodology for a more complex nozzle. The jet flowfield and acoustic data are analyzed and compared to similar experiments and excellent agreement is found. Potential areas of improvement are discussed for future research. ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{measuring}} the single-cycle impulse from detonation tubes with nozzles {{were conducted by}} hanging the tubes in a ballistic pendulum arrangement within a large tank. The detonation-tube nozzle and surrounding tank were initially filled with air between 1. 4 and 100 kPa in pressure simulating high-altitude conditions. A stoichiometric ethylene–oxygen mixture at an initial pressure of 80 kPa filled the constant-diameter portion of the tube. Four diverging <b>nozzles</b> and six <b>converging–diverging</b> <b>nozzles</b> were tested. Two regimes of nozzle operation were identified, depending on the environmental pressure. Near sea-level conditions, unsteady gas-dynamic effects associated with the mass of air contained in the nozzle increase the impulse as much as 72 % for the largest nozzle tested over the baseline case of a plain tube. Near vacuum conditions, the nozzles quasi-steadily expand the flow, increasing the impulse as much as 43 % for the largest nozzle tested over the baseline case of a plain tube. Competition between the unsteady and quasi-steady-flow processes in the nozzle determine the measured impulse as the environmental pressure varies...|$|R

Correction of the CNT for non-isothermal nucleation conditions is applied to experimental, simulated and the derived experimental data. The derived experimental rate data follow a similar temperature trend as the nucleation rate data for water vapour in carrier gases at lower temperatures.
