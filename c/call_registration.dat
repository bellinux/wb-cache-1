30|$|The request methods is {{the typical}} number of packets {{generated}} during a <b>call</b> <b>registration.</b> The call setup and tear down times {{can be calculated}} based on the packets captured using Wireshark. For our protocol, the call setup merely requires 8.2005 Seconds. This is the time taken to establish IPSec tunnel and SIP Registration. IPSec tunnel establishment requires 5.786 Seconds, and SIP registration takes 2.4145 Seconds. In contrast to our protocol, the two-pass IMS-AKA requires 4.528 Seconds, after IPSec tunnel establishment. Despite propagation delays and processing delays, the user would enjoy remarkable reduction in authentication delay, if deployed in mobile networks. Detailed performance evaluation and analysis is presented in Section “Overhead in Security Policy”.|$|E

The traditional input mode of separate hall <b>call</b> <b>registration</b> and the destination selection is improved to a single-input mode. On this basis, dynamic partition method in up-peak traffic is studied. This method means dynamically adjust division of floor region based on flow rate {{and distribution of}} passenger. Dynamic programming algorithm is used to solve this problem. Through regroupment and classification for ensemble of hall call communication, prediction of multi-objective evaluation items is proposed. Fuzzy Neural Network is constructed and applied further to realize the optimal scheduling policy. Simulated {{results show that the}} presented elevator model is effective and the optimized scheduling algorithm has advantaged improvement for overall performance of elevator system.

40|$|Methods of {{balancing}} <b>call</b> <b>registration</b> and paging are developed in this paper. Given that the probability distribution on the user location {{as a function}} of time is either known or can be calculated, previous work shows the existence of lower bounds on the average cost of paging. Here these bounds are used in conjunction with a Poisson incoming-call arrival model to formulate the paging/registration optimization problem in terms of timeout parameters, ø m; the maximum amount of time to wait before registering given the last known location was m. Timer-based methods, as opposed to location-based methods, do not require the user to record and process location information during the time between location updates. This feature might be desirable for minimizing mobile transceiver use during idle periods. We then consider uniform motion processes where a spatial translation of starting location produces an identical spatial translation of the associated time-varying probability distributio [...] ...|$|E

A fully automatic registration method is used that requires only gridded data, so the features in the model state {{do not need to be}} identified by the user. The morphing EnKF operates on a transformed state consisting of the registration mapping and the residual. Essentially, the morphing EnKF uses intermediate states obtained by morphing instead of linear combinations of the states. ...|$|R

The method, <b>called</b> <b>Registration</b> Efficiency and Accuracy through Learning a Metric on Shape (REALMS), is designed to support real-time IGRT. In a previously developed version of REALMS, the method interpolated 3 D deformation parameters for any credible deformation in a deformation space using a single globally-trained Riemannian metric for each parameter. We propose a refinement of the method in which the metric is trained over a particular region of the deformation space, such that interpolation accuracy within that region is improved.
