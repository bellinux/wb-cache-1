In the Upper Region {{along the border}} with Upper Volta now named Burkina Faso, a total of 185 clay-core dams were constructed in 15 years to enhance village water supplies during the 6 -month dry season. In a concentrated area of N. E. Ghana (now the Upper East Region) no fewer than 104 dams were erected in only 3 years. The beneficial impacts of the dams are indisputable, and life today would be unthinkable without them, despite severe problems of neglect of maintenance. Equally undeniable has been a negative disease impact whereby the regional rate of schistosomiasis tripled in 1 or 2 years from 17 % to 51 % prevalence. Thus, an agriculturally induced hyperendemicity of "red water" or "bloody urine" disease was established. To test the longevity of community disease impact, a survey of hematuria (bloody urine) was conducted in the same areas in 1997. It showed a 40 -year ecological entrenchment of elevated levels of schistosomiasis, that is, seemingly permanent alteration of regional disease ecology. The consequences of planning negligence have left a generational impact in that hematuria has become a "rite of passage" for young boys and girls. Unprepared and overburdened rural health care systems are ill-equipped in the face of competing demands to respond to the presence of schistosomiasis.

40|$|Electoral {{systems are}} known to be {{powerful}} shapers of electoral politics, but little research has considered their consequences for campaign finance. Focusing on systems fostering within-list or within-party competition, I make several arguments. Chapter 1 argues that these systems affect the likelihood that disclosure regulations extend to individual candidates (and not simply political parties). Electoral rules affect the degree to which individual candidates become objects of attention and/or active campaigners and thus also the 'demand' for the revelation and control of candidates' political finances. My detailed survey of the disclosure regulations for 44 countries supports the theory. Chapter 2 argues that within-list competition does not necessarily foster campaign spending because it may diminish the supply of contributions. Chile is a case in point. I develop a model of the Chilean campaign finance marketplace, and the theory's main result is that candidates who are competitive only vis-à-vis their own listmates are relatively unattractive to contributors. An analysis of the official disclosure reports of candidates in the 2005 Chamber of Deputies elections supports the theory. The analysis focuses on candidates' campaign income because this best illustrates the effect of market forces. Chapter 3 argues that the effects of campaign spending cannot be understood as simply the amount of votes 'purchased' per dollar; it also takes votes from competitors, and the effects can vary based on the identity of the competitor. Electoral systems matter because they affect incentives for <b>campaign</b> <b>coordination,</b> in which teammates target their campaigns at different voter groups, which also reduces the extent to which coordinators' expenditures detriment one another. Consequently, across electoral systems there is variation in the degree of intrateam coordination and so too in the degree to which spending affects intrateam versus interteam contests. The theory is supported with spending effects estimates for Chilean and Irish elections. The final two chapters discuss methodological issues in estimating campaign effects for multi-candidate elections. Chapter 4 considers a dyadic approach for estimating within-team and between-team effects. Chapter 5 considers regression specification problems when the number of candidates per district varie...|$|E

Bush, to endorse him. When queried about the commercial, Jeb Bush protested that “He didn’t know brother was doing that” and was “righteous in making sure there’s no coordination.” Given the nature of their relationship, some have found it difficult to believe that Jeb Bush had no role or influence in recruiting his brother to make the ad, and thus, contravened <b>campaign</b> finance <b>coordination</b> rules.|$|R

40|$|Outbreaks of measles {{continue}} to be a common occurrence among refugee and famine-affected children in emergency relief camps. Extremely high measles-associated mortality rates have been reported from refugee camps [...] where undernutrition is common [...] in several countries over the past 10 years. Mortality from measles is, however, preventable, and immunization against the disease is a high priority in emergency relief programmes, second only in importance to the provision of adequate food rations. All children aged 6 months to 5 years should be immunized with measles vaccine as soon as they enter an organized camp or settlement. Should supplies of measles vaccine be inadequate, children in feeding centres, or those otherwise identified as undernourished, are the top priority for immunization. The occurrence of measles in a camp is not a contraindication to conducting an immunization <b>campaign.</b> Strong <b>coordination</b> by a designated lead agency is needed if such campaigns are to be successful; however, cooperation with the local expanded programme on immunization is essential to ensure that existing cold chain equipment, training protocols, and management manuals are used.

Such uncertainties are attributable to three major factors: limitations in the spatial and temporal resolutions of the satellite observations used to quantify emissions, modeling parameters and assumptions, and the unique geographic characteristics of NSSA. It is recommended that field <b>campaigns</b> involving synergistic <b>coordination</b> of ground‐based, airborne, and satellite measurements with modeling be conducted in major and complex biomass burning regions such as the NSSA, and that significant improvements in the spatial and temporal resolutions of observation systems needed to reduce uncertainties in biomass burning characterization be seriously considered in future satellite missions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{summarizes}} the current policy of vaccination for influenza in the Netherlands. The {{department of the}} Chief Medical Officer of Health recommends vaccination of limited risk groups. Old age, without further medical indication, is {{not considered to be}} a risk factor. The vaccination coverage of the recommended risk groups is estimated to be about 30 %. This estimate cannot be confirmed since there are no detailed (age specific) prevalence figures on these risk factors, as there are no figures on the number of vaccins distributed in the Netherlands. In the current opinion, vaccination for influenza {{is considered to be a}} task of the general medical practitioner. This view is shared by the Influenza Vaccination Support Committee, as stated in this report. Computerized record systems in Dutch general practices would facilitate the determination of the actual size of the risk groups. Such systems would also facilitate vaccination campaigns among risk groups. In the Netherlands initiatives for implementing these systems are taken. Until computerized record systems are established in general practices, general medical practitioners should be supported in achieving a better vaccination coverage. A major role is to be played by the local health authorities Government, health insurances, patient platforms, local health authorities and drug companies could all take part in information <b>campaigns,</b> with appropriate <b>coordination.</b> Renewed efforts aimed at improved influenza vaccination coverage should join locally existing initiatives.

40|$|NASA Earth science {{research}} utilizes both spaceborne and airborne real time observations {{in the planning}} and operations of its field <b>campaigns.</b> The <b>coordination</b> of air and space components is critical to achieve the goals and objectives and ensure the success of an experiment. Spaceborne imagery provides regular and continual coverage of the Earth {{and it is a}} significant component in all NASA field experiments. Real time visible and infrared geostationary images from GOES satellites and multi-spectral data from the many elements of the NASA suite of instruments aboard the TRMM, Terra, Aqua, Aura, and other NASA satellites have become norm. Similarly, the NASA Airborne Science Program draws upon a rich pool of instrumented aircraft. The NASA McDonnell Douglas DC- 8, Lockheed P 3 Orion, DeHavilland Twin Otter, King Air B 200, Gulfstream-III are all staples of a NASA's well-stocked, versatile hangar. A key component in many field campaigns is coordinating the aircraft with satellite overpasses, other airplanes and the constantly evolving, dynamic weather conditions. Given the variables involved, developing a good flight plan that meets the objectives of the field experiment can be a challenging and time consuming task. Planning a research aircraft mission within the context of meeting the science objectives is complex task because it is much more than flying from point A to B. Flight plans typically consist of flying a series of transects or involve dynamic path changes when "chasing" a hurricane or forest fire. These aircraft flight plans are typically designed by the mission scientists then verified and implemented by the navigator or pilot. Flight planning can be an arduous task requiring frequent sanity checks by the flight crew. This requires real time situational awareness of the weather conditions that affect the aircraft track. Scientists at the University of Alabama-Huntsville and the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center developed the Waypoint Planning Tool, an interactive software tool, that enables scientists to develop their own flight plans (also known as waypoints) with point-and-click mouse capabilities on a digital map draped with real time satellite imagery. The Waypoint Planning Tool has further advanced to include satellite orbit predictions and seamlessly interfaces with the Real Time Mission Monitor which tracks the aircraft s position when the planes are flying. This presentation will describe the capabilities and features of the Waypoint Planning Tool highlighting the real time aspect, interactive nature and the resultant benefits to the airborne science community...|$|R

The development of this Waypoint Planning Tool demonstrates the significance of mission support in responding to the challenges presented during NASA field campaigns. Analyses during and after each campaign helped identify both issues and new requirements, initiating the next wave of development. Currently the Waypoint Planning Tool has gone through three rounds of development and analysis processes.

40|$|Nearly {{five years}} have passed since the {{political}} upheaval that swept through many Middle East and North African (MENA) countries began. Syria was caught in the grip of this revolutionary moment, one that drove the country to a civil war with no apparent way out. Analysts advanced a number of explanations for this event, which included the demographic profile of the younger generations and the economic difficulties they experienced, corruption of the government, the use of techniques from successful <b>campaigns</b> and the <b>coordination</b> of dissent through traditional/offline and new/online forms of contention. The employment of the new media by anti and pro-government groups has reached an unthinkable scale, {{to the point that the}} media have become instruments not limited to the purpose of informing, planning and coordinating the protest, but “performing” in the conflict, exacerbating the fight, instilling fear in the enemy and intimidating the adversary, while proselytising. By going beyond the dichotomy that frames the media as a deus ex machina of the uprising or, conversely, as a means of its expression, this thesis demonstrates how the new media did not simply play a crucial role at the time of the uprising and subsequent civil war, but an even more decisive role in the years that predated the uprising. The underlining argument of this research is that during the decade leading up to the uprising in Syria a (silent) form of mobilisation got underway as an effect of contextual factors (economic, institutional and social conditions), conditioned by people’s access to the new media. The new media became the mobilising structures of Syria’s pre-uprising social movement, the tools that changed people’s access to information and encouraged civic engagement in a period of structural friction and social ferment. The media are here contemplated as a microcosm, which affects and is affected by other different, hitherto unrelated (f) actors. Ultimately, in light of the growing popular mobilisations that are taking place around the globe and the leading role that the new media technologies are playing within these, the thesis offers perspectives of analysis on the role that the new media technologies are offering citizens to contest political authority as well as opposing social and economic inequalities worldwide...|$|R

He noted that after the revolution, they were allowed to celebrate the festival within the premises of the principal mosque in the presence of senior government officials. He also alluded to the fact that Ethiopian Muslims had long been prevented from taking part in national affairs and discriminated against in education, administration and the army. Finally, he called upon the government to grant land for the construction of a new mosque in the capital.In the succeeding years he was elected as a member of the national Šängo (parliament). He attended many international conferences (including one on world peace and disarmament/détente held the USSR), Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Libya, Algeria and other countries. He also took part in an interreligious seminar organized by the government and held from 28 to 30 March 1978 at which he “…expressed appreciation of the fact that Islam had been placed on an equal footing with other religions in Ethiopia.” Sheikh Muhammad Tānī played a crucial role in facilitating the construction of mosques in and outside Addis Abäba, and the establishment and expansion of orphanages by personally endorsing applications for financial and material assistance submitted to him, and approaching Ethiopian Muslim and foreign philanthropists and organizations.Sheikh Muhammad Tānī’s contribution to public and community service was as impressive and outstanding as his accomplishments in Islamic religious scholarship and preaching. He played an active role in transforming the Anwar Mosque from a venue for only formal ritual services into a centre of a vigorous, organized and vibrant social, intellectual and spiritual life and of theological and legal discourse based on consensus, tolerance and legitimacy of diversity and dissent, thereby setting a trend for, and impacting, the wider Muslim community in the country at large. orphanages by personally endorsing applications for financial and material assistance submitted to him, and approaching Ethiopian Muslim and foreign philanthropists and organizations.|$|R

Health promotion and social marketing practitioners as well as researchers are beginning to use Web 2. 0 to market health-related behaviour change. As the prevalence of Web 2. 0 usage increases, and its nature changes, over time there are areas which warrant research examination, such as: reasons for Web 2. 0 growth and adoption, the characteristics which draw different target audiences to Web 2. 0 platforms, {{as well as the}} best practices that researchers and practitioners should consider when using new media channels to market health-related behaviour change. This thesis contributes to our understanding of how health promotion and social marketing practitioners, as well as researchers, can use Web 2. 0 to market and research health-related behaviour change. This thesis contains seven articles and uses a mixed methodological approach, including qualitative and quantitative methods, in three stages. Stage 1 involved a systematic literature review and online search to document Web 2. 0 reach and growth over time, user engagement in Web 2. 0, and theoretical frameworks to explain why users adopt and diffuse Web 2. 0. The results of this review are presented in Chapters 2 and 3; and led to determining the gaps in the Web 2. 0 evidence base, which was the basis of the papers presented in Chapters 6 and 7. Significant increases over time in reach and growth of Web 2. 0 and new media channels by geography, technology, and age were found during the systematic literature review and online search. Users engaged in Web 2. 0 channels to seek or create news, entertainment, and health information. An examination of the practical use of social marketing principles in Web 2. 0 campaigns suggested that one or more principles were being applied to new media <b>campaigns,</b> but further <b>coordination</b> and integration are required. A framework to guide the development of a Web 2. 0 research agenda identified many opportunities for Web 2. 0 researchers to advance the field: documenting Web 2. 0 natural history, individual risks or benefits, and specific areas relevant to the discipline of social marketing (acceptance, utilisation, social marketing principles, or best practices). Stage 2 involved qualitative in-depth interviews (presented in Chapters 4 and 5) with 17 social marketing experts living in Australia, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States who had utilised Web 2. 0 marketing strategies. The discussion guide contained open-ended questions which gauged: reasons for campaign implementation, formative and pre-test research strategies used, campaign implementation strategies used, how campaign impact was defined, and how campaign success was measured. During the qualitative in-depth interviews, Web 2. 0 experts working in social marketing discussed best practices from utilising new media channels; such as using plain language, transparent communication practices, and strategic planning for social marketing and health promotion campaigns. Interestingly, practitioners perceived more strengths than limitations with implementing a campaign on Web 2. 0 platforms compared to implementing a campaign on traditional communication channels. Social marketing practitioners also used some traditional research approaches to evaluate their Web 2. 0 campaigns. The last phase of the research comprised a quantitative online survey (n= 325) with Internet users 18 years of age and older living in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom (Chapter 8) to assess usage of Web 2. 0 for health information and health engagement. New media platforms were visited by Internet users living in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States for health information and to engage in health content engagement. To reach individuals 18 - 34 years old, recommendations were provided to use video sharing or social media channels (Facebook or Twitter), whereas, for Internet users 55 years of age and older Twitter and LinkedIn were equally good avenues for disseminating health information, while Facebook was not. The overall results of the enclosed thesis provide concrete recommendations for practitioners and researchers with regard to how to plan, monitor, and evaluate best-in-class health promotion and social marketing campaigns using Web 2. 0. Modelling healthy behaviour, engaging target audiences in creating content, and disseminating messages on multiple Web 2. 0 channels were examples of best practices for Web 2. 0 campaigns...|$|R
