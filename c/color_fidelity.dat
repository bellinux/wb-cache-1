40|$|Periodic {{clustered-dot}} screens {{are widely}} used for electrophotographic printers due to their print stability. Typically there are four-colorant color printing: cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K). Moreover, with the occurence of high <b>fidelity</b> <b>color</b> printing, one or more additional primary colorants, such as orange and violet, are needed to extend the gamut of printer. Nevertheless, when applied to color printing, superpositions of periodic screens may cause objectionable moire patterns. It is much harder to be solved while more and more colorant planes are superposed. ^ Meanwhile, halftone designers also need to consider “print symmetry” (visual equality). In other words, in each colorant plane, we want the clustered dots as round as possible, in order to render more details equally in different directions, and for entire color screen set, we want the screen frequency of each colorant as close as possible. In this dissertation, we proposed a new color screen set which solves the moire problem and also gives the consideration to print symmetry issue. ...|$|R

40|$|Photography In {{the field}} of silver-halide photography, color {{separation}} was explored about a century ago, using filter mosaics, dichroic mirrors, three-shot filtration, and other techniques, before the dominant technology of multi-layered color film emerged. In {{the field of}} digital photography, the same techniques are being explored now in conjuction with silicon sensor technology. The three-shot technique, and the related tri-linear scanning technique, can deliver excellent images, but are awkward to employ and unsuitable for subjects that move. The filter-mosaic aproach is currently dominant in the digital camera market, but its inevitable aliasing artifacts limit its applicability in the professional end of the business. The use of dichroic mirrors, embedded in prisms as in color-TV cameras, has been attempted by a few camera vendors, so far with limited success. The demand for better digital images, however, has provided a continuing incentive to work on making this three-sensor approach feasible. Several key problems must be solved to make a viable professional camera using this approach: first, sensors with high enough resolution and image quality must be made at a cost that allows three {{of them to be}} included in a product; second, a prism must be designed for good <b>color</b> reproduction <b>fidelity</b> and must be economically and precisely manufactured; third, the three sensors must be optically aligned to the prism in a way that avoids ghost reflections and other problems; and finally, a whole new camera system needs to be designed around such a three-channel sensor assembly.

40|$|In this research, we {{investigated}} two important issues in digital color imaging: {{the measure of}} colors and the measure of perceived image fidelity. ^ For measuring colors, we explored {{the use of a}} digital camera for imaging colorimetry. Our system consists of a digital camera, a set of filters, and a set of calibration matrices which are illuminant-dependent. We develop two colorimetry systems by applying model-based and regression-based techniques. For the model-based system, a model for the digital camera is employed; and our objective is to find the optimal filters and the corresponding calibration sets that minimize a cost function which accounts for errors in L *a*b* space, system robustness, and filter smoothness. For the regression-based system, no modeling technique is applied to the camera and filters. The objective is simply to find the optimal calibration matrices that minimize the total least squared errors of a given color set in CIE XYZ coordinates under several pre-selected illumination conditions. ^ We apply both types of colorimetry systems to two specific tasks: general purpose measurement of color samples and colorimetry of human teeth. Even though each system has its strength and weakness, we found that both systems yield accurate measure of colors from our experimental results. ^ For evaluating perceived image fidelity, we develop the <b>Color</b> Image <b>Fidelity</b> Assessor (CIFA) which extended Taylor et al 2 ̆ 7 s achromatic IFA. The CIFA is a visual model that assesses perceived image fidelity along three opponent coordinates: the luminance, the red-green opponent, and the blue-yellow opponent. In this work, we introduce a novel color descriptor namely chromatic difference to measure the spatial interaction between colors along chromatic coordinates. A set of chromatic difference discrimination experiments that use physiologically motivated stimuli were presented. The experiments were designed in such way that they measured the sensitivity of each visual channels of human visual system that are directly related to the model. Therefore, we can directly apply the results of the psychophysical experiments to CIFA for the task of perceived image fidelity assessment. Our simulation results show that the CIFA provides visual prediction as human perceives {{for a wide range of}} image contents and distortion types. Hence we concluded that CIFA is an effective perceived image fidelity assessor. ...|$|R

40|$|Color {{reproduction}} stabilization is {{a control}} process {{to ensure that}} the printed output matches the desired color tones. In this paper we consider the stabilization of single color tone separation. The mapping of input-tone to output-color is characterized by the color tone reproduction curve(TRC). By compensating for any variations of the Xerographic printing process, the TRC stabilization controller aims to achieve identity TRC maps. This problem is critical to ensure high <b>fidelity</b> <b>color</b> printing. To make TRC stabilization viable in an actual Xerographic printing process, there are two major issues to address; 1) there exist only small number of actuators to stabilize a potentially infinite dimensional TRC; 2) {{only a small number of}} color sensor patches can be printed and measured at a time. We will look into TRC stabilization controller based on optimal controller. To address the second problem, we proposed the use of time-sequential sampling to fulfill the sparse spatio-temporal sampling requirement of sensing the TRC. We also proposed using Kalman filtering approach to reconstruct the time-sequential sampled signal. Two types of time-sequential sampling strategies- lexicographical and bit reversed strategies are analyzed and their suitability for TRC stabilization discussed. The time-sequential sampling and Kalman filter forms a linear time invariant observer for the TRC stabilization controller. This gives a straightforward implementation of the TRC stabilization control with time-sequential sampling. Experimental and simulation results verified the adequacy of the approach taken in realizing a practical color reproduction stabilization control system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{databases}} {{which are}} currently used in driving simulators {{do not take}} lighting into account in a realistic way. First, the visualization of surfaces use photographic textures. These textures are modified by computer graphics designers in order to visually match with a specific lighting environment, without photometric or colorimetric control of any kind. For instance, a database build from daytime pictures will need contrast, brightness and color modifications for a night-time simulation with road lighting. Secondly, the textures are stored as pixel intensities, instead of physical units, which yelds display dependant rendering. Yet, <b>color</b> and contrast <b>fidelity</b> would make driving simulators useful for many new applications, specially for road safety, which involves visibility issues (driving through fog, for instance). This motivation led us to test if current lighting computation techniques {{could be used in}} real time applications. Realistic rendering of contrasts and colors is a fast evolving topic in the field of computer graphics. Physical modeling of light transport, using the radiosity method for instance, is a standard approach to get realistic rendering in synthetic images. Such computations would improve the realism of driving simulators. Unfortunately, the algorithms are far from compatible with real time. This is due to high computation times, but also to the geometric representation of the surfaces, which need to be meshed (like in finite element methods). It leads to amounts of polygons that cannot be handled by current rendering technologies. In this paper, we propose a methodology allowing the use of lighting calculation techniques as a pre-process of database rendering on driving simulators. Our goal is to allow contrasts and colors to quantitatively match real world values, so as to use driving simulation in visibility and lighting evaluation experiments, and to increase the use of driving simulation for road safety studies. The presented methodology was applied on a database of the Fourvieres tunnel (Lyon, France) ...|$|R
