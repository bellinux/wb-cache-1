On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Past {{studies have}} shown that {{disruptive}} behavior can be eliminated and attending behavior accelerated in an academic setting. The relationship between these behaviors and academic performance is not well understood. The effects of behavioral and performance <b>contingencies</b> on classroom behavior and on academic performance were investigated. The subjects, third-grade students from an inner city elementary school, were exposed to a series of conditions including baseline, behavior <b>contingencies,</b> performance <b>contingencies,</b> and a mix of behavior and performance <b>contingencies</b> using a reversal design. The students worked 100 randomly selected mathematics problems for 20 minutes each day during each period. Behavioral <b>contingencies</b> improved attending and decreased disruptions but did not improve performance. Performance <b>contingencies</b> increased per cent correct problems but attending declined and disruptions increased. The combined <b>contingencies</b> increased both performance and attending. The experiment was replicated with another class of children varying the sequence of conditions and the amount of token reinforcement that could be earned. The findings emphasized the importance of designing specific <b>contingencies</b> for specific target behaviors. Behavioral <b>contingencies</b> did not have the positive effect on performance often implied, nor were performance <b>contingencies</b> alone able to maintain acceptable classroom behavior...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{were trained}} on a discrete-trial {{probability}} learning task. In Experiment 1, the molar reinforcement probabilities {{for the two}} response alternatives were equal, and the local <b>contingencies</b> of reinforcement differentially reinforced a win-stay, lose-shift response pattern. The win-stay portion was learned substantially more easily and appeared from the outset of training, suggesting that its occurrence did not depend upon discrimination of the local <b>contingencies</b> but rather only upon simple strengthening effects of individual reinforcements. Control by both types of local <b>contingencies</b> decreased with increases in the intertrial interval, although some control remained with intertrial intervals as long as 30 s. In Experiment 2, the local <b>contingencies</b> always favored win-shift and lose-shift response patterns but were asymmetrical for the two responses, causing the molar reinforcement rates for the two responses to differ. Some learning of the alternation pattern occurred with short intertrial intervals, although win-stay behavior occurred for some subjects. The local reinforcement <b>contingencies</b> were discriminated poorly with longer intertrial intervals. In the absence of control by the local <b>contingencies,</b> choice proportion {{was determined by the}} molar <b>contingencies,</b> as indicated by high exponent values for the generalized matching law with long intertrial intervals, and lower values with short intertrial intervals. The results show that when molar <b>contingencies</b> of reinforcement and local <b>contingencies</b> are in opposition, both may have independent roles. Control by molar <b>contingencies</b> cannot generally be explained by local <b>contingencies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Also in 1990, the U.S. {{intervened in}} the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm. During that intervention, Fort Lewis {{deployed}} 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia. I Corps {{also contributed to}} the command structure, with the I Corps Commander, LTG Calvin A. H. Waller and the Deputy I Corps Commander, MG Paul R. Schwartz, assisting General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander of the American Forces. I Corps expanded its <b>contingency</b> missions and became a quick-response corps. For several months, I Corps was the nation's worldwide <b>contingency</b> corps, while the XVIII Airborne Corps was engaged in the Gulf War. This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps' new mission, and to insure that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States. The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization <b>contingency</b> corps and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command. This entailed the addition of a number of active component corps units.|$|E

The constraints determine {{the status of the}} organization of the environmental suprasystem and the state of each subsystem. Some internal <b>contingencies</b> are: structural <b>contingencies,</b> output, and demographic, spatiotemporal and traditional <b>contingencies.</b> External <b>contingencies</b> are: economic, technological, legal, socio political cultural and environmental <b>contingencies.</b> Wiio, as quoted by Smith (1984) further stated that “In different organizational <b>contingencies,</b> different demographic variables showed significant relationships with communication variables”.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{systematic}} analysis of all dangerous N − 2 <b>contingencies</b> observed in medium size model of Polish power grid with about 2600 power lines. Each of the dangerous <b>contingencies</b> {{is composed of}} two initially tripped lines and one or more lines that overloaded as the result. There are 443 distinct <b>contingencies</b> that do not lead to immediate islanding of the grid. In {{the scope of the}} work we analyze the statistics of individual line participation in those <b>contingencies</b> and show that some lines have anomalously high rate of participation in the <b>contingencies.</b> Next, we show that about third of all the <b>contingencies</b> can be associated with the subgrids that are connected {{to the rest of the}} grid via small set of power line chains. The <b>contingencies</b> arise when cutting some of those chains results in overload of the others. Simple reduction of power grid corresponding to aggregation of chain components significantly reduces the total number of distinct <b>contingencies.</b> The rest of the <b>contingencies</b> are closely related to a set of almost dangerous N − 1 <b>contingencies</b> that result in heavy loading of particular lines. Tripping many different additional lines on top of these N − 1 <b>contingencies</b> results in an overload of one or more lines. We conclude our work by characterization of the joint distributions of power flows through the initiating and overloaded lines and statistical analysis of topological distance between the initially tripped and overloaded lines. 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} to reinforcement-schedule <b>contingencies</b> is presented that accommodates continuous {{as well as}} discrete effective dimensions of responses and reinforcers. College students' wheel turning was reinforced by projected reading material according to four schedule <b>contingencies</b> that incorporated either a discontinuous (count) or continuous (duration) dimension of the response and the reinforcer. The <b>contingencies</b> arranged a 1 : 1 correspondence between (a) response count and consequent stimulus count, (b) response duration and stimulus count, (c) response count and stimulus duration, and (d) response duration and stimulus duration. <b>Contingencies</b> incorporating response count produced moderate to high rates of very short-duration responses. <b>Contingencies</b> incorporating response duration produced very low-rate, long-duration responding. The dimension of the reinforcer had minimal or no additional effect. We suggest that incorporating duration and other continuous dimensions into schedule <b>contingencies</b> may improve our understanding of both laboratory and nonlaboratory behavior...|$|R

Twelve preschool children learned four stimulus classes through instructions, shaping, or imitation.

Given sufficient exposure to changed <b>contingencies,</b> rule-driven insensitivity to <b>contingencies</b> was overcome by experience with consequences.
