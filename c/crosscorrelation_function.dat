It {{is well known that}} given a pair of distinct m-sequences, the <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> must take on at least three values. This correspondence shows the three correlation values are symmetric about- 1. The main result is a proof of a conjecture made by Helleseth in 1976, that if m is a power of 2 then there are no pairs of binary m-sequences with a 3 -valued <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function...</b>|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{results have}} been {{obtained}} for first-order direction-dependent processes perturbed using maximum length ternary (MLT) signals. In particular, the process output and the input-output <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> are derived, leading to a theoretical expression for the combined time constant of the process. The importance of doing {{this is that the}} direction-dependent behaviour can be detected, and the combined linear dynamics of the process can be estimated, from the input-output <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function.</b> In the above derivations, it is assumed that the process dynamics are faster in the upward direction, and that the clock-pulse interval is chosen such that the output always decreases when the input is at signal level zero. The first of these assumptions does not affect the terms in the <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> because the input signal is inverse-repeat. The second assumption is shown to be valid during most of the signal period. The errors caused by the deviation from the ideal case are assessed, and are found to be small. Hence, the ideal case can be used as an effective benchmark against which results from an identification test as specified above can be measured. Advantages and disadvantages of using the MLT signal, instead of the maximum length binary or its inverse-repeat signal, are discussed. A simulation example is also shown to verify the obtained theoretical results...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of systems which have different dynamics when the output is increasing {{compared with those}} when the output is decreasing is considered. The dynamics in each direction will be assumed to be linear. It is shown that when such systems are perturbed by pseudorandom binary signals based on maximum length sequences, there are coherent patterns in the input-output <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function,</b> {{but there is no}} coherent pattern in either the gain response or the phase response in the frequency domain. The crosscorrelation terms are developed in detail for a process with first-order dynamics in the two directions, perturbed by a maximum length binary (MLB) signal and the results are confirmed by simulation. Similar theoretical expressions and simulation results are given for such a process perturbed by an inverse-repeat signal based on an MLB signal. The <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> patterns obtained using an MLB signal are not present when other classes of pseudorandom binary signals are used. The linear dynamics for the process perturbed by an MLB signal and its corresponding inverse-repeat MLB signal are estimated, and found to agree more closely with the theoretical value when the latter type of signal is used. The theory cannot be readily extended to processes with direction-dependent dynamics of higher order, but simulation results presented for such second-order processes show that the departure from linearity can still be detected from the <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> when an MLB perturbation signal is used...|$|E

40|$|This {{group is}} {{interested}} {{in a variety of}} problems in statistical communication theory. Current research is primarily concerned with: analytic nonlinear systems, <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>functions</b> under nonlinear transformation, output probability densities of linear systems, signal theory, second-order correlation functions, and probability distribution analyzers. 1. A generalization of time-invariant linear systems to some nonlinear systems is being developed. The generalization is based upon replacing the condition of linearity by that of analyticity (expressibility in a power series). An analytic system is charac-terized by an infinite sequence of system functions. One advantage of this development is that two analytic systems in cascade are equivalent to one analytic system, the Fourier transforms of whose system functions are series of products of the transforms of the system functions of the components. 2. The relationship between the <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>functions</b> of two time functions before and after nonlinear transformation is of considerable theoretical and practical importance.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} network {{architecture}} to compute on-line the temporal <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> between two signals, either stationary or locally stationary. We {{show that the}} weights of a multi-FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter trained with a teacher forcing anti-Hebbian rule encode the <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> between the input and the desired response. We extend this network to the Gamma filter which is an IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter and also to nonlinear filters.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{statistical}} analysis was the assessment of the relation between time series of environmental factors and of frequencies of diseases of the respiratory system in pre-school children. During about one year, daily measurements of air pollutants and climatic variables were taken. During the same period of time two series of medical data were collected: (i) The daily relative number of pre-school children, exhibiting diseases of the respiratory tracts who either came to the outpatients' clinic of the children's hospital or were reported by paediatricians in Basle (ENTRIES). (ii) The daily relative frequency of symptoms of the respiratory tracts observed in a group of randomly selected pre-school children (SYMPTOMS). By means of transfer function models the relation between the two target variables and the 'explaining' variables was analysed. Several practical problems did arise: Choice of the appropriate transformation of the different series, interpretation of the <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> using different methods of 'prewhitening', time splitting and nonstationarity of the crosscorrelation structure. In particular, it was found that after prewhitening the <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>function</b> between the explanatory series SO 2 and the response series SYMPTOMS changes with time.

The method is based on correlating signals, which are measured in two flow cross-sections. The cross-correlation function generated provides information about {{the time it takes}} for a particle to travel between the measurement planes.

The two measurement planes must be an optimum distance apart to ensure the best possible signal resolution and sufficient quality of the cross-correlation: If the distance is too small, the resolution is coarse, while for a too large distance, the pipe contents in the two crosssections may differ due to curved particle trajectories (e. g. due to gravity), leading to weak <b>crosscorrelation</b> <b>functions.</b> In this paper, experimental measurements and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of dilute-phase pneumatic conveying processes are reported.
