One way of increasing the lubricating properties of engineoil is through the addition of antioxidants. Antioxidants included in lubricants have a number of functions, one being buffering theinorganic acids sulphuric acid and nitric acid. A novel method expected to lower the hydrogen ion concentration in acidified engine oil was evaluated in this thesis. Thecapability of four different types of <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> to serve as complements for buffering additives in heavy vehicle engineswas assessed. Two <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> were weak and two were strong. The analysis techniques used to evaluate what effect thecation exchangers have on engine oil were standard test method ASTM D 4739, for measurements of the total base number (TBN),and inductively coupled plasma – atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). With ASTM D 4739 it was found that weak cationexchangers give positive results with respect to the ability to decrease the hydrogen ion concentration in acidified engine oil. However, after begin subjected to strong <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers,</b> ASTM D 4739 indicated that the hydrogen ion concentration in theacidified engine oil remains the same or increases. With additional literature studies of a variety of <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> currently on the market, further optimization of the cationexchanging material could likely be achieved.

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} of novel cation-exchanger with controllable charge density and polymer chain length of poly(3 -sulfopropyl methacrylate) (poly(SPM)) grafted via atom transfer radical polymerization onto Sepharose FF matrix. Polymer grafting provided a three-dimensional regular arrangement of the ligand and increased ionic capacity of the poly(SPM) -grafted cation-exchangers. The result showed that adsorption capacity for lysozyme enhanced greatly in poly(SPM) -grafted cation-exchangers whereas adsorption capacity for gamma-globulin decreased dramatically. It {{can be attributed to}} the consequence of the competition between electrostatic interaction and repulsive excluded volume interaction of grafted polymer and protein. For lysozyme, protein adsorption on poly(SPM) -grafted <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> was driven dominantly by electrostatic interaction. By constrast, the repulsive excluded volume interaction between grafted polymer and protein was remarkable in adsorption of gamma-globulin on poly(SPM) -grafted <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers.</b> Moreover, the poly(SPM) -grafted <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> exhibited great salt tolerance in protein adsorption and distinct intraparticle mass transfer properties. Finally, the results of dynamic binding capacity (DBC) for lysozyme showed that the poly(SPM) -grafted cation-exchangers had higher binding capacities than did the commercial SP Sepharose FF, and the maximal DBCs reached 192 mg/mL at 50 mmol/L NaCl.

Properties of various <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> and mixed beds comprised of strong cation exchange particles and alkyl-modified silica particles were explored. The role of ionic and nonpolar interactions was examined {{in terms of}} retention and elution of analytes. A series of displacement experiments was used to characterize the interactions and energy-minimized, three-dimensional models were used to illustrate these interactions. Selectivity of <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> was probed by introducing cations differing in size, hydrophobic nature and charge before and after introduction of the analytes. The ionic strength, the solvent composition and the pH of the liquid phase were parameters that were varied in order to define the type of interaction that was responsible for retention, lack of retention, or elution during the SPE procedure. Application of mixed sorbents toward the extraction of basic drugs of abuse, {{as well as the}} use of reversed-phase silica and a resin for the extraction of a neutral organonitrogen species were also investigated. With propylene-linked <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> (under appropriate pH conditions), it was shown that the primary mode of interaction is through ionic forces. As a consequence, there is no selectivity of these sorbents for cations based on hydrophobic nature. With ethylbenzene and octylene-linked exchangers, there is an increase in selectivity for cations with increasing hydrophobic nature. The linker chain is adequately long enough to allow for nonpolar interactions with the aliphatic side groups, just as a resin-based exchanger allows. With short and long chain exchangers, there is selectivity proportional to the charge of the ion. The proposed reason for this is a combination of multiplesite attachment of polyprotic species to the surface and increased probability of single-site interaction proportional to the number of charged nitrogen atoms on the molecule. It was shown that mixed sorbent beds offer advantages in operator control over the retention of organic bases in a high ionic strength sample matrix. The retention mechanism was elucidated, demonstrating a clear contribution of nonpolar forces to retention with the mixed sorbents as was observed with the long-chain <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers...</b>|$|R

Cerium (IV) initiated "graft-from" polymerization reactions were employed to convert M-PVA magnetic particles into polyacrylic acid-fimbriated magnetic cation exchange supports displaying ultra-high binding capacity for basic target proteins. The modifications, which were performed at 25 mg and 2. 5 g scales, delivered maximum binding capacities (Q) for hen egg white lysozyme in excess of 320 mgg, combined with sub-micromolar dissociation constants (0. 45 - 0. 69 μm) and "tightness of binding" values greater than 49 Lg. Two batches of polyacrylic acid-fimbriated magnetic <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> were combined to form a 5 g pooled batch exhibiting Q values for lysozyme, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase of 404, 585, and 685 mgg, respectively. These magnetic <b>cation</b> <b>exchangers</b> were subsequently employed together with a newly designed "rotor-stator" type HGMF rig, in five sequential cycles of recovery of lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase from 2 L batches of a crude sweet bovine whey feedstock. Lactoferrin purification performance was observed to remain relatively constant from one HGMF cycle to the next over the five operating cycles, with yields between 40 % and 49 % combined with purification and concentration factors of 37 - to 46 -fold and 1. 3 - to 1. 6 -fold, respectively.
