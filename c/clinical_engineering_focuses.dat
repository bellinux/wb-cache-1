40|$|The use of {{technology}} in health-care today is increasing dramatically with a corresponding increase in cost and complexity to provide and support it. The {{degree to which a}} hospital manages this technology affects its ability to treat patients, to perform research, to teach and to attract competent staff. This thesis project has identified the role that <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> could play in health-care technology provision and support in South Africa. A system synthesis technique was employed to develop an idealized <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> model (ICE) that would satisfy South African technological requirements. An extensive literature survey of the current status of <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> in both developed and developing countries was undertaken to provide input to the synthesis process. Surveys were then conducted to determine the actual current status of <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> and its environment in the RSA. To enable such an idealised department to function as defined, it must be supported by appropriate and timeous information. The information needs of the idealised <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> model were analysed and a corresponding decision support system (DSS) defined. Further surveys were conducted to test the applicability and acceptability of the idealised <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> model. The feasibility of implementing the idealised <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> model in South Africa was investigated and recommendations were made based on the research results of this thesis to bring the actual status of <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> closer to the idealised model. i...|$|R

Despite the importance of <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> in hospitals and <b>clinical</b> environment, <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> departments have not been systematically incorporated into Peruvian hospitals. Several attempts from foreign and national institutions have not been successful in the implementation of these departments within hospital organization. <b>Clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> needs of <b>clinical</b> epidemiology in order to meet some of its funtions.

40|$|Biomedical {{technology}} is a valuable asset of healthcare facilities.

The activities that guarantee a proper management are carried on by the people working on a <b>Clinical</b> <b>Engineering</b> (CE) Department. In the chapter we describe a model to estimate the number of clinical engineers and biomedical equipment technicians (BMET) that will constitute the <b>Clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> department staff.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{approximately half}} of the healthcare equipments are not in full use and the main cause of this is the inadequate management of them. The <b>Clinical</b> <b>Engineering</b> might face this problem in the healthcare environment analyzing the equipment with a health technological process perspective to identify opportunities of improvements. Generally, the inadequate management is a result of lack of systemized and contextualized information about the health technological process. The effort to make an adequate management generates an increasing interest in the use of benchmarker. Currently, the benchmarkers used by the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Engineering</b> are not representative of a health technological process as a whole. Health technological process concept is stated in this article. The multicriteria analysis methodology MCDA (Multicriteria Decision Aid) is used to obtain benchmarkers and to identify opportunities of improvements, thus generating conditions for that the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Engineering</b> consolidates its relevant contribution for the healthcare.

40|$|For {{the past}} few decades, {{and for the next}} few decades to come, the amount of high {{technology}} equipment used in hospitals has been increasing drastically. This has forced Hospital Administrations to re-examine techniques used to oversee the operation of such apparatus in the hospital, and the scientific principles they use. different methods are available today for this purpose, from which administrators can choose. The suggested method by this report is the implementation by the Health Care System of Clinical Engineers. The material in this report is presented in such a manner as to reveal the different aspects related to the position of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Engineering.</b> The report therefore defines the position of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Engineering,</b> the qualifications of a candidate for that position, and describe the observed need for such personnel in the Canadian Health Care System.

5000|$|In 2011, AAMI {{arranged}} {{a meeting to}} discuss a new name for <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> and/or biomedical equipment technology. After careful debate, the vast majority decided on [...] "Healthcare Technology Management". Due partly to common confusion about the line between clinical engineers (engineers) and BMETs (technicians), the word engineering was deemed limiting from the administrator's perspective and unworkable from the educator's perspective. (An ABET-accredited college could not name an associate degree program [...] "engineering".) Also, the adjective clinical limited the scope to hospitals. It remains unresolved how widely or officially accepted this change is or will be, and how this will affect <b>Clinical</b> <b>Engineering</b> Certification (CCE) or the formal recognition of <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> as a subset of biomedical engineering.
