5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which <b>contains</b> <b>calcium</b> carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings {{are attached to the}} second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone <b>contains</b> <b>calcium</b> oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E

25|$|Calcium oxalate is {{the most}} common {{component}} of kidney stones. Early investigators isolated oxalic acid from wood-sorrel (Oxalis). Members of the spinach family and the brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts) are high in oxalates, as are sorrel and umbellifers like parsley. Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% oxalic acid, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) <b>contains</b> <b>calcium</b> oxalate crystals. Similarly, the Virginia creeper, a common decorative vine, produces oxalic acid in its berries as well as oxalite crystals in the sap, in the form of raphides. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{possible}} origins {{for the name}} Lias: the first reason is it was taken by a geologist from an English quarryman's dialect pronunciation of the word [...] "layers"; secondly, sloops from north Cornish ports such as Bude would sail across the Bristol Channel to the Vale of Glamorgan to load up with rock from coastal limestone quarries (lias limestone from South Wales was used throughout North Devon/North Cornwall as it <b>contains</b> <b>calcium</b> carbonate to fertilise the poor quality Devonian soils of the West Country); the Cornish would pronounce the layers of limestone as 'laiyers' or 'lias'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thermodynamically}} stable form of CaCO3 {{under normal}} conditions is hexagonal β-CaCO3, (the mineral calcite). Other forms {{can be prepared}}, the denser,(2.83 g/cc) orthorhombic λ-CaCO3 ( [...] the mineral aragonite) and μ-CaCO3, occurring as the mineral vaterite. The aragonite form can be prepared by precipitation at temperatures above 85°C, the vaterite form can be prepared by precipitation at 60°C. Calcite <b>contains</b> <b>calcium</b> atoms coordinated by 6 oxygen atoms, [...] in aragonite they are coordinated by 9 oxygen atoms. [...] The vaterite structure is not fully understood. Magnesium carbonate MgCO3 has the calcite structure, whereas strontium and barium carbonate (SrCO3 and BaCO3) adopt the aragonite structure, reflecting their larger ionic radii.|$|E

2500|$|Phosphate rock, {{which usually}} <b>contains</b> <b>calcium</b> phosphate, {{was first used}} in 1850 to make phosphorus, and {{following}} {{the introduction of the}} electric arc furnace in 1890, elemental phosphorus production switched from the bone-ash heating, to electric arc production from phosphate rock.

Phosphate rock production greatly increased after World War II, and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today. See the article on peak phosphorus {{for more information on the}} history and present state of phosphate mining.

40|$|Background: Microbial {{irritation}} is {{the major}} etiologic cause of pulp and periapical lesions. Therefore the main goal of endodontic treatment is complete elimination or inimizing acteria with chemo-mechanical preparation. Calcium hydroxide {{is one of the}} chemical substances, which are used, in endodontic treatment and its antimicrobial effect on various bacteria has extensively has been studied and researched. Recently Gutta-percha point <b>containing</b> <b>calcium</b> hydroxide has been offered to dentistry. The purpose {{this study was to examine}} the antimicrobial effects of this substance in infected root canals. Material and Methods: In this study ninty extracted human maxillary central incisors, which had been extracted to various reasons, were selected. After canal preparation and root sterilization, all the samples (excluding 10 negative control samples) were contaminated by bacillus subtillis. Then these eighty roots were randomly divided into 3 groups, which were 10 roots as positive control group (non medicated), 35 roots medicated with Gutta-percha point <b>containing</b> <b>calcium</b> hydroxide as group A, 35 roots medicated with calcium hydroxide as group B. after 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days in these three groups, antimicrobial effect was assessed.

Conclusion: Since there is no significant difference between antimicrobial effect of Gutta-percha point <b>containing</b> <b>calcium</b> hydroxide and calcium hydroxide past, it seems that the usage of this product as an intracanal medication should be more investigate...|$|R
