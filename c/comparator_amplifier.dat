40|$|Abstract—A new {{rail-to-rail}} CMOS input {{architecture is}} pre-sented that delivers behavior nearly {{independent of the}} common-mode level {{in terms of both}} transconductance and slewing char-acteristics. Feedforward is used to achieve high common-mode bandwidth, and operation does not rely on analytic square law characteristics, making the technique applicable to deep submi-cron technologies. From the basis of a transconductor design, an asynchronous comparator and a video bandwidth op-amp are also developed, providing a family of general purpose analog circuit functions which may be used in high (and low) bandwidth mixed-signal systems. Benefits for the system designer are that the need for rigorous control of common-mode levels is avoided and input signal swings right across the power supply range can be easily handled. A further benefit is that having very consistent performance, the circuits can be easily described in VHDL (or other behavioral language) to allow simulation of large mixed-signal systems. The circuits presented may be easily adapted for a range of requirements.

5000|$|In electronics, a Schmitt trigger is a {{comparator}} circuit with hysteresis implemented by applying positive {{feedback to the}} noninverting input of a <b>comparator</b> or differential <b>amplifier.</b> It is an active circuit which converts an analog input signal to a digital output signal. The circuit is named a [...] "trigger" [...] because the output retains its value until the input changes sufficiently to trigger a change. In the non-inverting configuration, when the input is higher than a chosen threshold, the output is high. When the input is below a different (lower) chosen threshold the output is low, and when the input is between the two levels the output retains its value. This dual threshold action is called hysteresis and implies that the Schmitt trigger possesses memory and {{can act as a}} bistable multivibrator (latch or flip-flop). There is a close relation between the two kinds of circuits: a Schmitt trigger can be converted into a latch and a latch can be converted into a Schmitt trigger.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the designing of a closed loop {{model of the}} dc motor drive for controlling speed. Accuracy and the dynamic responses are better in a closed loop system. In the closed loop system, acceleration and the deceleration of the motor can be controlled according to the requirement. In order to regulate drives automatically, the controlled variables are measured. A tachogenerator is used for this purpose. The output of the tachogenerators is compared with a preset reference voltage. The differences between these two signals are fed as an actuating signal to control {{the elements of the}} system. Control amplifiers are used as both <b>comparators</b> and <b>amplifiers.</b> As a small change in the voltage can cause a large change in the motor current and lead to a particular drive control feature. There are two closed paths in the dc control scheme. One is the outer speed control loop and the other is the inner current control loop. Both the loops are controlled with the help of P-I controllers having their own gains and the time constants according to the requirement of the system. The output of the speed P-I controller which is the function of the speed error is used to command for current P-I controller and compared with armature current. The current P-I controller output control the triggering circuit of the converter. The armature current tends to increase to a large value when the motor is accelerating. A current limit can be obtained in this system by limiting the maximum current command voltage.
