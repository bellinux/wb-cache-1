5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring tax <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{increased}} {{taxes on}} high-income taxpayers via: a) expiration of the Bush income tax <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> top 1–2% of income earners starting with 2013; and b) payroll tax increases on roughly the top 5% of earners {{as part of}} the ACA. This increased the average tax rate paid by the top 1% (incomes above $443,000 in 2015) from 28% in 2012 to 34% in 2013. According to the CBO, after-tax income inequality improved, by lowering the share of after-tax income received by the top 1% from 16.7% in 2007 to 15.1% in 2012 and to 12.4% in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} first flew on 15 October 1985, {{six months}} later than originally programmed date of 15 April. Costs had increased significantly during the development process, with the predicted unit cost rising from $1.5million in 1982 to $3million in February 1985. The 1985 Gramm–Rudman–Hollings Balanced Budget Act mandated spending <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> US Government {{in an attempt to}} limit the national debt, and while testing did not reveal any major problems, Secretary of the Air Force Russell A. Rourke cancelled procurement of the T-46, while allowing limited development to continue. While attempts were made in Congress to reinstate the program, which resulted in the FY 1987 budget being delayed, an amendment was passed to the 1987 Appropriations Bill to forbid any spending on the T-46 until further evaluation of the T-46 against the T-37 and other trainers took place.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the years, Canadian {{libraries}} {{have been}} subject to the political and economic influence of the nation. During World War II, public libraries experienced development setbacks, but expansion resumed in 1945. Then, in the 1960s, Canadian public libraries felt the benefits of the era's emphasis on education – service expanded, buildings were remodeled or constructed from scratch, and Centennial Grants were provided in order to improve the system. This period of growth ended in due to the inflationary period in the 1970s and the two recessions during the 1980s. However, in the late 1990s this trend reversed and the National Core Library Statistics Program reported in 1999 that public libraries served 28.5million municipal residents – a total of 93% of the Canadian population. Nevertheless, in 2011 the tides turned for public libraries in Canada once again, specifically in Toronto. The city is now undergoing a heated debate regarding Mayor Rob Ford's proposed budget <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Public Library, which is currently one of the most efficient public library systems in all of North America.|$|E

The 1400 storyboard <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film were completed on 16 January 2004. On 25 June the in-between animation was completed and checking was completed on 26 June. Studio Ghibli used digital technology to run many copies of the still portions of a scene, a process which avoids inconsistencies between various still frames, but can create an impression of artificiality. Therefore, the studio chose to manually retouch the digitally altered images, recreating the [...] "feel" [...] of a hand-drawn image.|$|E

500|$|As {{with several}} other {{characters}} from Tekken 6, Lars was given an alternate outfit designed by a manga artist, with Lars' being done by Masashi Kishimoto, author of the manga Naruto. In redesigning Lars, Kishimoto removed his Tekken Force outfit and gave him one made of a soft rubber material, marked with a lion figure on his right arm. He also made multiple <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> belt on the back, so that Lars' kicking techniques would be possible. Also, on the outfit's back are the numbers for Sweden's telephone country code: [...] "46". In the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Lars has an extra costume based on Link from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. For Tekken 7, Lars was given another look by Ninnin. After multiple drafts that gave Lars different colors and accessories, Ninnin made one which retains elements from the Tekken Force design, while adding a torn red cape. For Street Fighter X Tekken, Lars retains his Tekken 6 outfit, but is also given an alternate ninja outfit.|$|E
500|$|Hood {{was given}} a major refit from 1 May 1929 to 10 March 1931 and {{afterwards}} resumed her role as flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron. Later that year her crew participated in the Invergordon Mutiny over pay <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sailors. It ended peacefully and Hood returned to her home port afterwards. The Battlecruiser Squadron made a Caribbean cruise in early 1932. The next year she resumed her previous practice of a winter cruise in the Mediterranean. While en route to Gibraltar {{for one of these}} cruises she collided with the battlecruiser [...] on 23 January 1935, but was only lightly damaged. Hood participated in King George V's Silver Jublilee Fleet Review at Spithead the following August. She was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterward and stationed at Gibraltar at the outbreak of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and the Spanish Civil War. On 23 April 1937 she escorted three British merchantmen into Bilbao harbour despite the presence of the Nationalist cruiser [...] that attempted to blockade the port. She returned to Portsmouth in January 1939 for an overhaul that lasted until 12 August.|$|E
500|$|Obama {{initially}} viewed Ryan as a Republican {{who could}} help cut the federal deficit. In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in there ... that I would agree with, {{but there are some}} ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E

500|$|Titled {{after the}} [...] "drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] metaphor, [...] "Kool-Aid" [...] has a dark {{electric}} blues style, noir musical vibes, and lyrics about the politically misguided {{lower middle class}} who support Republican tax <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rich. The song's narrative follows a young American who accepts the Bush administration's pro-war stance, heads off to a foreign land willing to fight any person of color, and returns to his home jobless. According to writer James C. McKinley, Jr., the song continues a theme Cooder established on Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down: [...] "the idea of poor whites who have been let down by the politicians they have supported." [...] It also paraphrases the lyrics to the Western swing standard [...] "Cocaine Blues", and touches on the controversial stand-your-ground law, which Cooder viewed as [...] "new Jim Crow laws – the stand-your-ground law is already responsible for about 80 shooting deaths of African Americans." [...] "The 90 and the 9" [...] repurposes the gospel hymn {{of the same name}} and the worker songs of Joe Hill with apocalyptic themes, an anti-war narrative, and a depiction of modern union workers as part of the lower 99% of income distribution in the US. Cooder was inspired to write the song by military recruitment of high schoolers in his native Los Angeles. [...] "Take Your Hands off It" [...] has a defiant tone, prominent guitar, and lyrics that rousingly defend constitutional rights.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wealthy, {{and the second}} was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending, the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called [...] "Reaganomics", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987.|$|E
