5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde used was unique because it was the first <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into {{derivatives}} of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E

5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|British {{aircraft}} manufacturer Avro built {{a factory in}} south Chadderton in 1938–39, later known as BAE Chadderton. It {{was one of the}} largest employers in the area, producing a variety of aircraft models including Ansons, Manchesters and Bristol Blenheims. During the Second World War, 3,050 Avro Lancaster bombers were built at the Chadderton factory—over 40percent of the Royal Air Force's fleet. Post World War Two the Avro Vulcan was designed and built, as well as the Avro Shackleton and Avro Lincoln. After the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, Avro became part of the nationalised British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) and produced <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> for Boeing and Airbus.|$|E

5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft,</b> Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
5|$|She {{started from}} her home port on 13 November 1971 and reached her patrol {{location}} by 18 November. She remained there until 25 November when she was shifted to a new patrol location and remained there until 30 November. On 30 November, she rendezvoused with Karanj at sea to transfer instructions and subsequently then left for Bombay and reached there by 4 December 1971. During her patrols, she encountered fair weather and monitored a number of tankers and <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> flying on international routes. She was originally intended to lay mines but the plan was later cancelled.|$|E
5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.|$|E

Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} business travel, Gates usually flew coach in <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion. Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.|$|E
5|$|International {{airports}} sometimes serve {{military as}} well as commercial purposes and their viability is also affected by technological developments. Canton Island Airport, for example, in the Phoenix Islands (Kiribati), after serving as a military airport during World War II, {{was used as a}} refuelling stop by <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as Qantas which stationed ground crew there in the late 1950s. The advent in the early 1960s of jet aircraft such as the Boeing 707 with the range to fly non-stop between Australia or New Zealand and Hawaii, meant that a mid-Pacific stop was no longer needed and the airport was closed to regular commercial use. Other international airports, such as Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, have been decommissioned and replaced when they reached capacity or technological advances rendered them inadequate.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{instances}} {{of damage to}} jet aircraft {{as a result of}} an ash encounter. On 24 June 1982 a British Airways Boeing 747-236B (Flight 9) flew through the ash cloud from the eruption of Mount Galunggung, Indonesia resulting in the failure of all four engines. The plane descended 24,000 feet (7,300 m) in 16 minutes before the engines restarted, allowing the aircraft to make an emergency landing. On 15 December 1989 a KLM Boeing 747-400 (Flight 867) also lost power to all four engines after flying into an ash cloud from Mount Redoubt, Alaska. After dropping 14,700 feet (4,500 m) in four minutes, the engines were started just 1–2 minutes before impact. Total damage was US$80 million and it took 3 months' work to repair the plane. In the 1990s a further US$100 million of damage was sustained by <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> (some in the air, others on the ground) as a consequence of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E
5|$|The International Air Transport Association (IATA)—an {{industry}} trade organisation representing over 240 airlines (representing 84% of global air traffic)—and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)—the United Nations' civil aviation body—began working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time. The IATA created {{a task force}} (which included several outside stakeholders) to define a minimal set of requirements that any tracking system must meet, allowing airlines to decide the best solution to track their aircraft. The IATA's task force planned {{to come up with}} several short-, medium-, and long-term solutions to ensure that information is provided in a timely manner to support search, rescue, and recovery activities in the wake of an aircraft accident. The task force was expected to provide a report to the ICAO on 30 September 2014, but on that day said that the report would be delayed, citing the need for further clarification on some issues. In December 2014, the IATA task force recommended that, within 12 months, airlines track <b>commercial</b> <b>aircraft</b> in no longer than 15-minute intervals, although it still has not released its report and full details of proposed changes. The IATA itself did not support the deadline, which it believes cannot be met by all airlines, but the proposed standard has the support of the ICAO.
