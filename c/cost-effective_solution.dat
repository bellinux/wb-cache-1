5|$|Some of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System's current {{coverage}} area was once served by an electrified streetcar and suburban train system called the Key System. This early 20th-century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower {{deck of the}} Bay Bridge, but the system was dismantled in the 1950s and operated its last transbay crossing in 1958. By the mid-1950s, that system had been dismantled in favor of highway travel. A 1950s study of traffic problems in the Bay Area concluded the most <b>cost-effective</b> <b>solution</b> for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a new, high-speed rapid transit system linking the cities and suburbs.|$|E

25|$|In 1936 Denny met General W.S. Thiele at Fort MacArthur in Los Angeles, {{who complained}} that it cost $300 {{to have an}} {{aircraft}} tow a target for gunnery practice. He {{also noted that the}} target flew in a straight line, which made it unrealistic. Denny suggested that a radio controlled model might be a more <b>cost-effective</b> <b>solution.</b> In an effort to interest the US Army in the design, they had demonstrated the RP-1 at Dale Dry Lake on 21 February 1938, but the radio failed and it crashed.|$|E
25|$|A European {{solution}} and the US UGM-73 Poseidon were also briefly considered, but ultimately rejected, primarily on capability, cost and uncertainty grounds. The clear favourite was the UGM-96 Trident I, which {{as well as}} being a <b>cost-effective</b> <b>solution</b> — given the US would also operate the missile in vast numbers — also delivered the overall best long-term capability insurances against Soviet advancements in ballistic missile defence. Subsequently on 10 July 1980, the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote to US President Jimmy Carter requesting the purchase of Trident I missiles on a similar basis as the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement. However, following the acceleration of the US UGM-133 Trident II missiles, Thatcher wrote to US President Ronald Reagan in 1982 requesting the United Kingdom be allowed to procure the improved system instead. An agreement was made in March 1982 between the two countries, and under the agreement, Britain made a 5% research and development contribution.|$|E
25|$|An {{intelligent}} {{transportation system}} (ITS) {{is a system}} of hardware, software, and operators that allow better monitoring and control of traffic in order to optimize traffic flow. As the number of vehicle lane miles traveled per year continues to increase dramatically, and {{as the number of}} vehicle lane miles constructed per year has not been keeping pace, this has led to ever-increasing traffic congestion. As a <b>cost-effective</b> <b>solution</b> toward optimizing traffic, ITS presents a number of technologies to reduce congestion by monitoring traffic flows through the use of sensors and live cameras or analysing cellular phone data travelling in cars (floating car data) and in turn rerouting traffic as needed through the use of variable message boards (VMS), highway advisory radio, on board or off board navigation devices and other systems through integration of traffic data with navigation systems. Additionally, the roadway network has been increasingly fitted with additional communications and control infrastructure to allow traffic operations personnel to monitor weather conditions, for dispatching maintenance crews to perform snow or ice removal, as well as intelligent systems such as automated bridge de-icing systems which help to prevent accidents.|$|E

2500|$|Proposals for {{the modern}} rapid transit system now in service began in 1946 by Bay Area {{business}} leaders concerned with increased post-war migration and growing congestion in the region. An Army-Navy task force concluded that an additional trans-bay crossing would soon be needed and recommended a tunnel; however, actual planning for a rapid transit system did not begin until the 1950s. In 1951, California's legislature created the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission to study the Bay Area's long-term transportation needs.

2500|$|As cities {{struggle}} {{to comply with}} air quality standards, the ways that trees can help to clean the air should not be overlooked. The most serious pollutants in the urban atmosphere are ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfuric oxides (SOx) and particulate pollution. Ground-level ozone, or smog, is created by chemical reactions between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) {{in the presence of}} sunlight. High temperatures increase the rate of this reaction. Vehicle emissions (especially diesel), and emissions from industrial facilities are the major sources of NOx. [...] Vehicle emissions, industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, trees and other plants are the major sources of VOCs. Particulate pollution, or particulate matter (PM10 and PM25), is made up of microscopic solids or liquid droplets that can be inhaled and retained in lung tissue causing serious health problems. Most particulate pollution begins as smoke or diesel soot and can cause serious health risk to people with heart and lung diseases and irritation to healthy citizens. Trees are an important, <b>cost-effective</b> <b>solution</b> to reducing pollution and improving air quality.|$|E
