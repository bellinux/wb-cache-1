50|$|These scores {{can tell}} about the traits of the individual. Many qualifiers suggest a lack of decisiveness, use <b>of</b> <b>retractors</b> {{indicate}} an individual who will reconsider, use <b>of</b> <b>retractors</b> and negatives indicates {{a large amount of}} impulsivity, a combination of using I, me, explainers, negatives, and qualifiers, suggest anxiousness (and a less likely change of being the leader of a country), moodiness is identified by high I/we ratio, direct references, expression of feelings, and adverbial intensifiers. Other traits include an angry disposition, evidenced by high negatives, rhetorical questions, and direct references. Impulsive speakers use negatives more than any other group, controlling speakers use low qualifiers, steer the conversation, and use very few feelings. Histrionic individuals use adverbial intensifiers and exaggeration. Passivity is categorized by the extensive use of me. Domineering individuals use lots <b>of</b> qualifiers, <b>retractors,</b> and explainers as well as interruptions. Familiar behavior (establish report) is not surprising evidenced by the use of first names and high direct references.

40|$|Intra-cranial neurosurgical {{operations}} {{without the}} use <b>of</b> <b>retractors</b> <b>of</b> the brain are hardly imaginable. Contusions and infarctions of the brain are strongly related with this technique. In this study we evaluated the influence <b>of</b> two different <b>retractors</b> <b>of</b> the brain (metall- and silicon-retractors) on the cerebral microperfusion and traumatisation of the brain-tissue in a chinchilla-rabbit-model comparing LDSI (Laser-Doppler-Scanning-Imager) -measurements with histopathological analysis and MRI-images. Additionally the cerebro-protective effect of Mannitol, Nimodipine, Dexamethasone, Dopamine and Urapidil was examined during the application <b>of</b> the <b>retractors</b> {{as well as their}} influence on the rCBF (regional cerebral blood flow). The performed LDSI-measurements showed a reduction of perfusion of the brain tissue after application of pressure with the retractor. After the elimination of the pressure we were able to proof a reactive hyperaemia in all tests. Using LDSI-measurements the comparison of the two different types <b>of</b> <b>retractors</b> showed a significantly less pronounced reduction of the rCBF regarding the silicon-retractor. These findings were confirmed by histopathological analysis. The measurements of perfusion after application of the examined cerebro-protective substances showed best effects with Dopamine, Nimodipine and Mannitol. Dopamine was the most potent drug regarding the bloodflow. The Dexamethasone-group in this study did not show a positive influence on the histological presentation of post-ischaemic oedema. The originally planned comparison between the measurements of perfusion with the histopathological results and MRI-examinations coul technically not be realised. The LDSI-examination proofed {{to be a very good}} method for the assessment of regional perfusion. It is a usefull clinical tool for early identification of critical hypoperfusion. Summarized the use of a silicon-retractor in combination with Nimodipine or Mannitol is a usefull concept to lower damage to the brain-tissue after application of pressure with a retractor. Further and especially clinical observations are necessary to evaluate potential therapies with combinations of several neuro-protective drugs...|$|R

40|$|In {{the stick}} insect (Carausius morosus) imposed forward and {{backward}} movements of the coxa of the middle leg induce resistance reflexes in the retractor or protractor coxae muscles, depending on the direction of movement. The hairs of the ventral coxal hairplate (cxHPv) function as the primary transducer <b>of</b> the <b>retractor</b> part <b>of</b> the underlying feedback loop: bending of the hairs of the cxHPv during an imposed forward movement of the coxa leads to a reflex activation <b>of</b> the <b>retractor</b> motoneurones, whereas releasing of the hairs causes an inhibition of these motoneurones. Local nonspiking interneurones were investigated, which transmit information from the cxHPv onto the retractor motoneurones: 1) they are depolarized during bending of the hair sensilla of the cxHPv and 2) they decrease the activities <b>of</b> <b>retractor</b> motoneurones. In addition, four of the interneurones drive a protractor motoneurone, when they are depolarized. As bending stimuli at the cxHPv (mimicking an imposed forward movement of the leg) induce reflex activation <b>of</b> the <b>retractor</b> motoneurones and reflex inhibition of the protractor motoneurones, the physiology of the recorded interneurones appears to antagonize the resistance reflex in the thoraco-coxal joint. The results indicate that these nonspiking interneurones {{take part in the}} shaping of the reflex response and that furthermore these interneurones are involved in the organization of the motor output to the two antagonistic sets of motoneurones. The possible role of these interneurones might be the adjustment of the gain and of the time constant in the thoraco-coxal feedback loop...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of the use of Gelpi and Grevel retractors on multifidus muscle blood flow during hemilaminectomy, using a dorsolateral approach, for acute disc extrusion in dogs as measured by laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI). METHODS Blood flow in the multifidus muscles was measured intra-operatively using LSCI prior to insertion <b>of</b> the <b>retractors,</b> immediately after hemilaminectomy and removal <b>of</b> the <b>retractors,</b> and after 10 minutes of lavage of the surgical site. Plasma creatine kinase levels were measured preoperatively and 12 - 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Muscular blood flow was significantly decreased following retraction and remained lower than initial values 10 minutes after lavage in all dogs. The decrease in blood flow was significantly greater with Gelpi retractors (n = 8) than with Grevel retractors (n = 10). No significant relation was found between the duration of retraction and postoperative changes in creatine kinase levels or blood flow. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Findings in this study demonstrate a drop in blood flow within the multifidus muscles using the dorsolateral approach regardless <b>of</b> <b>retractor</b> type used. Gelpi retractors seem to have greater influence on muscular blood flow than Grevel retractors. Further studies are warranted to confirm this second finding...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundMedian {{sternotomy}} is {{the access}} {{of choice in}} cardiac surgery. Sternal retractors exert significant forces on the thoracic cage and might cause considerable damage. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>retractor</b> shape on local force distribution to obtain criteria for retractor design. MethodsTwo types <b>of</b> sternal <b>retractors</b> (straight [SSR] and curved [CSR]) were equipped with force sensors. Force distribution, total force, and displacement were recorded to a spread width of 10 cm in 18 corpses (11  males and 7 females; age, 62 ± 12 years). Both retractors were used in alternating sequence in 4 iterations in every corpse. Data were compared with respect to the different retractor blade shapes. ResultsMaximum total forces for full retraction <b>of</b> both <b>retractors</b> resulted in 349. 4 ± 77. 9 N. Force distribution during the first retraction for the cranial/median/caudal part of the sternum was 101. 5  ±  43. 9 / 29. 1 ± 33. 9 / 63. 0 ± 31. 4 N for the SSR and 38. 7 ± 41. 3 / 80. 9 ± 64. 5 / 34. 0 ± 25. 8 N for the CSR, respectively. During the 4 spreading cycles, the average force decreased from 224. 6 ± 61. 3 N in the first to 110. 8 ± 39. 8 N in the fourth iteration. The mean total force for the first retraction revealed 226. 4 ± 71. 9 N for the CSR and 222. 8 ± 52. 9 N for the SSR. ConclusionsThe shape <b>of</b> sternal <b>retractors</b> considerably influences the force distribution on the sternal incision.

40|$|Secretion {{of saliva}} to aid {{swallowing}} and digestion {{is an important}} physiological function found in many vertebrates and invertebrates. Pavlov reported classical <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation in dogs a century ago. <b>Conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation, however, has been so far reported only in dogs and humans, and its underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive because {{of the complexity of}} the mammalian brain. We previously reported that, in cockroaches Periplaneta americana, salivary neurons that control salivation exhibited increased responses to an odor after conditioning trials in which the odor was paired with sucrose solution. However, no direct evidence <b>of</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation was obtained. In this study, we investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>conditioning</b> trials on the level of salivation. Untrained cockroaches exhibited salivary responses to sucrose solution applied to the mouth but not to peppermint or vanilla odor applied to an antenna. After differential conditioning trials in which an odor was paired with sucrose solution and another odor was presented without pairing with sucrose solution, sucrose-associated odor induced an increase in the level of salivation, but the odor presented alone did not. The conditioning effect lasted for one day after conditioning trials. This study demonstrates, for the first time, classical <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation in species other than dogs and humans, thereby providing the first evidence of sophisticated neural control of autonomic function in insects. The results provide a useful model system for studying cellular basis <b>of</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>of</b> salivation in the simpler nervous system of insects...|$|R
