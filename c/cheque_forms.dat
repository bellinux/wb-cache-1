25|$|In 1984 {{was formed}} the Committee on Mechanisation in the Banking Industry (1984) whose {{chairman}} was Dr. C Rangarajan, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India. The major recommendations of this committee were introducing MICR technology {{in all the}} banks in the metropolises in India. This provided {{for the use of}} standardised <b>cheque</b> <b>forms</b> and encoders.|$|E
50|$|Sharples, once {{a prosperous}} town, is so entirely {{bound up with}} the {{shipyard}} that was its major employer that when the shipyard failed, so did the town. Unemployment is very high, and few shops remain open, the entire town living on the dole. The hospital is still open, however, and Warren is operated on successfully. While recovering he learns of the town's plight, as he starts becoming attracted to the Hospital's Almoner, Alice MacMahon - a law graduate who never practised but who is fiercely loyal to her town. He continues the pose of being indigent, and watches as others die through listlessness and lack of strength. Eventually his convalescence is complete and he is discharged. By this time, he has managed to have money and <b>cheque</b> <b>forms</b> sent to him, and he gives a major gift to the hospital, keeping it quiet.|$|E
5000|$|In the US, {{the bottom}} 5/8" [...] of the cheque is a keep out zone {{reserved}} for MICR characters only which {{should not be}} intruded upon by handwriting. One must be especially careful of lower case descenders when filling out the signature and memo lines which are often {{at the bottom of}} the cheque in close proximity. It is advisable to treat the signature and memo lines as boundaries rather than baselines and sign above them. Intrusion into the MICR area can cause problems when the cheque runs through the clearinghouse, requiring someone to print an MICR cheque correction strip and glue it to the cheque. Many new ATMs do not use deposit envelopes and actually scan the cheque at the time it is deposited and will reject cheques due to handwriting incursion which interferes with reading the MICR. This can cause considerable inconvenience as the depositor may have to wait days for the bank to be open and may have difficulty getting to the bank even when they are open; this can delay the availability of the portion of a deposit which their bank makes available immediately as well as the balance of the deposit. Terms of service for many mobile (cell phone camera) deposits also require the MICR section to be readable. Not all of the MICR characters have been printed at the time you manually fill in the cheque as additional characters will be printed later to encode the amount; thus your sloppy signature could obscure characters that you didn't realize would later be printed there. Since MICR characters are no longer necessarily printed in magnetic ink and will be scanned by optical rather than magnetic means, the readers will be unable to distinguish pen ink from pre-printed magnetic ink; these changes allow cheques to be printed on ordinary home and office printers without requiring pre-printed <b>cheque</b> <b>forms,</b> allow ATM deposit capture, allow mobile deposits, and facilitate electronic copies of cheques.|$|E
50|$|After Child died in 1713, {{his three}} sons ran the {{business}}, and during this time, the business {{transformed from a}} goldsmith's to a fully fledged bank. The bank claims {{it was the first}} to introduce a pre-printed <b>cheque</b> <b>form,</b> prior to which customers simply wrote a letter to their bank but sent it to their creditor who presented it for payment. Its first bank note was issued in 1729.|$|R
40|$|Numerals are {{the written}} and read symbols for numbers. Learning to identify, {{recognize}} and write numerals {{is an important}} part of early arithmetical development. Automatic numeral recognition of a script/language has variety of applications like reading postal zip code, passport number, employee code, bank <b>cheque,</b> <b>form</b> processing and so on. This paper presents a novice approach to identify the numerals; we call it as Circle partition approach which can be used after preprocessing stage. We have made the use of a new concept for feature extraction known as vector contour. The pros and cons and limitations of our approach are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{has been}} {{prepared by the}} Australian Payments Clearing Association Limited (APCA) {{in consultation with the}} printing industry. It is intended for designers, printers and customers who wish to use individually designed <b>cheques</b> and deposit <b>forms.</b> Paragraph amended (editorial changes), effective 28 / 06 / 04 The publication is available on the APCA website. This version of the Design Specifications for <b>Cheques</b> and Deposit <b>Forms</b> replaces the specifications contained in all previous versions. The publication gives the maximum and minimum dimensions for documents. It also includes requirements for design and layout, with particular emphasis on the location, dimensions, security features, and print requirements of the area for the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) system and the “Areas Of Interest ” used for the Intelligent Character Recognition system for image based processing...|$|R
5000|$|In the USA, a <b>cheque</b> as a <b>form</b> {{of payment}} can legally be refused {{for any reason}} (or no reason). Simply put: A payment via cheque is not a [...] "payment" [...] until the cheque was cashed and clears the banks.Example: You cannot order a fast food meal, throw a cheque {{on the counter and}} just leave with the meal, if they do not accept your payment via cheque, you would be {{committing}} larceny by taking the meal.|$|R
50|$|Cheques are {{the least}} used form of {{non-cash}} payment in Australia, but the most by value. Financial institutions are required to include BSB and bank account numbers on cheques, {{at the bottom of}} the <b>cheque</b> in MICR <b>form,</b> which identify the specific bank account number to be debited. BSB codes are also used on deposit and other vouchers. Paper transactions are processed under the Australian Paper Clearing System (APCS) (also known as CS1) drawn up by APCA. Account instructions which do not have a BSB code must be processed manually.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, American Express {{released}} the American Express Travelers Cheque Card, a stored-value card {{that serves the}} same purposes as a traveler's cheque, but {{can be used in}} stores like a credit card. It discontinued the card in October 2007. A number of other financial companies went on to issue stored-value or pre-paid debit cards containing several currencies that could be used like credit or debit cards at shops and at ATMs, mimicking the traveler's <b>cheque</b> in electronic <b>form.</b> One of the major examples is the Visa TravelMoney card.|$|R
5000|$|A {{certified}} check or certified <b>cheque</b> is a <b>form</b> of <b>cheque</b> {{for which the}} bank verifies that sufficient funds exist in the account to cover the cheque, and so certifies, {{at the time the}} cheque is written. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified cheque cannot be stopped (can't [...] "bounce"), and, in this manner, its liquidity is similar to cash, barring bank failure or illegal act (such as the funds being based on a fraudulent loan, at which point the cheque will be disavowed).|$|R
40|$|Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an {{interesting}} and challenging field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and machine vision and is used in many real life applications. Optical character recognition {{is a type of}} document analysis where a scanned document image that contains either machine printed or handwritten script is input to an OCR software engine, is translated into editable, machine-readable digital text format. With the spread of computers in public and private sectors and individual homes, automatic processing of tabular application <b>forms,</b> bank <b>cheques,</b> tax <b>forms,</b> census forms and postal mails has gained importance. Such automation needs research and development of handwritten characters/numerals recognition for different languages or scripts. The field of OCR is divided into two parts, one is recognition of machine printed characters and the second is recognition of handwritten characters. Recognizing handwritten text is an important area of research because of its various application potentials. Feature extraction is very important step in the process of OCR. This manuscript gives a review of comparative study of different feature extraction techniques used in OCR...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{hierarchical}} nearest-neighbor classifier algorithm which we conceived for the recognition of handwritten characters. Distances to all classes are used both as a decision criterion in the classification hierarchy and for generating class membership coefficients. These likelihood values can be easily integrated in a multi-agent cognitive environment. We introduce a new completely binary version of the k-means cluster algorithm and explain how a highly efficient implementation can be achieved using binary patterns. Performances for large character databases are presented. Keywords: pattern recognition, binary techniques, nearest-neighbor classifiers Introduction The recognition of handwritten text is a highly relevant industrial problem with a wide area of applications including the semi-automatic treatment of bank <b>forms,</b> <b>cheques,</b> and many other kinds of handwritten documents, {{as well as the}} automatic sorting of millions of letters every day. Although today standard Optic [...] ...|$|R
