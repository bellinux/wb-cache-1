Some {{of the stone}} vessels had <b>copper-coated</b> rims and {{are similar to the}} better known finds from tomb of Khasekhemwy.

50|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that 7.62 Tokarev surplus ammunition in the United States uses <b>copper-coated</b> mild steel bullets, and that this increases the chance of dangerous ricochets when fired at hard targets and can damage bullet traps often used on shooting ranges. While steel-core ammunition in 7.62×25 is available internationally, in the United States the importation of 7.62×25 cartridges loaded with <b>copper-coated</b> steel bullets is illegal; federal law defines these as armor-piercing pistol ammunition. The so-called steel bullets sold in the United States are generally lead-core bullets with copper-washed steel jackets, and these do not present a significantly greater risk of ricochet than a standard copper-jacketed projectile.|$|E

50|$|To correct this, {{the weak}} rolled brass {{cartridge}} {{was replaced by}} a stronger drawn brass version, and a longer loading lever was incorporated into the MK-IV to apply greater torque to operate the mechanism when fouled. These later variants were more reliable in battle, although it was not until smokeless nitro powders and <b>copper-coated</b> bullets were tried out in these rifles in the 1920s that accuracy and 100% reliability of cartridge case extraction was finally achieved by Birmingham ammunition makers (Kynoch). English hunters on various safaris, mainly in Africa, found the Martini using a cordite charge and a 500-grain full-metal-jacketed bullet effective in stopping large dangerous game such as hippopotamus up to 80 yards away.|$|E
50|$|Built in 1812-1825 in Castellammare di Stabia's {{shipyard}} for the Royal Navy of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, {{the ship}} was originally a French ship {{of the line of}} the Bucentaure class, ceded to the Kingdom of Naples in December 1813. She was heavily armed with 87 guns on two covered batteries and on the deck, with two batteries covered and one uncovered: 63 smoothbore guns of 24 pounds, 4 smoothbore Paixhans howitzers of 80 pounds, 4 smoothbore howitzers of 30 pounds and 16 24-pounder smoothbore carronades.

50|$|An {{improved}} version {{called the}} QBZ-95-1 was first seen undergoing trials in early 2010. The first formal {{public display of}} the improved version was with the Hong Kong Garrison, the first unit to receive the original QBZ-95, in a military parade in July 2012. Some improvements were ergonomic, with the safety switch moved to above the pistol grip and the right-sided ejection port moved forward with ejection of cartridges {{at an angle to}} allow left-handed firing. Unlike previous DBP87 and DBP85 5.8×42mm rounds, it fires better quality DBP10 ammunition with a non-corrosive primer, clean-burning propellant, and <b>copper-coated</b> steel casing with a copper-alloy-jacketed hardened steel-cored bullet. The QBZ-95-1 has a longer, heavier barrel and redesigned muzzle brake, a diamond-shaped cross-section on the handguard to disperse heat, a stronger buttstock and a redesigned trigger guard. The carrying handle was lowered to better position optics on the quick-releasable modified dovetail rail, and a pair of short rails at the sight's base allows for tactical accessories to be mounted.|$|E
50|$|The {{monument}} {{was built}} on the former Möltenorter Schanze (Möltenort Fieldwork) in Heikendorf and dedicated on 8 June 1930. After suffering structural damage, it was rebuilt in 1938. It consists of a 15.3-metre-high pillar, at the top of which sits a 4.8-metre-high eagle (designed by Fritz Schmoll). Extensive rust penetration was discovered in the internal steel supporting structure of the eagle in 2000, rendering renovation work necessary. Since 12 July 2001, the original eagle with its galvanised, <b>copper-coated</b> iron skin {{has been replaced by a}} recast bronze version similar to it (designed by the firm Noack from Berlin). The eagle was removed again in March 2012 for necessary reinforcement work after the detection of signs of fatigue in the supporting structure. The planned date of its return - initially scheduled to be six weeks later - was subjected to repeated delays thereafter; eventually, on 25 April 2013, the eagle was able to reassume its position.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the cathedral the complex contains the Church of Saint Quirinus, the only early Christian two-story church in Croatia. The Romanesque-style church was built {{in front of the}} cathedral, out of locally mined white stone. Because of lack of space its apses face southwards and it features three semicircular apses with romanesque arcades on top. There is also the Church of Saint Margaret, dedicated to Margaret of Antioch, and a bell tower. As early Christian churches did not have bell towers, a wooden tower was added behind the sacristy at a later date. Since there was very little building space left by then, it was constructed {{right in front of the}} Church of Saint Quirinus in 1515. In 1765 it underwent a thorough restoration, and the upper part was redesigned. As part of the restoration a sculpture of an angel made in Venice was installed on top. Since then the bell tower was renovated several times, last time in 1973 when the present-day plastic angel replaced the original <b>copper-coated</b> wooden sculpture.|$|E

Major improvements include a non-corrosive primer, a <b>copper-coated</b> steel case with a copper alloy bullet jacket with a 3.8 mm diameter hardened steel core for better penetration of (body) armor. It also uses a cleaner burning propellant {{so as not to}} leave residue inside the weapon after firing.

The report added: [...] "The assumption was always that she had committed suicide, even though there was no evidence to connect the SA80 weapon alongside her body with her death: no fingerprints were collected from the rifle; ammunition from it was inexplicably destroyed; the clothing Cheryl was wearing was never examined forensically; and, crucially, the bullet fragment said to have been collected at post-mortem, which we now know was ‘yellow’ (or brass, rather than <b>copper-coated),</b> had curiously disappeared". The magazine added that there was [...] "material to suggest Cheryl had been the victim of serious harassment and sexual violence", which it said had [...] "scandalously … remained buried" [...] in Surrey police files despite subsequent reviews of the force’s initial investigation by Devon and Cornwall Police and the Blake review. Pte James’ parents argued, through their QC, for their daughter’s body to be exhumed in the hope of recovering further bullet fragments. Coroner Mr Barker QC postponed making what he described as the [...] "difficult and unusual" [...] step of ordering an exhumation, but rejected the suggestion from Surrey police to delay the inquest and hold it alongside those of the other Deepcut recruits.
