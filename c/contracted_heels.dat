50|$|The {{majority}} of lameness originates in the hoof. For this reason, the hoof is closely scrutinized in shape, balance, shoeing, wear pattern, {{and for the}} presence of cracks, and <b>contracted</b> or sheared <b>heels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Examiners {{will also}} [...] "hoof test" [...] each foot by {{applying}} a metal instrument that squeezes the foot {{to test for}} deep pain. Diffuse sensitivity occurs with fracture or infection of the coffin bone, and laminitis. More localized sensitivity can be found with sole bruises, puncture wounds, hoof abscesses, and hot nails. Sensitivity over the middle third of the frog is consistent with navicular syndrome, but can also occur with sheared heels. To distinguish these two, the hoof testers may be applied over the heels, which will be sensitive {{in the case of}} any heel-related pain, such as sheared, <b>contracted,</b> or bruised <b>heels.</b> The hoof wall may also be percussed (struck with a hammer), which will produce a positive response in cases of hoof cracks that are causing the horse pain, laminitis, or a gravel (hoof abscess travelling up the hoof wall towards the coronary band).|$|R
5|$|The Rolls-Royce Mermaid {{propulsor}} pods {{fitted to}} QM2 {{have proven to}} be prone to failure. The failures had been so frequent and extensive that Carnival Corp. (USA), by way of its Cunard Line division, has taken Rolls-Royce Corp. (UK) to court in the United States in January 2009. The former placed claim that the Mermaid pod propulsion systems fitted to Cunard Line's flagship Queen Mary 2 are inherently defective in design. Cunard contends that Rolls Royce knew about the design deficiencies and deliberately conspired to mislead, deceive and defraud in the course of winning the <b>contract.</b> The Achilles’ <b>heel</b> of the design has been the motors' massive thrust bearings, which have continued to show a tendency to fail even after numerous attempts at redesign. In January 2011 Carnival Corporation was awarded US$24 million (approx. UK£15 million at the time of verdict) by the United States court due to the repeated failure of the propulsors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Contracted</b> <b>heels</b> are not {{normally}} inherited, but {{a symptom of}} limb unsoundness. A horse in pain will protect the limb by landing more softly on it. Over time, the structures contract. The source of pain should be explored by a vet.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Contracted</b> <b>heels</b> create {{problems}} like thrush. The horse loses shock absorption ability, potentially {{contributing to the}} development of navicular syndrome, sole bruising, laminitis, and corns. Heel expansibility may also be restricted, causing lameness from pressure around the coffin bone and reduced elasticity of the digital cushion.|$|E
50|$|This {{bacterium}} {{has been}} found to be associated with the foot disease thrush in horses. Thrush is a common fungal infection that occurs on the hoof of a horse, specifically in the region of the frog. F. necrophorum occurs naturally in the animal's environment, especially in wet, muddy, or unsanitary conditions, such as an unclean stall. Horses with deep clefts, or narrow or <b>contracted</b> <b>heels</b> are more at-risk to develop thrush.|$|E
5000|$|At SummerSlam, Bryan {{defeated}} Cena {{to win the}} WWE Championship. However, {{immediately after}} the match Triple H gave to Bryan a Pedigree, so that Randy Orton could cash in his Money in the Bank <b>contract,</b> turning <b>heel</b> {{for the first time}} since 2006. Vince McMahon then appeared in December at the end of the TLC pay-per-view, celebrating with Randy Orton and The Authority. In early 2014, McMahon stepped aside from his on-screen authority role in order to evaluate Triple H and Stephanies control of the company. McMahon returned on the November 3, 2014 episode of Raw as a fan favorite, making a stipulation that if Team Cena had defeated Team Authority at Survivor Series, The Authority would be removed from power. Team Cena won the match, but McMahon gave John Cena the option to reinstate The Authority. While the stable has a very particular idea of what they want the WWE to look like, who ranks at the top and who ranks at the bottom. In this regard, they play very tyrannical, power-abusing, and sadistic co-owners, justifying all of their actions as being [...] "whats best for business.", the entire stable consisted of Seth Rollins, who represented Triple-H and Stephanies selected future of the business and up-and-coming younger talent as well as a former WWE World Heavyweight Champion, J&J Security; Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury, who acted as Rollins personal bodyguards, Big Show; who represented the authorities muscle, and Kane, who formerly acted as the [...] "Director of Operations".|$|R
5000|$|Most recent research, {{particularly}} {{regarding the}} footstrike debate, has focused {{solely on the}} absorption phases for injury identification and prevention purposes. The propulsion phase of running involves the movement beginning at midstance until toe off. [...] From a full stride length model however, components of the terminal swing and footstrike can aid in propulsion.Set up for propulsion begins {{at the end of}} terminal swing as the hip joint flexes, creating the maximal range of motion for the hip extensors to accelerate through and produce force. As the hip extensors change from reciporatory inhibitors to primary muscle movers, the lower extremity is brought back toward the ground, although aided greatly by the stretch reflex and gravity. [...] Footstrike and absorption phases occur next with two types of outcomes. This phase can be only a continuation of momentum from the stretch reflex reaction to hip flexion, gravity and light hip extension with a heel strike, which does little to provide force absorption through the ankle joint. [...] With a mid/forefoot strike, loading of the gastro-soleus complex from shock absorption will serve to aid in plantar flexion from midstance to toe-off.As the lower extremity enters midstance, true propulsion begins. [...] The hip extensors continue contracting along with help from the acceleration of gravity and the stretch reflex left over from maximal hip flexion during the terminal swing phase. Hip extension pulls the ground underneath the body, thereby pulling the runner forward. During midstance, the knee should be in some degree of knee flexion due to elastic loading from the absorption and footstrike phases to preserve forward momentum. [...] The ankle joint is in dorsiflexion at this point underneath the body, either elastically loaded from a mid/forefoot strike or preparing for stand-alone concentric plantar flexion.All three joints perform the final propulsive movements during toe-off. [...] The plantar flexors plantar flex, pushing off from the ground and returning from dorsiflexion in midstance. This can either occur by releasing the elastic load from an earlier mid/forefoot strike or concentrically <b>contracting</b> from a <b>heel</b> strike. With a forefoot strike, both the ankle and knee joints will release their stored elastic energy from the footstrike/absorption phase. [...] The quadriceps group/knee extensors go into full knee extension, pushing the body off of the ground. At the same time, the knee flexors and stretch reflex pull the knee back into flexion, adding to a pulling motion on the ground and beginning the initial swing phase. The hip extensors extend to maximum, adding the forces pulling and pushing off of the ground. The movement and momentum generated by the hip extensors also contributes to knee flexion {{and the beginning of the}} initial swing phase.|$|R

50|$|Thrush is a {{very common}} {{bacterial}} infection that occurs on the hoof of a horse, specifically {{in the region of}} the frog. The bacterium involved is Fusobacterium necrophorum, and occurs naturally in the animal's environment — especially in wet, muddy, or unsanitary conditions, such as an unclean stall — and grows best with low oxygen. Horses with deep clefts, or narrow or <b>contracted</b> <b>heels</b> are more at risk of developing thrush.|$|E
5000|$|May be conformationally induced from angular limb {{deformity}} or malalignments of {{the bones}} within the hoof. These conformational problems cause excess strain {{on one side of}} hoof making it steepen, while the side with less impact grows to a flare. The coronary band often slopes asymmetrically due to pushing of hoof wall & coronet on steep side, which gets more impact than flared. May develop sheared heels, causing lameness issues, <b>contracted</b> <b>heels</b> & thrush.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{protection}} {{provided by the}} hoof, the coffin bone can be injured and fractured. [...] For example, inflammatory conditions such as laminitis may lead to rotation of the coffin bone and associated permanent damage due to the coffin bone pulling away from the hoof wall as the laminar layer tears apart. Pedal osteitis is another common inflammatory condition. Fractures can also occur to coffin bones and, depending on the fracture, can cause severe lameness. [...] Other conditions linked to the conformation of the horse, such as flexural contractures may also affect the coffin bone. For example, the coffin joint can become deformed and lead to changes of the coffin bone within the hoof capsule if the horse has an untreated club foot. [...] <b>Contracted</b> <b>heels</b> can also affect {{the shape of the}} coffin bone, making it grow away from its normal, healthy shape. [...] X-rays can diagnose injury, determine the position of the bone, and verify the type of damage that may have been received. Once injured, remedial shoeing can help protect the coffin bone from further trauma. Treatment of assorted disorders may also involve use of shoe pads, anti-inflammatory medication, and management changes.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} evaluate, through biometry, the forelimb hoof of horses {{participating}} in show jumping, barrel, long rope and polo competitions. Thirty subjects were assessed {{in relation to}} each competition (total of 120 animals). The linear measurements (cm) included the dorsal length of the toe; medial and lateral lengths of the quarter; medial and lateral heights of the quarter; lateral and medial lengths of the heel; medial and lateral heights of the heel; hoof length; hoof width; frog length; and frog width. The following angles (°) were measured: toe angle, pastern angle, heel angle and shoulder palette. The length of the horseshoe, coronet circumference and body weight were also assessed. With the use of hoof biometric evaluation was possible to identify the imbalances of forelimb in athletic horses and the most common were broken-backward hoof angle, with 96. 7 % of the animals showing this in the right forelimb (RFL) and 95. 8 % in the left forelimb (LFL); and <b>contracted</b> <b>heels,</b> with 95. 0 % in the RFL and 87. 6 % in the LFL. The competition type in which greatest numbers of hoof balance abnormalities were shown was the long rope, followed by the barrel. There were high frequencies of medial/lateral imbalance in all the sports. We conclude that animals used in functional tests have {{a high incidence of}} hoof balance abnormalities in the forelimbs...|$|E
