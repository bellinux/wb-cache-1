40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} {{mechanical}} polishing on the microstructure and corrosion behaviour of AA 7075 aluminium alloy are investigated. It was found that a nano-grained, near-surface deformed layer, up to 400 nm thickness, is developed due to significant surface shear stress during mechanically polishing. Within the near-surface deformed layer, the alloying elements have been redistributed and the microstructure of the alloy is modified; in particular, the normal MgZn 2 particles for T 6 are absent. However, segregation bands, approximately 10 -nm thick, <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>zinc,</b> are found at the grain boundaries within the near-surface deformed layer. The presence of such segregation bands promoted localised corrosion along the grain boundaries within the near-surface deformed layer due to microgalvanic action. During anodic polarisation of mechanically polished alloy in sodium chloride solution, two breakdown potentials were observed at − 750 mV and − 700 mV, respectively. The first breakdown potential is {{associated with an increased}} electrochemical activity of the near-surface deformed layer, and the second breakdown potential is associated with typical pitting of the bulk alloy...|$|E
30|$|As {{previously}} indicated, in {{this study}} {{it was found that}} CoBrA artists often used zinc white. To investigate this further, PCA was applied on a subset of 30 paintings by five CoBrA artists. The results indicated that the main difference between the paints was the zinc to lead ratio. While most paintings <b>contain</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>zinc</b> white, there is a selection of paintings containing zinc white and lead white. In this dataset, neither the date nor the artist coincides with the type of paint used therefore the visualization is omitted. This suggests random pigment choice in the CoBrA group. However, this did not compromise the detection of general trends in the full dataset.|$|R

40|$|Background: Quercetinases are metal-dependent dioxygenases of the cupin superfamily. While fungal quercetinases are copper proteins, {{recombinant}} Streptomyces quercetinase (QueD) {{was previously}} described {{to be capable}} of incorporating Ni 2 + and some other divalent metal ions. This raises the questions of which factors determine metal selection, and which metal ion is physiologically relevant. Results: Metal occupancies of heterologously produced QueD proteins followed the order Ni[*]>[*]Co[*]>[*]Fe[*]>[*]Mn. Iron, in contrast to the other metals, does not support catalytic activity. QueD isolated from the wild-type Streptomyces sp. strain FLA <b>contained</b> <b>mainly</b> nickel and <b>zinc.</b> In vitro synthesis of QueD in a cell-free transcription-translation system yielded catalytically active protein when Ni 2 + was present, and comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of in vitro produced proteins suggested that Ni 2 + ions support correct folding. Replacement of individual amino acids of the 3 His/ 1 Glu metal binding motif by alanine drastically reduced or abolished quercetinase activity and affected its structural integrity. Only substitution of the glutamate ligand (E 76) by histidine resulted in Ni- and Co-QueD variants that retained the native fold and showed residual catalytic activity. Conclusions: Heterologous formation of catalytically active, native QueD holoenzyme requires Ni 2 +, Co 2 + or Mn 2 +, i. e., metal ions that prefer an octahedral coordination geometry, and an intact 3 His/ 1 Glu motif or a 4 His environment of the metal. The observed metal occupancies suggest that metal incorporation into QueD is governed by the relative stability of the resulting metal complexes, rather than by metal abundance. Ni 2 + most likely is the physiologically relevant cofactor of QueD of Streptomyces sp. FLA. <br...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of bimetallic silver-cobalt clusters {{with less than}} 50 atoms is studied experimentally and their associated geometries are predicted by classical modeling. The clusters are created by laser vaporization and inert gas condensation. Their mass distribution is analyzed with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. For clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> silver, we find strong quantum size effects related to itinerant behavior of the silver and cobalt valence electrons. In the case of clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> cobalt, no pronounced size effects appear in the mass spectra. Photofragmentation experiments reveal that neutral silver atom evaporation is the favorable channel, suggesting that the Ag{single bond}Co bonds are weaker than the Co{single bond}Co bonds. Consistently, and for both sets of clusters, Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations predict these clusters to have icosahedral based structures that may depend on temperature. In clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> silver, cobalt sits at the cluster center and fragmentation proceeds by the evaporation of silver surface atoms. In clusters <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> cobalt, silver atoms also locate at the periphery and are more weakly bound to the cluster than cobalt surface atoms. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.
