Muybridge planned to take a series of {{photographs}} on 15 June 1878, at Stanford's Palo Alto Stock Farm (now the campus of Stanford University). He placed numerous large glass-plate cameras in a line {{along the edge of the}} track; the shutter of each was triggered by a thread as the horse passed (in later studies he used a <b>clockwork</b> <b>device</b> to set off the shutters and capture the images). The path was lined with cloth sheets to reflect as much light as possible. He copied the images in the form of silhouettes onto a disc to be viewed in a machine he had invented, which he called a [...] "zoopraxiscope". This device was later regarded as an early movie projector, and the process as an intermediate stage toward motion pictures or cinematography.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{example of}} a clockwork mechanism is the Antikythera mechanism, a first-century BC geared analogue computer, somewhat astrolabe-like, for calculating astronomical positions and eclipses, recovered from a Greek shipwreck. There are many other accounts of <b>clockwork</b> <b>devices</b> in ancient Greece, even in its mythology, and the mechanism itself is sophisticated enough to indicate a significant history of lesser devices leading up to its creation.|$|R
5000|$|In episode 13, it was {{revealed}} that the name [...] "Clockwork" [...] was based on the 1879 short story [...] "The Ablest Man in the World" [...] by Edward Page Mitchell. The story is about a man who was mute and mentally handicapped and grew up in a mental asylum. His life was changed when a scientist replaced his brain with a <b>clockwork</b> <b>device</b> that intended to make the patient—who has become a Russian baron {{at the time of the}} story—become Russia's answer to Napoleon.|$|E
50|$|Arthur {{arrives at}} the main hall and {{witnesses}} all twelve ghosts orbiting a <b>clockwork</b> <b>device</b> of rotating metal rings, with his children at the center. Discovering Cyrus' true fate, Arthur fights Cyrus while Maggie disrupts the machine's controls. The ghosts hurl Cyrus into the rings, slicing him to pieces. With the encouragement of Dennis' ghost, Arthur jumps into the machine, avoiding the rings and saving his children. The walls of the house shatter as the malfunctioning machine rips itself apart, freeing the ghosts. Dennis smiles at Arthur and departs, and Jean's ghost appears before the family and tells them that she loves them before she {{and all the other}} ghosts disappear.|$|E
5000|$|The {{appeal of}} the Fotoplayer to theatre owners {{was the fact that}} it took no major musical skill to operate. The Fotoplayer would play the piano and pipe organ {{mechanically}} using an electric motor, an air pump, and piano rolls while the user of the Fotoplayer would follow the onscreen action while pulling cords, pushing buttons, and pressing pedals to produce relatable sounds to what was occurring onscreen. [...] These actions could create sounds such as a steamboat whistle, a bird chirp, wind, thunder, a telephone bell, as well as many others. On Fotoplayers specifically, most effects were created using leather cords, with wooden handles on the ends, directly connected to the effects. For example, the steamboat whistle sound effect was created using a household bellows with a whistle at the end. Pulling the cord compressed the bellows, delivering a gust of air into the whistle. Creating a drum roll on the other hand was a bit more complicated. A <b>clockwork</b> <b>device</b> was needed to time the strikes of the drum which required constant winding.|$|E
50|$|Clockworks {{are often}} {{powered by a}} {{clockwork}} motor consisting of a mainspring, a spiral torsion spring of metal ribbon. Energy is stored in the mainspring manually by winding it up, turning a key attached to a ratchet which twists the mainspring tighter. Then {{the force of the}} mainspring turns the clockwork's gears, until the stored energy is used up. The adjectives wind-up and spring-powered refer to mainspring-powered <b>clockwork</b> <b>devices,</b> which include clocks and watches, kitchen timers, music boxes, and wind-up toys.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "music box" [...] is also {{applied to}} <b>clockwork</b> <b>devices</b> where a {{removable}} metal disk or cylinder was used {{only in a}} [...] "programming" [...] function without producing the sounds directly by means of pins and a comb. Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified wind instrument or plucked the chords on a modified string instrument. Some devices could do {{both at the same}} time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the Orchestrion.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} as a mysterious Brown Leather Man enters George's watch shop with a strange device in need of repair, {{claiming}} it was made by George's father, a brilliant watchmaker skilled in all forms of <b>clockwork</b> <b>devices.</b> George, who has inherited his father's shop, but not his father's talent, agrees {{to look at the}} device, although he knows his chances of repairing it are slim at best. George is quickly dragged into an ongoing conflict involving the Royal Anti-Society, the Godly Army and the Ladies Union for the Suppression of Carnal Vice. His investigation leads him to a strange neighborhood in London, Wetwick, which is inhabited by denizens who are a hybrid of humans and fish.|$|R

This device was later regarded as an early movie projector, and the process as an intermediate stage toward motion pictures or cinematography. The study is called Sallie Gardner at a Gallop or The Horse in Motion; it shows images of the horse with all feet off the ground. This did not take place when the horse's legs were extended to the front and back, as imagined by contemporary illustrators, but when its legs were collected beneath its body as it switched from [...] "pulling" [...] with the front legs to [...] "pushing" [...] with the back legs.|$|E
40|$|I don’t {{believe that}} {{linguistics}} and psychoanalysis offer {{a great deal}} to the cinema. On the contrary, the biology of the brain – molecular biology – does. ” Gilles Deleuze Models of the brain are inextricably linked to the surrounding cultural episteme: whether it is viewed as a complex <b>clockwork</b> <b>device,</b> a computer, a self-regulating network or even a cinema screen, our understanding of neurophysiology has always relied on discourses and images taken from other fields. In turn, however, our knowledge of cerebral processes (such as sight for instance) has always, inevitably, affected the way that we approach artworks, literary texts and cultural artefacts. Based on this, this paper looks at how recent neuroscientific research on vision and cognition can help us better understand the processes inherent in film theory. Focussing mainly on the recently discovered concept of the mirror neuron but also citing synaesthesia and limbic perceptual processing, I suggest that neuroscience can provide us with a fertile new ground for thinking about areas such as spectatorship and the facilitation of emotional affect, it can also offer us alternatives to monolithic ideas like the Gaze and the patriarchal nature of visual pleasure. Prompted perhaps by a shift in scopic thinking, some recent neuroscientific research has even mirrored film and cultural theory by foregrounding notions such embodiment, cross-model perception and mimesis, adding to the dialogic relationship that exists between these two disciplines. This paper then is not only concerned with how different fields communicate but with how each can provide models, metaphors and frameworks for the other...|$|E

50|$|The fultograph was an early, <b>clockwork</b> image-receiving <b>device,</b> {{similar in}} {{function}} to fax machines. It took {{signals from the}} loudspeaker socket of a radio receiver and used an electrochemical process to darken areas of sensitised paper wrapped on a rotating drum. Invented by Otho Fulton, the system was used briefly in the late 1920s to broadcast images to homes by radio. The machines themselves were expensive (£22 15s 0d in 1928) and required a good receiver to operate.|$|R
5000|$|In 1663 Christopher Wren {{presented}} the Royal Society with a {{design for a}} [...] "weather clock". A drawing shows meteorological sensors moving pens over paper driven by <b>clockwork.</b> Such <b>devices</b> did not become standard in meteorology for two centuries. The concept has remained virtually unchanged as evidenced by pneumatic chart recorders, where a pressurized bellows displaces a pen. Integrating sensors, displays, recorders and controls was uncommon until the industrial revolution, limited by both need and practicality.|$|R
5000|$|A conical {{pendulum}} {{consists of}} a weight (or bob) fixed {{on the end of}} a string or rod suspended from a pivot. Its construction is similar to an ordinary pendulum; however, instead of swinging back and forth, the bob of a conical pendulum moves at a constant speed in a circle with the string (or rod) tracing out a cone. The conical pendulum was first studied by the English scientist Robert Hooke around 1660 [...] as a model for the orbital motion of planets. [...] In 1673 Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens calculated its period, using his new concept of centrifugal force in his book Horologium Oscillatorium. Later it was used as the timekeeping element in a few mechanical clocks and other <b>clockwork</b> timing <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|The feudal mode of {{production}} {{is the third}} mode {{of production}} but the second exploitative mode of production, by the systems of the West between {{the fall of the}} classical European culture and the rise of capitalism, though similar systems existed in most of the world. The primary form of property is the possession of land in reciprocal contract relations: the possession of human beings as peasants or serfs is dependent upon their being entailed upon the land. Exploitation occurs through reciprocated contract (though ultimately resting on the threat of forced extractions). The ruling class is usually a nobility or aristocracy. The primary forces of production include highly complex agriculture (two, three field, lucerne fallowing and manuring) with the addition of non-human and non-animal power <b>devices</b> (<b>clockwork,</b> wind-mills) and the intensification of specialisation in the crafts—craftsmen exclusively producing one specialised class of product.|$|R
