The Society for Historical Archaeology letter voiced similar concerns to those of other groups, however, J.W.

Citizens with a CAP would be inclined to excavate in stream banks and other areas near waterways according to the letter. J.W. Joseph also appeals to the state by bringing up that <b>CAP</b> <b>holders</b> would create navigational hazards in waterways and that the state would incur great costs to run the program with little return from the sale of permits.|$|R

60|$|Percussion Caps.--Caps may {{be carried}} very {{conveniently}} {{by means of}} a ring, with two dozen nipple-shaped beads, made of some metal, strung upon it; each bead being intended to be covered by a percussion-cap. The beads are cleft down the middle, which gives them a slight springiness, that more effectually secures the caps that are placed upon them: the ring is tied by a thong to the belt or button-hole. It is very Difficult, without this contrivance, to keep caps free from sand, crumbs, and dirt, yet always at hand when required. I can confidently recommend it, though as it is old-fashioned and not well suited for sportsmen in England, it is rarely to be met with. Spring <b>cap</b> <b>holders</b> are, I am sure, too delicate for rough travel.|$|R

Besides, the attenuation of the photon by the source-to-detector system (detector material, detector end <b>cap,</b> and <b>holder</b> material) was considered and determined. This method is straightforwardly useful in setting up the efficiency calibration curve for NaI(Tl) scintillation detector, when no calibration sources exist in volume shape.

50|$|The {{plate was}} then {{carried to the}} camera in a {{light-tight}} plate holder. Withdrawing a protective dark slide or opening a pair of doors in the holder exposed the sensitized surface within the dark camera and removing a cap from the camera lens began the exposure, creating an invisible latent image on the plate. Depending on the sensitization chemistry used, {{the brightness of the}} lighting, and the light-concentrating power of the lens, the required exposure time ranged from a few seconds to many minutes. After the exposure was judged to be complete, the lens was <b>capped</b> and the <b>holder</b> was again made light-tight and removed from the camera.|$|R
500|$|Rod Oram commented in a Sunday Star Times {{column that}} the National Government's {{changes to the}} ETS were [...] "a giant step backwards" [...] which would [...] "drive up emissions, {{perpetuate}} old technology, necessitate ever-greater subsidies and reduce New Zealand's international competitiveness and reputation." [...] Oram considered that the amendments to the NZ ETS destroyed its effectiveness. His examples were: removing limits on emissions by adopting intensity-based allocation of free carbon credits, slavishly following climate-laggard Australia, minimising the price incentive by extending the free allocation of credits for 75 years, muting the price signal with a $NZ25 per tonne of carbon <b>cap,</b> forcing forestry <b>holders</b> of credits to sell them overseas because of the $NZ25 per tonne cap, cancelling complementary measures such as fuel efficiency standards, giving in to special pleading via subsidies, and creating uncertainty for business.|$|R

30|$|Reactive {{calcination}} of {{the precursor}} {{was carried out}} by the introduction of a low concentration of chemically reactive CO–air mixture (4.5 % CO) at a total flow rate of 32.5  ml min− 1 over the hot precursors. The temperature of the reactor bed was increased from room temperature to 160  °C where CO conversion has started. This temperature was maintained for a defined period of time where the CO concentration was measured in the exit stream of the reactor at regular intervals until 100 % CO conversion was achieved. After achieving total CO conversion, the resultant catalyst was annealed for half an hour at the same temperature, than the temperature was increased up to 300  °C and held for an hour followed by cooling down to room temperature in the same environment. The catalysts prepared as given above were stored in <b>capped</b> glass sample <b>holders</b> placed in desiccators.|$|R
40|$|Forty 10 Be {{samples of}} Antarctic ice (DSS 0506 -pit) along with {{associated}} procedural blanks, {{measured at the}} ANTARES AMS facility at ANSTO {{were found to have}} 10 - 100 times the 10 B levels of routine BeO samples and blanks (full procedural blanks with this beryl carrier are typically 10 Be/ 9 Be < 5 x 10 - 15). These exceptionally high boron rates (measured via an active absorber cell filled with argon gas), coupled with the relatively low 10 Be/ 9 Be ratios of ice samples, made any correction to the raw 10 Be detector count rate highly unreliable and uncertain. As this was a unique sample set, a method for reprocessing the targets to remove the boron was developed and tested. For measurement on ANTARES ~ 0. 5 mg BeO is mixed with ~ 2. 0 mg of niobium powder and rearpressed into an aluminium target holder with a 1. 6 mm diameter recess at 120 kPa. To reprocess the samples, this BeO/Nb mixture was physically removed from the target holders by pushing the sample loading pin forward with a hand press. The beryllium was separated from the niobium by dissolving the BeO in concentrated H 2 SO 4. This solution was then heated with HF to remove the boron as BF 3. The beryllium was then re-precipitated as Be(OH) 2 and calcined to BeO, which was then mixed with new niobium powder before being rear-pressed into a detachable <b>cap</b> target <b>holder</b> with a smaller (1 mm) diameter recess. Overall yields for this process averaged 40 %. Boron levels for all the original samples and blanks returned to acceptable levels, with 10 Be/ 9 Be blanks of ~ 10 x 10 - 15. Extensive testing of the equipment, reagents and laboratory failed to determine the source of the boron. As a precautionary measure, a similar H 2 SO 4 /HF step has been subsequently added to the standard ice processing method, resulting in consistently low boron levels without any decrease in processing yields.
