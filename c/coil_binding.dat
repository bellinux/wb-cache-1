25|$|Spiral binding is {{the most}} {{economical}} form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases and other publications where it is necessary or desirable {{to be able to}} open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along {{the entire length of the}} spine of the page and winding a wire helix (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral <b>coil</b> <b>binding</b> uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.|$|E

40|$|Team Rhin-O-Tuff {{was asked}} by Performance Design Inc. to develop a simpler, cheaper {{and easier to use}} machine to spin plastic <b>coil</b> <b>bindings</b> onto pre-punched {{document}}s. The Gate-R-Trap semi-automated binding system modernizes the document binding industry and by taking the document out of the user’s hands during the binding process. It utilizes a uniquely designed coil guide insertion system that increases successful binding by 20 %. The prototype includes a document sizing tray that automatically provides the user digital feedback for the appropriate coil size for each individual document. This makes manual measurement no longer required. The Gate-R-Trap’s floating head draws the coil through the document as opposed to previous technology which pushes the coil from behind. This can be compared to the proverbial “pushing versus pulling a rope” analogy creating less coil deformation and document damage. The Gate-R-Trap also includes a built-in cutting and crimping system to remove the coil overrun at each document end. In past roller insertion systems, the user had to remove excess coil with hand held pliers. Overall, the Gate-R-Trap system combines user friendliness, efficiency, and functionality in a much more cost effective platform than any other product currently in its target price range...|$|R

The Rad 50 ABC–ATPase complex with Mre 11 {{nuclease}} {{is essential}} for dsDNA break repair, telomere maintenance and ataxia telangiectasia–mutated kinase checkpoint signaling. How Rad 50 affects Mre 11 functions and how ABC–ATPases communicate nucleotide binding and ligand states across long distances and among protein partners are questions that have remained obscure. Here, structures of Mre 11 –Rad 50 complexes define the Mre 11 2 -helix Rad 50 binding domain (RBD) that forms a four-helix interface with Rad 50 coiled coils adjoining the ATPase core. Newly identified effector and basic-switch helix motifs extend the ABC–ATPase signature motif to link ATP-driven Rad 50 movements to <b>coiled</b> <b>coils</b> <b>binding</b> Mre 11, implying an ~ 30 -Å pull on the linker to the nuclease domain. Both RBD and basic-switch mutations cause clastogen sensitivity.

Introduction of SRF-S 162 D into SRF null ES cells permitted transcription of the c-fos gene but was unable to rescue expression of myogenic contractile genes. Transition of proliferating C 2 C 12 myoblasts to postfusion myocytes after serum withdrawal was associated with a progressive decline in SRF-S 162 phosphorylation and an increase in α-actin gene expression.

40|$|Late blight, {{caused by}} the oomycete {{pathogen}} Phytophthora infestans, is the most devastating potato disease in the world. Control of late blight in the United States and other developed countries relies extensively on fungicide application. We previously demonstrated that the wild diploid potato species Solanum bulbocastanum is highly resistant to all known races of P. infestans. Potato germplasm derived from S. bulbocastanum has shown durable and effective resistance in the field. Here we report the cloning of the major resistance gene RB in S. bulbocastanum by using a map-based approach in combination with a long-range (LR) -PCR strategy. A cluster of four resistance genes of the CC-NBS-LRR (<b>coiled</b> coil–nucleotide <b>binding</b> site–Leu-rich repeat) class was found within the genetically mapped RB region. Transgenic plants containing a LR-PCR product {{of one of these}} four genes displayed broad spectrum late blight resistance.

Interactions such as coiled <b>coils,</b> SH3 domain-peptide <b>binding</b> or SpyTag/SpyCatcher have helped to give such control.

40|$|Proteins {{containing}} nucleotide binding sites (NBS) encoded by plant resistance genes play {{an important}} role in the response of plants to a wide array of pathogens. In this paper, an in silico search was conducted in order to identify and characterize members of NBS-encoding gene family in the tribe of Triticeae. A final dataset of 199 sequences was obtained by four search methods. Motif analysis confirmed the general structural organization of the NBS domain in cereals, characterized by the presence of the six commonly conserved motifs: P-loop, RNBS-A, Kinase- 2, Kinase- 3 a, RNBS-C and GLPL. We revealed the existence of 11 distinct distribution patterns of these motifs along the NBS domain. Four additional conserved motifs were shown to be significantly present in all 199 sequences. Phylogenetic analyses, based on genetic distance and parsimony, revealed a significant overlap between Triticeae sequences and <b>Coiled</b> coil-Nucleotide <b>binding</b> site-Leucine rich repeat (CNL) -type functional genes from monocotyledons. Furthermore, several Triticeae sequences belonged to clades containing functional homologs from non Triticeae species, which has allowed for these sequences to be functionally assigned.

In addition, the 18 R protein was stimulated to unwind longer DNA duplexes by a 25 kDa protein purified from vaccinia virions, representing the cleaved product of the L 4 R gene, an ssDNA binding protein. Purified recombinant 25 kDa L 4 R protein also stimulated 18 R DNA helicase activity and maximum activity was observed only when there were < 13 nucleotides of DNA per molecule of L 4 R protein. The DNA helicase activity of the A 18 R protein was not stimulated by either recombinant 25 kDa L 4 R protein or by an E. <b>coil</b> ssDNA <b>binding</b> protein. Vaccinia virus (VV) encodes four proteins, D 6 R, DllL, I 8 R and A 18 R, with amino acid similarity to the superfamily helicases (Koonin & Senkevich, 1992).

40|$|The two heavy {{chains of}} kinesin- 1 are {{dimerized}} through extensive coiled coil regions and fold into an inactive conformation through {{interaction of the}} C-terminal tail domains with the N-terminal motor (head) domains. Although this potentially allows a dimer of tail domains to interact symmetrically with a dimer of head domains, we report here that {{only one of the}} two available monomeric tail peptides is sufficient for tight binding and inhibition of a dimer of head domains. With a dimeric tail construct, the other tail peptide does not make tight contact with the head dimer and can bind a second head dimer to form a complex containing one tail dimer and two head dimers. The IAK domain and neighboring positively charged region of the tail is sufficient for tight half-site interaction with a dimer of heads. The interaction of tails with monomeric heads is weak, but a head dimer produced by the dimerization of the neck coil is not required because an artificial dimer of head domains also binds monomeric tail peptides with half-site stoichiometry in the complete absence of the native neck <b>coil.</b> The <b>binding</b> of tail peptides to head dimers is fast and readily reversible as determined by FRET between mant-ADP bound to the head dimer and a tail labeled with GFP.

40|$|To gain {{an insight}} into the {{processes}} underlying disease resistance and its durability, the durable Tm- 22 resistance gene was compared with the broken Tm- 2 resistance gene. The Tm- 2 gene of tomato could be isolated via PCR with primers based on the Tm- 22 sequence. The Tm- 2 gene, like the Tm- 22 gene, encodes an 861 amino acid polypeptide, which belongs to the <b>coiled</b> coil/nucleotide <b>binding</b> site/leucine-rich repeat class of resistance proteins. The functionality {{and the nature of}} the isolated Tm- 2 gene were confirmed by introducing the gene under the control of the 35 S promoter into tomato mosaic virus-susceptible tobacco. This transgenic tobacco was crossed with transgenic tobacco plants producing the movement protein (MP) -authenticated MP as the Avr protein of the Tm- 2 resistance. The Tm- 22 and Tm- 2 open reading frames only differ in seven nucleotides, which on a protein level results in four amino acid differences, of which two are located in the nucleotide binding site and two are located in the leucine-rich repeat domain. The small difference between the two proteins suggests a highly similar interaction of these proteins with the MP, which has major implications for the concept of durability. Comparison of the two resistance-conferring alleles (Tm- 2 and Tm- 22) with two susceptible alleles (tm- 2 and lptm- 2) allowed discussion of the structure–function relationship in the Tm- 2 proteins. It is proposed that the Tm- 2 proteins display a partitioning of the leucine-rich repeat domain, in which the N-terminal and C-terminal parts function in signal transduction and MP recognition, respectively. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{appended}} a rationally designed acidic amphipathic protein sequence to the N-terminus of a leucine zipper. Circular dichroism {{data indicate}} that this engineered polypeptide sequence can 'zipper' up the basic region of a bZIP monomer into a heterodimeric coiled coil.

Only five sources of resistance have been identified (Resistance to Phakopsora pachyrhizi 1 [Rpp 1], Rpp 2, Rpp 3, Rpp 4, and Rpp 5). Rpp 4 was previously identified in the resistant genotype PI 459025 B and mapped within 2 centimorgans of Satt 288 on soybean chromosome 18 (linkage group G). Using simple sequence repeat markers, we developed a bacterial artificial chromosome contig for the Rpp 4 locus in the susceptible cv Williams 82 (Wm 82).

Constructs containing regions of the Wm 82 Rpp 4 candidate genes were used for virus-induced gene silencing experiments to silence resistance in PI 459025 B, confirming that orthologous genes confer resistance. Using primers developed from conserved sequences in the Wm 82 Rpp 4 candidate genes, we identified five Rpp 4 candidate genes (Rpp 4 C 1 –Rpp 4 C 5 [PI 459025 B]) from the resistant genotype. Additional markers developed from the Wm 82 Rpp 4 bacterial artificial chromosome contig further defined the region containing Rpp 4 and eliminated Rpp 4 C 1 (PI 459025 B) and Rpp 4 C 3 (PI 459025 B) as candidate genes. Sequencing of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products revealed that Rpp 4 C 4 (PI 459025 B) was highly expressed in the resistant genotype, while expression of the other candidate genes was nearly undetectable.

40|$|A {{synthetic}} peptide {{based on the}} leash and &# 945;-helical region (LHR) of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 envelope is a potent inhibitor of viral entry into cells. The inhibitory peptide targets a triple-stranded coiled-coil motif of the fusion-active transmembrane glycoprotein and in a trans-dominant negative manner blocks resolution to the trimer-of-hairpins form. The LHR-mimetic is, therefore, functionally analogous to the C 34 /T 20 -type inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus. Previous attempts to shorten the bioactive peptide produced peptides with severely attenuated activity. We now demonstrate that truncated peptides often suffer from poor solubility and impaired coiled <b>coil</b> <b>binding</b> properties, and we identify features that are critical to peptide function. In particular, the &# 945;-helical region of the LHR-mimetic is necessary but not sufficient for inhibitory activity. Moreover, two basic residues are crucial for coiled-coil binding and efficient inhibition of membrane fusion. By retaining these basic residues and a region of main chain peptide contacts with the coiled coil, a core LHR-mimetic was obtained that retains both the inhibitory properties and solubility profile of the parental peptide. Variants of the core peptide inhibit both membrane fusion and infection of cells by free viral particles, but unexpectedly, infection by virions was more susceptible to inhibition by low activity inhibitors than syncytium formation. The core inhibitor provides a valuable lead {{in the search for}} smaller more bio-available peptides and peptido-mimetics that possess anti-viral activity.

Syntaxin 13 inhibited early endosomal fusion and botulinum toxin/E inhibition of early endosomal fusion was reversed by addition of SNAP- 25 (150 – 206), confirming a role for syntaxin 13, and establishing a role for SNAP- 25 in endosomal fusion. Hrs inhibited formation of the syntaxin 13 –SNAP- 25 –VAMP 2 complex by displacing VAMP 2 from the complex. These data suggest that SNAP- 25 is a receptor for Hrs on early endosomal membranes and that the binding of Hrs to SNAP- 25 on endosomal membranes inhibits formation of a SNARE complex required for homotypic endosome fusion...|$|R
40|$|Tropomyosin (Tm) is a two-chained, α-helical coiled-coil {{protein that}} {{associates}} end-to-end {{to form a}} continuous strand along actin filaments and regulates the functions and stability of actin in eukaryotic muscle and nonmuscle cells. Mutations in Tm cause skeletal and cardiac myopathies. We applied a neoteric molecular evolution approach to gain insight into the fundamental unresolved question of what makes the Tm coiled <b>coil</b> an actin <b>binding</b> protein. We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of 70 coding sequences of Tm genes from 26 animal species, from cnidarians to chordates, and evaluated the substitution rates (ω) at individual codons to identify conserved sites. The most conserved residues at surface b, c, f heptad repeat positions were mutated in rat striated muscle αTm and expressed in Escherichia coli. Each mutant had 3 – 4 sites mutated to Ala within the first half or {{the second half of}} periods 2 – 6. Actin affinity and thermodynamic stability were determined in vitro. Mutations {{in the first half of}} periods 2, 4, and 5 resulted in the largest reduction in actin affinity (>  4 -fold), indicating these mutations include residues in actin-binding sites. Mutations in the second half of the periods had a ≤  2 -fold effect on affinity indicating these residues may be involved in other conserved regulatory functions. The structural relevance of these results was assessed by constructing molecular models for the actin-Tm filament. Molecular evolution analysis is a general approach that may be used to identify potential binding sites of a protein for a conserved protein...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella {{and other}} {{pathogenic}} bacteria use the type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to inject virulence proteins into human cells to initiate infections. The structural {{component of the}} T 3 SS contains a needle and a needle tip. The needle is assembled from PrgI needle protomers and the needle tip is capped with several copies of the SipD tip protein. How a tip protein docks on the needle is unclear. A crystal structure of a PrgI–SipD fusion protein docked on the PrgI needle results in steric clash of SipD at the needle tip when modeled on the recent atomic structure of the needle. Thus, there is currently no good model of how SipD is docked on the PrgI needle tip. Previously, we showed by NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) methods that a specific region in the SipD coiled <b>coil</b> is the <b>binding</b> site for PrgI. Others have hypothesized that a domain of the tip protein—the N-terminal α-helical hairpin—has to swing away during the assembly of the needle apparatus. Here, we show by PRE methods that a truncated form of SipD lacking the α-helical hairpin domain binds more tightly to PrgI. Further, PRE-based structure calculations revealed multiple PrgI binding sites on the SipD coiled coil. Our PRE results together with the recent NMR-derived atomic structure of the Salmonella needle suggest a possible model of how SipD might dock at the PrgI needle tip. SipD and PrgI are conserved in other bacterial T 3 SSs; thus, our results have wider implication in understanding other needle-tip complexe...|$|R
