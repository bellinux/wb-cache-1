50|$|Leighton was {{a learned}} scholar, with wide-ranging interests. His legacy remains {{today in the}} Leighton Library (or Bibliotheca Leightoniana), which is the oldest purpose built library in Scotland. It {{contains}} a collection of around 4000 volumes and 78 manuscripts from the 16th to the 19th century, and is founded on the personal collection of Leighton, who bequeathed some 1500 books to Dunblane Cathedral. A library building was erected between 1684 and 1688 in order to house the books {{for the use of}} the local clergy. From 1734 the library became one of the first subscription libraries in Scotland. The collection covers a variety of subject areas, including history and politics (particularly 17th century), theology, medicine, travel, and language. Some of the collection was originally owned by Newbattle and was stored at the Old Manse, but it is now held in its entirety at The Cross, Dunblane. The <b>catalogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> is now available to academics and researchers through arrangement with Stirling University.|$|E
40|$|The Internet {{is playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role in today’s society and {{people are beginning to}} expect instantaneous access to information and content wherever they are. As content delivery is consuming a majority of the Internet bandwidth and its share of bandwidth is increasing by the hour, we need scalable and efficient techniques that can support these user demands and efficiently deliver the content to the users. When designing such techniques {{it is important to note}} that not all content is the same or will reach the same popularity. Scalable techniques must handle an increasingly diverse <b>catalogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>contents,</b> both with regards to diversity of content (as service are becoming increasingly personalized, for example) and with regards to their individual popularity. The importance of understanding content popularity dynamics is further motivated by popular contents widespread impact on opinions, thoughts, and cultures.

40|$|Abstract—Swarms within {{peer-to-peer}} {{networks are}} hindered by content containing incorrect metadata. After publishing, any incorrect metadata requires either a complete republish/swarm recreation or for each peer to manually make corrections (causing {{them to leave}} the swarm, decreasing performance). We present an approach which enables a swarm to both collaboratively upgrade embedded data to reflect changes in metadata, and identify additional candidates which contain metadata errors but a correct payload. Swarm degradation due to peer drop-off resulting from edits is eliminated, and additional peers can be identified in a fully automated fashion, increasing swarm lifetime and performance. Stemming from this metadata abstraction, automatic pu-rification can be realised in situations where multiple incom-plete/incorrect versions are available within one or more un-connected swarms. Variations associated with a content set are processed associatively using a knowledge discovery rule set to extrapolate a canonical tag set, which can also be reinforced using data from external corpora. After any update, these changes can again be automatically disseminated in a peer-to-peer swarm. The system presented enables context-aware P 2 P data transfers which abstract metadata optimally, while also maximising swarm size and enabling <b>cataloguing</b> <b>of</b> <b>content.</b> A proof-of-concept implementation is presented, {{and its impact on}} swarm purification/optimisation is evaluated.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{and critically}} evaluates present music and video market functioning with emphasis to {{the sales of}} electronic format <b>of</b> this <b>content</b> which is preferred by current customers. It analyzes the widespread trend <b>of</b> <b>content</b> sharing via the Internet and specifies reasons why the trend is happening. It defines cases of behavior that are justifiable {{in the eyes of}} consumers and therefore legitimate (i. e. creation of backups, downloading and sharing legally unavailable content, downloading for personal use, etc.) and elements that reduce value of the legally distributed content for the customer (copy protection mechanisms or current licensing system). Furthermore, it analyzes new economic approaches that enable the utilization potential of the Internet (i. e. the Long Tail Theory) or of potential customers (Crowdsourcing, Word of Mouth, Gamification). The paper analyzes the functioning new services that use the Internet as a platform for their operation and offer users the experience they want. Proposal for this new system <b>of</b> audiovisual <b>content</b> distribution is proposed based on a synthesis of findings from the operation of these services, new theoretical approaches and author's own contribution. This new system rejects the idea <b>of</b> selling the <b>content</b> as goods (per items) and adopts an approach of access to the whole <b>catalogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>content</b> for a flat monthly fee. This newly born service has several tiers that differ qualitatively among themselves, also in terms of added value for users and finally in the price at which the layers are available. This system is very acceptable to customers as well as being an interesting long-term alternative to the current system for operators of the new system and copyright holders...|$|R
