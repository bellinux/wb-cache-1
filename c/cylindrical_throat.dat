40|$|From physics {{standpoint}} exotic matter {{problem is}} a major difficulty in thin-shell wormholes (TSWs) with spherical / <b>cylindrical</b> <b>throat</b> topologies. We aim to circumvent this handicap by considering angular dependent throats in 3 + 1 -dimensions. By considering the throat of the TSW to be deformed spherical, i. e., a function of θ and φ, we present general conditions which are to be satisfied by {{the shape of the}} throat in order to have the wormhole supported by matter with positive density in the static reference frame. We provide particular solutions / examples to the constraint conditions. Comment: 7 pages two figures. Retitled and additional material added, accepted for publication in EPJ...|$|E
40|$|A ten-foot-diameter {{water tunnel}} is {{discussed}} as to feasibility and design, and consideration is narrowed {{to the working}} section [...] nozzle, throat and diffuser. A non-cavitating nozzle shape is calculated by systematizing the method suggested by Hue-Shen Tsien. Structural design is approached {{on the basis of}} a six-hundred-foot static pressure head; and an additional half- full design loading is calculated as a Fourier expansion. The analysis of the structure is broken down into a number of elasticity problems. The <b>cylindrical</b> <b>throat</b> is analyzed by membrane theory for the high-head condition; and stresses at and in the supporting rings are thoroughly investigated. More involved methods considering transverse shear and bending are used to check the stability of the shell when only partially full. Membrane theory is applied to the conical diffuser and to the double-curved nozzle to determine the stress state in both under the high-head condition. Shell thicknesses and member sizes have been selected throughout from this analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Cleveland 18 - by 18 -inch supersonic tunnel at a Mach number of 1. 85 and angles of attack from 0 deg to 5 deg to determine optimum design configurations for a convergent-divergent type of supersonic diffuser with a subsonic diffuser of 5 deg included divergence angle. Total pressure recoveries in excess of theoretical recovery across a normal shock at a free-stream Mach number of 1. 85 wore obtained with several configurations. The highest recovery for configurations without a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>throat</b> section was obtained with an inlet having an included convergence angle of 20 deg. Insertion of a 2 -inch throat section between a 10 deg included angle inlet and the subsonic diffuser stabilized the shock inside the diffuser and resulted in recoveries as high as 0. 838 free-stream total pressure at an angle of attack of 0 deg, corresponding to recovery of 92. 4 percent of the kinetic energy of the free air stream. Use of the throat section also lessened the reduction in recovery of all configurations due to angle of attack...|$|E

The <b>throat</b> is a piecewise smooth cylindrical surface resulting in a shape function that is not differentiable at some value. It is proposed that the regular derivative be replaced by a one-sided derivative at this value. The resulting wormhole geometry satisfies the weak energy condition.

40|$|International audienceA pore-scale {{network model}} based on spherical pore bodies and <b>cylindrical</b> pore <b>throats</b> was {{developed}} to describe the displacement of water by DNAPL. The pore body size and the pore throat size were given by statistical distributions with user-specified values for the minimum, mean and maximum sizes. The numerical model was applied to a laboratory experiment conducted on a sand-filled glass column. The parameters relative to pore body size and pore throat size {{that were used in}} the construction of the equivalent network were derived from the discrete grain-size distribution of the real porousmedium. The calculated arrival times of the DNAPL front were compared with those measured using optic fibre sensors placed at different points on the control section of the experimental device. Furthermore, the model simulated DNAPL pressure measured at the entrance section of the system. In general, the numerical results obtained with the model were in good agreement with the actual measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{void space}} {{properties}} {{of a set}} of gas reservoir sandstone samples have been measured. The properties include porosity, absolute gas permeability, electrical resistivity formation factor and tortuosity. The mineralogy of each sandstone was determined by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. Mercury intrusion and extrusion data have been measured for most of the sandstone samples. A new procedure for measuring the degree and range of void size correlations within resin-filled sandstones has been developed. Image analysis of backscattered electron micrographs of these samples supplies void size and positional information. A "semi-variogram" study of void size and coordinate data ascertains the degree and range of void size correlation. Measurable correlation has been found in two sandstone samples, but was absent from four others. Diffusion coefficients of methane, iso-butane and n-butane through dry sandstones have been measured using an adaptation of a non-steady state method, using a redesigned apparatus. A repeatability and error analysis of diffusion coefficient measurement has also been performed. A correlation between diffusion coefficients, absolute permeability, porosity and formation factor was detected for sandstones containing little clay. The diffusion coefficients measured for clay affected sandstones did not correlate with any petrophysical properties of these samples. A computer model capable of simulating porous media has been previously developed. It consists of a 10 x 10 x 10 network of cubic pores and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>throats,</b> and simulates die mercury intrusion curve. The void size distribution is modified until both simulated and experimental curves closely match. New void size distribution input and curve fit algorithms have been developed to increase the speed and accuracy of die simulations and a new modelling procedure allows the modelling of samples with void size correlation. The model is capable of simulating porosity, permeability, tortuosity and mercury extrusion. Each of the reservoir sandstones has been modelled and their characteristic properties simulated. Successful simulations were obtained for all relatively clay-free reservoir sandstones. Clay affected sandstone simulations were less successful due to the high complexity of these samples. A study into formation damage witiiin reservoir sandstones was also undertaken. The effect of colloidal particulate void space penetration is measured and simulated.

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new way to hide the fifth dimension, and to modify gravity in the far infra-red. A gravitating tensional {{membrane}} in five dimensions folds the transverse space into a truncated cone, stoppered by the membrane.

A very long section, of length comparable to the membrane radius divided by the remaining conical angle, of this sliver is well approximated by a narrow cylinder ending on the membrane.

40|$|Waterjet {{technology}} has been extensively used in machining processes since 1970 ’s, {{and in the last}} years it has evolved to a precision machining tool for mi-cro workpieces, namely micro abrasive-waterjet blasting (µAWJB); neverthe-less, as a finishing process to remove micro-burrs it has not been yet developed. Our experimental studies on low-pressure µAWJB showed that conventional nozzles which are used for micro abrasive air jet blasting are subject to clog-ging at the mixing chamber. In this study, the venturi principle is exploited in order to obtain a novel nozzle design which will not lead to the clogging problem. The factors are considered as follows: the volumetric flow rate, the contraction–expansion ratios, the length of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>throat</b> and the lo-cation of the attached (side) pipe. Various geometries are considered and a number of numerical simulations are performed to analyze these factors so that a nozzle which is suitable for low-pressure µAWJB can be constructed in light of the numerical results. The nozzle which is chosen in accordance with the numerical findings is proven to be operational with experimental studies. 1 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to simulate the}} transport and deposition of virus-sized colloids in a <b>cylindrical</b> pore <b>throat</b> considering various processes such as advection, diffusion, colloid-collector surface interactions and hydrodynamic wall effects. The pore space {{is divided into three}} different regions, namely, bulk, diffusion and potential regions, based on the dominant processes acting in each of these regions. In the bulk region, colloid transport is governed by advection and diffusion whereas in the diffusion region, colloid mobility due to diffusion is retarded by hydrodynamic wall effects. Colloid-collector interaction forces dominate the transport in the potential region where colloid deposition occurs. The governing equations are non-dimensionalized and solved numerically. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the virus-sized colloid transport and deposition is significantly affected by various pore-scale parameters such as the surface potentials on colloid and collector, ionic strength of the solution, flow velocity, pore size and colloid size. The adsorbed concentration and hence, the favorability of the surface for adsorption increases with: (i) decreasing magnitude and ratio of surface potentials on colloid and collector, (ii) increasing ionic strength and (iii) increasing pore radius. The adsorbed concentration increases with increasing Pe, reaching a maximum value at Pe = 0. 1 and then decreases thereafter. Also, the colloid size significantly affects particle deposition with the adsorbed concentration increasing with increasing particle radius, reaching a maximum value at a particle radius of 100 nm and then decreasing with increasing radius. System hydrodynamics is found to have a greater effect on larger particles than on smaller ones. The secondary minimum contribution to particle deposition has been found to increase as the favorability of the surface for adsorption decreases. The sensitivity of the model to a given parameter will be high if the conditions are favorable for adsorption. The results agree qualitatively with the column-scale experimental observations available in the literature. The current model forms the building block in upscaling colloid transport from pore scale to Darcy scale using Pore-Network Modeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved...|$|R

ISO 5167 - 4 : 2003 also provides background information for calculating the flow-rate and is applicable {{in conjunction with the}} requirements given in ISO 5167 - 1. ISO 5167 - 4 : 2003 is applicable only to Venturi tubes in which the flow remains subsonic throughout the measuring section and where the fluid can be considered as single-phase. In addition, each of these devices can only be used within specified limits of pipe size, roughness, diameter ratio and Reynolds number. ISO 5167 - 4 : 2003 is not applicable to the measurement of pulsating flow. It does not cover the use of Venturi tubes in pipes sized less than 50 mm or more than 1 200 mm, or for where the pipe Reynolds numbers are below 20 000. ISO 5167 - 4 : 2003 deals with the three types of classical Venturi tubes: cast, machined and rough welded sheet-iron. A Venturi tube is a device which consists of a convergent inlet connected to a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>throat</b> which is in turn connected to a conical expanding section called the "divergent". The differences between the values of the uncertainty of the discharge coefficient for the three types of classical Venturi tube show, on the one hand, the number of results available for each type of classical Venturi tube and, on the other hand, the more or less precise definition of the geometric profile. The values are based on data collected many years ago. Venturi nozzles (and other nozzles) are dealt with in ISO 5167 - 3...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{previous}} researches of the Gas-Kinetic Unified Algorithm (GKUA) for flows from highly rarefied free-molecule transition to continuum, a new implicit scheme of cell-centered finite volume method is presented for directly solving the unified Boltzmann model equation covering various flow regimes. In view of the difficulty in generating the single-block grid system with high quality for complex irregular bodies, a multi-block docking grid generation method is designed {{on the basis of}} data transmission between blocks, and the data structure is constructed for processing arbitrary connection relations between blocks with high efficiency and reliability. As a result, the gas-kinetic unified algorithm with the implicit scheme and multi-block docking grid has been firstly established and used to solve the reentry flow problems around the multi-bodies covering all flow regimes with the whole range of Knudsen numbers from 10 to 3. 7 E− 6. The implicit and explicit schemes are applied to computing and analyzing the supersonic flows in near-continuum and continuum regimes around a circular cylinder with careful comparison each other. It is shown that the present algorithm and modelling possess much higher computational efficiency and faster converging properties. The flow problems including two and three side-by-side cylinders are simulated from highly rarefied to near-continuum flow regimes, and the present computed results are found in good agreement with the related DSMC simulation and theoretical analysis solutions, which verify the good accuracy and reliability of the present method. It is observed that the spacing of the multi-body is smaller, the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>throat</b> obstruction is greater with the flow field of single-body asymmetrical more obviously and the normal force coefficient bigger. While in the near-continuum transitional flow regime of near-space flying surroundings, the spacing of the multi-body increases to six times of the diameter of the single-body, the interference effects of the multi-bodies tend to be negligible. The computing practice has confirmed that it is feasible for the present method to compute the aerodynamics and reveal flow mechanism around complex multi-body vehicles covering all flow regimes from the gas-kinetic point of view of solving the unified Boltzmann model velocity distribution function equation...|$|E
