5|$|In 1944 and 1945, as the German {{situation}} deteriorated, {{provision of}} food to POW camps became more sporadic and starvation became a problem. As Soviet troops advanced westwards, <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east were evacuated and moved on foot, in so-called death marches, away from the front in extremely poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{refugees}} from Bayt Jibrin, including their descendants, {{was estimated to}} be 17,310 in 1998. Many live in the al-'Azza (also called Bayt Jibrin) and Fawwar <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern West Bank.|$|E

5|$|After the Anschluss, the Austrian SS was {{folded into}} SS-Oberabschnitt Donau. The third {{regiment}} of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (Der Führer) {{and the fourth}} Totenkopf regiment (Ostmark) were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter. On Heydrich's orders, mass arrests of potential enemies of the Reich began immediately after the Anschluss. Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the Anschluss. Before {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union, Mauthausen was the harshest of the <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greater German Reich.|$|E
5|$|During three war patrols, U-162 sank 14 vessels. However, on 3 September, three British destroyers hunted U-162 {{down and}} sank her. Of {{a crew of}} fifty-one, only two died.

5|$|Early on, Banff {{was popular}} with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and {{continued}} westward on the railroad. Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded {{one of the}} first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park.|$|E

5|$|In June, William Sullivan was {{replaced}} as ambassador by G. McMurtrie Godley, who immediately loosened {{the rules of}} engagement and increased the bombing campaign in the north and northeast. The results were almost immediate. Nearly 50 {{percent of the population of}} the once heavily populated Plain of Jars had moved into refugee <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south. Refugee rolls for the Agency for International Development, which had averaged 130,000 between 1964 and 1968, jumped to 230,000 in February 1970.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many state}} parks in north central Pennsylvania, {{development}} of the facilities at Cherry Springs {{was the work of}} the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a work relief program for young men from unemployed families. Established in 1933as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, the CCC was designed to combat unemployment during the Great Depression. It operated in every U.S. state, and established ten CCC <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Susquehannock State Forest, of which eight were in Potter County.|$|E

5|$|Though only {{numbering}} about 3,000 {{soldiers and}} 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners {{in the former}} Galla-Sidamo Governorate after the campaign. At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean askari safe passage to British prisoner of war <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east and sent Congolese guards {{to protect them from}} Ethiopian retaliation. The Belgian force quickly returned to Congo with their spoils of war. The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.|$|E
5|$|Under the British Mandate of Palestine, Bayt Jibrin again {{served as}} a {{district}} center for surrounding villages. It was captured by Israeli forces during the 1948 War, causing its inhabitants to flee eastward. Today, many of the refugees of Bayt Jibrin and their descendants live in the Bayt Jibrin and Fawwar <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern West Bank. The kibbutz of Beit Guvrin was established on Bayt Jibrin's lands in 1949. The underground caves of Bayt Jibrin have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Union troops {{continued}} {{to organize and}} train at military <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, as battles in Kentucky and Tennessee caused major changes to Indianapolis. After the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the Union began to collect {{a large number of}} Confederate prisoners of war for transport to the North. Governor Morton volunteered to hold some of the prisoners at Indianapolis. Designated as one of four northern prisoner-of-war camps, Camp Morton was converted into one of the Union's largest prisons for captured Confederate soldiers.|$|E

5|$|After briefly {{stopping}} in Albany, where its convoy was delayed due to {{concerns over the}} presence of German warships en route, the 10th Battalion departed Australian waters in November and proceeded towards Egypt. Initially, the plan had been for the battalion to continue on the United Kingdom from where it would subsequently move to the Western Front. Poor conditions and overcrowding in training <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom resulted {{in the decision to}} disembark the Australians in Alexandria instead. Arriving there on 4 December 1914, the battalion was sent into camp at Mena, near Cairo.|$|E
5|$|After his {{football}} career ended, Slater worked with an ABC affiliate in Los Angeles. He participated {{as a guest}} coach during St. Louis Rams training <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 2000s. On February 16, 2006, Oakland Raiders head coach Art Shell hired {{him to become a}} co-offensive lineman coach along with Irv Eatman. Slater was hired to mentor Robert Gallery, moving him to left tackle. Gallery struggled that season and Slater was released by the Raiders for the 2007 season and replaced by Tom Cable. He is currently the offensive line coach at Azusa Pacific University in Azusa, California.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{in which}} Portugal joined the Allies, Caldas {{had one of}} three {{internment}} <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. In 1916, most Germans in Portugal were deported, but men aged 15–45 were imprisoned to prevent their joining the German military. Originally, all of the approximately 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island in the Azores, where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilhões do Parque). The prisoners were released the following year, {{after the end of}} the war.|$|E

The claims were registered next day at the police post {{at the mouth of the}} Fortymile River and news spread rapidly from there to other mining <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yukon River valley.|$|E
5|$|Kagame first {{provided}} {{troops and}} military training to aid a rebellion against Zaire by the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group living near Bukavu in the Zairian South Kivu province. With Rwandan army support, the Banyamulenge defeated local {{security forces and}} began attacking the Hutu refugee <b>camps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. At the same time, Kagame's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two of the camps there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 refugees to flee. Many returned to Rwanda {{despite the presence of}} the RPF; others ventured further west into Zaire.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Komnenos {{attempted}} {{to draw the}} Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against Hungary, {{and to a lesser}} extent Norman Sicily. This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti-Byzantine <b>camps.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia: prince Iziaslav II of Kiev was related to Géza II of Hungary and was hostile to Byzantium; Prince Yuri Dolgoruki of Suzdal was Manuel's ally (symmachos), and Vladimirko of Galicia is described as Manuel's vassal (hypospondos). Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and, therefore, was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts. Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and Vladimirko, the situation became reversed; when Yuri of Suzdal, Manuel's ally, took over Kiev and Yaroslav, the new ruler of Galicia, adopted a pro-Hungarian stance.|$|E
