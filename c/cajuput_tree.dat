40|$|The {{utilization}} of cajaput tree species for cajuput oil {{production in the}} Wasur National Park (NP) should be supported by accurate data and information. It becomes important because uncontrolled exploitation can lead to disruption of the national park function. This study aims to determine the spatial distribution of three <b>cajuput</b> <b>tree</b> species, i. e Asteromyrtus symphyocarpa, Melaleuca cajuputi and Melalueca viridiflora existed in Wasur NP region. The {{results of this study}} showed that, in general, the distribution of those three cajuput oil species mostly in Yanggandur area. They are mainly concentrated around the Yanggandur village, Mbembi village, Wasur village and Sota village. Those species were mostly found around wamps, especially in the Sermayam, Rawa Buaya and Rawa Biru. The total area of those three species was 103, 011. 75 ha, which was dominated by A. symphyocarpa (8. 30 % of the total area of the NP), followed by M. cajuputi (8. 27 % of the total area of the NP) and M. viridiflora (7. 03 % of the total area of the NP). In general, A. symphyocarpa dominantly grow on type of Kambisol soil, where as M. cajuputi and M. viridi flora dominantly grow on soils type of Kambisol and Gleysol...|$|E

This paper evaluates fertility variation, effective population size and genetic diversity among <b>cajuput</b> <b>trees</b> in seedling seed orchard at Paliyan, Gunungkidul for optimizing seed orchard management. A total of 160 trees were observed in three flowering periods of 2011 - 2013. The fertility {{based on the number}} of flowers and fruits were registered for each tree at the age of 12, 13 and 14 years. Results show that there are similar patterns of fertility after three years observation. Sibling coefficients (Î¨) which show fertility variation during three flowering periods are 1. 39, 1. 25 and 1. 43 respectively. They show deviation from random mating, because of individual imbalance for producing flowers and fruits. However, the number of fertile trees was comparatively higher at 2011. More than 15 families of effective population size were recorded each year and supported more than 75 % individuals in seed orchard to contribute flowers and seeds. High value of genetic diversity was calculated based on fertility variation (0. 965, 0. 967 and 0. 957, respectively). Fertility variation led to consequence on seed deployment, including seeds of fertile families which should be collected equally and mixed to compose equal proportion of seeds and to avoid domination of highly fertility families and genetic drift. Silvicultural treatments in seed orchard management were indispensable to promote fertility uniformity and to increase effective population size in seed orchard for obtaining maximal genetic gain...|$|R
