5|$|The tale of {{the slaying}} of Keshi is told in the Hindu scriptures of Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana and Harivamsa. Krishna is often praised as Keshava - the slayer of Keshi - in scriptures. Theories {{suggested}} about Keshi's origins range from his being a demon of <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> to the story's being inspired by the Greek Herculean labour of slaying the horses of Diomedes.|$|E

In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health. They next moved to Monterey, California, where his father taught metallurgy at the Naval Postgraduate School. They soon moved to Claremont, California, then to El Cajon, before finally settling in San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E

25|$|WHO has the {{broadest}} health mandate under the UN system, including setting priorities, coordinating global health surveillance, and emergency {{assistance in the}} event of disease outbreaks. Health experts give WHO credit for major successes, such as the eradication of smallpox, near eradication of polio, and substantial progress in controlling <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases,</b> and in expanding primary health care in developing countries. WHO defenders blame continued member state parsimony that has kept WHO's regular biennial budget to roughly $850 million for several years and forced it to rely more on voluntary contributions that often come with strings attached as the cause of its shortcomings. This situation led to lack of focus at the top level as well as overly optimistic forecasts.|$|E

25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation). Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment) patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of herpetic infection in seropositive patients. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E

500|$|The {{bones of}} a total of 179 people were found during the {{excavations}} of the Mary Rose, including 92 [...] "fairly complete skeletons", more or less complete collections of bones associated with specific individuals. Analysis of these has shown that crew members were all male, most of them young adults. Some were no more than 11â€“13 years old, and the majority (81%) under 30. They were mainly of English origin and, according to archaeologist Julie Gardiner, they most likely came from the West Country; many following their aristocratic masters into maritime service. There were also a few people from continental Europe. An eyewitness testimony right after the sinking refers to a survivor who was a Fleming, and the pilot may very well have been French. Analysis of oxygen isotopes in teeth indicates that some were also of southern European origin. In general they were strong, well-fed men, but many of the bones also reveal tell-tale signs of <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> and a life of grinding toil. The bones also showed traces of numerous healed fractures, probably the result of on-board accidents.|$|E
500|$|In the Atharvaveda (2nd {{millennium}} BCE), Keshi, the [...] "hairy one", first {{appears as}} being {{described as a}} demon who attacks the unborn, though not in relation to Krishna. A line from passage 8.6 which describes evils that attack female fetuses reads as: [...] "Let us keep the black asura KeÅ›in, born in the reed clump, snout-mouthed and all other harmful creatures, away from her genitals and her loins" [...] Phyllis Granoff, a scholar on Indian religions, opines that the Keshi is a demon of <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> or miscarriage, like the demoness Putana, who were both killed by the infant Krishna. However, this hypothesis is not unanimous. The tales of Keshi-vadha ("The killing of Keshi") are {{well known in the}} Kushan period (60-375 CE). Metropolitan Museum of Art parallels Krishna killing Keshi to the labour of Greek hero Heracles - slaying the horses of Diomedes, from which episode the former may be inspired. Keshi or KeÅ›Ä« could be the earliest Sanskrit word known in Chinese; the (2nd century BCE) Huainanzi records treasures given in ransom for King Wen of Zhou to King Zhou of Shang in 1103 BCE, including the mount named jisi é›žæ–¯ or Old Chinese *kese.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{population}} health, life expectancy in 2006 {{was about two}} and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years. Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S. Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage. For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd. [...] The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation. In an international comparison of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, and kidney and liver transplants. The U.S. performed better on 6 indicators, including survival rates for breast and cervical cancer, and avoidance of <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> such as pertussis and measles. [...] It should be noted that the 21 indicators were distilled from a starting list of 1000. [...] The authors state that, [...] "It is an opportunistic list, rather than a comprehensive list." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} it was common to marry off daughters quite young, as soon as a {{suitable}} husband could be found and a dowry put together. [...] Combined with <b>childhood</b> <b>diseases</b> and a high general mortality rate this meant that it was not uncommon for young people to die within a short time of marriage, before their spouses had formed lasting relationships with their families. [...] Under Jewish inheritance law, a husband is his wife's sole heir, but a wife does not inherit from her husband. Thus, no matter who died, the dowry, which represented a substantial sacrifice by the wife's parents for their daughter's happiness, would end up with the husband or his family. As a result, parents became reluctant to give their daughters large dowries, which in turn led to difficulty in finding them husbands. Therefore the synod of Troyes, led by Rabbenu Tam, decreed that if a husband or wife dies within a year of marriage without leaving a surviving child, the dowry would revert to the parents who had given it; if the death was within two years half the dowry would revert. While Rabbenu Tam rescinded this decree before his death, it was reaffirmed by his students in the first synod of SHUM. This decree is today incorporated by reference into the standard Ashkenazi prenuptial contract (tena'im), with the phrase [...] "and in case of absence [...] it will stand as the decree of ShUM"; in some communities even this elliptical mention of death is thought unlucky at a wedding, so it is merely hinted at with the cryptic phrase [...] "and in case, etc." [...] Even if it is not explicitly referenced at all, or if there is no contract, it is assumed that the parties consented to it unless it is explicitly excluded.|$|E
