Firstly, the theorems analysing pricing of tradable goods and the trade balance dynamics following exchange rate shocks are accounted for. Secondly, the sunk <b>cost</b> <b>hysteresis</b> model of foreign trade is described, including the possibility for hysteresis both at the microeconomic and macroeconomic level. Finally, the implications of sunk <b>cost</b> <b>hysteresis</b> for the predictions of the traditional trade-exchange rate theorems are discussed. This paper argues that the sunk cost model provides a microeconomic basis for trade dynamics that allows for non-linearities and regime switches, something often seen in empirical analysis. When it comes to policy, this paper argues in favour of context-specific policy interventions and against the {{one size fits all}} approach of structural adjustment programmes. sunk cost hysteresis; pricing; prices; tradable goods; elasticity; income absorption; trade balances; exchange rates; developing countries; entry costs; international markets; foreign trade; trading; microeconomics; macroeconomics; trade dynamics; non-linearities; regime switches; empirical analysis; context-specific policies; policy interventions; one size fits all; structural adjustment programmes; economics; business research. ...|$|E

First the theorems analysing pricing of tradable goods and the trade balance dynamics following exchange rate shocks are accounted for. Second the sunk <b>cost</b> <b>hysteresis</b> model of foreign trade is described, including the possibility for hysteresis both at the microeconomic and at the macroeconomic level. Third the implications of sunk <b>cost</b> <b>hysteresis</b> for the predictions of the traditional trade-exchange rate theorems are discussed, focusing on both pricing of trad- able goods as well as short and long run trade balance dynamics following exchange rate shocks. The paper argues that the sunk cost model provides a microeconomic basis for trade dynamics that allows for non-linearities and regime switches, something often seen in empirical anlysis. The predictions of structural adjustment programs are however drawn from the traditional theorems, lacking the possibility for non-linearity. The sunk cost model is argued to push both pricing rules and trade balance dynamics closer towards the empirical record, mainly by allowing for a state-dependent relationship between exchange rates and foreign trade.

40|$|We argue that, {{under certain}} {{conditions}} described by a sunk <b>cost</b> <b>hysteresis</b> model, firms consider exports {{as a substitute for}} domestic demand. This is valid also on the macroeconomic level where the switch from the domestic market to the export market and vice versa takes place in a smooth manner. Areas of weak reaction of exports to changes in domestic demand are widened by uncertainty. Our econometric model for six euro area countries suggests domestic demand and capacity constraints as additional variables for export equations. We apply the exponential and logistic variant of a smooth transition regression model and find that domestic demand developments and uncertainty are relevant for short-run export dynamics particularly during more extreme stages of the business cycle. A substitutive relationship between domestic and foreign sales can most clearly be found for France, Greece and Ireland (ESTR model) and France, Portugal and Italy (LSTAR model), providing evidence of the importance of sunk costs and hysteresis in international trade in these EMU member countries. What is more, our empirical results are robust to the inclusion of a variable measuring European policy uncertainty. In some cases (Italy, Greece and Portugal) the results underscore the empirical validity of the export hysteresis under uncertainty model...|$|E
40|$|The paper explores ways {{in which}} economists view parking charges {{within the context of}} policy formulation. Recent trends in {{economic}} analysis have taken more note of the institutional structure in which decisions are made; institutions embracing both formal structures such as laws but also the de facto {{ways in which}} actual outcomes emerge. While this distinction is often applied to final consumers, it also has relevance for those setting and enforcing micro economic policies such as parking policies. Taking a neo-classical economic approach would lead parking policies in one direction, but allowing for transactions <b>costs,</b> <b>hysteresis,</b> second-best factors, game-playing, etc. as well as normative concerns over equity of various kinds, all of which reflect institutional structures, can lead into a variety of others. The aim is to explain why current parking policies deviate from classical economic ideals. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{responsiveness}} of a country's export supply to exchange rate changes and measures its quantitative importance by breaking down export adjustments between changes in output levels by existing exporters (intensive margin) and movements due {{to changes in the}} number of exporters (extensive margin). Using data on a representative sample of Spanish manufacturing firms, the paper finds sunk <b>costs</b> <b>hysteresis</b> in entry and exit to be an important factor in determining export market participation, but unrelated to exchange rate uncertainty. The sunk costs of entering the market appear to be much larger than the costs of exiting the market. Finally, although hysteresis exists, its effect on the responsiveness of aggregate trade volumes to exchange rate changes is quantitatively small. A 10 % home currency depreciation results in an increase in export volume due to {{the increase in the number}} of exporting firms of only 1. 5 % of export volume.

40|$|Recent {{economic}} {{literature suggests}} {{the importance of}} sunk <b>costs</b> and <b>hysteresis</b> in explaining export patterns in international trade. To explore their empirical importance, we present a new conceptual framework that distinguishes six different types of exporter behaviour, and apply this framework to a unique longitudinal data set on Irish manufacturing. Our analysis allows us to identify significant numbers of manufacturers who engage in ?exporter re-switching behaviour?. The magnitude of these numbers leads us to question the widespread importance of sunk costs. In response to export-market shocks, we find strong evidence of both heterogeneous exporter responses and hysteresis. heterogeneous exporters, sunk costs, re-switching behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Krugman’s {{models of}} spatial {{resource}} allocation and trade convey robust theoretical insights with a parsimonious lucidity that appeals strongly to modern economists ’ tastes. Those great pedagogical virtues also may limit the models ’ utility in guiding empirical {{research on the}} dynamic processes ostensibly being addressed. Three reasons for this worry are elaborated in this comment: (1) they are meant to explain a set of “stylized ” facts that abstract from important observed inhomogeneities in the geography of development; (2) the modeling emphasis on demand-side externalities diverts attention from supply-side forces making for industrial localization; and (3) Krugman’s treatment {{of the role of}} the state ignores inefficiencies arising from locational tournaments involving local government subsidization of firms in footloose industries. The models of spatial resource allocation and trade in Paul Krugman’s article live up to expectations. They exhibit all the parsimonious elegance, expositional lucid-ity, and deft topicality that have characterized their creator’s many contributions to the literature of economics. They reveal, in the sparest ways conceivable, how vari-ous pairings of centripetal and centrifugal forces can result in simple but structured equilibrium configurations in the spatial distribution of specialized production. And their formal details lay bare the essential character of the mechanisms through which sunk <b>cost</b> <b>hysteresis</b> allows past events to exercise a tenacious influence on the geography of economic development. Krugman’s modeling arts are deployed on this occasion to propel development economists more deeply into space, that is, to make them consider more carefull...|$|E
40|$|Unprecedented {{movements}} in real exchange rates during the 1980 s led to suspicions of {{instability in the}} exchange rate - trade relationships in the UK and elsewhere. 1 be research in this thesis investigates the sensitivity of UK trade volumes to {{movements in}} the real exchange rate, and considers various interpretations of the alleged parameter instability: econometric misspecification; theoretical inadequacy due {{to the neglect of}} possible hysteresis effects and/or the neglect of supply side factors; and the Lucas critique effects of a changed policy regime on expectations formation. Against the background of UK experience we examine specific questions of theory and evidence within partial equilibrium frameworks. These share a common concern: considering the (macro economically important) case of mean reversion in real exchange rate expectations. Clapters two and three introduce mean reversion into Dixit's (1989 a) theory model of sunk <b>cost</b> <b>hysteresis</b> in trade. This research uses both analytic and numerical methods to characterise solutions with mean reversion in greater detail than elsewhere and uncovers some striking and unexpected results. Most important is the possible reversal of the stochastic and perfect foresight triggers under asymmetric sunk costs which reflects the essential difference between costly reversibility and strict irreversibility in investment Uncertainty does not always delay action, because the possibility of reversal must be allowed for. Chapter four explores the wider significance of the analysis for similar stochastic saddlepoint models such as the analysis of exchange rate target zones. Chapters five and six consider the significance of the short run dynamic specification of quarterly UK manufactured export volumes equations to the reported instability in estimates of the long run competitiveness elasticity in the light of evidence that UK competitiveness measures follow stationary processes within an institutionally identified policy regime. Hausman specification tests, show that the long run competitiveness elasticity is misspecified and underestimated in recent (error correction mechanism) specifications of UK manufactured export volume equations. This inadequacy reflects the omission of long 'smoothing' lags on the competitiveness variable Subsequently, chapter seven considers simulation evidence from the Dixit model as to the potential relevance of such effects to the UK experience under the large shock to competitiveness of 1980 - 1 but emphasises that the aggregate implications are not clear cut chapter eight considers whether the expectational effects of the 1979 Thatcher government's change in policy regime can be separated out from the other influences at work behind reduced form models but finds that the data do not support the particular approach adopted. Concluding. we emphasise that the potential importance and complexity of expectational factors and theory combines with the our empirical findings to suggest that exchange rate uncertainty may be crucial to trade behaviour and that macroeconomic adjustment may be inhibited by excess exchange rate uncertainty. Overall export performance may also reflect supply factors which are not captured in existing models, such as hysteretic exit. or expected cost changes. But we doubt whether future research will achieve a data consistent aggregate econometric model of UK trade which is fully grounded in appropriate optimising economic theory with realistic adjustment costs. We may have to settle for approximations to the data generation process which do not employ recent theoretical insights. In that event. the use of such models in policy design should be circumscribed due to the possibility of Lucas critique effects, hysteresis mechanisms and supply side factors...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of the export behaviour of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the U. K. between 1994 and 1998. I use a dynamic empirical model to disentangle three distinct dimensions of a firms’ participation in foreign markets: sunk <b>cost</b> induced <b>hysteresis,</b> firm heterogeneity and macroeconomic instability. The results show that SMEs view exporting as an irreversible investment, with state dependence being the largest explanatory factor. Moreover, observable firm characteristics, such as size and ownership, {{play a significant role in}} distinguishing exporters from non-exporters. Finally, there is no evidence that the 1992 – 1993 recession influenced firms’ export decisions in subsequent years implying that the results provide a valid indication of SMEs "typical" export behaviour.

40|$|The article {{looks at}} the impact that the 2008 - 2009 {{recession}} had on the Belgian labour market and, whilst taking account of the varying severity and duration of the economic downturn, draws a comparison with other European countries. More specifically, the consequences are investigated {{with regard to the}} adaptation of volume of labour and labour costs, and also the composition of employment. The analysis for Belgium shows that the crisis was accompanied by a less than proportional contraction in the volume of labour, resulting in a fall in labour productivity. The reduction in the volume of labour was only partly reflected in the trend in employment as the use of measures aimed at limiting working time, with a considerable fall in the number of hours worked per employee as a result, was accompanied by considerable labour hoarding. In general terms, the crisis did not result in a fall in the activity rate, but there is a major risk of discouragement among low-skilled young people. The increase in long-term unemployment points in turn to the threat of a rise in structural unemployment, which may adversely affect the potential for growth in the economy. The crisis did not have a moderating effect on the trend in hourly labour costs. After allowing for the productivity trend, the labour cost handicap, expressed in unit labour costs, narrowed temporarily with respect to the three neighbouring countries, but an increase in this handicap was once again posted in 2010. labour hoarding, long-term unemployment, labour productivity, labour <b>cost</b> handicap, <b>hysteresis...</b>|$|R
