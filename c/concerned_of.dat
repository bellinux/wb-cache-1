25|$|The {{literary}} {{production in}} Pular {{has been for}} the most part published originally in the form of loose leaves in manuscript. The author himself was not <b>concerned</b> <b>of</b> the conservation of his works until later in his lifetime that resulted to the loss of many manuscripts without doubt. A Talibe student of Maaci in Pita, Guinea sent him one day a copy of a manuscript about Amicale Gilbert Viellard (Agv) that Thierno Abdourahmane did not have in his procession.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Phi Delta Theta, {{along with}} Kappa Sigma and Phi Sigma Kappa left the North-American Interfraternity Conference due to ideological differences.

Phi Delta Theta officials believed that the conference had been placing too much emphasis on individual undergraduates through specific programs such as leadership conferences rather than focusing on the fraternity movement as a whole.

25|$|After {{less than}} a year {{following}} the New York Draft Riots, it was feared that another riot might result from the story. That same morning, a crowd began to gather outside of the office of the Journal of Commerce on the corner of Wall and Water Streets. Many of these were merchants suspicious of the story and finally General George B. McClellan arrived at the office to investigate the matter. The editors, <b>concerned</b> <b>of</b> a likely confrontation with the mob, insisted the proclamation was real and showed a dispatch from Associated Press which they had received earlier that morning.|$|E

25|$|On 11 December 1998, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew {{responded to}} a gay man's {{question}} about the place of homosexuals in Singapore, live on CNN International by saying, '...what we are doing as a government is to leave people to live their own lives {{so long as they}} don't impinge on other people. I mean, we don't harass anybody.' Given Lee's stature as the venerated albeit authoritarian founding father of independent Singapore, these words helped set the tenor for official policy on homosexuality for many years to come. His comments may be {{regarded as one of the}} most significant events, as far as gay rights are <b>concerned,</b> <b>of</b> the decade.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some criticisms of fair trade {{specific}} to coffee. Colleen Haight of the Stanford Innovation Review argues that fair trade coffee is merely a way to market the idea of ethical consumerism. Quality and transparency concerns regarding coffee are increasingly common amongst some consumers and coffee companies, as seen through {{the rise of the}} third wave coffee movement. Maintaining a balance between ethical and higher-quality coffee may be difficult with fair trade coffee due to what some coffee roasters deem as insufficient quality incentive within many fair-trade certified coffee farms. Deborah Sick’s research, involving interviews with coffee farmers in Costa Rica, finds that many farmers often produce more fair trade coffee than they can sell, so will often end up selling to independent buyers that will often pay more than fair trade buyers can. Some scholars are <b>concerned</b> <b>of</b> the artificial stimulation of coffee production, especially since worldwide demand for coffee is relatively inelastic.|$|E
25|$|While the SAF was <b>concerned</b> <b>of</b> {{the safety}} of out gay and trans men living and working with {{straight}} servicemen it was also reluctant to exempt them from the compulsory National Service that all Singaporean men had to perform. However, post-operative male-to-female transsexuals were exempted from National Service as the Singapore Government recognised their new gender identity as women. It is unknown if post-operative female-to-male transsexuals perform National Service, though {{it is unlikely that}} many of them exist who have undergone their operation by the time of enlistment, around the age of 18. In any case, most homosexuals did (and do) not declare their sexual orientation during this examination and go on to serve in all variety of vocations. Gay men do not come out for many reasons, the most common being that they are not comfortable with declaring their sexuality to a State and organisation that is perceived to be homophobic. Some gay men also refrain from coming out as they wish to perform their duties alongside others, and find the segregation of homosexuals offensive.|$|E

25|$|Harbin {{was among}} {{one of the}} key {{construction}} cities of China during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1951 to 1956. 13 of the 156 key construction projects were aid-constructed by the Soviet Union in Harbin. This project made Harbin an important industrial base of China. During the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1961, Harbin experienced a very tortuous development course as several Sino-Soviet contracts were cancelled by the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution many foreign and Christian things were uprooted, such as the St. Nicholas church which was destroyed by Red Guards in 1966. As the normal economic and social order was seriously disrupted, Harbin's economy also suffered from serious setbacks. One of the main reasons of this setback is with its Soviet ties deteriorating and the Vietnam War escalating, China became <b>concerned</b> <b>of</b> a possible nuclear attack. Mao Zedong ordered an evacuation of military and other key state enterprises away from the northeastern frontier, with Harbin being the core zone of this region, bordering the Soviet Union. During this Third Front Development Era of China, several major factories of Harbin were relocated to Southwestern Provinces including Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan and Guizhou, where they would be strategically secure {{in the event of a}} possible war. Some major universities of China were also moved out of Harbin, including Harbin Military Academy of Engineering (predecessor of Changsha's National University of Defense Technology) and Harbin Institute of Technology (Moved to Chongqing in 1969 and relocated to Harbin in 1973).|$|E
25|$|The Fascist regime also {{engaged in}} interventionist {{foreign policy in}} Europe. In 1923, Italian {{soldiers}} captured the Greek island of Corfu {{as part of the}} Fascists' plan to eventually take over Greece. Corfu was later returned to Greece and war between Greece and Italy was avoided. In 1925, Italy forced Albania to become a de facto protectorate which helped Italy's stand against Greek sovereignty. Corfu was important to Italian imperialism and nationalism due to its presence in the former Republic of Venice which left behind significant Italian cultural monuments and influence, though the Greek population there (especially youth) heavily protested the Italian occupation. Relations with France were mixed: the Fascist regime consistently had the intention to eventually wage war on France to regain Italian-populated areas of France, but with the rise of Hitler the Fascists immediately became more <b>concerned</b> <b>of</b> Austria's independence and the potential threat of Germany to Italy, if it demanded the German-populated areas of Tyrol. Due to concerns of German expansionism, Italy joined the Stresa Front with France and Britain against Germany which existed from 1935 to 1936. The Fascist regime held negative relations with Yugoslavia, as they long wanted the implosion of Yugoslavia in order to territorially expand and increase Italy's power. Italy pursued espionage in Yugoslavia, as Yugoslav authorities on multiple occasions discovered spy rings in the Italian Embassy in Yugoslavia, such as in 1930. In 1929, the Fascist government accepted Croatian extreme nationalist Ante Pavelić as a political exile to Italy from Yugoslavia. The Fascists gave Pavelić financial assistance and a training ground in Italy to develop and train his newly formed fascist militia and terrorist group, the Ustaše. This organization later became the governing force of the Independent State of Croatia, and murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and Roma during World War II.|$|E

Henrik Stangerup, (1937-1998) a Danish writer, wrote three books as a way to illustrate Kierkegaard's three stages of existence, 1981, The Road to Lagoa Santa, which was about Kierkegaard's brother-in-law Peter Wilhelm Lund (the ethicist), 1985 The Seducer: It Is Hard to Die in Dieppe, Peder Ludvig Moller was the esthetic in that novel, and in 1991 [...] Brother Jacob which describes Søren Kierkegaard as a Franciscan monk.|$|E

2500|$|Walker's {{actions in}} the region caused concern amongst his neighbors and {{potential}} American and European investors who feared he may pursue further military conquests in Central America. <b>Concerned</b> <b>of</b> Walker's intentions in the region, Costa Rican President Juan Rafael Mora rejected Walker's diplomatic overtures and began preparing the country's military for a potential conflict. The most important strategic defeat of Walker came during the [...] Campaign of 1856–57 [...] when the Costa Rican army, led by President Juan Rafael Mora defeated the Filibusters, in Rivas, Nicaragua on April 11, 1856, (the Second battle of Rivas). It was in this battle that the soldier and drummer Juan Santamaría sacrificed himself by setting the filibuster stronghold on fire. In an amazing parallel between these two Central American countries, Santamaría would become Costa Rica's national hero. Walker deliberately contaminated the water wells of Rivas with corpses. Later, the morbus cholera epidemic spread to the Costa Ricans troops and the civilian population {{of the city of}} Rivas. A few months later nearly 10,000 civilians died, almost the 10% of the population of Costa Rica.|$|E
