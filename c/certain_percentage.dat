40|$|Recycling {{demolished}} concrete as {{recycled aggregate}} can {{be applicable to}} most construction applications. Lower-grade applications, including sub-base and roadwork, have been practicing in many countries; however, higher-grade activities are rarely discussed. This paper develops two mixing approaches by adding silica fume into <b>certain</b> <b>percentages</b> of Recycled Aggregate (RA) in the pre-mix procedure, named as Two-Stage Mixing Approach(silica fume) (TSMAs) and adding silica fume and proportional amounts of cement into <b>certain</b> <b>percentages</b> of RA in the first mix, named as Two-Stage Mixing Approach(silica fume and cement) (TSMAsc). Experimentation highlights that improvements have been recorded resulted {{from the use of}} various RA percentages from both TSMAs and TSMAsc. The additions of silica fume and proportional cement content in the pre-mix on TSMAs and TSMAsc can fill up the weak areas in the RA and thus develop a stronger interfacial layer around aggregate, and hence a higher strength of the concrete. It, thus, concludes that TSMAs and TSMAsc can provide alternative methodologies for further improvement in quality of this recyclable material...|$|R

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that irrigation with the leachate has decreased drain water's SAR in all treatments (Table[*] 6).
