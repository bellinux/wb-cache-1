In {{order to keep the}} impact of this effect as small as possible, wires with the largest possible surface are used in high-frequency technology, e.g. in the form of thin spare cross-sections or Litz wires. The low losses of Litz wires partly stem from the fact that a large area of the inner surface is taking part in the current flow. In particular in electric mobility, the motor is often powered by high-frequency voltage.

Furthermore, only the current in a neighborhood around any point on the conductor significantly contributes to the potential at that point. Time dependence is ignored, {{as it may be}} incorporated by multiplying the current distribution by a time-varying sinusoid. These conditions imply that a quasi-static condition exists and that the geometry is, effectively, one of an infinitely long conductor with a constant surface current density [...] (current per area), thereby reducing a three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional one. Also implied is the magnetic vector potential is parallel to the conductor's axis.|$|R

40|$|A {{time domain}} {{boundary}} element formulation employing the surface impedance boundary conditions (SIBCs) is {{developed for the}} 3 -dimensional transient eddy current problem of cylindrical conductors. SIBCs of different orders of approximation are implemented using the perturbation technique in the small parameter proportional to {{the ratio of the}} skin depth and characteristic size of the <b>conductor</b> <b>cross-section.</b> The formulation consists of a set of time domain surface integral equations that have identical left-hand sides and can be solved using the same program procedure. The number of equations is determined by the order of approximation of the SIBC, namely: solutions in the perfect electrical conductor (PEC) limit (lowest order) and in the so- called Rytov approximation (highest order) are given by one and four equations, respectively. It is demonstrated that each equation admits separation of variables into space and time components, a property that significantly reduces computational costs compared with traditional time domain formulations that require the integral equations to be solved at each time step. For the purpose of validation, a test problem is solved by the proposed formulation and by the ‘original’ BEM based on the time-dependent fundamental solution.

40|$|Electrical {{power cables}} with Cross-Linked Polyethylene Insulation (XLPE-insulation) are {{currently}} utilized in projects of the electric-power supply systems of modern facilities. However, the higher costs, the incomplete design, {{installation and maintenance}} normativetechnical basis as well as certain constructional features of the XLPE-insulated cable lines hinder their large-scale implementation. The cables with XLPE insulation are mostly produced in a single-conductor core version being provided with a composite copper shield whose cross-section may vary while the electric <b>conductor</b> <b>cross-section</b> remains uniform. Earthing the cable shields on both sides causes the flow of electricity in them. The course of operational service of the XLPE-insulated cable lines revealed the following fact – the currents induced in the cable shields can run up to the levels commeasurable {{with those in the}} conductor-cores themselves. That, in its turn, leads to electrical safety-level reduction, cable lines failure, and economic losses. The currents induced in the shields may occur both in symmetric (normal and emergency) and asymmetric operating modes of the power grid with values of the induced currents reaching 80 % of the conducting core currents. Many factors affect the level of the current induced in the shield: the midpoint conductor modes, the values of the core longitudinal currents in the normal and emergency operating modes, failure mode, the cross-section area of the shield, the cables mutual disposition, and the distance between them. The paper claims experimental existence conformation of the cable-shield current induced by that in the conductor-core and demonstrates its measured value. The author establishes that induction of dangerous currents in the cable shields demands elaboration of measures on reducing their level. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} resistance of helically-stranded conductors (aluminium and aluminium alloy), {{intended for use}} in distribution and transmission lines, depends on the <b>conductor</b> <b>cross-section</b> area, the conductivity of the aluminium alloy, the lay length of the aluminium layers, and {{the presence or absence}} of a steel reinforcing core. The presence of a stranded steel core both reduces the conductor resistance due to the conductivity of the galvanized steel wires and increases the resistance due to core magnetizing effects. This brochure describes a process of calculation for stranded aluminium conductors both with and without a steel reinforcing core. APPENDIX A provides a MathCad programme to determine the AC resistance of a stranded conductor for a given current. This output can be used in conjunction with the steady state model to determine the actual current flow or conductor temperature. APPENDIX B provides an alternate model for the calculation of the AC resistance On the basis of laboratory tests and theoretical studies, it has been determined, that AC resistance of stranded aluminium conductors (AAC) or all aluminium conductors (AAAC) can be calculated with acceptable accuracy by taking into consideration the conductor geometry, e. g. lay ratio, diameter of wire, current and temperature distribution of conductor. Resistance calculations with Aluminium conductor Steel reinforced (ACSR), however, can be more complex due interactions between the currents in each helically stranded layer coupled through the steel core. On the basis of results from research [5, 6, 7, 8]* computer programs have been developed that can determine the AC resistance of ACSR very accurately (one presented here). This brochure describes the theory as well as demonstrating a programme that can be used within existing software packages that will enable rapid and accurate determination of AC resistance for helically stranded conductor types...|$|E

G could be increased, but this is highly undesirable since increasing G will increase the loss. Decreasing R is sending the loss in the right direction, but this is still not usually a satisfactory solution. R must be decreased by a large fraction and to do this the <b>conductor</b> <b>cross-sections</b> must be increased dramatically. This not only makes the cable much more bulky but also adds significantly to the amount of copper (or other metal) being used and hence the cost. Decreasing the capacitance also makes the cable more bulky (since the insulation must now be thicker) but is not so costly as increasing the copper content. This leaves increasing L which is the usual solution adopted.|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} features of outdoor lighting lines are of considerable length {{and the use}} {{of a large number of}} light sources of an average power. Under such conditions, in order to determine and maintain the optimal modes of operation of outdoor lighting networks with a bilateral supply it is necessary to choose the wire section of the line. This section should provide the required voltage levels to the light sources in all modes, but it should not be too high, in order not to increase the cost of the grid. This article demonstrates an example of the choice of the optimum <b>conductor</b> <b>cross-section</b> of the lighting line when it is working in a normal mode (bilateral power supply) with voltage levels at the power items of 230 V, as well as in the mode of unilateral power (at voltage loss in the second power item) with a value of the voltage of 230 V in the first item of the power supply. The method of calculation of the mode of such a line that had been presented in part 1 of the article was used. The calculation is performed with the of MathCad software. The diagrams of the voltage distribution at items of the lighting line with bilateral power under conditions of different modes of functioning are plotted for various sections of aluminum conductors. The choice of the optimal values of the cross sections of the lighting network was based on the mentioned diagrams. The specific features of different modes of operation of the lighting line with the chosen conductor cross section were analyzed. Operating parameters for each phase of the line (i. e. voltage at the items of the circuit, power, currents, power loss and voltage drop in all sections) were determined.

40|$|Under {{the market}} economy {{conditions}} every producer should know the proportion of electrical energy to be delivered to a concrete load and the energy losses that arise at the delivery. Any network is characterised by such parameters as loads, generated power, power from slack buses, flows in its branches, which can be determined by computer programs, e. g. Mustang or Power World. However, these programs do not calculate the share of a particular power plant (PP) in supplying a particular load, since the PPs can {{be involved in the}} load delivery in different proportions, without changing the input information on the generated power, loads and branch flows. Therefore, solution of this problem is not purely technical, and many alternative solutions are proposed, the most important among them being based on the principle of proportionality. This principle is in conflict with the notion of the injection node. If the share of a PP in the load coverage is not known, the flow of this plant in the network branches is also unknown. In the paper, it is proposed {{to take into account the}} admittance from a PP to the load, calculating the load share to be covered by this plant. The current from a PP to the load should be calculated proportionally to the admittance of the path to load, after which the admittance of the involved power line attached to a PP is determined. Such admittances take into account not only impedances of these lines but also the currents flowing from other PPs and can be calculated when in the lines not only collinear but also differing in phase currents flow; in the latter case the angle between the currents is accounted for. In such a manner, the load coverage quotient is determined that shows the load coverage to be shared by a given PP. All coverage quotients determined, the address coefficients for all PPs can be calculated. This method allows more realistic calculation of the flows from PPs in a particular power line. The losses of a given PP are found by well-known formulas, assuming that a definite proportion of the phase <b>conductor</b> <b>cross-section</b> of a given line belongs to a given PP.

It is identified that the critical 5 – 20 km medium voltage (MV) underground ac distribution cable link, responsible for bulk power delivery to the inner urban city substation, can benefit the most with capacity and efficiency enhancement, if the existing infrastructure is reused and operated under dc. Quantification of the same is offered in this paper by incorporating all influencing factors like voltage regulation, dc voltage rating enhancement, capacitive leakage currents, skin and magnetic proximity effect, thermal proximity effect and load power factor. Results are presented for three different ac and dc system topologies for varying cable lengths and <b>conductor</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> The computed system efficiency is enhanced with use of modular multilevel converters that have lower losses due to lower switching frequency.
