40|$|Changes in {{agricultural}} production {{methods have been}} associated with environmental pressure and a loss of natural habitats. This paper explores the extent to which farmer participation in off-farm work (an increasing phenomenon in most developed countries) changes the intensity of agricultural input use focusing, in particular, on fertilizer and <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> use. A sample selection model that accounts for both unobserved heterogeneity between farms and the potential simultaneity between farm operations and hours worked off-farm is estimated for 2, 419 farms in England and Wales. The econometric evidence indicates that the input intensity of products which have well-established links to environmental damage can increase as well as decrease. The results suggest that that fertilizer intensity may decline as off-farm labor increases while the use of crop protection per hectare increases as off-farm work increases.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For a <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> {{to achieve}} its goal, the product must be applied and remain on the leaves until it is absorbed. This {{situation}} may be compromised due to rainfall after spraying, thus necessitating reapplication which increase the overall cost. Application technology {{research has focused on}} alternatives and solutions to mitigate this effect through the use of adjuvants. The objective of this research was to evaluate the deposit of spraying liquid on citrus seedlings using the products spirodiclofen, propargite, imidacloprid, lambda cyhalothrin, copper oxychloride, and copper hydroxide with water mixed with the adjuvants polydimethylsiloxane and phosphatidylcholine. Seedlings were subjected to simulated rains of 10 mm at intervals of 1, 6, 12 and 24 h after spraying, and the remaining deposits of spraying liquid per leaf area were analyzed by spectrophotometry by assessing a metallic marker previously added in the spraying liquids. Variables were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey's test (P< 0. 05). The rains that occurred soon after spraying resulted in decreased spraying liquids deposits on citrus leaves. Adjuvant phosphatidylcholine promoted the greatest retention of spraying liquid on citrus leaves after rainfall...|$|E
40|$|Europe and North America are key {{producers}} {{of food in}} the world market and major users of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products.</b> For a number of commodities (e. g., cereals, oilcrops, potatoes, and citrus fruit) they have a considerable share of global food production. Western Europe and North America also {{account for more than}} half of the world market of agrochemicals. The E. U., U. S. A., Japan, and Brazil account for about three-quarters of the global market of agrochemicals. When treated properly, the use of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> extends the lifetime of food products in the agrifood chain. Also, food can be supplied in a more uniform manner and have a better appearance. However, residues of these products may harm the natural environment by contamination of groundwater resources, surface waters, and soils, as well as spray drift affecting air quality and biodiversity. A major challenge to agriculture is to internalize these social costs of production properly in farm management practices. Environmental policy measures are taken across the globe to control such external effects of production on the natural environment. Agricultural policy is a main area of public intervention in the agricultural sector, and the use of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> is therefore also affected by such policy measures. Market and price support measures have encouraged the use of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products.</b> More recently, however, efforts have been made to internalize environmentally harmful effects of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> into farming practices, and reforms of agricultural policies could stimulate farmers to change their practice.

Our theoretical model adopts the multi-output generalization of the Lichtenberg-Zilberman damage control technology model developed by Chambers and Lichtenberg. In the empirical application, farm-level data for a sample of French farms are utilized. Results suggest that price effects on the usage of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> are always more elastic than the compensatory payment effects. This result indicates that a policy reform consisting of a reduction in price-support measures in favor of direct payments to farmers, such as the 1992 CAP reform, involves a certain degree of agricultural policy decoupling and may result in a reduction in the usage of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products.</b> Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|Current {{environmental}} monitoring of pesticides (<b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products)</b> in Sweden mainly concentrates on investigating possible leaching of pesticides used within agriculture. However, {{there is a}} lack of knowledge on how these compounds behave in the environment after their use within horticultural production. In certain parts of southern Sweden there are extensive areas of outdoor fruit and vegetable crops, as well as greenhouse crops. Greenhouses have in some contexts been regarded as 'closed environments'. This has meant that the same high demands have not always been applied when assessing the risks of harmful effects to neighbouring waters of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> used in greenhouses compared with those used in outdoor vegetable crops. The aim of this investigation was to broaden our knowledge of possible leaching to water of pesticides used in field cultivation of horticultural crops and in greenhouses. The investigation, which was carried out in 2008, is the most comprehensive to date as regards the number of pesticides analysed in Swedish watercourses. The analyses comprised 126 different substances, 39 of which have not been investigated previously within Swedish {{environmental monitoring}}. The investigation consisted of surface water sampling in six areas with extensive growing of horticultural crops. Field growing of berries occurred in the catchment area in SE Småland, vegetables in NE Skåne and fruit in SE Skåne. Greenhouse cultivation took place in the catchment area in W Skåne and NW Skåne. Some 10 samples per area were collected during the period May-October 2008. In addition, around 20 water samples were collected for analysis from one of the areas included in national environmental monitoring (area N 34 in Halland). A few samples were also taken of the effluent water from greenhouses with recirculation systems. A total of 78 of the 126 substances included in the investigation were encountered, with a range of between 24 and 44 substances detected in water from the individual areas. The highest numbers of substances and the highest concentrations were detected in the area with intensive vegetable growing in NE Skåne, in the area in Halland and in the two areas with greenhouse growing. Lower concentrations and fewer substances were found in water from the area in SE Småland with strawberry cultivation and from the area in SE Skåne with apple orchards. The guideline value was exceeded in most of the samples collected from the area in NE Skåne and in all samples from the two greenhouse areas (W Skåne and NW Skåne), with the highest exceedences in the latter two areas. The insecticide imidacloprid was the substance that exceeded the guideline value most frequently in this investigation. Some of the substances encountered at elevated levels in water from the areas with greenhouse cultivation were also detected in the samples of effluent water taken from the greenhouses. Substances used widely in ornamental plant production in the greenhouse were also found in the watercourse in W Skåne. The results show that there is leaching of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> from Swedish greenhouses. Future work should therefore aim to identify potential risk elements associated with <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> operations in the greenhouse, with the aim of decreasing losses of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> to neighbouring waters...|$|R
