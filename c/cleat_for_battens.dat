50|$|Innovations in cleat {{technology}} {{continued to}} take place throughout {{the mid to late}} 20th century. In 1954, the first modern football boots were made by Adidas. They were lighter, had a non-leather sole, an upper portion made from kangaroo skin, and included replaceable rubber or plastic studs, which could be screwed in at different lengths. Later, in the 1990s, Adidas introduced another innovation in the form of rubber blades instead of studs, which faced different directions and allowed for better grip. Today, different types of <b>cleats</b> exist <b>for</b> different surfaces: replaceable aluminum cleats which are worn in wet dirt, firm plastic <b>cleats</b> which are <b>for</b> regular surfaces, and short, plastic or rubber <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> very hard surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Flupirtine {{has been}} noted for its neuroprotective properties, and has been {{investigated}} for possible use in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It has also been proposed as a possible treatment <b>for</b> <b>Batten</b> disease.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Fitzgerald was {{involved}} with SoftSpikes, a soft plastic replacement <b>cleat</b> <b>for</b> golf shoes. SoftSpikes was founded by Rob O'Loughlin, Fitzgerald's son-in-law.

5000|$|Cleats {{began to}} be used in the United States in the 1860s when metal spikes were first used on {{baseball}} shoes. [...] A baseball shoe, as defined by the Dickson Baseball Dictionary (3rd Ed), is [...] "a special type of shoe designed and worn by baseball players that features <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> traction and a full set of laces for support." [...] The first official baseball shoe was invented and produced by Waldo M. Claflin, of Philadelphia in 1882. [...] The use of cleats gained further notoriety in the United States with the birth of American football in the early 20th century. The original football shoes were actually baseball shoes, but innovations quickly emerged. In the 1920s, detachable cleats were first introduced. As the game continued to grow, cleats had to adapt to technological advances in playing surfaces, most notably artificial turf. By the 1970s, players were wearing footwear with short, rubber <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> use on artificial turf.|$|R

I knew then that it was all over being a player. I was more interested in art. So I traded my <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> canvas, my bruises for brushes, and put all the violence and power I had felt on the field into my paintings." ...|$|R

As of January 2011, Holt traded in his <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> a clip board as he has returned to his alma mater as a Graduate Assistant Coach..|$|R
50|$|Various {{hardware}} {{is found}} {{attached to the}} boom. The hardware could include fairleads, blocks, block tracks, and <b>cleats.</b> <b>For</b> attachment, screws are used on wooden booms and screws or rivets on aluminium booms. If {{the foot of the}} sail is attached to the boom, there may be hoops from the foot of the sail, around the boom, or there may be a track {{on the top of the}} boom into which fittings on the foot of the sail are slid.|$|R

50|$|Joseph Amos Pipal (January 18, 1874 - August 10, 1955) was an American {{football}}, basketball, {{and track}} and field coach. He served as the head football coach at Doane College (1902), Dickinson College (1907), the University of South Dakota (1910), Occidental College (1911-1915, 1921-1923), and Oregon Agricultural College—now known as Oregon State University—(1916-1917), compiling a career college football record of 50-35-3. Pipal was credited with devising lateral pass and mud <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> football shoes and in 1934 wrote a book titled The lateral pass technique and strategy.|$|R
50|$|In Sydney and Brisbane Australia {{there has}} been a revival of the early days of 18’ skiff sailing. Replicas of famous 18’ skiffs from the period of 1930 through to 1950 have been built using {{original}} techniques, including wooden hulls and spars, gaff rigs, several-piece spinnaker poles and unrestricted sail area. These boats race under the rules of the Australian Historical Skiff Association, which bans wings, trapezes, <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> controlling ropes for the mainsail, jib and spinnaker, and most of the other modern equipment which makes sailing easier.|$|R
30|$|The {{parameters}} of steel 02 material <b>for</b> <b>batten</b> columns and <b>for</b> accurate modeling were verified based on existing experimental results obtained by Jafari and Hossaini-Hashemi (2008). The concrete 01 for shear walls was used, {{and the material}} was modeled as ‘unconfined’ with peak strength achieved at a strain of − 0.002 and minimum post-peak strength achieved at a strain of − 0.008. The reinforcement was assumed to have a post-yield modulus equal to 2 % of the elastic modulus.|$|R
5000|$|Cleats {{may have}} more {{specific}} names based on added benefit they provide. Some published standards only use those more descriptive terms and may never refer to these various lumber components as <b>cleats.</b> <b>For</b> example, lumber placed under {{the top of a}} wood container to add support for a large top are called [...] "joists". Lumber is built into the midsection of the top of a wood container to strengthen the top are called [...] "cleats". When the cleats are enlarged and constructed to support a large top, they may generically be termed [...] "cleats" [...] or more specifically be termed [...] "joists".|$|R
40|$|Batten {{disease is}} the most common {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder of childhood in western countries. A novel cDNA responsible <b>for</b> <b>Batten</b> disease has recently been identified. We have developed a rapid diagnostic solid phase minisequencing test to detect the major 1. 02 kb deletion which is responsible for 81 % of affected chromosomes in Batten disease worldwide. In Finland, 90 % of Batten chromosomes carry the major deletion owing to the enrichment of the CLN 3 gene in the isolated Finnish population...|$|R
500|$|In June 1982, a {{team made}} up of Beattie; Walt Kowall, a {{graduate}} student in anthropology at the University of Alberta; Arne Carlson, an archaeology and geography student from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia; and Arsien Tungilik, an Inuk student and field assistant, were flown to the west coast of King William Island, where they retraced some of the steps of McClintock in 1859 and Schwatka in 1878–79. Discoveries during this expedition included the remains of between six and fourteen men in the vicinity of McClintock's [...] "boat place" [...] and artifacts including a complete boot sole fitted with makeshift <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> better traction.|$|R
50|$|A fore-and-aft {{triangular}} mainsail {{achieves a}} better approximation of a wing form by extending the leech aft, beyond {{the line between}} the head and clew in an arc called the roach, rather than having a triangular shape. This added area would flutter in the wind and not contribute to the efficient airfoil shape of the sail without the presence of battens. Offshore cruising mainsails sometimes have a hollow leech (the inverse of a roach) to obviate the need <b>for</b> <b>battens</b> and their ensuing likelihood of chafing the sail.|$|R
60|$|But {{the beams}} or cleats I found myself on {{were not the}} broad, generous ones that at that time were usually on box-cars. On the contrary, they were very narrow--not more than {{an inch and a}} half in breadth. I couldn't get half of the width of my sole on them. Then there was nothing to which to hold with my hands. True, there were the ends of the two box-cars; but those ends were flat, {{perpendicular}} surfaces. There were no grips. I could only press the flats of my palms against the car-ends for support. But that would have been all right if the <b>cleats</b> <b>for</b> my feet had been decently wide.|$|R
40|$|The {{buckling}} strength problem <b>for</b> <b>battened</b> struts is largely unsolved. Design recommendations given in both CP 118 "The Structural Use of Aluminium" and BS 449 "The Use of Structural Steel in Building" are therefore far from exact. This thesis endeavours to verify {{and extend the}} knowledge upon which the present design rules <b>for</b> <b>battened</b> struts are based. Full scale testing has been employed and particular attention given to eccentric end loading, producing bending in the, plane of the battens. Thin-walled material is now being increasingly used and calls for more precise design information. The problems of local buckling and torsion therefore assume greater importance. Battened struts {{have in the past}} presented problems of rigidity and this was particularly true before the use of welding. Economically designed aluminium alloy structures are at present largely restricted to bolted and riveted construction, because of the reduction in strength when welding is used. An Al-Zn-Mg alloy, which is still under development in the U. K., has been used for this work. Its behaviour was excellent and its efficiency after welding has done much to solve the rigidity problem. The following investigation deals with both axial and eccentric load conditions, using thin walled beaded channels. Axially loaded struts failed by lateral instability of the most heavily loaded channel. The eccentrically loaded struts failed by local buckling of the same channel. Indications are that battens need to be reinforced to combat lateral movement. Their spacing can however be increased if a small reduction in ultimate load is accepted. The interaction method of analysis, suitably factored, would be ideal for practical use. Further research is needed to establish an upper limit of plasticity <b>for</b> the <b>battened</b> strut configuration. Deflection will however control design...|$|R
