5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special ability {{that allows them to}} uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover {{for a short period of}} time. Therefore, <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can then use a starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue in}} these {{developed}} countries is <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> kind of food. More fast food is consumed {{per capita in}} the United States {{than in any other}} country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> heat {{exchanger}} (HX) requires {{some knowledge of}} the different {{heat exchanger}} types, {{as well as the}} environment where the unit must operate. Typically in the manufacturing industry, several differing types of heat exchangers are used for just one process or system to derive the final product. For example, a kettle HX for pre-heating, a double pipe HX for the ‘carrier’ fluid and a plate and frame HX for final cooling. With sufficient knowledge of heat exchanger types and operating requirements, an appropriate selection can be made to optimise the process.|$|E
25|$|Like any {{breed of}} dog, the Picardy Shepherd {{is not for}} everyone, and much thought must be devoted to <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> dog. As more Picard puppies are {{imported}} into the US from France and other countries, {{it is important that}} owners and future breeders remain responsible; they will determine the fate of this breed in the United States. In 2006 the Berger Picard Club of America was formed to help promote and protect this breed. The Berger Picard was fully recognized in the herding group by the American Kennel Club as of 1 July 2015.|$|E

The effect was achieved by a variety of methods including <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> material for the body suits to ensure that there were no wrinkles when the characters moved, shooting the footage at lower framerates and keeping backgrounds simple in terms of details and the use of a neutral tone of grey. The sets were made larger than life to make the characters look small as the producers could not take children as the schedule of shooting was odd.|$|E
25|$|The Ars Amatoria is a , a didactic elegiac poem {{in three}} books that {{sets out to}} teach the arts of {{seduction}} and love. The first book addresses men and teaches them how to seduce women, the second, also to men, teaches how to keep a lover. The third addresses women and teaches seduction techniques. The first book opens with an invocation to Venus, in which Ovid establishes himself as a praeceptor amoris (1.17)—a teacher of love. Ovid describes the places one can go to find a lover, like the theater, a triumph, which he thoroughly describes, or arena—and ways to get the girl to take notice, including seducing her covertly at a banquet. <b>Choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time is significant, as is getting into her associates' confidence.|$|E
25|$|Short for {{electronic}} sports, are video game competitions played most by professional players individually or in teams that gained pupularity {{from the late}} 2000s, the most common genres are fighting, first-person shooter (FPS), multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) and real-time strategy. There are certain games that are made for just competitive multiplayer purposes. With those type of games, players focus entirely one <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so {{that people in the}} area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best. Major League Gaming (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for {{the fact that they have}} played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been able to come up with different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With strategy games, players tend to know how to get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.|$|E

500|$|Development of Halo Wars 2 {{began in}} 2014 when 343 Industries {{approached}} Creative Assembly about collaborating on the title. 343 Industries were careful about <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> partner {{to work with}} on the project; Creative Assembly were chosen for their {{years of experience in}} developing RTS games. An effort was made to integrate the story of Halo Wars 2 more closely with the main storyline of Halo series. This approach influenced the setting of the game, which takes place on the Ark (featured in Halo 3) and is set 28 years after the events of the original Halo Wars to fit more inline with the current timeline of series' main story arc. The game was officially announced in 2015 at Gamescom and showcased at a number of video gaming conventions prior to release. Two open betas ran during the final year of the game's development so that the development team could make adjustments to the game based on feedback from players.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} {{entries in the}} Tales series, Tales of Innocence is an action role-playing video game. The player navigates overworld and town environments, and enters a separate arena-like area during battle. The characters and environments are represented using full 3D graphics and models. Characters gain experience levels using experience points, gained by completing quests and fighting. Side-quests separate from the main narrative can be taken through guilds {{in various parts of}} the overworld. As the player completes side-quests, guilds level up with the character, providing extra materials and items. Guilds level up as players complete quests for them, and some of the game's dungeons are directly linked to guild quests. Guilds are also used to communicate with other players using the Nintendo DS' wireless function. Multiplayer allows two players to cooperate in battle. During navigation, extra plot-related or casual conversations with characters called Skits can be triggered by the player. Some character interactions used a choice-based [...] "bonding" [...] system, where a dialogue choice is offered while conversing with another character or during certain story scenes: <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> response increases the bond with a character, granting both items and special boons in battle.|$|E

A [...] "Social" [...] augmentation enables better reading of an NPC's expression and judging their psychological profile, improving chances of selecting the right dialogue option. While in the game's environments, Adam finds terminals and computers that can be accessed either with a password or through hacking. When hacking, the hacking screen is summoned, which shows the pathway through a device's security system to access the information: the pathway is accessed by opening [...] "directory" [...] nodes to reach the registry. Different nodes have different ratings, affecting how easily they can be accessed. Various devices have different grades of difficulty, which in turn dictate how many times hacking may be attempted. Each hacking attempt activates a Diagnostic Sub-Routine which works to stop the hack, activating a time limit once it is alerted. Adam can use additional skills and items to lengthen the time, such as software to stop or instantly capture nodes or fortify captured nodes to increase the time limit. Successful hacks yield experience points, Credits, and sometimes additional items.|$|E
