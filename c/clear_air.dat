5|$|In 1975, Gillan {{formed the}} Ian Gillan Band with guitarist Ray Fenwick, keyboardist Mike Moran, quickly {{replaced}} with Mickey Lee Soule and then Colin Towns on keyboards, Mark Nauseef on drums and John Gustafson on bass. Their first album, Child in Time {{was released in}} July 1976, followed by <b>Clear</b> <b>Air</b> Turbulence in April 1977 and Scarabus in October. The sound of the band had a distinct jazz-rock aspect which, although interesting to Gillan, proved unpopular, particularly since punk rock was in vogue at that time.|$|E
5|$|Upper-level jet streams. Associated with {{upper level}} jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as <b>clear</b> <b>air</b> turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient {{at the edge of}} the jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, usually next to or just below the axis of the jet.|$|E
5|$|Maricello's super soft tyres {{began to}} degrade quickly, {{allowing}} Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer {{over the next}} two laps. Rossi caught Maricello by the start of the sixth lap but the latter remained on the circuit. King, who was delayed by a long queue of vehicles behind him, was the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and rejoined the track in <b>clear</b> <b>air.</b> On lap eight, Matsushita collided heavily with de Jong at the Novelle chicane, causing him to retire and was later penalised with a three-place grid penalty for the sprint race after the stewards judged him to have missed the corner's braking point. De Jong was able to continue. Marciello made his pit stop for new tyres on the next lap, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to move into the first and second places and both drivers built an advantage over the remainder of the field. Maricello rejoined in eleventh, behind Pic, who made his pit stop one lap later. Sørensen was placed into the Casino Hairpin barriers at the apex of the corner by Nato on lap ten, ending his race. Nato was issued with a ten-second time penalty, but no safety car was deployed. Marvelov retired from the race in the pit lane with damage to his car after running off the circuit, and drove over a kerb exiting the left-hand Louis Chiron corner, causing him to become airborne, and hit the barriers lining the track.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this system}} was {{hampered}} by the inherent limitations of radar systems and the curvature of the Earth. Due {{to the location of}} the Soviet Union {{on the other side of}} the Northern Hemisphere, the potential Soviet ICBM sites were thousands of miles over the horizon from the BMEWS radar stations that were under construction at Thule and <b>Clear</b> <b>Air</b> Force Station, Alaska (and later on, in England), and the BMEWS stations, as huge as they are, could not detect the ICBM warheads immediately after their launching. Only when the warheads had risen above the horizon could they be detected and warnings passed on by the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Clouds {{initially}} form in <b>clear</b> <b>air</b> {{or become}} clouds when fog rises above surface level. The genus {{of a newly}} formed cloud is determined mainly by air mass characteristics such as stability and moisture content. If these characteristics change over time, the genus tends to change accordingly. When this happens, the original genus is called a mother cloud. If the mother cloud retains much of its original form after {{the appearance of the}} new genus, it is termed a genitus cloud. One example of this is stratocumulus cumulogenitus, a stratocumulus cloud formed by the partial spreading of a cumulus type when there is a loss of convective lift. If the mother cloud undergoes a complete change in genus, it {{is considered to be a}} mutatus cloud.|$|E
25|$|After taking Friday off—a {{feature of}} the event {{timetable}} unique to Monaco— the drivers returned to action on Saturday in bright weather conditions. All of the leading drivers had trouble getting <b>clear</b> <b>air</b> as they fought for clear space around the narrow circuit which had been made worse by them taking longer than usual to get optium tyre temperature. Despite having difficulties with his car's handling and narrowly avoiding an accident at Tabac corner, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the weekend so far with a late lap of one minute and 16.758 seconds, half of {{a tenth of a}} second quicker than the second-placed Ricciardo. Rosberg was third-fastest; Vettel in the other Red Bull was fourth, with the two Ferrari drivers in fifth and sixth (with Alonso faster than Räikkönen). Pérez was seventh-fastest, Hülkenberg eighth, Vergne ninth and Daniil Kvyat completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vergne ran off the track at Sainte Dévote and Mirabeau corners. Ericsson went into the Dévote run-off area and reversed to rejoin the track.|$|E

25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in <b>clear</b> <b>air</b> above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E
25|$|They land on Schar's World {{and search}} for the Mind in the Command System, a complex of {{subterranean}} train stations. They soon discover that the Mind is being hunted {{by a pair of}} Idiran soldiers who have killed all the Changers stationed on the planet, and who regard Horza and his crew as enemies, having no knowledge of the Changers' alliance with the Idirans. Horza has kept Balveda alive, and she is taken into the complex. The CATs crew encounter the Idirans in one of the Command System stations, and after a firefight apparently kill one and capture the other. After tracking the Mind to another station, the drone Unaha-Closp discovers it hiding in the reactor car of a Command System train. The second Idiran, who had been mortally wounded but not killed, sets one of the trains for a collision course to the station. The captured Idiran, Xoxarle, frees himself and in the ensuing impact and firefight the remaining members of the <b>Clear</b> <b>Air</b> Turbulence are killed. Horza pursues Xoxarle and is fatally injured, but the Idiran is killed by Unaha-Closp and Balveda.|$|E
25|$|Rosberg {{began to}} pull away from Hamilton, opening up a 1.2 second {{advantage}} over his teammate while Massa was a further one second adrift of Hamilton. Further down the field, Räikkönen passed Hülkenberg to move into eleventh position. Ricciardo pressured teammate Vettel on the start of the third lap, feigning an overtaking manoevure heading into the Senna S chicane but was not close enough to complete the pass. Massa was the first driver to have severe blistering on the soft compound tyres and {{was the first of the}} leading drivers to make a pit stop at the end of lap five for the change to the medium compound tyres, with Vettel, Bottas and Button making similar stops on the following lap. Rosberg held a one-second lead over Hamilton and made his first pit stop from the lead at the end of the seventh lap. Hamilton had been more conservative on his tyres and went half a second faster in <b>clear</b> <b>air.</b> The medium compound tyres took more than one lap to get optimum temperature. Massa was handed a five-second penalty after he was observed speeding in the pit lane, and Hamilton made his pit stop from the lead at the conclusion of lap eight and came out narrowly behind teammate Rosberg.|$|E
