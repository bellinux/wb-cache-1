40|$|The {{application}} of cable bolts as a secondary support system {{is an increasing}} trend in underground coal mines worldwide. The performances of cable bolts have been evaluated under both axial and shear loading conditions. Two methods of testing cables for shear, single and double shear, have been recognised. This paper examines the shear behaviour {{of a variety of}} cable bolts under different pre-tension loads by double shear testing. Plain, spiral and the combination of both cable types were used in this study. The initial axial load and the type of cable bolts are the main factors affecting their shear strength. By increasing the axial pre-tension load, the peak shear load occurs at lower shear displacement. The failure angle due to <b>cable</b> <b>bending</b> across the joint at different pre-tension loads varied between 41 ° and 49 °. This demonstrates that the ratio of axial and perpendicular displacements is almost constant and on average the failure occurs at about 45 °. A novel analytical model is proposed to evaluate the shear behaviour of pre-tensioned fully grouted cable bolts subjected to double shearing. Energy and Fourier Series methods were incorporated in the model to simulate the shear behaviour of cable bolts. The comparison of the experimental results with the proposed model shows a good agreement...|$|R

Slack cables, however, exhibit significant flexural hysteresis resulting from interstrand friction.

The present work deals with {{the analysis of the}} dynamic behavior of such cables. The local mechanical properties of a wire cable are identified experimentally. In particular, the moment-curvature-relationship is determined experimentally at every location of the wire cable which is subjected to dynamic flexural deformations.

They are submitted to traffic loads and exposed to environmental conditions (rain, wind, marine environment, de-icing salts). These loads can lead to two main damage causes: fretting-fatigue and corrosion. These both phenomena can be coupled and lead to premature failures of drawn steel wires. In fact, at specific contact points, cracks are often initiated by fretting-fatigue. Fretting-fatigue {{is due to the}} <b>cable</b> <b>bending.</b> Near anchorages, the bending deformations are the highest and can generate damage (wire cracks). Cracks may propagate under traffic or wind fatigue load. They are also often submitted to a severe environment. Indeed, even if cables are initially protected, these protections can deteriorate and then cables are subject to corrosion. Experimental results show that wire cracks are often initiated by fretting-fatigue and crack propagation is due to fatigue or fatigue corrosion. In this study wire crack is initiated by fretting-fatigue first and fatigue tests are set up after with several environments in order to evaluate their influence on the crack propagation. The studied corrosive environments are: distilled water, sodium chloride solution and thiocyanate ammonium solutions with different concentrations. Lifetimes of specimens are compared. Metallographic and fractographic observations show the influence of the different solutions on the crack propagation. Indeed, since the microstructure of the steel wires is fully oriented in the longitudinal direction, corrosion changes the crack propagation modes and favours mixed mode propagation or longitudinal propagation...|$|R

40|$|Understanding thermal {{effects on}} the {{vibration}} of local (cable-dominant) modes in multi-cable structures is a complicated task. The main difficulty lies in the modification by temperature change of cable tensions, which are then undetermined. This paper applies a finite element procedure to investigate the effects of thermal loads on the linear dynamics of prestressed self-weighted multi-cable structures. Provided that boundary conditions are carefully handled, the discretization of cables with nonlinear curved beam elements can properly represent the thermoelastic behavior of cables {{as well as their}} linearized dynamics. A three-step procedure that aims to replace applied pretension forces with displacement continuity conditions is used. Despite an increase in the computational cost related to beam rotational degrees of freedom, such an approach has several advantages. Nonlinear beam finite elements are usually available in commercial codes. The overall method follows a thermoelastic geometrically non-linear analysis and hereby includes the main sources of non-linearities in multi-cable structures. The effects of <b>cable</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness, which can be significant, are also naturally accounted for. The accuracy of the numerical approach is assessed thanks to an analytical model for the vibration of a single inclined cable under temperature change. Then, the effects of thermal loads are investigated for two cable bridges, highlighting how natural frequencies can be affected by temperature. Although counterintuitive, a reverse relative change of natural frequency may occur for certain local modes. This phenomenon can be explained by two distinct mechanisms, one related to the physics intrinsic to cables and the other related to the thermal deflection of the superstructure. Numerical results show that cables cannot be isolated {{from the rest of the}} structure and the importance of modeling the whole structure for a quantitative analysis of temperature {{effects on the}} dynamics of cable bridges...|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis {{addresses}} {{the threat posed}} to society by sources that can produce high power electromagnetic pulses (HEPM) and be used maliciously to disturb or damage electronic equipment. The vulnerability from intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) has increased in the recent decades due to the widespread dependence of the civil society on sensitive electronic systems and proliferation of radiation sources. As {{the characteristics of the}} disturbances associated with IEMI often have very high frequency content, the existing mitigation measures and protection components may not be adequate. It was seen that for ultra wideband (UWB) transients low voltage protection components may not work as intended, due to parasitic components that arises from the packaging of the device. The large spatial distribution of many civilian facilities and critical infra-structures (e. g., power generation, communications, train system, etc.) presents many unexpected ports for an attacker as the majority of the parts of these systems are not protected or secure. As the new European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) will utilize wireless communication for communication and control of the trains the vulnerability from different radiating HPEM sources was investigated. Angles of incidence and frequencies that are a threat in a given situation are identified. Due to the possibility of unexpected ports, the propagation of differential mode ultra wideband transients in low voltage power networks, when injected into a power socket of a facility, was studied. The effects on the transient propagation from <b>cable</b> <b>bends,</b> switches and junctions were studied, both in a laboratory setup and in the network of a facility. Also, as modern electronic equipment and systems may not be tested for waveforms and disturbances other than standardized EMC tests, experiments on some common commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment were performed with non-standard test situation. It was seen that these could easily be disturbed or even permanently damaged. In addition, due to the inherent difficulties with IEMI, a new method for classifying facilities from IEMI is suggested. It is based on available terminology of accessibility (A), susceptibility (S) and consequence (C), but expands these and forms the so called IEMI/ASC-cube...|$|R

Moreover, the finite difference method and the finite element method in numerical analysis can often be ineffective because of inappropriate parameter configuration and the drastic variation of functions in the boundary layers. Therefore, this study proposed a novel bending moment expression of a large sag catenary.

The design requirements for the cable include a high operating current so that a field of 10 - 11 T can be produced, together with a low critical current degradation due to bending around a 90 mm radius. A program, using ITER strands of the internal tin type, was launched to develop the optimal cable design for React-and-Wind common coil magnets.

40|$|Degradation of {{the cable}} jacket, {{electrical}} insulation, and other cable components of installed cables within nuclear power plants (NPPs) is known to occur {{as a function of}} age, temperature, radiation, and other environmental factors. System tests verify cable function under normal loads; however, demonstration of some cable’s ability to perform under exceptional loads associated with design-basis events is essential to assuring plant integrity. The cable’s ability to perform safely over the initial 40 -year planned and licensed life has generally been demonstrated and there have been very few age-related cable failures. With greater than 1000 km of power, control, instrumentation, and other cables typically found in an NPP, replacing all the cables would be a severe cost burden. Justification for life extension to 60 and 80 years requires a cable aging management program to justify cable performance under normal operation as well as accident conditions. A variety of tests are available to assess various aspects of electrical and mechanical cable performance, but none of these tests are suitable for all cable configurations nor does any single test confirm all features of interest. One particularly powerful test that is beginning to be used more and more by utilities is frequency domain reflectometry (FDR). FDR is a nondestructive electrical inspection technique used to detect and localize faults in power and communication system conductors along the length of a cable from a single connection point. For the measurement, two conductors in the cable system are treated as a transmission line, which propagates a low-voltage swept-frequency waveform to interrogate the cable length. Note that because the applied signal is low-voltage (3 ̆c 5 volts), the test is completely nondestructive and poses no special safety concerns to operators. An inverse Fourier transform is used to convert the resulting frequency-domain data into a time-domain format, which can determine the physical location of signal reflections if the signal propagation velocity is known. FDR detects discontinuities in the electrical impedance that arise due to cable splices or similar changes along the path of the conductor pair. In addition, FDR has the potential to provide sensitivity to insulation degradation by detecting small changes in capacitance between the cable conductors being examined. Example changes that impact the insulation capacitance include exposure to heat, radiation, water damage, corrosion, or mechanical fatigue. The technique is also sensitive to <b>cable</b> <b>bends,</b> the particular lay {{of the cable}} in tray, proximity to other cable, and other factors that bear consideration when interpreting these tests.
