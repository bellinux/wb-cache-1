40|$|Nutritional {{studies were}} {{performed}} on nine Bacteroides strains, by use of the methodology and media of anaerobic rumen microbiology. Ristella perfoetens CCI required l-arginine hydrochloride, l-tryptophan, l-leucine, l-histidine hydrochloride, l-cysteine hydrochloride, dl-valine, dl-tyrosine, and the vitamin calcium-d-pantothenate, since scant turbidity developed in media without these nutrients. R. perfoetens was stimulated by glycine, dl-lysine hydrochloride, dl-isoleucine, l-proline, l-glutamic acid, dl-alanine, dl-phenylalanine, dl-methionine, and the vitamins nicotinamide and p-aminobenzoic acid, since maximal turbidity developed more slowly in media without these nutrients than in complete medium. Medium A- 23, which was devised for R. perfoetens, contained salts, 0. 0002 % nicotinamide and <b>calcium</b> <b>d-pantothenate,</b> 0. 00001 % p-aminobenzoic acid, 0. 044 % l-tryptophan, 0. 09 % l-glutamic acid, and 0. 1 % of the other 13 amino acids listed above. Zuberella clostridiformis and seven strains of R. pseudoinsolita did not require vitamins, and showed no absolute requirement for any one amino acid. Various strains produced maximal turbidity more slowly in media deficient in l-proline, glycine, l-glutamic acid, dl-serine, l-histidine hydrochloride, dl-alanine, or l-cysteine hydrochloride, than in complete medium. These eight strains grew optimally in medium A- 23 plus 0. 1 % dl-serine but without vitamins...|$|E
30|$|After a {{successful}} start-up which lasted for 10  days, a synthetic medium containing 5  mM of glucose {{as the sole}} electron donor and the following nutrients (per litre): 50  mM K 2 HPO 4, 10  mM KH 2 PO 4, 0.1  mM (NH 4) 2 SO 4, 0.25  mM MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O, 0.25  mM CaCl 2, 100  µL trace element solution, and 100  µL vitamin solution was used to sustain the continuous electricity production in MFCs. Vitamins solution contained (per litre): 1  mg biotin, 1  mg folic acid, 8  mg pyridoxine, 3  mg HCl, 3  mg thiamine HCl· 2 H 2 O, 2  mg riboflavin, 2  mg nicotinic acid, 2  mg <b>calcium</b> <b>d-pantothenate,</b> 0.1  mg vitamin B 12, 2  mg p-aminobezoic acid, and 2  mg lipoic acid.

40|$|Four {{groups of}} {{juvenile}} Megalobrama amblycephala were fed three times daily with six semi-purified diets containing 3. 39 (PA unsupplied diet), 10. 54, 19. 28, 31. 04, 48. 38 and 59. 72 mg kg(- 1) <b>calcium</b> <b>D-pantothenate.</b> The {{results showed that}} survival rate, final weight, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio and nitrogen retention efficiency all increased significantly (P< 0. 01) as dietary PA levels increased from 3. 39 to 19. 28 mg kg(- 1), whereas the opposite was true for feed conversion ratio. Whole-body crude protein increased as dietary PA levels increased, while the opposite pattern was found for the crude lipid content. Intestinal α-amylase, lipase, protease, Na+-K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities were all elevated in fish fed PA-supplemented diets. Hepatic catalase activities improved with increases in dietary PA, while the opposite was true for malondialdehyde contents. The liver PA concentration and coenzyme A content rose significantly (P< 0. 01), up to 31. 04 mg kg(- 1), with increasing dietary PA levels and then plateaued. The percentage of hepatic saturated fatty acids increased significantly (P< 0. 01) as dietary PA levels increased, while the percentages of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) decreased as dietary PA increased. Fish fed diets containing 19. 28 and 31. 04 mg kg(- 1) PA exhibited higher (P< 0. 01) docosahexaenoic acid and PUFA percentages in muscle than those fed with other diets. The expression of the gene encoding pantothenate kinase was significantly up-regulated (P< 0. 01) in fish fed PA-supplemented diets. Hepatic Acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, fatty acid synthetase, stearoyl regulatory element-binding protein 1 and X receptor α genes all increased significantly (P< 0. 01) as dietary PA levels increased from 3. 39 to 31. 04 mg kg(- 1). Based on broken-line regression analyses of weight gain, liver CoA concentrations and PA contents against dietary PA levels, the optimal dietary PA requirements of juvenile blunt snout bream were estimated to be 24. 08 mg kg(- 1) ...|$|E
