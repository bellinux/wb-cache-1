500|$|Stable carbenes {{are very}} reactive, {{and so the}} minimum amount of {{handling}} is desirable using air-free techniques. However, provided rigorously dry, relatively non-acidic and air-free materials are used, stable carbenes are reasonably robust to handling per se. By way of example, a stable carbene prepared from potassium hydride can be filtered through a dry <b>celite</b> pad to remove excess KH (and resulting salts) from the reaction. On a relatively small scale, a suspension containing a stable carbene in solution can be allowed to settle and the supernatant solution pushed through a dried membrane syringe filter. Stable carbenes are readily soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane, and so typically recrystallisation of stable carbenes can be difficult, due to the unavailability of suitable non-acidic polar solvents. Air-free sublimation as shown right {{can be an effective}} method of purification, although temperatures below 60°C under high vacuum are preferable as these carbenes are relatively volatile and also could begin to decompose at these higher temperatures. Indeed, sublimation in some cases can give single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. However, strong complexation to metal ions like lithium will in most cases prevent sublimation.|$|E

5000|$|A {{proposed}} {{mechanism for}} the oxidation of an alcohol by Fétizon's reagent involves single electron oxidation of both the alcoholic oxygen and the hydrogen alpha to the alcohol by two atoms of silver(I) within the <b>celite</b> surface. The carbonate ion then proceeds to deprotonate the resulting carbonyl generating bicarbonate which is further protonated by the additionally generated hydrogen cation to cause elimination of water and generation of carbon dioxide.The rate limiting step of this reaction is proposed to be the initial association of the alcohol to the silver ions. As a result, the presence of even weakly associating ligands to the silver can inhibit the reaction greatly. As a result, even slightly polar solvents of any variety, such as ethyl acetate or methyl ethyl ketone, are avoided when using this reagent as they competitively associate with the reagent. [...] Additional polar functionalities of the reactant should also be avoided whenever possible as even {{the presence of an}} alkene can sometimes reduce the reactivity of a substrate 50 fold. [...] Commonly employed solvents such as benzene and xylene are extremely non-polar and further acceleration of the reaction can be achieved through the use of the more non-polar heptane. [...] The solvent is also typically refluxed to drive the reaction with heat and remove the water generated by the reaction through azeotropic distillation.Steric hindrance of the hydrogen alpha to the alcohol is a major determination of the rate of oxidation as it effects the rate of association. Tertiary alcohols lacking an alpha hydrogen are selected against and generally do not oxidize in the presence of Fétizon's reagent.Increasing the amount of <b>celite</b> used in the reagent accelerates the rate of the reaction by increasing the surface area available to react. However, increasing the amount of <b>celite</b> past 900 grams per mole of silver(I) carbonate begins to slow the reaction due to dilution effects.|$|E

For improving the yield of the glycosidase catalyzed reactions, hydration {{level of the}} media has to be carefully maintained because the presence of water is necessary for enzyme activity {{but at the same}} time water causes parasitic hydrolysis of the substrate and product [17]. <b>Celite</b> R- 640 ® is a chemically inert silica-based matrix and has shown promising potential for maintaining hydration level of media during enzyme catalyzed peptide and amide synthesis [78].

This preparation exhibited good stability of the enzyme even in co-solvents like dimethyl formamide compared to enzymes immobilized on Amberlite XAD- 4. Other materials such as DEAE-sepharose and polyacrylamide have also been used to immobilize β-glucosidases for synthesis of AGs.
