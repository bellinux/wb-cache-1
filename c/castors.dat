25|$|Terry Nation's {{original}} plan {{was for the}} Daleks to glide across the floor. Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon <b>castors,</b> propelled by the operator's feet. Although <b>castors</b> were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios, for The Dalek Invasion of Earth Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed {{on the streets of}} London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature tricycles with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base. The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and {{it was not possible to}} remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on static electricity drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.|$|E

Furthermore, some important reactions on converting <b>castor</b> oil into useful products is discussed. The reactions discussed include hydrogenation, pyrolysis, caustic fusion, dehydration, transesterification, sulphonation, and polymerization. The use of <b>castor</b> oil and ricinoleic acid as green capping agent in the synthesis of nanomaterials is highlighted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Castor- stalk is {{one kind}} of {{excellent}} wood materials {{can be used to}} make the wood based panel and substitute for the wood resource, reducing the pollution caused by <b>castor</b> stalk-burnt. The properties of the <b>castor</b> stalk based fiber panel are better than the properties of the <b>castor</b> stalk based particle panel made under the same techniques. It studied the infiltrating-characters, the radicals-concentration and the micro-structure of the <b>castor</b> stalk based panel with highly effective surface tension and angle of contact instrument, Electron spin resonating spectrum instrument (ESR) and Scanning electronic microscope (SEM). The results show that the wetting-soakage and the radicals-concentration of the <b>castor</b> fiber are worse than those of the <b>castor</b> particle. The micro-structure of the <b>castor</b> fiber is complete and smooth without crevasse in the <b>castor</b> stalk based fiber panel. But the micro-structure of the <b>castor</b> fiber is not complete and is bruised in the <b>castor</b> stalk based particle panel.

25|$|Kitchener {{received}} a sobering 10–4 loss in game {{one at the}} hands of Sherbrooke. The Rangers played much better in game two, defeating Portland 9–2. Brian Bellows scored 11 seconds into the game, setting a Memorial Cup record. In their third game, the Rangers shut out the <b>Castors</b> 4–0, atoning for the previous lopsided loss in game one. The game was very physical, and included a bench-clearing brawl in the second period. Kitchener seemed to be a bit worn out the next night, losing 4–2 to Portland.|$|E
25|$|Castor {{underwent}} a refit at Plymouth between November 1798 and March 1799, recommissioning under Captain Edward Leveson Gower. In March 1799 {{a quantity of}} the gunpowder stores were accidentally ignited, causing severe injury to one of <b>Castors</b> midshipmen. The injured man having been replaced, Captain Gower sailed Castor to Newfoundland in April 1799, but by December that year Castor was on the Spanish coast when she captured the 2-gun privateer Santa Levivate y Aninimus off Oporto on Christmas Day 1799. Captain David Lloyd took command of Castor in 1801, but he was soon succeeded by Captain Bernard Hale who sailed for the West Indies in April 1801. Hale died in 1802; his successor Captain Richard Peacocke continued to command Castor in the West Indies.|$|E
500|$|In November 1974, they {{employed}} {{for the first}} time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows. In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named [...] "Algie". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall. The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a [...] high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. One striking feature of the tour was the performance of [...] "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a flightcase on <b>castors,</b> an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech.|$|E

In this research, the Malaysian newly produces <b>castor</b> beans are extracted and the <b>castor</b> oil is characterized.
