40|$|We {{argue that}} <b>contingent</b> {{convertible}} <b>capital</b> (CoCo-Bonds) might have perverse risk-taking incentives for banks (asset substitution problem) and discourage them from investing in positive NPV projects and issuing new equity {{in times of}} crisis (debt overhang problem). Whenever the conversion price is set too high - {{as in the case of}} the Lloyds CoCo-Bond issuance in November 2009 - a wealth transfer will take place at the time of conversion. This will exacerbate both the asset substitution problem and the debt overhang problem. We propose a new type of <b>contingent</b> convertible <b>capital</b> for banks - which we label Convert-to-Surrender Bonds (CoSu-Bonds) - which eliminates both the asset substitution and the debt overhang problem. CoSu-Bond convert into equity once the equity ratio falls below a certain threshold and CoSu-Bond holders take over the bank while equity holders are totally wiped out. This instrument makes equity holders naturally risk averse and gives incentives to equity holders to raise new equity and to invest also in slightly negative NPV projects in times of financial distress. Our instrument has a unique price if it is augmented by a simple option for old equity holders to issue equity if the trigger is hit, thereby circumventing the problem of multiple equilibria. We develop a tractable model to analyze risk-taking incentives in the banking sector and present a detailled analysis of the Lloyds CoCo-Bond issuance. We finally discuss several policy issues associated with this new instrument including robustness and unique equilibria...|$|R
40|$|<b>Contingent</b> {{convertible}} <b>capital</b> instruments (CoCos) are {{hybrid capital}} securities that absorb losses when {{the capital of}} the issuing bank falls below a certain level. In this article, we go over the structure of CoCos, trace the evolution of their issuance, and examine their pricing in primary and secondary markets. CoCo issuance is primarily driven by their potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. The bulk of the demand for CoCos has come from small investors, while institutional investors have been relatively restrained so far. The spreads of CoCos over other subordinated debt greatly depend on their two main design characteristics – the trigger level and the loss absorption mechanism. CoCo spreads are more correlated with the spreads of other subordinated debt than with CDS spreads and equity prices. JEL classification: G 12, G 21, G 28. Private investors are usually reluctant to provide additional external capital to banks in times of financial distress. In extremis, the government can end up injecting capital to prevent the disruptive insolvency of a large financial institution because nobody else is willing to do so. Such public sector support costs taxpayers and distorts the incentives of bankers. <b>Contingent</b> convertible <b>capital</b> instruments (CoCos) offer a way to address this problem. CoCos are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses in accordance with their contractual terms when {{the capital of the}} issuing bank falls below a certain level. 2 Then debt is reduced and bank capitalisation gets a boost. Owing to their capacity to absorb losses, CoCos have the potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. In this article, we examine recent developments and trends in the market for CoCos.

40|$|We {{highlight}} the ex ante risk-shifting incentives faced by a bank's shareholders/managers when CoCos (<b>contingent</b> convertible <b>capital)</b> {{are part of}} the capital structure. The risk shifting incentive arises from the wealth transfers that the shareholders will receive upon the CoCo's conversion under CoCo designs widely used in practice. Specifically we show that for principal writedown and nondilutive equity-converting CoCos, shareholders/managers have an incentive to take on more risk to make conversion more likely because of those wealth transfers. As a consequence, wide spread use of CoCos will increase systemic fragility. We show that such improperly designed CoCos {{should not be allowed to}} fill in loss absorption capacity requirements unless accompanied by higher required equity ratios to mitigate the increased risk taking incentives they lead to. Sufficiently dilutive CoCos do not lead to undesired risk taking behavior...|$|R

I use data on stocks of gross external assets and liabilities for 167 countries over 1973 - 2003, in an unbalanced panel probit regression to obtain robust estimates of the probability and determinants of a post-crisis recession. Several single and simultaneous equation specifications support the idea that the output cost of a currency crisis depends on its transmission mechanism.

40|$|The {{proposal}} for banks to issue <b>contingent</b> <b>capital</b> that must convert into common equity when the banks' stock price falls below a specified threshold, or "trigger," {{does not in}} general lead to a unique equilibrium in equity and <b>contingent</b> <b>capital</b> prices.

The return on the bank's assets follows a jump-diffusion process, and default-free interest rates are stochastic. The equilibrium pricing of the bank's deposits, <b>contingent</b> <b>capital,</b> and shareholders' equity is studied for various parameter values haracterizing the bank's risk and the contractual terms of its <b>contingent</b> <b>capital.</b> Allowing for the possibility of jumps in the bank's asset value, as might occur during a financial crisis, has distinctive implications for valuing <b>contingent</b> <b>capital.</b> Credit spreads on <b>contingent</b> <b>capital</b> are higher the lower is the value of shareholders' equity at which conversion occurs and the larger is the conversion discount from the bond's par value. The effect of requiring a decline in a financial stock price index for conversion (dual price trigger) is to make <b>contingent</b> <b>capital</b> more similar to non-convertible subordinated debt. The paper also examines the bank's incentive to increase risk when it issues different forms of <b>contingent</b> <b>capital</b> as well as subordinated debt. In general, a bank that issues <b>contingent</b> <b>capital</b> has a moral hazard incentive to raise its assets' risk of jumps, particularly when the value of equity at the conversion threshold is low.

40|$|<b>Contingent</b> {{convertible}} <b>capital</b> (CoCo) is a {{debt instrument}} that converts to equity or is written off if the issuing bank fails {{to meet a}} distress threshold. The conversion increases the issuer’s lossabsorption capacity, but results in wealth transfers between CoCo holders and shareholders, which in turn gives rise to risk-shifting incentives to shareholders. Using the framework of call options, {{we find that the}} risk-shifting incentives arising from issuing CoCos relative to subordinated debt have two opposite effects: higher risk increases the probability of CoCo conversion, while lowering the benefit of the wealth transfer relative to the same amount of subordinated debt. For writedown CoCos, the risk-shifting incentive is always positive, while for equity-converting CoCos, it depends on the dilutive power of the CoCo. While recent regulation has deemed CoCos suitable for increasing loss absorption capacity, our results show that some CoCos are potentially riskier than issuing subordinated debt in their place. To sidestep these consequences, their use by banks must be tempered by increasing capital requirements, and as such, they should not be treated as true substitutes for equity...|$|R
40|$|In {{times of}} {{financial}} distress, banks struggle to source additional capital from reluctant private investors.

Although gaining in popularity in developed economies, CoCo issuance in Africa is still in its infancy, possibly due to pricing complexity and ambiguity about conversion triggers. In this paper, the pricing of these instruments is investigated and the influence of local conditions (using data from three major African markets and an all- African index) on CoCo prices is explored. We find that the African milieu (high interest rates and equity volatility compared with the situation in developed markets) makes CoCos particularly attractive instruments for the simultaneous reduction of debt and the enhancement of capital.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} a {{response}} to the Casualty Actuarial Society’s request for proposals on "Contingent Capital". In light of the recent financial crisis, <b>contingent</b> <b>capital,</b> a type of hybrid security, is seen as an innovative way of recapitalization given the occurrence of a specified event, such as the capital adequacy ratio falling below the threshold. Although it has gained prominence among regulators, there are some doubts from market participants. The effectiveness of this automatic bail-in hybrid security is still too early to tell given the limited market experience and unclearness of the impact on the share price when the conversion is triggered. The goal of this research is to explore the key features of <b>contingent</b> <b>capital,</b> its market, the appropriate pricing and valuation tools, and its application in insurance industry. It is hoped that the research will increase our understanding of <b>contingent</b> <b>capital</b> and facilitate the assessment of its value and risk. Motivation.

40|$|CoCo 9 ̆ 2 s (<b>contingent</b> {{convertible}} <b>capital)</b> {{are designed}} to convert from debt to equity when banks need it most. Using a Diamond-Dybvig model cast in a global games framework, we show that while the CoCo conversion of the issuing bank may bring the bank back into compliance with capital requirements, it will nevertheless raise the probability of the bank being run, because conversion is a negative signal to depositors about asset quality. Moreover, conversion imposes a negative externality on other banks in the system in the likely case of correlated asset returns, so bank runs elsewhere in the banking system become more probable too and systemic risk will actually go up after conversion. CoCo 9 ̆ 2 s thus lead to a direct conflict between micro- and macroprudential objectives. We also highlight that ex ante incentives to raise capital to stave off conversion depend critically on CoCo design. In many currently popular CoCo designs, wealth transfers after conversion actually flow from debt holders to equity holders, destroying the latter 9 ̆ 2 s incentives to provide additional capital in times of stress.

40|$|Contrary to the {{prediction}} of benchmark neoclassical models, growth accelerations in developing countries tend to be associated with current account improvements, resulting from larger increases in saving than in investment. I argue that this can be driven by the behavior of entrepreneurs facing incomplete financial markets and risky investment. The uninsurable risk of losing invested capital forces entrepreneurs to rely on self-financing to build up their firms. As new business opportunities open up, entrepreneurs increase their saving to finance the investment that produces growth. The key insight is that saving has to rise more than investment in order to allow also for the accumulation of precautionary assets. As a consequence, entrepreneurs generate a net saving increase that sustains persistent net capital outflows. Plausibly calibrated simulations produce sizeable quantitative effects.
