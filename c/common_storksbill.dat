5000|$|Wingletang Down is 28.9 ha of {{maritime}} heath, {{dune grassland}} and scrub reaching a maximum height of 20 m above sea-level {{and is considered}} by Plantlife to be an Important Plant Area. Due to exposure to salt-laden winds, wind-pruned or [...] "waved" [...] maritime heath has developed on the low nutrient, shallow soils on the higher land, whilst to the south on the deeper sandy soils close to sea-level dune grassland grows. At the southern promontory of Horse Point there is short maritime grass and a tumble of large granite boulders where shallow temporary brackish pools occur. Sea milkwort (Glaux maritima) is a rare plant in Scilly and grows here. Sand sedge (Carex arenaria) and sand couch (Elytrigia juncea) dominate the dune grassland between Wingletang Bay and Porth Askin whilst flowering plants include <b>common</b> <b>storksbill</b> (Erodium cicutarium), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica) and hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) which is unusual here as it usually grows in wet habitats. At Beady Pool, {{which is part of}} Wingletang Bay, sea kale (Crambe maritima) grows on the strandline along with yellow horned poppy (Glaucium flavum) and sea spurge (E paralias). There is a colony of Six-spot Burnet (Zygaena filipendulae) here and in the past Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula) nested. The nationally scarce (but common on all the inhabited islands) early meadow grass (Poa infirma) grows in the short maritime grass west of Porth Askin.|$|E
25|$|These {{are known}} as zonal geraniums because many have zones or {{patterns}} {{in the center of}} the leaves, this is the contribution of the Pelargonium zonale parent. <b>Common</b> names include <b>storksbill,</b> fish or horseshoe geraniums. They are also referred to as Pelargonium ×hortorum Bailey. Zonal pelargoniums are tetraploid, mostly derived from P.inquinans and P.zonale, together with P.scandens and P.frutetorum.|$|R
