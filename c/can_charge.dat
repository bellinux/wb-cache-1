5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> from the bus power {{as if there were}} a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the charging port transparently.|$|E

50|$|Price {{controls}} are governmental {{restrictions on the}} prices that <b>can</b> be <b>charged</b> {{for goods and services}} in a market. The intent behind implementing such controls can stem from the desire to maintain affordability of goods, to prevent during shortages, and to slow inflation, or, alternatively, to ensure a minimum income for providers of certain goods or a minimum wage. There are two primary forms of price control, a price ceiling, the maximum price that <b>can</b> be <b>charged,</b> and a price floor, the minimum price that <b>can</b> be <b>charged.</b>|$|R

25|$|In Ontario, {{gas storage}} is {{regulated}} by the Ontario Energy Board. Currently all the available storage is owned by vertically integrated utilities. The utility companies have to price their storage capacity sold to their customers at cost-based rates, but can market any remaining capacity at market-based rates. Storage developed by independent storage developers <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> market-based rates.|$|E
25|$|To prevent usury (unreasonable and {{excessive}} rates of interest), some jurisdictions limit the annual percentage rate (APR) that any lender, including payday lenders, <b>can</b> <b>charge.</b> Some jurisdictions outlaw payday lending entirely, {{and some have}} very few restrictions on payday lenders. In the United States, the rates of these loans used to be restricted in most states by the Uniform Small Loan Laws (USLL), with 36–40% APR generally the norm.|$|E

25|$|As of January 2017, in Mexico {{there were}} 700 public access {{charging}} stations for PHEVs that are privately owned. The Ministry of Energy {{and the state}} owned electric power utility, Comision Federal de Electricidad, will destine $25 million MXN to install 100 more charging stations through 2017-2018 in the metropolitan areas of Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City.

This program was paid for by a grant from the state of Massachusetts due to Salem's status as a Massachusetts Green Community.|$|E
25|$|In {{basically}} {{all major}} primate taxa, aggression {{is used by}} the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males. In hamadryas baboons, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them. Wild chimpanzees <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting. A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates {{is that it is a}} way for males to train females to be afraid of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.|$|E

25|$|The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) {{estimates}} {{that there are}} more than 50,000 credit firms that come under its widened remit, of which 200 are payday lenders. Payday loans in the United Kingdom are a rapidly growing industry, with four times as many people using such loans in 2009 compared to 2006 – in 2009 1.2 million people took out 4.1 million loans, with total lending amounting to £1.2 billion. In 2012, it is estimated that the market was worth £2.2 billion and that the average loan size was around £270. Two-thirds of borrowers have annual incomes below £25,000. There are no restrictions on the interest rates payday loan companies <b>can</b> <b>charge,</b> although they are required by law to state the effective annual percentage rate (APR). In the early 2010s there was much criticism in Parliament of payday lenders.|$|E
25|$|CBS alienated and {{confused}} fans with its sporadic treatment of regular season telecasts. With {{a sense of}} true continuity destroyed, fans eventually figured {{that they could not}} count on the network to satisfy their needs (thus, poor ratings were a result). CBS televised about 16 regular season Saturday afternoon games (not counting back-up telecasts) which was 14 less than what NBC televised during the previous contract. According to Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, the reason for the reduction in regular season telecasts was in order for teams to sell them locally {{in order to make a}} direct profit. CBS used the strategy of broadcasting only a select amount of games in order to build a demand in response to supposedly sagging ratings. In theory, the limited regular season package would require the network to sell less advertising during the year so it <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> more for its postseason events.|$|E
25|$|Until it was {{required}} to sell Gatwick and Stansted Airports, Heathrow Airport Holdings held a dominant position in the London aviation market, and has been heavily regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) {{as to how much}} it <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> airlines to land. The annual increase in landing charge per passenger was capped at inflation minus 3% until 1 April 2003. From 2003 to 2007 charges increased by inflation plus 6.5% per year, taking the fee to £9.28 per passenger in 2007. In March 2008, the CAA announced that the charge would be allowed to increase by 23.5% to £12.80 from 1 April 2008 and by inflation plus 7.5% for each of the following four years. In April 2013, the CAA announced a proposal for Heathrow to charge fees calculated by inflation minus 1.3%, continuing until 2019. Whilst the cost of landing at Heathrow is determined by the CAA and Heathrow Airport Holdings, the allocation of landing slots to airlines is carried out by Airport Co-ordination Limited (ACL).|$|E

25|$|ETFs have a {{reputation}} for lower costs than traditional mutual funds. This will be evident as a lower expense ratio. This is mainly from two factors, the fact that most ETFs are index funds and some advantages of the ETF structure. However, this needs to be compared in each case, since some index mutual funds also have a very low expense ratio, and some ETFs' expense ratios are relatively high. An index fund is much simpler to run, since it does not require some security selection, and can be largely done by computer. Not only does an ETF have lower shareholder-related expenses, but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash redemptions, an ETF does not have to maintain a cash reserve for redemptions and saves on brokerage expenses. Mutual funds <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> 1% to 3%, or more; index fund expense ratios are generally lower, while ETFs are almost always less than 1%. Over the long term, these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} hunting sloth bears {{involved}} {{the use of}} beaters, in which case, a hunter waiting on a post could either shoot the approaching bear through the shoulder or on the white chest mark if it was moving directly to him. Sloth bears are very resistant to body shots, and <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> hunters if wounded, though someone of steady nerves could score a direct hit from within a few paces of a charging bear. Sloth bears were easy to track during the wet season, as their clear footprints could be followed straight to their lairs. The majority of sloth bears killed in forests were due to chance encounters with them during hunts for other game. In hilly or mountainous regions, two methods were used to hunt them there. One was to lie in wait above the bear's lair at dawn {{and wait for the}} bear to return from its nocturnal foraging. Another was to rouse them at daytime by firing flares into the cave to draw them out. Sloth bears were also occasionally speared on horseback. In Sri Lanka, the baculum of a sloth bear was once used as a charm against barrenness.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{original}} Mega Man and Mega Man 2 {{as the main}} inspiration for the gameplay in Mega Man 9, several significant features from previous games were left out. Specifically, Mega Man lacks the ability to slide along {{the ground and the}} ability to charge up his Mega Buster for more powerful shots. Aside from using or omitting various elements from past games in the series, Mega Man 9 introduces a time attack mode and 50 optional challenges where certain requirements should be met to be accomplished. These range from defeating a boss using only the Mega Buster to clearing the entire game without taking any damage. Downloadable content for all three versions of the game was made available for purchase during October 2008. Proto Man can be downloaded as an alternate playable character. Proto Man is able to slide, <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> up his buster, and takes double the damage of Mega Man, among other differences. Additional downloadable add-ons include higher difficulty modes, an endless stage, and a special stage featuring a new boss, Fake Man. In the later release of the game as part of Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, instead of having actual DLC, completing the game or entering the secret code at the Mega Man 9 title screen is the new requirement to unlock to acquire the former DLC extra material.|$|E

25|$|Korean {{courts have}} ruled {{that it may}} violate the {{constitution}} {{for the government to}} limit the amount of money hagwon <b>can</b> <b>charge.</b> In early 2008, the Seoul government was working on changes to the regulations to allow hagwons to set their own hours, citing individual choice as trumping regulation. However, the government reversed its position five days later. The regulations were criticized as ineffective because the city council possessed limited resources to monitor and enforce them. Along with these restrictions, hagwon also had to disclose their tuition amounts to the government so people could complain if the schools attempted to raise the tuition. The licenses of hagwon caught running false advertisements will be revoked. Hagwon are required to issue cash receipts. In July 2009, to help catch violators of these new regulations, the government started a program to reward people who reported them. The regulations were intended to reduce the cost of private education. However, some hagwon added weekend classes to compensate for shorter weekday classes. Other parents have sought out private tutors {{to make up for lost}} study time. Other hagwon simply ignored the regulations. It was reported in April 2009 that 67percent of hagwon sampled were found to have overcharged for tuition. Forty percent were found to have charged parents over two times the registered tuition amount.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of fair trade and ethical {{marketing}} organizations employing different marketing strategies. Most fair trade marketers believe it is necessary to sell the products through supermarkets to get a sufficient volume of trade to affect the developing world. The Fairtrade brand is by far the biggest of the fair trade coffee brands. Packers in developed countries pay a fee to The Fairtrade Foundation for the right to use the brand and logo, and nearly all the fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers <b>can</b> <b>charge</b> as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified fair trade cooperative, and there is a minimum price when the world market is oversupplied. Additionally, the cooperatives are paid an additional 10c per lb premium by buyers for community development projects. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as fair trade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices. The exporting cooperative can spend the money in several ways. Some go to meeting the costs of conformity and certification: as they have to meet fair trade standards on all their produce, they have to recover the costs from a small part of their turnover, sometimes as little as 8%, and may not make any profit. Some meet other costs. Some is spent on social projects such as building schools, health clinics and baseball pitches. Sometimes there is money left over for the farmers. The cooperatives sometimes pay farmers a higher price than farmers do, sometimes less, but there is no evidence on which is more common.|$|E
