50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the herringbone gear {{is that it}} cannot be cut by simple gear hobbing machines, as the cutter would run into {{the other half of}} the gear. Solutions to this have included assembling small gears by stacking two helical gears together, cutting the gears with a central groove to provide clearance, and (particularly in the early days) by casting the gears to an accurate pattern and without further machining. With the older method of fabrication, herringbone gears had a central channel separating the two oppositely-angled courses of teeth. This was necessary to permit the shaving tool to run out of the groove. The development of the Sykes gear shaper made it possible to have continuous teeth with no central gap. Sunderland, also in England, also produced a herringbone cutting machine. The Sykes uses cylindrical guides and round cutters; the Sunderland uses straight guides and rack-type cutters. The W. E. Sykes Co. dissolved in 1983-84. Since then it has been common practice to obtain an older machine and rebuild it if necessary to create this unique type of gear. Recently, the Bourn and Koch company has developed a CNC-controlled derivation of the W. E. Sykes design called the HDS1600-300. This machine, like the Sykes gear shaper, has the ability to generate a true apex without the need for a <b>clearance</b> <b>groove</b> cut around the gear. This allows the gears to be used in positive displacement pumping applications, as well as power transmission. Helical gears with low weight, accuracy and strength may be 3D printed.|$|E
40|$|Carrying {{capacity}} {{is the most}} important performance index for slewing bearings. Maximizing the carrying capacity of slewing bearing is one pursuing goal for the bearing designer; this is usually realized by optimizing the design parameters. A method of analyzing the carrying capacity of double-row four-point contact ball slewing bearing by using dynamic carrying capacity surfaces was proposed in this paper. Based on the dynamic load carrying capacity surface of the slewing bearing, the effect of changes of the bearing design parameters, such as axial <b>clearance,</b> raceway <b>groove</b> radius coefficient, and contact angle, on the dynamic carrying capacity of the slewing bearing was researched; the trend and the degree of the effect of the micro changes of the bearing design parameters on the dynamic load carrying capacity of the bearing were discussed, and the results provide the basis for optimizing the design parameter of this type of slewing bearing...|$|R
40|$|Externally {{pressurized}} grooved gas {{thrust bearings}} for shaft systems were studied both numerically and experimentally. Three thrust bearings {{composed of a}} symmetric pair of rings facing a shaft collar were tested. The rings, with inner and outer diameters of 52 and 110 mm, respectively, are equipped with a polar array of eight holes, with a 0. 35 -mm diameter, distributed on a 65 -mm-diameter circumference. The influence of a circumferential groove situated in correspondence with the supply holes is discussed. In particular, two thrust bearings have a rectangular cross-sectional groove of 0. 7 -mm width and 10 - and 20 -lm depth. A numerical model based on Reynolds' equation is used to study thrust-bearing performance in relation to geometry (diameter of supply holes, <b>clearance,</b> and <b>groove</b> dimensions). A test rig is used to monitor thrust-bearing axial load capacity and stiffness, and evaluate damping and stability at different supply pressure rates. Experimental and numerical results are compared and discusse...|$|R
40|$|The core {{compressor}} exit stage {{study program}} develops rear stage blading designs that have lower losses in their endwall boundary layer regions. The test data and performance {{results for the}} best stage configuration consisting of Rotor-B running with Stator-B are described. The technical approach in this efficiency improvement program utilizes a low speed research compressor. Tests were conducted in two ways: (1) to use four identical stages of blading to obtain test data in a true multistage environment and (2) to use a single stage of blading to compare with the multistage test results.

40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Experimental results for the rotordynamic coefficients and leakage characteristics of helically grooved annular gas seals are presented. The effects of speed, inlet pressure, pressure ratio, clearance, fluid pre-rotation, and groove angle are investigated. The experimental results are then compared to a theoretical code which attempts to predict the rotordynamic and leakage characteristics of a compressible helically grooved cylindrical seal. The experimental results confirmed two important characteristics concerning helically grooved seals. Results showed that there is excellent stability at a range of inlet pressures, speeds, <b>clearances,</b> and <b>groove</b> angles. The results show decreasing stability with increasing groove angle at low speeds and less sensitivity to groove angle at high speeds. The results also showed reduced leakages and relatively insensitive to groove angle. In general, the theoretical code could not predict the experimental results, especially in terms of the magnitude of the results. However, there was some correct theoretical prediction of trends versus groove angle...|$|R
40|$|The {{leakages}} and {{the dynamic}} characteristics of six types of spiral grooved seals are experimentally investigated. The {{effect of the}} helix angle of the seal is investigated mainly under {{the condition of the}} same nominal <b>clearances,</b> land and <b>groove</b> lengths, and groove depths. The dynamic characteristics are measured for various parameters such as preswirl velocity, pressure difference between inlet and outlet of the seal, whirling amplitude, whirling speed, and rotating speed of the rotor. The results are also compared with leakage increases with the increase of the helix angle, but as the rotating speed increases, the leakages of the larger helix angle seals quickly drop. The leakage of the smooth-stator (SS) /smooth-grooved rotor (SGR) seal drops faster than that of the spiral-grooved stator (SGS) /smooth-rotor (SR) seal. It is found that a circumferential flow can be produced by the flow along the helix angle direction, and this circumferential flow acts as a negative swirl. For the present helix angle range, there is an optimum helix angle with which the seal has a comparatively positive effect on the rotor stability. Compared with the SGS/SR seals, the SS/SGR seal has a worse effect on the rotor stability...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a wide number of results {{about the influence}} that variations in terms of operational and design parameters play on the dynamic behaviour of external gear pumps. These results are obtained by using a non-linear lumped-parameter kineto-elastodynamic model developed and experimentally assessed {{with the aim of}} including all the important dynamic effects. On the one hand, the effects of variations in the operational parameters - namely output pressure, rotational speed and oil viscosity - are analysed; on the other hand, the effects of modifications of some design parameters are shown: <b>clearances</b> and relief <b>groove</b> dimension. The results in terms of gear eccentricity, pressure evolution, pressure forces, gear accelerations and variable forces exciting the pump casing enlighten the dynamic behaviour of gear pumps and give useful indications for design improvements and vibration and noise reduction. As regards specifically gear accelerations as well as forces exciting the casing, they strongly increase with both output pressure and rotational speed, but variations in rotational speed in the operational range give lower effects. Conversely, the modifications of the clearances give negligible effects, while the relief groove dimension is very important: the larger the relief grooves are, the higher the gear accelerations and forces exciting the casing become...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} contributors to an engine's total oil consumption is the piston ring-pack. As a result, optimization of the ring pack is becoming more important for engine manufacturers and lubricant suppliers. This leads to current efforts to control the oil transport and flow through the ring pack. Decreasing the amount of oil needed for proper lubrication while minimizing, frictional losses are the goals of such research. The hope is to fully understand the mechanisms that govern oil's flow, and then control it. Analytical tools and computer simulation models have been created to assist in predicting the performance of a given ring pack. This study intended to be an experimental look at the effects of piston-ring-pack design changes on the steady-state and transient oil consumption of a spark ignition engine. Namely, the effects of a V. -Cut on the 2 nd land, a chamfer on the 3 rd land, OCR groove drain holes, and the OCR design were to be examined. However, after some minor measurements, the engine experienced a major malfunction that caused it to cease operation. The focus of the study shifted to a more theoretical, computer simulated concentration of the aforementioned design changes. Different speeds -and loads were analyzed along with the notation of some general observations. In the end, the effects of the design modifications on ring dynamics and gas flow were qualified. The presence of a V-Cut on the 2 nd land of the piston had beneficial and adverse effects on the general performance of the ring pack. The added volume decreased the 2 nd land pressure enough to avoid 2 nd ring radial collapse, but it also caused reverse flutter to occur at lower loads. Using a chamfer on the upper portion of the 3 rd land also had mixed results. Stability of the 2 nd ring was greatly improved with less radial collapse and an increase in average blowby flow. (cont.) The performance of the OCR design was primarily dependent on the gap area of the ring and the variation of <b>groove</b> <b>clearances.</b> The OCR <b>groove</b> drain holes were also deemed a necessity. This research, though theoretical in nature, brings together many ideas that offer solutions to common problems. Radial collapse, reverse flutter, OCR cost, and the use of drainage holes all are part of the attempts to improve the piston-ring-pack performance while driving down cost of production. Future experiments will put the theoretical conclusions to the test with the continuation of the pistons not installed in the engine due to the events previously explained. by Eric B. Senzer.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 For {{applications}} that involved fluids {{with a high}} rate of change of vapor pressure or low specific heat, it was found that there could be inadequate flow through the thrust bearing. This effect was compounded by the heat generation due to the eddy currents that occur in magnetic drive pumps with metallic shells. This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in magnetic drive sealless pumps. The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of magnetic drive pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for sealless pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the back shroud influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped back shroud, pump out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different bushing <b>clearances</b> and <b>grooving</b> configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the thrust collar face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|R
