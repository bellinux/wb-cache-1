40|$|Although {{economic}} theory supports {{the use of}} extended producer responsibility (EPR) to stimulate prevention and recycling of waste, EPR systems implemented in Europe are often criticized {{as a result of}} weak incentives for prevention and green product design. Using a stylized economic model, this article evaluates the efficiency of European EPR systems. The model reveals that the introduction of static <b>collection</b> <b>targets</b> creates a gap between theory and implementation. Static targets lead to inefficient market outcomes and weak incentives for prevention and green product design. The minimum <b>collection</b> <b>targets</b> should be complemented with a tax on producers for the non-collected waste fraction. Because such a tax internalizes the cost of waste disposal, more efficient price signals will lead to better incentives for waste management in a complex and dynamic market. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for {{consumer}} waste {{has been criticized}} for failing to induce strong waste prevention incentives. Using a stylized economic model with oligopolistic competition of recycling firms, this paper assesses efficiency of thr ee policies that strengthen EPR prevention incentives. In a closed economy, market power of recycling firms, excise duties and disposal taxes on recycling residues are shown to strengthen prevention in an efficient way. Raising <b>collection</b> <b>targets</b> above the first - best level improves prevention but also creates inefficiency. In an open European market for waste destined for recycling, strategic behavior of governments makes the use of disposal taxes difficult. Indeed, tax competition between countries may lea d to a ‘race to the bottom’ for recycling residue taxes. Conversely, strategic behavior may lead to a counter - intuitive ‘ race to the top’ for <b>collection</b> <b>targets</b> and excise duties because domestic prevention restrains foreign recycling profits. Since welfa re loss from the use of excise duties is minimal, an excise duty seems the instrument best fit to induce stronger EPR prevention incentives in an increasingly open European waste market. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipment (WEEE) {{is one of}} the fastest growing UK waste streams. The UK WEEE Regulations prioritise waste prevention, reuse, recycling and recovery to minimise disposal of electronic products in landfill. This paper evaluates and discusses the UK collection network for household WEEE by analysing the operations of key stakeholders. The paper discusses the amount of wastes collected, how it is handled and processed. In UK urban areas, there are adequate facilities for the collection of unwanted appliances. In 2009, the UK surpassed <b>collection</b> <b>targets</b> for WEEE; by weight, the bulk of these were large household appliances, cooling appliances and display equipment. The majority of the collected waste was recycled with minor fractions reused. The core logistical problem facing the network is insufficient storage space for collecting unwanted appliances.

Improvements in the collection phase are necessary in both countries in order to fulfill Directive 2012 / 19 /EU targets. While large e-waste showed the highest collection rate, about IT, small household and consumer equipment e-waste strategic actions are necessary, particularly in Italy.
