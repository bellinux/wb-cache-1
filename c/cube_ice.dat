50|$|<b>Cube</b> <b>ice</b> {{machines}} {{are classified as}} small ice machines, in contrast to tube ice machines, flake ice machines, or other ice machines. Common capacities range from 30 kg to 1755 kg. Since the emergence of <b>cube</b> <b>ice</b> machines in the 1970s, they have evolved into a diverse family of ice machines.|$|E
50|$|The ice bin {{can also}} be {{equipped}} with compressors. Generally <b>cube</b> <b>ice</b> machines with over 320 kg capacities have built-in compressors in the ice bin for storage prior to sales, for use when demands are large.|$|E

50|$|Another superstition is {{flushing}} <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> {{down the}} toilet. Most prefer <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> rather than crushed ice. There {{are many other}} traditions that include <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> such as throwing them into a pond or lake in hopes of the water freezing over, throwing shaved <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> at a tree, and tossing ice into one’s front yard.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cube</b> <b>ice</b> {{machines}} are commonly seen as vertical modular devices. The upper part is an evaporator, {{and the lower}} part is an ice bin. The refrigerant circulates inside pipes of sale-contained evaporator, where it conducts the heat exchange with water, and freezes the water into ice cubes. When the water is thoroughly frozen into ice, it is automatically released, and falls into the ice bin.|$|E
40|$|Cholera {{is a type}} of watery {{diarrhea}} {{with specific}} sign stool containing mucus which resembles rice water. Cholera caused by gram negative bacteria Vibrio cholerae (V. Cholerae). The transmissions of bacteria were through a contaminated food or water. Bali is an international tourism destination with tropical weather where ice is widely used in food and beverage which bring a risk of cholera through a contaminated ice. Ices have a risk of bacterial contamination whether from the making and the usage process. Type of ice that widely used were cube and tube ice which each of them have a different in making and usage process. The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain the contamination of V. cholera in cube and tube ice. The method of this study is descriptive observational study with quota sampling technique. Sample were obtained from a restaurants and street vendor which use a block and tube ice with total 10 sample and 5 for each type of ice. Sample then cultured in Alkaline Peptone Water(APW) and Thiosulfate Citrate Bile salt Sucrose(TCBS) agar. Bacteriacolony then identified using a gram staining and Latex Serotyping. The result are 3 over 5 (60 %) sample of <b>cube</b> <b>ice</b> contaminated by V. cholera O 1 Inaba serotype and 3 over 5 (60 %) sample of tube ice contaminated by V. cholera O 1 Inaba serotype. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{commercial}} ice making {{machines that}} produce {{a batch of}} <b>cube</b> <b>ice</b> at regular intervals are known as â€œcubersâ€. Â Such machines are commonly used in food service, food preservation, hotel, and health service industries. Â Machines are typically rated for the weight of ice produced over a 24 hour period at ambient air temperatures of 90 Â°F and water inlet temperature of 70 Â°F. These cubers typically utilize an air-cooled, vapor-compression cycle to freeze circulating water flowing over an evaporator grid. Â Once a sufficient amount ice is formed, a valve switches to enable a harvest mode, where the compressorâ€™s discharge gas is routed into the evaporator, thereby releasing ice into a storage bin. Â The U. S. Department of Energy has set a target of reducing energy usage by 10 â€“ 15 % by 2018. Â Engineering models are not publicly available to assist designers in achieving the new energy regulations. This paper presents an engineering simulation model that addresses this need. Â This model simulates the transient operation of a cuber ice machine based on fundamental principles and generalized correlations. Â The model calculates time-varying changes in the system properties and aggregates performance results {{as a function of}} machine capacity and environmental conditons. Â Â Rapid â€œwhat ifâ€ analyses can be readily completed, enabling engineers to quickly evaluate the impact of a variety of system design options, including the size of the air-cooled heat exchanger, finned surfaces, air / water flow rate, ambient air and inlet water temperature, compressor capacity and/or efficiency for freeze and harvest cycles, refrigerants, suction/liquid line heat exchanger and thermal expansion valve properties. Â Simulation results from the model were compared with the experimental data of a fully instrumented, standard 500 lb capacity ice machine, operating under various ambient air and water inlet temperatures. Key aggregate measures of the ice machineâ€™s performance are: (1) cycle time (duration of freeze plus harvest cycles), (2) Energy input per 100 lb of ice, and (3) Energy usage during 24 hours. Â For these measures, the modelâ€™s accuarcy is within 5 % for a variety of operating conditions. ...|$|E
50|$|For {{small-scale}} ice production, {{many modern}} home refrigerators {{can also make}} ice with a built in icemaker, which will typically make <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> or crushed <b>ice.</b> Stand-alone icemaker units that make <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> are often called ice machines.|$|R

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{characteristic of}} commercially made <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> {{is that they}} are completely clear, lacking the clouding found in the center of domestically made <b>ice</b> <b>cubes.</b> Cloudy <b>ice</b> <b>cubes</b> result when water is frozen quickly, or when the water is high in dissolved solids. When water is cooled to its freezing point, and ice starts to form, dissolved gases can no longer stay in solution and come out as microscopic bubbles. However, as ice floats in water, once there is enough ice to form a layer on the surface, the ice layer traps all bubbles within the <b>ice</b> <b>cube.</b> Commercial ice-makers use a flowing source of purified water to make ice with cooling elements at the bottom, allowing the bubbles to be washed away from the top as the cube grows.|$|R
50|$|Even {{with the}} success of <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube's</b> film Next Friday, the album's {{promotion}} was poor and other new artists such as Eminem, Xzibit and Dr. Dre's 2001 were on top of the charts. This was <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube's</b> final album under Priority Records. It took six years for <b>Ice</b> <b>Cube</b> to release his next album, Laugh Now, Cry Later.|$|R
