5|$|Far Side Virtual is the thirtieth studio album by the American {{electronic}} musician James Ferraro, {{released on}} October 25, 2011 by the record label Hippos in Tanks. First {{conceived as a}} series of ringtones, the album marked Ferraro's transition from his previous lo-fi recording approach to a sharply produced, electronic aesthetic that deliberately evokes sources such as elevator music, corporate mood music, easy-listening, and outdated computer sound design. The album has been interpreted as engaging with themes such as hyperreality, disposable <b>consumer</b> <b>culture,</b> 1990s retro-futurism, advertising, and musical kitsch.|$|E
5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and <b>consumer</b> <b>culture.</b> In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes {{the danger of the}} streets and puts it in a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger of the streets.|$|E

Thus, GCE extends experience that allows a borderless transaction which is free from spatial-temporal restrictions supported by advanced technology and an interaction with the consumption environment including a business, other <b>consumers,</b> <b>cultures,</b> ideologies, and technologies by sharing information and experience with them.|$|R

40|$|Popular and <b>consumer</b> <b>cultures</b> share {{a similar}} {{trajectory}} in the United States with spectacle and money being key {{ingredients in the}} construction of both. This is most apparent in the sports industry in America with billions of dollars in revenue generated every year. During {{the first half of the}} twentieth century sports like baseball and boxing commanded a significant amount of cultural and economic capital. It was not unheard of for sports teams, talented athletes and even a few select coaches to ascend to a legendary or even mythical status. The spectacle and revenue generating capacity of amateur and professional sports was considerable during this time, but it was not until the early 1960 s that the true potential for an American sports was constructed. The introduction of television in the development of the National Football Leagues spectacle redefined what sports in the United States means to popular and <b>consumer</b> <b>cultures.</b> The enormity of the National Football Leagues premier annual spectacle, the Super Bowl, is a testament to the sports dominance of American popular and <b>consumer</b> <b>cultures.</b> By analyzing the National Football Leagues formative years during the 1960 s and 1970 s, it is my intention to demonstrate how the NFL was able to reframe its cultural product, and achieve an unprecedented social and economic status in American culture. I will employ an organization set analysis of cultural industry systems proposed by Paul M. Hirsch in conjunction with Clifford Geertz and Jerome Bruners studies on the cultural power and significance of the narrative form to trace the trajectory of the NFLs social and economic success. Popular fiction will also be included to demonstrate how thoroughly professional football infiltrated popular and <b>consumer</b> <b>cultures</b> and changed how Americans viewed televised sports.

40|$|Book synopsis: Globalization and {{consumerism}} {{are two of}} the buzzwords of {{the early}} twenty-first century. In Consuming Cultures, renowned scholars explore the links between modernity and consumption. The book fills a gap in contemporary thinking on the subject by approaching it from a truly global point-of-view. It draws on case studies from around the world, with Africa, Asia and Central America featuring as prominently as Western countries. A transnational perspective allows the authors to investigate the diversity of <b>consumer</b> <b>cultures</b> and the interaction between them. The authors look at the genealogy of the modern consumer and the development of <b>consumer</b> <b>cultures,</b> from the porcelain trade and consumption in Britain and China in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to post Second World War developments in America and Japan, and the contemporary consumer politics of cosmopolitan citizenship. Challenging and pioneering, Consuming Cultures problematizes popular accounts of globalization and consumerism, decentring the West and concentrating on putting history back into these accounts...|$|R

25|$|Earlier in England in 1956 {{the term}} Pop Art {{was used by}} Lawrence Alloway for {{paintings}} that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era.

It was the first full-length study {{of the impact of}} American <b>consumer</b> <b>culture</b> on an immigrant group. Hasia Diner, Professor of History at New York University, said about Heinze: “Historians of immigration and Jewish history will be indebted to him for opening up whole areas of behavior which they previously shrugged off as irrelevant.” The Journal of Consumer Affairs remarked upon the variety of topics that the book explored: the rise of ad campaigns for major American products in the foreign-language press; the rise of the summer vacation among working people; installment-buying as a way for working families to obtain expensive furnishings such as pianos; the role of Jewish women as agents of assimilation through their control over family purchases; and the way that American abundance altered religious rituals, especially holidays such as Chanukah and Passover. Adapting to Abundance established Heinze's reputation as part of a scholarly vanguard that produced the first histories of mass consumption in Europe and America.
