5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, little owl, and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and white stork. It {{does not appear to}} be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and <b>constricting</b> snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious {{pathogens}} of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as <b>constricting</b> rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
5|$|Being a free city, Sélestat {{attracted}} settlers {{from the}} region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which had become too <b>constricting,</b> was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At {{the end of the}} Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt). As the road network was poor and dangerous, goods transited via the Ill river.|$|E

50|$|When {{a patient}} with an Adie pupil {{attempts}} {{to focus on a}} nearby object, the pupil (which would normally <b>constrict</b> rapidly) <b>constricts</b> slowly. On close inspection, the <b>constricted</b> pupil is not perfectly round. When the patient focuses on a more distant object (say {{the far side of the}} room), the pupil (which would normally dilate immediately) remains <b>constricted</b> for several minutes, and then slowly dilates back to the expected size.|$|R

5|$|Between 1860 and 1863 Busch wrote {{over one}} hundred {{articles}} for the Münchener Bilderbogen and Fliegende Blätter, but he felt his dependence on publisher Kaspar Braun had become <b>constricting.</b> Busch appointed Dresden publisher Heinrich Richter, the son of Saxon painter Ludwig Richter, as his new publisher— Richter's press {{up to that time}} was producing children's books and religious Christian devotional literature. Busch could choose themes, although Richter raised some concerns regarding four suggested illustrated tales that were proposed. However, some were published in the 1864 as Bilderpossen, proving a failure. Busch then offered Richter the manuscripts of Max and Moritz, waiving any fees. Richter rejected the manuscript as sales prospects seemed poor. Busch's former publisher, Braun, purchased the right to Max and Moritz for 1,000 gulden, corresponding to approximately double the annual wage of a craftsman.|$|E
5|$|Skye {{tries to}} defend them both, {{but when the}} team finds {{evidence}} that Lydon was paid substantially for the information, she turns on him and cooperates with the agents. The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project Centipede facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's fire-resistant platelets against his will, to use as stabilizers for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for <b>constricting</b> him, attacks both. He kills, among others, Quan and the Centipede head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode. Lydon, convinced that what he did is harming people, helps by using his hacking skills to direct the blast through the ventilation and out {{the top of the}} building, while the others escape to safety.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, the British Army was {{considerable}} {{interested in the}} potential use of compact helicopters in the observation and aerial observation roles. In 1953, there was a requirement issued by the British Ministry of Supply which sought for a low-cost two-seat helicopter, which would be suitable for reconnaissance, casualty evacuation and training duties. This specification {{was considered to be}} quite demanding, calling for it to be capable of high speeds and quick climb rates even under tropical conditions. The rotorcraft was also required to be transportable {{on the back of a}} standard Army three-ton truck, <b>constricting</b> the dimensions of the prospective vehicle considerably.|$|E
25|$|Although not yet widely used, {{tidal energy}} has {{potential}} for future electricity generation. Tides are more predictable than {{the wind and}} the sun. Among sources of renewable energy, tidal energy has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus <b>constricting</b> its total availability. However, many recent technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. dynamic tidal power, tidal lagoons) and turbine technology (e.g. new axial turbines, cross flow turbines), indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed, and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism by}} which cocaine harms the fetus may be in part by interfering with blood supply to the uterus. Cocaine causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in both mother and fetus, which can cause hypoxia in the fetus. <b>Constricting</b> blood vessels causes tissues to receive insufficient blood flow, killing cells, but this effect is less pronounced with cocaine than with nicotine. The reduction in {{blood flow to the}} uterus limits the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Cocaine also constricts the blood vessels in the fetus, which is potentially linked to slowed fetal growth and abnormal development of the genitourinary, cardiovascular, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems.|$|E
