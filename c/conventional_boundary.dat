50|$|The S band is a {{designation}} by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for {{a part of}} {{the microwave}} band of the electromagnetic spectrum covering frequencies from 2 to 4 gigahertz (GHz).

The S band is used by weather radar, surface ship radar, and some communications satellites, especially those used by NASA to communicate with the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.

The S band also contains the 2.4-2.483 GHz ISM band, widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as cordless phones, wireless headphones (Bluetooth), wireless networking (WiFi), garage door openers, keyless vehicle locks, baby monitors as well as for medical diathermy machines and microwave ovens (typically at 2.495GHz).|$|E
5000|$|The {{first version}} of the GB Historical GIS was {{developed}} at Queen Mary, University of London between 1994 and 1999, although it was originally conceived simply as a mapping extension to the existing Labour Markets Database (LMDB). The system included digital boundaries for Registration Districts and Poor Law Unions (c.1840 to 1911), Local Government Districts (1911 to 1974), and Parishes (1870s to 1974). These boundaries were held not as polygons but as line segments (arcs), using ArcGIS software. Dates of creation and abolition were held for each line segment (or [...] "arc") and custom software was developed to assemble line segments into polygons, creating <b>conventional</b> <b>boundary</b> maps for particular dates. Meanwhile, the Labour Markets Database evolved into the Great Britain Historical Database (GBHDB), which stored a large collection of historical statistics from the census, vital registration and records of poverty and economic distress. These were held in thousands of columns within hundreds of separate tables, within an Oracle database. This system is described in detail in Gregory and Southall (1998), and in Gregory and Southall (2002).|$|E

[...] Yet it is this cyborg that presents a limit to Haraway's posthuman theory. The sonographic fetus, as posited by scholar Heather Latimer, [...] "is publicly envisioned as both independent of mother's body and as independent of the sonographic equipment used to read this body. We know that fetal images are depictions, yet the sonogram invokes a documentary-like access to fetuses that makes it easy to ignore this, which in turn can limit the authority and agency of pregnant women." [...] In positioning the fetus as independent, and consequently oppositional, to the pregnant mother, these reproductive technologies [...] "reinscribe stable meanings to the human/machine dualism they supposedly disrupt." [...] Valerie Hartouni argues, [...] "most reproductive technologies have assimilated into the 'order of nature'" [...] which would make Haraway's vision of a regenerative species, unrestricted by heteronormative conceptions of reproduction, unattainable in the sonographic fetus.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Cubic Hermite {{interpolation}} ensures {{continuity of}} derivatives between elements, so {{as well as}} providing an excellent representation of a smooth function, it also accurately models its gradients. Another attractive feature of this interpolation is that because each node is shared by neighbouring elements, a mesh of cubic Hermite elements has no more unknowns than a mesh of quadratic Lagrange elements, even though the cubic elements provide the better modelling scheme. The difficulty with Hermite interpolation is that the <b>conventional</b> <b>boundary</b> element procedure does not provide enough linearly dependent equations even when solving Laplace's equation on simple geometries. There are several other well-documented situations where the <b>conventional</b> <b>boundary</b> element method does not produce a well-conditioned system of equations.

40|$|Abstract—We {{demonstrate}} that {{the efficiency of the}} boundary element whispering gallery microcavity analysis can be improved by orders of magnitude with the inclusion of Fresnel approxi-mation. Using this formulation, simulation of a microdisk with wave-number-radius product as large as kR ≈ 8, 000 was demon-strated in contrast to a previous record of kR ≈ 100. In addition to its high accuracy on computing the modal field distribution and resonance wavelength, this method yields a relative error of 10 % in calculating the quality factor as high as 1011 through a direct root searching method where the <b>conventional</b> <b>boundary</b> element method failed to achieve. Finally, quadrupole shaped cavities and double disks as large as 100 µm in diameter were modeled by employing as few as 512 boundary elements whilst the simulation of such large cavities using <b>conventional</b> <b>boundary</b> element method were not reported previously.

40|$|In this paper, {{a system}} approach, null-field {{integral}} equation {{in conjunction with}} the degenerate kernel, is used to solve the radiation problem of two spheres. The null-field integral equation instead of the <b>conventional</b> <b>boundary</b> integral equation can avoid the singular and hypersingular integrals. To fully utilize the spherical geometry, the fundamental solutions and the boundary densities are expanded by using degenerate kernels and spherical harmonics in the spherical coordinate, respectively. The main difference between the present approach and the <b>conventional</b> <b>boundary</b> integral equation is that the collocation point can be exactly located on the real boundary owing to introducing the degenerate kernel. The proposed approach is seen as one kind of semi-analytical methods, since the error is attributed from the truncation of spherical harmonics in the implementation. For the single sphere, the present approach can obtain the analytical solution. Finally, a two-spheres radiation problem is given to verify the validity of proposed approach...|$|E
