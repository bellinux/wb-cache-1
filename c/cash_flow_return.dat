40|$|The {{research}} done on style 'anomalies' {{such as the}} book-to-market and the size effect have found that these idiosyncratic factor s explain returns better than Beta. These findings have led has to an increased importance of idiosyncratic factors in explaining returns, which {{is contrary to the}} popular Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). CAPM only considers Beta or systematic risk in explaining returns and disregards idiosyncratic risk. This paper has an even greater focus on idiosyncratic factors, by testing company specific factors with no reference to market valuation. These are defined as 'quality' factors {{for the purposes of this}} paper. The paper done by Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen (2013), found that quality stock s earned excess returns in 23 of the 24 countries that they tested. This paper followed a similar approach with respect to the definition of quality and tested whether these 'quality' factors have explanatory power on the FTSE/JSE All-Share. The explanatory power of the 'quality' factors are then combined and compared with some of the style 'anomalies'. The results found that nine of the quality factors from the single regression analysis, over the entire period from the 1 st of January 1994 until the 1 st of November 2014 were significant at a 95 % level of confidence. The following 'quality' factors were found significant and are ranked according to the absolute t-statistics:: Accruals ratio (ACCRUALS), <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on equity (CFROE), 12 -month growth in earnings per share (EPS 12 M), 12 -month growth in <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on equity (CFROE 12 M), 24 -month growth in <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on equity (CFROE 24 M), 12 -month growth in EBITDA margin (EBITDAMARG 12 M), 36 -month growth in <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on equity (CFROE 36 M), interest coverage before tax (ICBT), return on total capital (ROC). In the single regression results the ACCRUALS ratio ranked higher than the book-value-to-market and the earnings yield. The CFROE also exhibited a higher level of significance than the earnings yield. In the multiple regression analysis for all factors, the following factors which are ranked according to absolute t-statistics were found to be significant : book-value-to-market, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on equity (CFROE), 12 -month growth in earnings per share (EPS 12 M), 18 -month volatility in return on equity (ROEVOL 18 M) and the accruals ratio (ACCRUALS). Finally the cumulative payoff results are consistent with the results found in the regression analysis. In terms of cumulative payoff the ACCRUALS factor ranked first and the CFROE factor ranked fifth. The ACCRUALS and CFROE factors also had the highest and fifth highest Sharpe ratio respectively. A single 'quality' factor composite of the significant factors found may have an important role to play in asset pricing, due to the high explanatory power and stable positive relationship with returns on the FTSE/JSE All-Share...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{a new wave of}} merger and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) activity since the early 1990 's across the world, much of this occurring in the financial services industry. This trend has affected Europe as well where the landscape of the financial services industry has been changing. This M&A activity in general has stimulated more in depth research to assess the consequences of the merger events, although comparatively little work has been done on M&A activity in the European financial services industry. This thesis uses a market return approach and an operating performance approach to evaluate the M&As outcome in European banking. We document a minimal total return, and a smaller target return in comparison to US studies. The post-merger operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on assets deteriorated but we also found a very minimal improvement in efficiency which was not supportive enough to boost the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on assets and the profitability of the merging partners, although these mergers were mainly motivated by synergy.

However, although there have been extensive empirical researches documenting the stock market return of firms around the announcement date, studies that examine the operating performance of either the acquirer or the target are very limited especially for Chinese M&A market. This study aims to investigate whether M&A in China create value for the operating performance for the listed acquiring firms. This study is based on 163 completed M&A transactions undertaken between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009, and conclusion can be drawn that the operating performance of the acquiring firms measured by three categories of indicators including accrual performance (return on assets, earnings per share), cash flow performance (<b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on total assets, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>return</b> on sales), and growth opportunity (sales growth) consistently reveal significant improvements or no gains following a merger or an acquisition. Additionally, the cross-sectional regression analysis shows that the post-merger operating performance is significantly improved when the M&A is industry-related. Also, this study shows the acquirers have significantly better post-merger operating performance when the M&A is undertaken during the financial crisis period. Apart from that, none of the factors deal size, method of payment, and toehold investment is found to have significant impacts on the post-merger operating performance.

Our study uncovers an interesting pattern of changing performance differences between state-owned and privately-owned banks around the Asian financial crisis. We find that state-owned banks operated less profitably, held less core capital, and had greater credit risk than privately-owned banks prior to 2001, and the performance differences are more significant in those countries with greater government involvement and political corruption in the banking system. In addition, from 1997 to 2000, the 4 -year period after {{the beginning of the}} Asian financial crisis, the deterioration in the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>returns,</b> core capital, and credit quality of state-owned banks was significantly greater than that of privately-owned banks, especially for the countries that were hardest hit by the Asian crisis.
