According to the {{characteristics}} of <b>coiling</b> <b>tension</b> control characteristics and the requirements of actual engineering, establish the mathematical model of the double closed loop control system and use the traditional PID to tuning the model parameters. It is proved by Matlab simulation experiments that traditional PID can effectively improve the response process of <b>coiling</b> <b>tension</b> control system and greatly enhance the dynamic and steady-state performance...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of construction with springs. Springs can be {{located on the}} mechanical equivalent of the forearm or the upper arm, or both, as well as nearer the base. Some lamps use <b>tension</b> <b>springs,</b> and others use compression springs.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an independent thesis corresponding 15 hp and {{was carried out}} on Högskolan in Halmstad {{during the spring of}} 2014. The thesis is the final course which ends a three-year mechanical engineering program with focus on technical design. The thesis started in an operation which electricians are exposed to every day. The operation in question is cable laying or wiring. The tool they use is called a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and is a long and stiff wire, usually made out of nylon or fiberglass. The <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is fed through pipes in the walls and brings the desired cables with it on the way back. The problem shows up when the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is drawn back by the electrician. The stiffness in the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> causes it to tangle itself and that causes unnecessary irritation and a waste of time. The problem gave an electrician and a good friend an idea about a product that could solve the problem in an easy and functional way. The idea started as a simple idea {{and with the help of}} several different product development methods from a production-, construction-, and design point of view a special methodology was developed, perfectly customized for the thesis. Potential customer gave the verdicts and helped create the needs and requirements for the product. The product went through a big process with creating different concepts and a lot of time was spent in CATIA for the final creation. One of the great goals of the thesis was to create a functional prototype, something that has been achieved and is now ready to be tested in a real environment. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} solution, adaptive-grid method {{utilizing a}} <b>tension</b> and torsion <b>spring</b> analogy is proposed for multidimensional fluid flow problems. The <b>tension</b> <b>spring,</b> which connects adjacent grid points to each other, controls grid spacings. The torsion spring, which {{is attached to}} each grid node, controls inclinations of coordinate lines and grid skewness. A marching procedure was used that results in a simple tridiagonal system of equations at each coordinate line to determine grid-point distribution. Multidirectional adaptation is achieved by successive applications of one-dimensional adaptation. Examples of applications for axisymmetric afterbody flow fields and two dimensional transonic airfoil flow fields are shown...|$|R

5000|$|A low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> is an {{electrical}} device {{used to create}} a spark across the points of an ignitor on early 1900s gasoline engines, generally flywheel engines, hit and miss engines, and other engines of that era. In modern electronic terms, a low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> is simply a large inductor, {{an electrical}} device that stores energy for brief periods. The term [...] "low tension" [...] was the terminology of the day used to differentiate it from the term [...] "high tension", and generally meant [...] "low voltage" [...] (tension) as opposed to [...] "high voltage" [...] (<b>tension).</b> High <b>tension</b> <b>coils</b> produce high voltages, generally meant to produce a spark across a spark plug.|$|R

50|$|A {{key feature}} of the Anglepoise design and patent is the {{placement}} of all springs (either three or four) near the base. The design was extensively copied by other companies, usually in simplified form, and is still in use. Some derivatives use a heavy balance weight instead of the springs. The most common version replaces the arm linkages with two independent parallelogram linkages, {{with a pair of}} light <b>tension</b> <b>springs</b> on each half of the arm.|$|R
40|$|A {{clinostat}} for simulating microgravity on {{cell systems}} {{carried in a}} fiber fixedly mounted in a rotatable culture vessel is disclosed. The clinostat is rotated horizontally along its longitudinal axis to simulate microgravity or vertically as a control response. Cells are injected into the fiber and {{the ends of the}} fiber are sealed and secured to spaced end pieces of a fiber holder assembly which consists of the end pieces, a hollow fiber, a culture vessel, and a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> with three alignment pins. The <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is positioned around the culture vessel with its ends abutting the end pieces for alignment of the spring. After the fiber is secured, the spring is decompressed to maintain tension on the fiber while it is being rotated. This assures that the fiber remains aligned along the axis of rotation. The fiber assembly is placed in the culture vessel and culture medium is added. The culture vessel is then inserted into the rotatable portion of the clinostat and subjected to rotate at selected rpms. The internal diameter of the hollow fiber determines the distance the cells are from the axis of rotation...|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} mechanical {{mechanism for}} a passive parallelogram-based exoskeleton arm-support is presented. It consists of several levers and joints and an attached extension coil spring. The additional mechanism has two favourable features. On {{the one hand}} it exhibits an almost iso-elastic behaviour whereby the lifting force of the mechanism is constant for a wide working range. Secondly, {{the value of the}} supporting force can be varied by a simple linear movement of a supporting joint. Furthermore a standard <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> can be used to gain the desired behavior. The additional mechanism is a 4 -link mechanism affixed to one end of the spring within the parallelogram arm-support. It has several geometrical parameters which influence the overall behaviour. A standard optimisation routine with constraints on the parameters is used to find an optimal set of geometrical parameters. Based on the optimized geometrical parameters a prototype was constructed and tested. It is a lightweight wearable system, with a weight of 1.9 kg. Detailed experiments reveal a difference between measured and calculated forces. These variations can be explained by a 60  % higher pre load force of the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and a geometrical offset in the construction.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Argonne Tokamak Experimental Power Reactor (TEPR) design studies, a {{toroidal}} field (TF) coil {{system has}} been designed. NbTi {{was chosen as the}} most suitable superconductor and 8 T was regarded as a practical peak field level in this study. The 16 -coil design was chosen as a reasonable compromise between 2 percent field ripple and 3 m access gap. To minimize the coil structure and the bending moments on the conductor, a pure <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> shape is necessary. A correct approach for determining the pure <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> profile in a bumpy TF coil system is given.

40|$|For nickel-containing alloys {{irradiated}} in thermalized neutron fluxes, {{the formation}} and reaction of 59 Ni with thermal neutrons can lead to time-varying changes in displacement damage rate, expressed as displacements per atom per second (dpa. s- 1), gas formation and nuclear heating. Ni-rich alloys are used in PWR and BWR reactors as spacers within fuel assemblies but also as <b>tensioning</b> <b>springs</b> for these same assemblies. Flux thimbles have also been made from Ni-rich alloys {{in the past but}} are gradually being replaced by thimbles made from other alloys containing substantially less Ni. In a CANDU reactor, Ni-alloys are used as <b>tensioning</b> <b>springs,</b> fuel channel spacers (in the form of garter springs) and as cable sheathing and core wires in flux-detector assemblies. Prediction of the irradiationprocesses that affect the functionality of these CANDU internals, such as irradiation embrittlement and irradiation creep, especially under conditions of extended operation, necessitates a consideration of the effect of the transmutation of Ni. Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable increase in the understanding of the effects of irradiation on the properties of components made from Ni-rich alloys. The nuclear processes and the effects of irradiation damage on the performance of components made from these alloys will be described...|$|R
