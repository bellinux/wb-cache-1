50|$|A caesium {{standard}} or caesium {{atomic clock}} {{is a primary}} frequency standard in which electronic transitions between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium-133 atoms are used to control the output frequency. The first <b>caesium</b> <b>clock</b> was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK.|$|E
50|$|Louis Essen, a {{physicist}} from Nottingham, made {{advances in the}} quartz clock in the 1930s at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, to produce the quartz ring clock in 1938, and the <b>caesium</b> <b>clock,</b> known as the atomic clock, in 1955. During the war he invented the cavity resonance wavemeter to find the first accurate value {{of the speed of}} light. The atomic clock works on differences in magnetic spin. Before Essen's invention, the second was defined on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun; he changed it in 1967 {{to be based on the}} hyperfine structure of the caesium-133 atom. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), in Paris, takes the average of 300 atomic clocks around the world.|$|E

The first accurate <b>caesium</b> <b>clock</b> was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Caesium clocks have improved over the past half-century and are regarded as [...] "the most accurate realization of a unit that mankind has yet achieved." [...] These clocks measure frequency with an error of 2 to 3 parts in 1014, which corresponding to an accuracy of 2 nanoseconds per day, or one second in 1.4 million years. The latest versions are more accurate than 1 part in 1015, about 1 second in 20 million years. The Caesium standard is the primary standard for standards-compliant time and frequency measurements. Caesium clocks regulate the timing of cell phone networks and the Internet.|$|E

5000|$|Partly as {{a result}} of his wartime contacts, his company, Henn-Collins Associates, {{undertook}} a wide range of projects for government agencies and commercial organisations worldwide, mostly in the field of telecommunications, but he had other interests as well, and in the 1950s and 60s he patented a number of devices of an electro-mechanical nature. In his workshop he developed his idea for a quartz crystal clock which by using transistors in place of thermionic valves, made possible a much smaller quartz clock than was previously feasible. He described his [...] "mantelpiece" [...] clock in the British Horological Journal in 1957 and showed it at an exhibition in Goldsmiths' Hall in 1958, [...] "The Pendulum to the Atom", which was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh. Christopher Henn-Collins and Dr Louis Essen, inventor of the <b>caesium</b> <b>clock</b> were presented to him.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, the {{infrared}} {{light from a}} methane-stabilized laser was inconvenient for use in practical interferometry. It was not until 1983 that the chain of frequency measurements reached the 633 nm line of the helium-neon laser, stabilized using molecular iodine. That same year, the 17th CGPM adopted the current definition of the metre, {{in terms of the}} 1975 conventional value for the speed of light: The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of [...] of a second. The concept of defining a unit of length in terms of a time received some comment, although it was similar to Wilkins' original proposal in 1668 to define the universal unit of length in terms of the seconds pendulum. In both cases, the practical issue is that time can be measured more accurately than length (one part in 1013 for a second using a <b>caesium</b> <b>clock</b> as opposed to four parts in 109 for the metre in 1983). The definition in terms of the speed of light also means that the metre can be realized using any light source of known frequency, rather than defining a [...] "preferred" [...] source in advance. Given that there are more than 22,000 lines in the visible spectrum of iodine, any of which could be potentially used to stabilize a laser source, the advantages of flexibility are obvious.|$|E
40|$|Squeezing {{of quantum}} {{fluctuations}} {{by means of}} entanglement is a well recognized goal {{in the field of}} quantum information science and precision measurements. In particular, squeezing the fluctuations via entanglement between two-level atoms can improve the precision of atom clocks and of spectroscopy in general [1, 2]. Here, we demonstrate 3. 4 dB of metrologically relevant squeezing and entanglement for 10 5 cold caesium atoms via a quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement [3, 4, 5] on the atom clock levels. We demonstrate the effect of decoherence inherent to generation of entanglement via a QND measurement and present a dichromatic QND scheme which allows to minimize the effect of this decoherence in metrological applications.

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically and experimentally a nondestructive {{interferometric measurement}} of the state population of an ensemble of laser cooled and trapped atoms. This study is a step towards generation of (pseudo-) spin squeezing of cold atoms targeted at {{the improvement of the}} <b>Caesium</b> <b>clock</b> performance beyond the limit set by the quantum projection noise of atoms. We calculate the phase shift and the quantum noise of a near resonant optical probe pulse propagating through a cloud of cold 133 Cs atoms. We analyze the figure of merit for a quantum non-demolition (QND) {{measurement of the}} collective pseudo-spin and show that it can be expressed simply as a product of the ensemble optical density and the pulse integrated rate of the spontaneous emission caused by the off-resonant probe light. Based on this, we propose a protocol for the sequence of operations required to generate and utilize spin squeezing for the improved atomic clock performance via a QND measurement on the probe light. In the experimental part we demonstrate that the interferometric measurement of the atomic population can reach the sensitivity of the order of N_at^ 1 / 2 in a cloud of N_at cold atoms, which is an important benchmark towards the experimental realisation of the theoretically analyzed protocol.

40|$|The Integrity GNSS Receiver (IGNSSRX) is a European Commission funded {{project with}} three main objectives: The {{development}} of two platforms {{to capture and}} store GNSS radio frequency signal samples and a reference trajectory from representative low-, medium- And high-end sensors in terrestrial applications. An extensive data collection campaign aiming to characterize error sources, magnitudes and probabilities for two important GNSS terrestrial application areas: Automotive and pedestrian users. The {{research and development of}} techniques and algorithms to mitigate the integrity threats in the two terrestrial environments studied using the collected data, thus allowing reliable terrestrial applications within these domains. This paper presents the results for the first two objectives of the IGNSSRX project, providing the GNSS measurement error characterization results obtained from the analysis of the real data collected using the developed platforms during the acquisition campaign, together with a preliminary report on the developed techniques and algorithms. Data Collection Platforms Two Data Acquisition and Storage Units (DASU) have been developed within the IGNSSRX project for the data collection campaign in the vehicular and pedestrian domains: Vehicular DASU: RF Front-Ends: A high resolution FE and a three- Antenna FE system working both in the GPS LI and Galileo El bands and the GLONASS LI band. The high-resolution FE allows the application of DSP techniques to detect the integrity threat and the three antenna array allows the use of the direction of arrival (DOA) information to identify non line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. Record raw data from medium and low cost COTS sensors, such as IMUs and odometer, for PVT hybridisation with GNSS as well as to provide a reference of the performance or representative medium and low cost solutions used in these applications Truth reference equipment using a high accuracy/high availability reference system based on high geodetic-grade GPS&GLONASS dual-frequency receiver, tactical-grade IMU and digital wheel probe, processed using a dedicated COTS post-processing software. Common atomic clock (CSAC <b>Caesium</b> <b>clock)</b> synchronizing the platform with the truth reference equipment. Pedestrian DASU: RF Front-Ends: A high resolution FE in the GPS LI and GLONASS LI bands.

Common atomic clock (CSAC <b>Caesium</b> <b>clock)</b> synchronizing the platform with the truth reference equipment. Data Collection Campaigns Using the two DASU an extensive data collection campaign has been carried out covering representative road and pedestrian user environments: Vehicular campaign: fourteen days of road data collection covering a motorway route with open sky (best case), and an urban route through typical city environments with canyons and tunnels. Pedestrian campaign: A number of different routes around city areas in three cities. Of these routes there are two "city centre" routes, where there is a mixture of closely spaced buildings, covered arcades and wider roads; two in "out of town" shopping centres with large car parks for initialisation and limited visibility in the remaining of the route; and a rural/suburban route around a park area. Interference campaign: The collected data is complemented by tests performed with a signal simulator to test the impact of interferences and spoofing. Offline Analysis Unit (OAU) Based on the SRX software receiver [1] for processing the collected RF samples and by taking advantage of the accurate reference system and a common reference atomic clock integrated in the DASU platforms, the measurement errors (code, carrier phase and Doppler) can be accurately determined, and by using precise orbit, clock and ionosphere data from reliable sources (such as the IGS) it is possible to distingu...|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic <b>clocks.</b> <b>Caesium</b> atomic <b>clocks</b> are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years).

50|$|<b>Caesium</b> <b>clocks</b> are {{the most}} {{accurate}} time and frequency standards, and serve as the primary standard for {{the definition of the}} second in SI (the metric system). By definition, radiation produced by the transition between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium (in the absence of external influences such as the Earth's magnetic field) has a frequency of exactly 9,192,631,770 Hz. That value was chosen so that the caesium second equalled, to the limit of human measuring ability in 1960 when it was adopted, the existing standard ephemeris second based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Because no other measurement involving time had been as precise, the effect of the change was less than the experimental uncertainty of all existing measurements.|$|R

5000|$|Early {{atomic time}} scales {{consisted}} of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated {{by a single}} atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first <b>caesium</b> atomic <b>clock</b> at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL). The [...] "Greenwich Atomic" [...] (GA) scale began in 1955 at the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The International Time Bureau (BIH) began a time scale, Tm or AM, in July 1955, using both local <b>caesium</b> <b>clocks</b> and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of VLF radio signals. The United States Naval Observatory began the A.1 scale 13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, Colorado. Both the BIH scale and A.1 were defined by an epoch {{at the beginning of}} 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding UT2 instant. The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: [...] "A3" [...] in 1963 and [...] "TA(BIH)" [...] in 1969. This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of UT2. At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.|$|R

5000|$|Hafele and Keating, in 1971, flew <b>caesium</b> atomic <b>clocks</b> {{east and}} west around the earth in {{commercial}} airliners, to compare the elapsed time against that of a clock that remained at the U.S. Naval Observatory. Two opposite effects came into play. The clocks were expected to age more quickly (show a larger elapsed time) than the reference clock, since {{they were in a}} higher (weaker) gravitational potential for most of the trip (c.f. Pound-Rebka experiment). But also, contrastingly, the moving clocks were expected to age more slowly because of the speed of their travel. From the actual flight paths of each trip, the theory predicted that the flying clocks, compared with reference clocks at the U.S. Naval Observatory, should have lost 40Â±23 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and should have gained 275Â±21 nanoseconds during the westward trip. Relative to the atomic time scale of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the flying clocks lost 59Â±10 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and gained 273Â±7 nanoseconds during the westward trip (where the error bars represent standard deviation). In 2005, the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom reported their limited replication of this experiment.
