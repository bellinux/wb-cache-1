However, The <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Pearl became both a critical and commercial success.|$|E

5|$|The backstory for {{the film}} is a legend {{fabricated}} by Sánchez and Myrick which is detailed in the <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blair Witch, a mockumentary broadcast on the SciFi Channel in 1999 prior {{to the release of}} The Blair Witch Project.

25|$|<b>The</b> {{classification}} <b>of</b> text {{as belonging}} to the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather on <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report <b>the</b> <b>cursing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fig tree, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we find only <b>the</b> parable <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barren fig tree, in a different point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.|$|R

5|$|Betty instantaneously {{realizes that}} Simon needs magic {{in order to}} survive, so she places him on the magic carpet and flies it to Wizard City. On the way, Death (voiced by Miguel Ferrer) appears to Simon in a vision, {{offering}} his one and only chance of escaping the <b>curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown. Simon refuses, and Betty attacks and eventually destroys Bella Noche. Simon reverts to Ice King, unaware of what happened. Later, he recounts the events to a captured Muscle Princess, while Betty—who survived the struggle with Bella Noche—watches sadly from a window and flies off on the magic carpet.|$|E
5|$|For 24-year-old Hanshin Tigers fan Masaya Shitababa, the 2003 celebration was a tragedy. He {{drowned in}} the canal, with all reports being {{that he had been}} shoved in by the revelers. To prevent future incidents, the Osaka city council ordered the {{construction}} of a new Ebisubashi bridge beginning in 2004, which will make it more difficult for fans to take the celebratory leap should the <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colonel be broken and the Tigers win again.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the Tigers had an {{unexpectedly}} strong season. Their chief rivals, the Yomiuri Giants, lost their star player Hideki Matsui to the New York Yankees, while the Tigers saw {{the return of}} pitcher Hideki Irabu back to NPB after playing with the Texas Rangers. The Tigers won the Central League {{to qualify for the}} Japan Series, and many newspapers speculated that the <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colonel had finally been broken. The Tigers lost the Japan Series, this time to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, so the curse is presumably intact.|$|E

However, Verbinski told his concept artists to keep working on the picture, and when Eisner came to visit, the executive was astonished by what had been created.|$|E
