40|$|This paper investigates how the {{benefits}} of <b>hedging</b> <b>currency</b> risk and the incentives of a firm to hedge {{are affected by the}} hedging strategies of competing firms. In competitive industries, if <b>currency</b> <b>hedging</b> is uncommon, prices are expected to positively co-vary with exchange rate related cost shocks providing firms with a ‘natural hedge’. As the extent of <b>currency</b> <b>hedging</b> in an industry rises, prices become less sensitive to exchange rates, making profits more random. This suggests that, insofar as randomness in profits is undesirable, the decision to remain unhedged hurts expected profits more if a higher fraction of competitors are hedged. Consistent with this, I find that a firm’s decision to remain unhedged hurts its value more if a higher fraction of competitors hedge exchange rate risk. Consequently, firms are more likely to <b>hedge</b> <b>currency</b> risk if a higher fraction of their competitors do so, even after controlling for industry level exposures to currency risk. These strategic incentives are robust and appear to be more important for <b>currency</b> <b>hedging</b> decisions than some of the firm-specific factors highlighted by existing theory...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the risk management problem of an investor {{who holds a}} diversified portfolio of global equities or bonds and chooses long or short positions in currencies to manage {{the risk of the}} total portfolio. Over the period 1975 - 2005, we find that a risk-minimizing global equity investor should short the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and British pound but should hold long positions in the US dollar, the euro, and the Swiss franc. The resulting currency position tends to rise in value when equity markets fall. This strategy works well for investment horizons of one month to one year. In the past 15 years the risk-minimizing demand for the dollar appears to have weakened slightly, while demands for the euro and Swiss franc have strengthened. These changes may reflect the growing role for the euro in the international financial system.

Our analysis shows that value stocks outperform growth stocks, and that hedging a value portfolio can provide marginally higher risk-adjusted returns. The hedged portfolios do on the other hand provide potential diversification benefits due to lower correlation with their respective benchmarks.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the demand for}} index bonds and their role in hedging risky asset returns against currency risks in a complete market where equity is not hedged against inflation risk. Avellaneda's uncertain volatility model with non-constant coefficients to describe equity price variation, forward price variation, index bond price variation and rate of inflation, together with Merton's intertemporal portfolio choice model, are utilized to enable an investor to choose an optimal portfolio consisting of equity, nominal bonds and index bonds when {{the rate of inflation}} is uncertain. A hedge ratio is universal if investors in different countries hedge against currency risk to the same extent. Three universal hedge ratios (UHRs) are defined with respect to the investor's total demand for index bonds, hedging risky asset returns (i. e. equity and nominal bonds) against currency risk, which are not held for hedging purposes. These UHRs are hedge positions in foreign index bond portfolios, stated as a fraction of the national market portfolio. At equilibrium all the three UHRs are comparable to Black's corrected equilibrium hedging ratio. The Cameron-Martin-Girsanov theorem is applied to show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative given under a P -martingale, the investor's exchange rate (product of the two currencies) is a martingale. Therefore the investors can agree on a common hedging strategy to trade exchange rate risk irrespective of investor nationality. This makes the choice of the measurement currency irrelevant and the hedge ratio universal without affecting their values.

In recent years investors have been turning to foreign markets to obtain even greater scope for {{diversification}} than domestic markets offer.

This article investigates {{the impact of}} <b>currency</b> <b>hedging</b> on these portfolios, in particular index portfolios of stocks and bonds from markets in seven industrialized countries. The author finds that the apparent risk-reducing benefits of <b>currency</b> <b>hedging</b> of equity portfolios in the early 1980 s did not continue into subsequent periods. In contrast, foreign long-term bond portfolios consistently exhibited dramatically lower variability of hedged returns compared with unhedged returns.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to analyze the competitive firm 2 ̆ 7 s behavior under the price and exchange rate uncertainty when the firm participates in futures markets to hedge against these risks. This dissertation deals with three theoretical models which consider three different firms, and one empirical study. The first model shows that if the producing firm which trades in international and domestic markets uses the futures markets, the separation theorem holds, and the production decision {{does not depend on}} the risk attitudes or probability distribution of the random variables, but marketing (and hedging) decisions are still affected by uncertainty even though there are hedging instruments. The second model shows that the separation theorem still holds even under the existence of basis risk. In third theoretical model an importing offshore firm which has access to U. S. futures market and face input price and exchange rate uncertainty is analyzed. Introducing both hedging markets to the offshore country encourages the offshore firm to increase its production by increasing imports. In empirical study, time series data relating to a Korean importing are investigated as to whether they are stationary or not by using Dickey-Fuller method and Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin method. The conditional moments method is used to solve the nonstationarity problem and to estimate the optimal commodity and <b>currency</b> <b>hedge</b> ratios and the effects of introducing hedging markets to a Korean firm.

40|$|The German {{real estate}} {{open-ended}} fund, a major indirect {{real estate investment}} vehicle for German individual investors, is now suffering a strong pressure of globalization from its investors because of the sluggish German domestic real estate market. In {{order to deal with}} such pressure, many funds have begun to invest in the US and now looking for opportunities in Asia, especially in Japan. For a German fund which is basically a core investor with a long-term investment horizon, the Japanese market fits its investment policy because of the maturity and stability. At the same time, the low correlation with its fatherland market and the <b>currency</b> <b>hedge</b> gain in Japan is worthy of special mention, along with the recovering market. However, many funds seem to encounter difficulties in acquiring Japanese properties. Among several reasons, the most significant problem {{is likely to be the}} problem of the accessibility to deal flows. Currently, many transactions are conducted among the limited market community of participants in Japan. Otherwise bidding requires a fairly high premium on the market consensus because of the small number of publicly available transactions. Nevertheless, some foreign investors have successfully acquired properties in Japan, so the German open-ended fund will surely be able to have opportunities, too. (cont.) In this thesis, four measures are proposed: the close relationship to Japanese leading real estate companies or their intimate advisory firms, the entry in the retail sector, the participation in development projects, and the investment in PFI projects. Some of them may have already been examined by funds, but the advantages and disadvantages of these alternatives are examined from the perspective of a Japanese real estate professional, which should help German funds comprehend possibilities in the Japanese market. by Rokuhei Hayashi.

40|$|The Global Credit Crisis of 2008 - 09 has {{underscored the}} urgency of {{reforming}} the international financial architecture. While a number of short-term reforms are already in train, this paper contemplates more ambitious reforms of the international financial architecture that might be implemented {{over the next ten}} years. It proposes routinizing the expansion of IMF quotas and the conduct of exchange rate surveillance. It contemplates an expanded role for the SDR in international transactions, which would require someone-like the IMF-to act as market maker. It considers proposals for reimposing Glass-Steagall-like restrictions on commercial and investment banking, something {{that will have to be}} coordinated internationally to be feasible. Other proposals would require banks to purchase capital insurance; here the question is who would be on the other side of the market. Again there is likely to be a role for the IMF. Then there are arguments for a new agency or institution to deal with cross-border bank insolvencies. Any such entity will require staff support, which might plausibly come from the Fund. Finally, some insist that international colleges of regulators are not enough-that it is desirable to create a World Financial Organization (WFO) with the power to sanction members whose national regulatory policies are not up to international standards. A WFO will similarly need staff support, of which the IMF would be one possible source. All this of course presupposes meaningful IMF governance reform so that the institution has the legitimacy and efficiency to assume these additional responsibilities. The paper therefore concludes with some conventional and unconventional proposals for IMF governance reform.
