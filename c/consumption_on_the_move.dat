40|$|Students are {{increasingly}} expecting HE institutions {{to acknowledge the}} universality of mobile phone use and to incorporate mobile use into learning. Many institutions are taking up the challenge, with SMS notifications of cancelled lectures to mobile access to VLE’s. However, the growing ubiquity of smartphones, equipped with powerful facilities including easy web access and media capture, points to more powerful educational uses besides admin message and lecture <b>consumption</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move.</b> These facilities make it feasible for user generated content to be captured and shared with peers, providing students with a powerful means of bridging the gap between classroom and outside world in natural and engaging ways. This should be an effective learning tool, as students see taught material reflected {{in the outside world}} and vice versa, enabling them to engage in mapping from classroom to lived reality and thereby deepen their understanding. Language teachers are particularly attuned to the need for students to transfer their learning to real life settings. With JISC and EU funding we have been developing a mobile language learning app that makes this bridging possible, with language learners capturing examples of interesting target language use to share and discuss in class. Alternatively teachers can ask for specific materials to be collected. In this paper we report on the evaluation of the system with foreign language learners in the UK, Norway and Italy...|$|E

If Problem 3.3 is solved, <b>the</b> minimum power <b>consumption</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other subcarriers can also be {{obtained}} with the similar steps.

40|$|Production and {{consumption}} of multimedia content <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet is rising, fueled by the demand for content from services such as YouTube, Netflix and Facebook video. The Internet is shifting from host-based to content-centric networking. At the same time, users are shifting away from a homogeneous desktop computing environment to using a heterogeneous mix of devices, such as smartphones, tablets and thin clients, all of which allow users to consume data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move</b> using wireless and cellular data networks. The popularity of these new class of devices has, in turn, increased demand for multimedia content by mobile users. The emergence of rich Internet applications and the widespread adoption and use of High Definition (HD) video has also placed higher pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> service providers and the core Internet backbone, forcing service providers to respond to increased bandwidth use in such networks. In my thesis, I aim to provide clarity and insight into the usage of core networking protocols and multimedia <b>consumption</b> <b>on</b> both mobile and wireless networks, {{as well as the}} network core. I also present research prototypes for potential solutions to some of the problems caused by <b>the</b> increased multimedia <b>consumption</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet...|$|R
