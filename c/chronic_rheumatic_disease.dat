40|$|The type of rheumatic disease, disease {{activity}} or the medical treatment {{can give a}} risk factor for impaired wound healing or infection after dental intervention by patient with <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> (RP). The aim of the pilot study was to show differences in wound healing between RP and a control group without rheumatic disease. RP with different types of <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> (like rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disease, spondyloarthropathy or vaskulitis) were interviewed for dental intervention (like tooth extraction, implantation or root planing), systemic disease, parodontal disease and oral hygiene with an acquired questionnaire. These facts were compared with the age and sex matched controls. We found 128 RP (96 women/ 75 %; 32 man/ 25 %) with mean time of rheumatic disease from 10 ± 9, 9 years and 128 age and sex matched patients in the control group. RP = 41 /controls = 57 report a good wound healing (p = 0, 002), RP = 12 /controls = 9 a moderate wound healing (p = 0, 480), RP = 5 /controls = 1 bad wound healing (p = 0, 096). RP = 9 /controls = 7 report a low (p = 0, 597), RP = 1 /controls = 1 a moderate, RP = 1 /controls = 0 a severe infection. These results detect differences in wound healing and risk factors in connection with dental intervention between RP and controls without rheumatic disease.

40|$|Abstract Background For {{adolescents}} with {{a diagnosis of}} lifelong chronic illness, mastery of self-management skills is {{a critical component of}} the transition to adult care. This study aims to examine self-reported medication adherence and self-care skills among {{adolescents with}} <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease.</b> Methods Cross-sectional survey of 52 adolescent patients in the Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic at UCSF. Outcome measures were self-reported medication adherence, medication regimen knowledge and independence in health care tasks. Predictors of self-management included age, disease perception, self-care agency, demographics and self-reported health status. Bivariate associations were assessed using the Student's t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher exact test as appropriate. Independence in self-management tasks were compared between subjects age 13 - 16 and 17 - 20 using the chi-squared test. Results Subjects were age 13 - 20 years (mean 15. 9); 79 % were female. Diagnoses included juvenile idiopathic arthritis (44 %), lupus (35 %), and other rheumatic conditions (21 %). Mean disease duration was 5. 3 years (SD 4. 0). Fifty four percent reported perfect adherence to medications, 40 % reported 1 - 2 missed doses per week, and 6 % reported missing 3 or more doses. The most common reason for missing medications was forgetfulness. Among health care tasks, there was an age-related increase in ability to fill prescriptions, schedule appointments, arrange transportation, ask questions of doctors, manage insurance, and recognize symptoms of illness. Ability to take medications as directed, keep a calendar of appointments, and maintain a personal medical file did not improve with age. Conclusions This study suggests that adolescents with <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>disease</b> may need additional support to achieve independence in self-management. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Contraception is an {{important}} issue and should be a matter of concern in every medical visit of adolescent and young patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>diseases.</b> This narrative review discusses contraception methods in adolescents with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE), antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). Barrier methods are safe and their use should be encouraged for all adolescents with <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Combined oral contraceptives (COC) are strictly prohibited for JSLE and APS patients with positive antiphospholipid antibodies. Reversible long-acting contraception can be encouraged and offered routinely to the JSLE adolescent patient and other <b>rheumatic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Progestin-only pills are safe in the majority of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>diseases,</b> although the main concern related to its use by adolescents is poor adherence due to menstrual irregularity. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injections every three months is a highly effective contraception strategy, although its long-term use is associated with decreased bone mineral density. COC or other combined hormonal contraceptive may be options for JIA and JDM patients. Oral levonorgestrel should be considered as an emergency contraception method for all adolescents with <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatic</b> <b>diseases,</b> including patients with contraindication to COC...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{definition}} proposed by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is defined as an arthritis of unknown etiology, starting under 16 {{years of age and}} lasting for at least 6 weeks, once other known conditions have been excluded.

Several studies have evaluated the effects of candidate genetic variants in the complex pathway of genes involved in methotrexate pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, however, results are still contrasting and no definitive genetic marker of methotrexate response useful for the clinician to tailor therapy of children with JIA has been identified. Recently, genome-wide approaches have been applied, identifying new potential biological processes involved in methotrexate response in JIA such as TGF-beta signaling and calcium channels.

Therefore, targeting T-cell activation is a rational approach for the treatment of JIA. Abatacept (ABA), a selective co-stimulation modulator, has been shown to be effective in treating all JIA subtypes and is generally safe and well tolerated in JIA. Neutralizing antibodies were found in 6 / 9 (67 %) of seropositive patients, but anti-ABA antibodies did not appear to be associated with disease flare, serious adverse events, acute infusional adverse events, hypersensitivity, autoimmune disorders, or low ABA serum concentrations.
