5|$|Boletus reticulatus is {{very similar}} to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} during the summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler stipe <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more elaborate and pronounced whitish reticulation, often extending to the stipe base.|$|E
5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E

5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} first <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{distinctive}} soul style by Labelle on their 1972 album Moon Shadow. Van Halen began covering {{the song in}} concert in 1993.

5|$|To {{make the}} tunnel water and frost tight, {{the walls were}} covered with {{polyethylene}} mats. Because they are highly flammable, they were then <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> layer of gunite. Also installed were fire water pipes and ventilation systems to remove smoke. To sound-insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing, the entire tunnel was <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> layer of rock wool. By December 2010, the ballast had been laid, and in January 2011 laying of the tracks and ties started. The work to build the tracks and overhead wires has been contracted to Baneservice. The contract for the electro-technical installations was awarded to YIT Building Systems for NOK120 million. As of 2006, the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK2.7 billion.|$|E

5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} of Jupiter and that the planet's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely to be much more than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E

The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place. They then {{travel to the}} lovers' lane, only to find all the cars abandoned and <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cotton candy-like substance. Back in town, the klowns arrive and begin capturing townspeople in cocoons using rayguns that resemble toys. Several klowns perform pranks and mock circus acts, all resulting in the deaths of several onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Snakes, {{like other}} reptiles, have a skin <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scale. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. A scale protects {{the body of}} the snake, aids it in locomotion, allows {{moisture}} to be retained within, alters the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage, and in some cases even aids in prey capture (such as Acrochordus). The simple or complex colouration patterns (which help in camouflage and anti-predator display) are a property of the underlying skin, but the folded nature of scaled skin allows bright skin to be concealed between scales then revealed in order to startle predators.|$|E
5|$|The Chelicerata are {{arthropods}} as they have: segmented {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cuticle made of chitin and proteins; heads that {{are composed of}} several segments that fuse during {{the development of the}} embryo; a much reduced coelom; a hemocoel through which the blood circulates, driven by a tube-like heart. Chelicerates' bodies consist of two tagmata, sets of segments that serve similar functions: the foremost one, called the prosoma or cephalothorax, and the rear tagma is called the opisthosoma or abdomen. However, in the Acari (mites and ticks) there is no visible division between these sections.|$|E

5|$|The Hallaton Helmet is a {{decorated}} iron Roman cavalry parade helmet originally <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sheet {{of silver and}} decorated in places with gold leaf. It was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton, Leicestershire after Ken Wallace, {{a member of the}} Hallaton Fieldwork Group, found coins in the area. Further investigation by professional archaeologists from University of Leicester Archaeological Services discovered that the site appeared to have been used as a large-scale Iron Age shrine. Nine years of conservation and restoration has been undertaken by experts from the British Museum, supported by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £650,000. The helmet is now on permanent display at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough alongside other artefacts from the Hallaton Treasure hoard.|$|E
5|$|The comet {{continued}} to fade as it receded, {{but is still}} being tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of 25.7 AU from Sun, the comet was still active {{as indicated by the}} detection of the CO-driven coma. Herschel Space Observatory images taken in 2010 suggest comet Hale–Bopp is <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fresh frost layer. Hale–Bopp was again detected in December 2010 when it was 30.7 AU away from the Sun, and on August 7, 2012 at a 33.2 AU distance from the Sun. Astronomers expect that the comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which time it will be nearing 30thmagnitude. By this time it will become very difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of horns {{above and}} in front of the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
