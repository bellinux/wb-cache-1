40|$|This study {{examined}} use of wearable activity trackers and social media, and {{their influence on}} motivation for physical activity and participation in endurance events. I did a literature review of social media’s influence on event participation {{and the influence of}} activity tracking usage on motivation to participate in fitness activity. The literature is broken down by a study of each technology, and then the interaction between them. I also <b>conducted</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research</b> by gathering data, conducting a survey and interviews. Through these methods I show that on their own, each of these technologies can influence motivation and participation. Furthermore, when the ease of uploading data from a tracker is combined with social media, the technology is having a direct effect on physical activity and recreational endurance sports participation...|$|R

As an educator, I wanted to <b>conduct</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research</b> to investigate whether a teacher can motivate slow learners by using different motivational strategies. Fifteen pupils of Form I participated in completing a questionnaire to show how much they were intrinsically and extrinsically motivated in the learning of the Arabic language before applying the motivation strategies. At the end, the same questionnaire was given after these strategies were applied. As a result, my goal was achieved. Pupils seemed to be motivated after applying the motivational strategies. However, based on the findings, extrinsic motivation {{showed no sign of}} improvement and obviously, this matter merits further research. Some recommendations are provided. At last, it is hoped that results of this study could be used to adapt the curriculum to the needs of slow learners. Classics and World LanguagesM. A. (Arabic Language...|$|R
40|$|In {{this era}} where global {{sustainability}} is challenged, environmental education plays {{a vital role}} in building environmental awareness. Other roles of environmental education include the promotion of responsible citizenship and the fostering of environmental advocacy in children. As a way to strengthen these goals of environmental education, this thesis explores the dynamic uses of music to compound on the fields impact. I argue that the benefits of music outlined suggest music’s power to heighten environmental sensitivity from a young age. I use narratives from the environmental education, music, education, and psychology discourses to demonstrate the theoretical advantages of music in conjunction with environmental education. I also <b>conduct</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research</b> with Pitzer’s Leadership in Environmental Education Partnership, to put the theories into action. As a result, I find music to be an antecedent to the development of environmental sensitivity; music is not only instrumental in promoting environmental citizenship, but can be a way to achieve an environmental revolution by inspiring communities to mobilize for change...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master {{thesis is}} to analyse the {{communication}} strategy of Budweiser Budvar Brewery in connection with its brand Budweiser Budvar on the domestic beer market. In the theoretical part of the thesis I describe marketing theory, which is focusing on communication mix and brand research. In the practical part I first introduce Budweiser Budvar Brewery, its history, portfolio of products and I evaluate {{the position of the}} company on the Czech market as well as on foreign markets. In the following part I analyse the internal and external environment and also the current use of the individual communication tools. I focus mainly on the current advertising campaign. Based on the information I obtained, a SWOT analysis is carried out. I also <b>conduct</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research,</b> which deals with the perception of Budweiser Budvar brand on the Czech beer market.

40|$|Many {{designers}} {{today are}} creating communication materials that encourage individuals {{to change their}} behavior related to environmental issues. The problem {{is that people are}} often unaware of existing research on effective methods for these communications. For example, environmental psychologists have studied best practices for creating persuasive communications for several decades. During this yearlong master’s thesis project, I <b>conducted</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research</b> studies, exploring how the emotional tone and medium of a communication piece affect a person’s decision to change his or her behavior. My second goal was to connect designers to existing research in the fields of psychology, decision sciences, and persuasive technology. In the end, I created a roadmap to behavior change: a compilation of <b>research</b> from <b>my</b> <b>own</b> studies and existing literature. The roadmap includes observations and practical tips people can use when designing for environmental issues, as well as a set of ethical principles that should be followed when designing for behavior change. I believe that my work will help designers use communication to empower individuals with knowledge, encouraging them to begin and sustain a journey toward positive behavior change...|$|R
40|$|Diploma thesis "The {{marketing}} usage in {{the social}} media" deals with {{the application of the}} social media in the marketing communication. My target is to create a comprehensive outlook on social media in marketing promotion. What are the most commonly used tools of social media marketing? Which forms of promotion does it offer? How to use these tools correctly? Is the promotion that uses social media effective? How big is its role in the current communication and how do the clients understand the social media marketing? The thesis is divided into two parts. The theoretical one describes the basic definitions of terms for my thesis. Later in the thesis, I am explaining the position of marketing in media and what new elements it has brought. I do this throurgh mapping of the online and social media marketing and promotion resources. Another section of the theoretical part is devoted description of selected social media. As an <b>own</b> contribution to <b>my</b> practical part of diploma thesis, I <b>conducted</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research.</b> It was done in a form of qualitative research, more complex open-ended questions, focused on a smaller group of respondents intended to detect {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the use of social media in current marketing.

40|$|Candles, {{once the}} most {{reliable}} source for light, are now popular as memorials, religious and romantic decorations, or as symbols of the past. The real candle I made lost its light due {{to the presence of}} the wax—the very source of its light— more specifically, due to the wax’s liquification and liquidity. Its structure creates an irony: its result contradicts the intention that a candle serves as a steady light source. The documentary of the burning process is projected as a moving image onto a part of the candle, which is the original site for the candlelight. To me, the projection presents to viewers the candlelight that you have never seen—a history that was not in your memory. Yet the infinite loop—the eternal return of the ghostly light—can create a fake memory, and therefore, a fake witness. The film does not simply tell you the past, it also reminds you of the past, while the reflection captures everyone coming towards the candle and traps you in the loop. In my college years, I have taken a number of courses and <b>conducted</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research</b> on the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Middle Eastern politics, and the Holocaust. Through hearing stories about all kinds of turmoil and their representations, judgments, and justifications, I began to feel and experience—rather than just seeing—our human history, its complexity, construction, and repetition. I read history; I stare at images; I watch documentaries; I go to museums. At the end of the day, what I perceive forms part of my memory, my history, which becomes an essential element that constructs my identity and myself...|$|R

40|$|Prosthetics {{dates back}} {{thousands}} of years, {{with some of}} the earliest recorded devices dating back to the ancient Egyptians. The devices are used to replace a limb that may have been lost due to a variety of reasons. Of course, much has changed since the basic wooden devices. What is exceptionally fascinating about prosthetics and orthotics is that the field is always changing and become more advanced; it truly has infinite potential. Prosthetics has evolved over many centuries to be what it is today, but where will the technology go in the future? Focusing on one area of prosthetics, specifically upper extremity devices, one can clearly see that much improvement can be made. Prostheses for upper extremity patients are traditionally passive (purely cosmetic), body powered (operated by movement of shoulders or upper arm), or myoelectric (controlled by signals from patient’s muscles). Each of these types of devices has its advantages and disadvantages, but no significant changes have been made since the 1980 s. Through conducting independent research, interning at Nunnery Orthotics and Prosthetics in North Kingstown, RI, as well as consulting with numerous prosthetists and other experts in the field, I have come up with three possible directions for the field of upper extremity prosthetics: sensory feedback, wireless electrode transmission, and simultaneous control of devices. This project has allowed me to further understand the challenges that prosthetists and their technicians face when trying {{to meet the needs of}} a patient, as well as the incredible benefits that patients receive through this new technology. Each of these directions will require many years of research and study to perfect, and it could potentially be years before anything is available to the public. I hope that through the completion of this project I have caused many more to think about the population of people using prosthetic devices, and how to make their lives easier to live each day. I chose to complete this project for a few different reasons. Not only did I wish to expand my knowledge of the field of prosthetics, but I also really wanted to learn about where the future may be going to potentially <b>conduct</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research</b> someday...|$|R
40|$|People today {{live in a}} world {{dominated}} by technology. All of the conveniences and technologies people enjoy and utilize today, however, would not exist without the foundation of empirical science laid during the Enlightenment. This thesis looks at the Enlightenment both as a philosophical movement and as the setting of the Scientific Revolution. The leaders of the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution began the tradition of utilizing reason in research, founded empirical science, and developed the scientific method. This thesis traces the development of science during the Enlightenment and seeks to prove that Enlightenment science {{set the stage for the}} science of today and that the ultimate goals of scientists in the Enlightenment and today are the same. I want to show that the end goals of science are and always have been to understand and control the natural world and to use that knowledge to improve peoples lives. I used nanotechnology as the example of the cutting-edge science of today because it, like Enlightenment science, has the potential to revolutionize society and how people view their world. I also <b>conducted</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research</b> on the nanomolecular building block corannulene under the direction of Dr. Nathan Hammer. We developed our own undergraduate Physical Chemistry laboratory exercise. This laboratory exercise utilizes modern analytical and computational chemistry methods for collecting and analyzing data and serves as an example of more basic nano-level research that is being done today. In researching this thesis, I looked at the work of many historians of the Enlightenment as secondary sources, and I read the personal papers, letters, and publications of Enlightenment philosophers and scientists as primary sources. While developing my corannulene laboratory exercise, I consulted numerous peer-reviewed scientific journals to learn about what research had previously been done with nanomolecular building blocks. By looking generally at current nanotechnology research and its potential to change society and specifically at nanomolecular building blocks, this thesis shows that the same tenets of the scientific method and empirical science that began during the Enlightenment are still guiding the science of today, and that the same goals of understanding the world and using science to benefit humanity are still present...|$|R
40|$|Today we {{continue}} to experience inefficiencies in understanding the mental health and cultural needs of returning service members. I have <b>conducted</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>research</b> to best comprehend the emotions and needs of returning veterans, evaluating the practices that are most beneficial for healing and reintegration. The primary focus of my independent study was to observe the current mental health treatments that are offered to the veterans outside of the traditional medical realm. In relation to this, I wanted to evaluate the role that religious and spiritual practices play in the veterans’ healing process. I spent four months observing and interviewing various personnel at the Providence Rhode Island Veterans’ Administration Hospital. I conducted interviews with a chaplain, psychologist, peer-­‐mentor specialist, anthropologist, veterans, and PTSD clinical staff members. My research also included the analysis of a documentary film, texts, research studies, and soldier’s memoirs. To demonstrate the services that returning veterans with mental health conditions would receive at the VAH, I applied {{the story of a}} recently returned veteran to my encounters. I used this veteran’s story to depict the vast amount of encounters that he could potentially experience during his treatment process, and the different types of treatment mechanisms that may be recommended. I have concluded this research with my personal recommendations, proposing changes and implementations that could be made to better treat the mental health conditions of the veterans...|$|R
40|$|Dying is {{not only}} a highly {{personal}} topic, but we cannot forget that it is also a social theme, because people who are near death are always affected not only by other people but by society as well. Social workers and those in services that help the dying to live a meaningful, dignified, and painless existence in the interim must make a number of decisions, many of which being uneasy or uncomfortable, even in some cases where they have no clear solution. It is these problematic cases that these workers meet in their daily life. This thesis is therefore focused on the dilemmas faced by social workers that work with the dying. The theoretical part introduces problems of social work {{in the context of the}} dying. In order to understand a particular context, it must be something about the problems of dying to know why their work occasionally works as terms like dying, death and palliative care. As a crucial part of the work is the problem of dilemmas, where I come from Musil (2004) concept of everyday dilemmas. The theoretical part is devoted only dilemmas that research has not been proven. Other dilemmas are more specified in the empirical part. In the empirical part, I am setting one main goal, in which I try to find out what some of the dilemmas are that the staff working in social services with the dying people experience (such as in hospices, nursing homes, and retirement homes) and how to solve those dilemmas. To that end, I set two main research questions and six sub-research questions. To collect my data I chose the qualitative research method of questioning through semi-structured interviews. For the research sample, I chose the method of random selection. The research had to meet a set of predetermined criteria. For my data processing research, I chose the method of case studies. The research occurred in phases, where the first stage was partial, and then subsequently I <b>conducted</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>research.</b> <b>My</b> goal in this work was to identify the problems experienced by people who provide social services to the dying, and how these are solved. The results have shown that they are indeed faced with many challenges. The research revealed nine such examples, while some individual workers had repeated instances. Further research showed that workers in most cases solve dilemmas as best as their knowledge and conscience permit. Accumulated experience is probably the most valuable asset in dealing with such situations, and the majority of respondents considered it important to discuss the issues faced by a multidisciplinary team. I believe that my work goals were met successfully and the research questions provided answers. My work could serve as a basis for a conference or for a technical article dealing with these issues in more detail...|$|R
40|$|Participating in the UEPI {{sponsored}} Affordable Housing Summer Internship exposed me to {{the realities}} of housing issues in the Los Angeles area through real life experience in project development and policy research. I chose to intern within the Real Estate Department of the East LA Community Corporation (ELACC) which is a non-profit that has been operating in the Boyle Heights community for over sixteen years. Through site visits, meetings, and assistance with ongoing project budgets I had the opportunity to witness the extensive process that is involved in developing affordable housing units. Correspondingly, in the last weeks of my internship I directed the initial phases of community outreach related to a future development site. In addition to these responsibilities, I was given the opportunity of <b>conducting</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>research</b> regarding the restriction of affordable housing developments within 500 feet of freeways and major roadways. Research consisted of studying the health, financial and social costs associated with such stipulations for residents of Boyle Heights specifically. The results demonstrate the need for pollution reduction regulations and related housing policies to be localized in order to maximize overall air quality enhancement and community health. All of the aforementioned tasks served to greatly enhance my comprehension of the current housing market in Los Angeles, specifically how rising costs of living, increasing housing prices, and the lack of affordable developments are devastating low income families and individuals...|$|R
40|$|At {{first for}} my {{bachelor}} thesis was <b>conducted</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> marketing <b>research,</b> which {{was focused on}} mobile phones. Respondents filled the questionnaire, which was previously created for this purpose. With this marketing research, I received information about what people expect from mobile phones, according to what type of the mobile phones are bought, how much money on mobile services and mobile devices are spent, which mobile operators are using and much more. Individual users of mobile phones were placed into groups either by age, occupation, income or any other character. Then I tried using correspondence analysis {{to determine whether there}} is any relationship between these groups and other features, such as how much money pay per call, what they expect from mobile phones, which operator they have, which brand of mobile phone are using, etc. With correspondence analysis, I have investigated the mutual dependence of the results, which were obtained in <b>my</b> <b>own</b> marketing <b>research.</b> Based on the results of correspondence analysis, I was able to recommend to mobile operators and manufacturers of mobile phones, on which user groups should focus on. Mobile phone manufacturers will be able, thanks to the recommendation, to improve the features and functionality of its products strictly according to customer requirements and might even increase sales of their products. When would be the mobile operators focus on those target groups that are {{based on the results of}} my work for them the key, they could then create a better and cheaper fares for these target groups. This could get affection of such groups and thus gain new users for its mobile network. When would these manufacturers and mobile operators to preserve in my recommendation, they could also save costs of mobile users for mobile services due to cheaper and better fares. Furthermore, the mobile phones should have their exact functions and features, which are required from them. This would be on the market of mobile phones and service satisfaction on both the supply and demand...|$|R
