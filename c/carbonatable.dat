40|$|Carbonation of {{concrete}} at ambient CO 2 concentration {{is a slow}} process. This makes the testing of the resistance {{of concrete}} against carbonation often too slow to be applicable for service life assessments of new structures. Raising the CO 2 -concentration will accelerate the test but the validity of an increase CO 2 -level is debated. If not valid, the service life can be seriously underestimated. In this paper, the effects of accelerating on the carbonation process are discussed. It is shown that a change in CO 2 concentration will not change the carbonation process. Since carbonation occurs instantly, a zero CO 2 concentration at the carbonation front is maintained. Moreover, it has been concluded that all hydrated and unhydrated cement ultimately carbonate. This implies {{that the amount of}} <b>carbonatable</b> matter can be determined {{on the basis of the}} amount of calcium in the unreacted cement...|$|E
40|$|This article reviews {{proposed}} technical {{approaches for}} the manufacture {{and use of}} alternatives to Portland Cement Clinker as the main reactive binder component for ordinary concrete construction in non-specialty applications, while giving lower net global CO 2 emissions in use. A critical analysis, taking into account {{a wide range of}} technical considerations, suggests that, with the exception of alkali-activated systems, (treated in a separate paper in this issue,) there are only four classes of alternative clinker system that deserve serious attention with respect to global reductions in concrete-related CO 2 emissions: (A) Reactive Belite-rich Portland cement (RBPC) clinkers (B) Belite-Ye’elimite-Ferrite (BYF) clinkers (C) <b>Carbonatable</b> Calcium Silicate clinkers (CCSC) (D) Magnesium oxides derived from magnesium silicates (MOMS) A and B are “hydraulic” clinkers, (i. e. clinkers which harden by reaction with water,) C is a “carbonatable” clinker, (i. e. one which hardens by reaction with CO 2 gas) and D can fall into both categories...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in CO 2 concentrations {{and global warming}} will increase the carbonation depth of concrete. Furthermore, temperature rise will increase the rate of corrosion of steel rebar after carbonation. On the other hand, compared with normal concrete, high volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete is more vulnerable to carbonation-induced corrosion. Carbonation durability design with climate change {{is crucial to the}} rational use of HVFA concrete. This study presents a probabilistic approach that predicts the service life of HVFA concrete structures subjected to carbonation-induced corrosion resulting from increasing CO 2 concentrations and temperatures. First, in the corrosion initiation stage, a hydration-carbonation integration model is used to evaluate the contents of the <b>carbonatable</b> material, porosity, and carbonation depth of HVFA concrete. The Monte Carlo method is adopted to determine the probability of corrosion initiation. Second, in the corrosion propagation stage, an updated model is proposed to evaluate the rate of corrosion, degree of corrosion for cover cracking of concrete, and probability of corrosion cracking. Third, the whole service life is determined considering both corrosion initiation stage and corrosion propagation stage. The analysis results show that climate change creates {{a significant impact on the}} service life of durable concrete...|$|E
