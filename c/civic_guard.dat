5|$|The first entity {{to use the}} Italian tricolour was the Cisalpine Republic in 1797, which supplanted Milan after Napoleon's victorious army crossed Italy in 1796. The colours {{chosen by}} the Cispadane Republic were red and white, which were the colours of the {{recently}} conquered flag of Milan; and green, which was the colour of the uniform of the Milanese <b>civic</b> <b>guard.</b> During this time, many small French-proxy republics of Jacobin inspiration supplanted the ancient absolute Italian states and almost all, with variants of colour, used flags characterised by three bands of equal size, clearly inspired by the French model of 1790.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Civic</b> <b>Guard</b> {{was formed}} by the Provisional Government in February 1922 {{to take over the}} {{responsibility}} of policing the fledgling Irish Free State. It replaced the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Irish Republican Police of 1919–22. In August 1922 the force accompanied Michael Collins when he met the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin Castle.|$|E

They halted at the top of the Toowoomba Toll Bar Road for a final {{farewell}} prior to their descent to the valley below.

The pro-Treaty IRA became part of a fully re-organised new National Army and a new police force, the <b>Civic</b> <b>Guard</b> (quickly renamed as the Garda Síochána), replacing one of Ireland's two police forces, the Royal Irish Constabulary. The second, the Dublin Metropolitan Police, merged some years later with the Gardaí.|$|E

The book is notable for its favorable portrayal of an African character, omnicompetent Terran consul Percy Mjipa, at a time when most science fiction still depicted such characters rarely and stereotypically.|$|E

25|$|Wishing to make {{a career}} in city politics, Jan {{enrolled}} in the <b>civic</b> <b>guard</b> as an ensign in 1651-1653 and in 1655. He served under captain Gerrit Reynst, also an art collector. When the new town hall was opened on July 29, Jan was participating in a parade on Dam Square; he wrote that three salvos were discharged, but not that his brother Jacob was sent out of the city for a day. In 1656 he was appointed as a city official in the Nieuwe Kerk. He resigned within a few months, when he was appointed as an administrator in the townhall. In the schutterij Jan was promoted lieutenant. On February 1, 1661 Jan was elected as schepen. He may have witnessed the unveiling of Rembrandts' painting The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis in the town hall, as well as its removal a couple of months later.|$|E
500|$|The first {{official}} tricolore italiano, or Italian tricolour, was adopted on 7 January 1797, when the XIVth Parliament of the Cispadane Republic, on the proposal of deputy Giuseppe Compagnoni of Lugo, decreed [...] "to make universal the ... standard or flag of three colours, green, white, and red ..." [...] This was {{probably because the}} Legione Lombarda had carried banners of red, white (from the flag of Milan), and green (from the uniform of the <b>civic</b> <b>guard),</b> and the same colours were later adopted in the banners of the Legione Italiana, which was formed by soldiers coming from Emilia and Romagna. The flag was a horizontal square with red uppermost and, {{at the heart of}} the white fess, an emblem composed of a garland of laurel decorated with a trophy of arms and four arrows, representing the four provinces that formed the Republic ...|$|E
500|$|The tricolour was {{reportedly}} {{used for the}} first time on November 13–14. 1794 on a cockade worn by a group of students of the University of Bologna, led by Luigi Zamboni and Giovanni Battista De Rolandis, who attempted to plot a popular riot to topple the Catholic government of Bologna, a city which was part of the Papal States at the time. The law students defined themselves as [...] "patriots" [...] and wore tricolour cockades to signal they were insipred by Jacobin revolutionary ideals, but modified them to distinguish themselves from the French. The chosen colours were white and red since those are the colours of the flag of Bologna, some scholars contend green was added only for the event to give it a more ideological effect; not all agree that the cockades used by the Bologna plotters actually had three colours, since a myth about that may have been created a year later. On May 18. 1796 a cockade with those colours commemorating the Bologna riots {{was reportedly}} presented to Napoleone Bonaparte in Milan, who decided banners with same colours would be carried by the Milan <b>Civic</b> <b>Guard,</b> of the Lombard Legion and the National Guard.|$|E
50|$|Lauri Pekuri began flying as a {{youth in}} the 1930s Helsinki. He left college to {{participate}} in the <b>Civic</b> <b>guards</b> and sports. On his first attempt to join the Finnish Air Force he failed in the psychological tests and due to his bad academic record. Instead he became an NCO at the Mikkeli artillery battery. In 1939 he tried out again for the air force and was admitted. He had then completed his interrupted college studies.|$|R
50|$|The name 'Kloveniersburgwal' {{comes from}} a {{division}} of the <b>civic</b> <b>guards,</b> the 'kloveniers', named after the gun the guards were armed with. The kloveniers met at the 'Kloveniersdoelen' next to Swijgh Utrecht {{on the corner of the}} Kloveniersburgwal and the Nieuwe Doelenstraat. Later on their groupportrait, the famous painting 'De Nachtwacht' (by Rembrandt), hung in the 'Kloveniersdoelen'. Nowadays, it is exhibited in the Rijksmuseum. Swijgh Utrecht was completely destroyed in 1882; the Doelenhotel was built there instead.|$|R
50|$|The White Guard (Finnish: Suojeluskunta, plural: Suojeluskunnat, Finland-Swedish: Skyddskår, {{literally}} {{translated as}} Protection/Defense Corps) was a voluntary militia that emerged victorious over the socialist Red Guard {{as part of}} the Whites in the Finnish Civil War of 1918. The Finnish term Suojeluskunta has received many different approximations in English, including the literal translation Protection Corps, Security <b>Guard,</b> <b>Civic</b> <b>Guards,</b> National Guard, White Militia, Defence Corps, Protection Guard, and Protection Militia. They were generally known as the White Guard in the West due to their opposition to the communist Red Guards. In the White Army of Finland many participants were recruits, draftees and German trained Jägers and not part of the paramilitary as is sometimes erroneously thought.|$|R
500|$|The Dutch States' troops {{quartered}} in {{the village}} of Borgerhout numbered 25 or 40 infantry companies which comprised from 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers, plus 100 additional mounted troops. They were the backbone of the rebel army and William of Orange referred to them as [...] "his braves". Moreover, they were led by officers of renown such as François de la Noue and John Norreys. To confront the Spanish Army, they were detached along the village of Borgerhout, which they had fortified by digging a moat and building an earth rampart around the village, from the bridge of Deurne over the Groot Schijn stream, which flowed into the Scheldt, to the road of Voetweg, which ran parallel to the canal of Herentals. Orange deployed four additional French infantry regiments and Walloon troops from the nearby garrisons of Ath and Termonde behind Borgerhout and under the protection of Antwerp's citadel and moat. The city's <b>civic</b> <b>guard,</b> numbering 80 flags of armed and trained burghers, was ready to defend the city if necessary, but not willing to get out to join the battle nor to allow the regular troops to come within Antwerp. The Spanish soldier and chronicler Alonso Vázquez claimed that Orange's army had, in all, 25,000 men.|$|E

50|$|Born into {{a family}} of painters, he was first trained by his father, Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen. Jacobsz was deeply {{influenced}} by the Mannerist style of fellow Amsterdam painter Jan van Scorel. His painting, The Crossbowmen (1529), was regarded as his most important piece, {{and was the first}} militia portrait in Dutch history. He married Marritgen Gerritsdr. in 1550, and they had two children, Maria Dircksdr. and Jacob Dircksz. Jacob later became a painter as well.

5000|$|To Badens {{has been}} {{attributed}} a [...] (1603 - 1618, Amsterdam Museum). The painting {{falls in the}} genre of the schutterstukken and {{represents one of the}} schutterijen (<b>civic</b> <b>guards)</b> of Amsterdam. In this composition Badens created a sense of space by providing a through view. A striking figure is the drummer in the centre. Occupying a low rank, he would likely not have had enough money to pay for his portrait. Probably the drummer and the many lances and hats in the background were included to create the impression that the whole guard was present in the painting.|$|R
