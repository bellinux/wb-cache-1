Hence, understanding past variability in Southern Ocean intermediate to deep water chemistry and circulation is fundamental to constrain the role of these processes on modulating glacial/interglacial changes in the global carbon cycle. Our study focused on the glacial/interglacial variability in the vertical extent of southwest Pacific Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). We compared carbon and oxygen isotope records from epibenthic foraminifera of sediment cores bathed in modern AAIW and Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW; 943 – 2066 m water depth) to monitor changes in water mass circulation spanning the past 350, 000 years. We propose that pronounced freshwater input by melting sea ice into the glacial AAIW significantly hampered the downward expansion of southwest Pacific AAIW, consistent with climate model results for the Last Glacial Maximum.

40|$|The aim for {{the thesis}} {{is to look at}} the {{performance}} of natural refrigerants in heat pumps while operating in a colder climate. The advantage of using natural refrigerants is that they have significantly lower global warming potential (GWP) in comparison to the synthetic refrigerants i. e. hydro fluorocarbons (HFC) and hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC). Natural refrigerants are becoming common to use as a refrigerant in domestic heat pumps however still most household heat pumps use synthetic refrigerants. Due to the harmful impact of synthetic refrigerants, EU regulations are limiting the use of synthetic refrigerants in the future appliances. Similar steps are being taken by other countries around the globe. The motivation behind this work is to assess the energy requirement in the use of heat pump in <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> using natural and synthetic refrigerants.

40|$|Zonal and meridional surface {{temperature}} gradients {{are considered to}} be determinants of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. However, there has been limited investigation of these gradients as diagnostic aids. Here, the 20 th century variability in the Northern Hemisphere Equator-to-Pole temperature Gradient (EPG) and the Ocean-Land temperature Contrast (OLC) is explored. A secular trend in decreasing EPG and OLC is noted. Decadal and interannual (ENSO-related) variations in the joint distribution of EPG and OLC are identified, hinting at multistable climate states that may be indigenous to the climate or due to changing boundary forcings. The NH circulation patterns for cases in the tails of the joint distribution of EPG and OLC are also seen to be different. Given this context, this paper extends past efforts to develop insights into jet stream dynamics using the Lorenz- 1984 model, which is forced directly and only by EPG and OLC. The joint probability distribution of jet stream and eddy energy, conditional on EPG and OLC scenarios, is investigated. The scenarios correspond to (a) warmer vs. <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions,</b> and (b) polarized ENSO phases. The latter scenario involves the use of a heuristic ENSO model to drive the Lorenz- 1984 model, via a modulation of the EPG or the OLC. As with GCMs, the low-order model reveals that the response to El Niño forcing is not similar to an anthropogenic warming signature. The potential use of EPG and OLC as macro-level indicators of climate change and variability and for comparing results across GCMs and observations is indicated...|$|E

The techniques of fermented milk processing series and milk cream separating series ware shared over ethnic groups among the agro-pastoralists of Ladak. The fermented milk processing series consisted of such techniques as the sour milk processing by adopting lactic fermentation，the fat extraction (butter making by chuming sour milk and butter oil purifying by heating butter) and the protein extraction (cheese making by heating and dehydrating buttermilk).

40|$|Variability in the oceanic {{environment}} of the Arabian Sea region is strongly influenced by the seasonal monsoon cycle of alternating wind directions. Prominent and well studied is the summer monsoon, but much less is known about late Holocene changes in winter monsoon strength with winds from the northeast that drive convective mixing and high surface ocean productivity in the northeastern Arabian Sea. To establish a high-resolution record of winter monsoon variability for the late Holocene, we analyzed alkenone-derived sea surface temperature (SST) variations and proxies of primary productivity (organic carbon and d 15 N) in a well-laminated sediment core from the Pakistan continental margin. Weak winter monsoon intensities off Pakistan are indicated from 400 B. C. to 250 A. D. by reduced productivity and relatively high SST. At about 250 A. D., {{the intensity of the}} winter monsoon increased off Pakistan as indicated by a trend to lower SST. We infer that monsoon conditions were relatively unstable from ~ 500 to 1300 A. D., because primary production and SST were highly variable. Declining SST and elevated biological production from 1400 to 1900 A. D. suggest invigorated convective winter mixing by strengthening winter monsoon circulation, most likely a regional expression of <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> during the Little Ice Age on the Northern Hemisphere.

40|$|Despite {{recent report}} of {{short-term}} cyclicity from Lateglacial–Holocene deposits of several coastal plains worldwide, no precise {{documentation of the}} key factors controlling cyclic facies architecture has been made available by previous work. Detailed sedimentological analysis of a continuously-cored borehole, around the town of Pisa, in western Tuscany, provides evidence for the occurrence of three high-frequency, transgressive–regressive cycles within the post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) transgressive succession (13 – 8 cal. kyr BP) of the Arno incisedvalley fill. These cycles, which are bounded by lateral equivalents of marine flooding surfaces, are 8 – 12 m thick and correspond to small-scale parasequences. Micropalaeontological (foraminifers and ostracods) investigations based upon differentiation of eight microfossil associations, allow to refine the stratigraphic framework, emphasizing subtle changes in palaeosalinity across parasequence boundaries. Diagnostic changes invegetationpatterns, driven by opposite climate conditions, enable precise documentation of parasequence development {{as a function of}} climate change. Pollen spectra invariably show expansions of broadleaved forests atparasequence boundaries, suggesting that rapidshifts towarmer climate conditions accompanied episodes of rapid sea-level rise.

40|$|Knowledge on polar {{amplification}} {{is important}} to relate high latitude climate records to global mean temperature changes. Several studies {{have pointed out that}} the strength of polar amplification in the Northern Hemisphere varies considerably due to the presence of large ice sheets and more sea ice during <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> As a result, the polar amplification in the Northern Hemisphere decreases for warmer climates. In this study, we address the fact that these changes in the Northern Hemisphere also affect the polar amplification in the Southern Hemisphere. We study the Southern and Northern Hemisphere amplification together over the past 5 Million years with the CLIMBER- 2 intermediate complexity model. Radiation, land-ice extent and greenhouse gases are prescribed as forcing. We find that in contrast to the reduction in polar amplification in the Northern Hemisphere, polar amplification in the Southern Hemisphere increases for warmer climates. The amplification decreases in the Northern Hemisphere from 2. 7 during glacial conditions to 1. 6 for a pre-industrial climate. Over the same CO 2 range the Southern Hemispheric polar amplification increases from 1 to 1. 6. This is caused {{by the fact that the}} radiation surplus in the equatorial region needs to be compensated by a relatively stronger energy transport in the Southern direction, while the transport in Northern direction reduces. This reduction in Northern direction is driven by less (land and sea) ice resulting in a smaller meridional gradient in Northern direction and hence a smaller atmospheric transport. As a consequence, the traditional scaled (with LGM temperature) Dome C record needs to be corrected with a maximum of 0. 6 degrees half-way glacial and interglacial conditions, if it is to be interpreted as global mean temperature change indicator. While this changes the amplitude, the phasing of temperature records from the Southern Hemisphere remains unaffected...|$|E

40|$|The Pah Tempe {{hot springs}} {{discharge}} ~ 260 L/s {{of water at}} ~ 40 °C into the Virgin River in the footwall damage zone of the Hurricane fault at Timpoweap Canyon, near Hurricane, Utah, USA. Although these are Na-Cl waters, they actively discharge CO 2 gas and contain signifi cant quantities of CO 2 (~ 34. 6 mmol/kg), predominantly as H 2 CO 3 and HCO 3 –. Because of excellent exposures, Pah Tempe provides an exceptional opportunity to observe the effects of enhanced fracture permeability in an active extensional fault. Pah Tempe waters have been deeply circulated (> 5 km; > 150 °C) into basement rock {{as illustrated by the}} clear water-rock exchange of oxygen isotopes. Waters were probably recharged under <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> than present and therefore have a prolonged subsurface residence. Discharge of both water and gas in the springs correlates to the density of fractures in carbonate rocks above stream level. This observation suggests that clusters of high fracture density in the faultdamage zone act as pathways from the likely regional aquifer, the eolian Queantoweap Sandstone, through the overlying confining unit, the gypsiferous silty Seligman Member of the Kaibab Formation. Mass-balance modeling suggests that the majority of CO 2 discharge is the product of the quantitative dissolution of CO 2 gas at depth within the fault zone. Upon discharge, most of the carbon is released to the surface as dissolved species. It appears that the subsurface production rate of CO 2 is relatively low because Pah Tempe waters are grossly undersaturated in CO 2 at inferred minimum circulation depths and temperatures. Geological and geochemical data also suggest that the CO 2 is dominated by a crustal component complemented by minor mantle contributions...|$|E

The carbon in these waters was derived from a mantle source associated with local Pliocene to Recent basaltic Newer Volcanic Province rocks. Previously reported 3 He/ 4 He (1. 2 – 3. 1 relative to air) and high He/Ne ratios are also consistent {{with the presence of}} magmatic volatiles. Silica contents imply that the waters were never heated above 130 C and that the system is not hydrothermal. The occurrence of carbonated mineral springs in a relatively small region of the Newer Volcanics Province where volcanic activity ceased several thousands of years ago {{may be due to the}} presence of late intrusions combined with deep circulation of water through deeply weathered and fractured Ordovician basement. A region of low seismic velocity under the Daylesford area potentially images those intrusions. Most spring waters have d 18 O and d 2 H values of 8 %to 6 % and 45 % to 35 %, respectively, and lie to the left of the local and global meteoric water lines. The anomalously low d 18 O values results from CO 2 exsolution at low temperatures which strongly partitions 18 O into the gas. The lack of waters lying to the right of the local meteoric water line also implies that water–rock interaction at elevated temperatures did not occur. The d 2 H values are lower than contemporary meteoric water, suggesting that the waters may have recharged under <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> several thousand years ago. The local Ordovician rocks are gold bearing. The present spring system is cold and would not efficiently transport Au.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} Holocene sedimentary {{records from}} two lakes in the Lofoten Islands, northern Norway to evaluate environmental changes during the Holocene related to northern North Atlantic climate dynamics. The lakes {{are located in}} different geomorphological settings, and thus provide a contrast in their response to regional climate change. Environmental changes at both lakes were interpreted based on magnetic susceptibility, organic-matter flux, C/N, d 13 Corg, Ti concentrations, and mass accumulation rates. Chronologies were established using 16 AMS radiocarbon dates, and average deposition rates in both environments are higher than 0. 2 mm/year throughout the Holocene. At Vikjordvatnet, sedimentary geochemical properties define three distinct phases of sedimentation related to changes in aquatic productivity and gradual landscape development. Following deglaciation, during the early Holocene (11. 6 – 7. 2 ka), aquatic productivity increased and the landscape stabilized as regional temperatures increased in response to higher summer insolation and increasing inflow of warm Atlantic water into the Norwegian Sea. Centennial-scale intervals of decreased organic-matter flux, from 10. 9 to 10. 2 ka and 9. 2 to 8. 0 ka, record episodes of instability during the early Holocene. These may represent regional cooling events related to freshwater forcing and a slowdown of the northward transport of warm water into the North Atlantic. During the mid-Holocene (7. 2 – 4. 8 ka) organic-matter properties show less variability and {{the timing of this}} phase corresponds with the regional Holocene thermal maximum. The late Holocene sediments (4. 8 ka–present) record a transition to <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> The record from Fiskebølvatnet captures periodic changes in clastic input related to runoff and exhibits highfrequency variations over the last 9. 5 ka.

Therefore, this LPS {{qualifies as a}} test candidate for the potential of temporal high-resolution geochemical data obtained X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning of discrete samplesproviding a fast and non-destructive tool for determining the element composition. The geochemical data is first contextualized to existing proxy data such as magnetic susceptibility (MS) and organic carbon (Corg) and then aggregated to element log ratios characteristic for weathering intensity [LOG (Ca/Sr), LOG (Rb/Sr), LOG (Ba/Sr), LOG (Rb/K) ] and dust provenance [LOG (Ti/Zr), LOG (Ti/Al), LOG (Si/Al) ]. Generally, an interpretation of rock magnetic particles is challenged in western Europe, where not only magnetic enhancement but also depletion plays a role. Our data indicates leaching and top-soil erosion induced MS depletion at the Schwalbenberg II LPS. Besides weathering, LOG (Ca/Sr) is susceptible for secondary calcification. Thus, also LOG (Rb/Sr) and LOG (Ba/Sr) are shown {{to be influenced by}} calcification dynamics. Consequently, LOG (Rb/K) seems to be the most suitable weathering index identifying the Sinzig Soils S 1 and S 2 as the most pronounced paleosols for this site. Sinzig Soil S 3 is enclosed by gelic gleysols and in contrast to S 1 and S 2 only initially weathered pointing to <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> Also the Remagen Soils are characterized by subtle to moderate positive excursions in the weathering indices. Comparing the Schwalbenberg II LPS with the nearby Eifel Lake Sediment Archive (ELSA) and other more distant German, Austrian and Czech LPS while discussing time and climate as limiting factors for pedogenesis, we suggest that the lithologically determined paleosols are in-situ soil formations. The provenance indices document a Zr-enrichment at the transition from the Ahrgau to the Hesbaye Subformation.

Paleontological, mineralogical and geochemical data combined with mass-balance calculation allowed {{the identification of}} modern, diagenetic and eogenetic stages of authigenic precipitation within the sedimentary pile. Stratigraphic log contains six clay- and sand-rich sequences, some associated with freshwater ostracods. delta C- 13, delta O- 18 values and Sr isotopic ratios of whole-rock samples and ostracods indicate that the Montrond-les-Bains upper sequence (8 to 175 mbs) is a continental lake system that recorded continental weather condition (15 to 25 degrees C) during the upper Miocene time. Geochemical changes permit the estimation of variations of evaporation-inflow changes (E/I: 8 to 75 % and delta O- 18 (rainfall) - 6 to - 8 parts per thousand) associated with two sequences. delta O- 18 and E/I progressive changes were related to runoff to <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> large E/I values in below 100 mbs {{are associated with the}} appearance of authigenic calcite and dolomite precipitation. Euhedral dolomite seems to be related to desiccation period that induced capillary pumping of water undersaturated with respect to calcite but saturated for dolomite. The lower part of the Middle Miocene sedimentary series (175 to 300 mbs) hosts continental deposits with scarce fossil, a larger proportion of dolomite and massive pyrite levels related to mixed eogenetic and diagenetic precipitation. Scarce preserved "eogenetic levels" with unrealistic E/I ratios suggest either delta O- 18 values similar to the upper section but with temperature lower than 15 C, or a similar temperature but very low delta O- 18 (rainfall). Calculated delta O- 18 (H 2 O) values have to be as low as - 15 parts per thousand. delta O- 18 (H 2 O) values are similar to present-day melted snow. This stable isotope suggests episodes of regional warming melting surrounding snow, and able to mobilize as well as deposit thick sand levels.

40|$|Three consecutive, time-equivalent valley fills of Lateglacial-Holocene age (13 to 8 cal kyr BP) were {{identified}} in the Tuscan coastal plain, across a 30 km long transect approximately parallel to the present Tyrrhenian Sea shoreline. From South to North, the Arno valley fill is 35 - 40 m thick and 5 - 7 km wide, the Serchio valley fill is 15 - 20 m thick and 7 - 8 km wide, while the Camaiore valley fill is 20 - 30 m thick and 8 - 10 km wide. The three valley fills display remarkably similar facies architecture, with thin basal fluvial deposits overlain {{by a variety of}} transgressive, mud-dominated coastal plain and estuarine deposits. The valley bodies deeply incise and crosscut sand and gravel-prone fluvial-channel deposits assigned to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and are capped by a sheet-like, late transgressive succession of shoreline sands grading vertically into offshore clays. Beneath present Arno River, the valley body consists internally of three superposed millennial-scale cycles bounded by flooding surfaces (parasequences). These cycles display a similar facies architecture, with sharp-based central/outer estuarine clays grading upward into inner-estuary, bay-head delta and coastal-plain deposits. Overall, the three parasequences display an aggradational, rather than retrogradational stacking pattern, which is interpreted to reflect the complex relation between eustatic sea-level rise and sediment supply during the post-LGM transgression. Diagnostic changes in vegetation patterns, driven by opposite climate conditions, enable documentation of parasequence development as a function of climate change. Pollen spectra invariably show expansions of broad-leaved forests at parasequence boundaries, suggesting that rapid shifts to warmer climate conditions accompanied episodes of sea-level rise. In contrast, stillstand phases saw the development of cold-temperate communities, suggesting transition to temporary <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> Stratigraphic architecture beneath the Lateglacial-Holocene valley bodies shows that the coastal system of Tuscany experienced multiple cycles of fluvial incision and subsequent valley filling in response to late Quaternary sea-level fluctuations. Below the LGM fluvial deposits, an older set of estuarine clays is observed at depths ranging from 40 to 90 m.

The acidic agents present in natural acid rain precipitation, H 2 SO 4, HCl, HNO 3, CH 3 COOH and mixture of all the acids, “Acid mix”, were tested. The initial stages of acid weathering involve, apart from chemical dissolution, particularly intense physical detachment of rock particles (granular disintegration) significantly contributing to the total mass loss. Travertine {{was found to be}} most prone to salt crystallization damage and to acid weathering, and these features should be taken into account especially in external architectural usage of this stone in <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> and polluted urban atmosphere. ...|$|R

Furthermore, <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> have a degenerating effect on stormwater systems and road constructions. Porous asphalt {{has been used}} as a wearing course on highways and in porous pavement constructions all around the world. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the function of porous asphalt in <b>cold</b> <b>climates.</b> Measurements of the draining function of porous asphalt were carried out in a climate room with adjustable temperature in the range - 10 C to + 20 C. At freezing point, the infiltration capacity of porous asphalt was approximately 50 % of the infiltration capacity at + 20 C. When the porous asphalt was exposed to alternating melting and freezing during 2 days, conditions similar to the snowmelt period, the infiltration capacity was reduced by approximately 90 %. Based on the results of this study and previous studies, the infiltration capacity of porous asphalt was estimated to be 1 - 5 mm/min for snowmelt conditions. Validerad; 2000; 20070208 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|The {{stack effect}} creates {{uncontrolled}} vertical air movement in buildings. This air movement over the building envelope and internal {{parts of the}} building creates noise and draft through gaps of doors and increases energy consumption. The wind and mechanical ventilation may also have a pronounced effect on the air pressure conditions {{and the movement of}} the air along the shafts of the building. The objective {{of this study was to}} find solutions to minimize the stack effect. The effects of air tightness, air leakage distributions, and outdoor environmental conditions on air pressure conditions and energy consumption in a high-rise residential building were simulated in <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> The stack effect is possible to prevent with spatial arrangements and improved air tightness. Based on the analysis carried out, internal air tightness is playing the major role in the control of the stack effect. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{recent report}} of millennial-scale cyclicity from Lateglacial-Holocene {{deposits}} of severa! coastal plains worldwide, no precise documentation ofthe key fac- ' tors controlling cyclic facies architecture {{has been made}} available by previous work. Integrated sedimentologic, micropalaentologic, palynologic and geochemical analyses of a 56 m long core (Sl) from the Pisa area (Tuscany, ltaly). allow reconstruction of a high-resolution sequence-stratigraphic framework for the transgressive systems tract (TST) ofthe post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) succession ofthe Arno valley fili. At this location, the post-LGM succession is about 54 m thick and its lower part (early TST) includes a 35 m thick succession of alternating inner- and central- estuarine deposits (sensu Dalrymple et al. 1992). Three high-frequency depositional cycles, about 8 - 12 m thick and spanning intervals of ti me of about 1500 years each, are identified in core Sl. These cycles can be physically traced throughout the valley body, grading seaward to outer estuarine deposits (Amorosi et al. 2008). Radiocarbon dates constrain the age ofthe valley fili between 13 and 8 cal. kyr BP. Around 8 cal. kyr BP, transgressive sedimentation spread onto the interfluves and a coastal environment established ali throughout the study area (late TST). The three small-scale cycles are bounded by latera! equivalents of marine flooding surfaces (parasequences) and display a characteristic internai architecture, with a thin transgressive central-estuarine succession overlain by comparatively thicker, regressive inner-estuarine deposits. Differentiation of eight microfaunal (benthic foraminifer and ostracod) associations, allows to refi ne the stratigraphic framework, emphasizing subtle changes in palaeosalinity across parasequence boundaries. Diagnostic changes in vegetation patterns, driven by opposite climate conditions, enable precise documentation of parasequence development {{as a function of}} climate change around the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Pollen spectra invariably show expansions of broad-leaved forests at parasequence boundaries, suggesting that rapid shifts to warmer climate conditions accompanied episodes of rapid sea-level rise. In contrast, sti llstand phases saw the development of cold-temperate communities (upper parts of parasequences), suggesting transition to temporary <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions.</b> Geochemical characterization of the three parasequences allows detailed recon struction of palaoenvironmental changes within the valley, as a function of small-scale sea-level fluctuations. Specifically, peaks in [Cr/Ba]/[Mg/Al] at the onset ofbrackish conditions (lower parts of parasequences) are interpreted to reflect a major sediment contribution from the Arno River to the estuary during transgressive pulsations. In contrast, sediment provenance from Serchio River is recorded by the upper parts ofparasequences. This suggests increasing sediment contribution from atributary incised valley at times of sea-level stillstand, accompanying coastal progradation...|$|E
40|$|The aim for {{the thesis}} {{is to look at}} the {{performance}} of natural refrigerants in heat pumps while operating in a colder climate. The advantage of using natural refrigerants is that they have significantly lower global warming potential (GWP) in comparison to the synthetic refrigerants i. e. hydro fluorocarbons (HFC) and hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC). Natural refrigerants are becoming common to use as a refrigerant in domestic heat pumps however still most household heat pumps use synthetic refrigerants. Due to the harmful impact of synthetic refrigerants, EU regulations are limiting the use of synthetic refrigerants in the future appliances. Similar steps are being taken by other countries around the globe. The motivation behind this work is to assess the energy requirement in the use of heat pump in <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> using natural and synthetic refrigerants. For the study, climatic data from Karasjok (69 ° 28 ′ 55 ″N 25 ° 6 ′ 18 ″E) is taken into consideration (eKLIMA, 2014). Karasjok is located in Finnmark, county of Norway. The average temperature in Karasjok over the year can be as low as - 1. 45 ºC (from the stats of year 2012). The heat pump analysis was performed on three natural refrigrants, R 744 (carbondioxide – CO 2), R 717 (ammonia – NH 3), R 290 (propane – C 3 H 8) and one synthetic refrigerant R 410 A (a 50 / 50 mixture of HFCs: R 32 (difluoromethane – CH 2 F 2) and R 125 (pentafluoroethane – CHF 2 CF 3)). R 290 and R 744 have better performance in colder climatic condition within different analysis segments in single stage as well as two stages heat pump cycles. This shows that natural refrigerants are able to replace the synthetic refrigerants when considering the performance in the colder climate. Analysis also showed that a single stage R 290 heat pump is able to cover up to 90 % of the heating and hot water supply need on annual basis (data taken for years 2012 and 2013). The study was conducted in CoolPack©, MS Excel® sheet (Kolsaker, 2013) and log p-h diagrams. The analysis of refrigerants close to transcritical pressure was performed in CoolPack©. The analysis of two-stage refrigeration cycle was performed using CoolPack© and MS Excel® (Kolsaker, 2013). The results were compared using log p-h diagrams. The conclusion of the study is that with the use of natural refrigerants, it is possible to save energy. In addition, natural refrigerants have far lower environmental impact than its synthetic counterparts. Therefore, it is suitable to use natural refrigerants in replacement of synthetic refrigerants...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} 3 D-seismic survey {{from the}} Dutch offshore sector {{has been interpreted}} and subsequently correlated with existing regional seismo-stratigraphic concepts derived from conventional 2 D-seismic data sets. The interpreted 13 seismic units have been related to a newly established chrono-stratigraphic framework [Kuhlmann et al., 2006 a, b. Chronostratigraphy of Late Neogene sediments in the southern North Sea Basin and paleoenvironmental interpretations. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 239, 426 - 455; Integrated chronostratigraphy of the Pliocene-Pleistocene interval {{and its relation to}} the regional stratigraphical stages in the southern North Sea region. Netherlands Journal of Geosciences-Geologie en Mijnbouw, 85 (1), 19 - 35] resulting in up-dated age control for the seismic units. The generation of amplitude maps, time slices and isopach maps from the 3 D-seismic data enabled detailed spatial and temporal reconstruction regarding the paleoenvironmental and climatological development as depicted by Kuhlmann et al. [2006 a. Chronostratigraphy of Late Neogene sediments in the southern North Sea Basin and paleoenvironmental interpretations. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 239, 426 - 455]. The lowermost seismic units S 1 -S 4 comprise condensed Middle Miocene to Piacencian sediments, deposited under warm open marine conditions. These sediments show a uniform seismic facies of low-amplitude reflectors. The boundary of seismic unit S 4 -S 5 (around 2. 6 Ma) delineates a shift towards generally <b>colder</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> that are connected to the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Seismic unit S 5 includes alternations of warmer and colder periods. During warmer periods, bottom currents generated elongated structures (2. 5 - 4 km long, 300 - 500 m wide) on the horizon display. These layers show as well shallow gas accumulations with a more regional extent and are related to coarser-grained sediments sealed by clayey sediments of the cold phases. A homogenous seismic facies is characteristic for the colder periods. Within seismic units S 6 and S 7, internal fore set structures display the regressional trend related to the cooling of this interval. Seismic units S 8 -S 11 display a pattern of unoriented lineaments which was probably caused by icebergs drifting into the North Sea and souring the sea floor. This finding is in accordance with the shallow marine, arctic conditions of this interval. Within these units a bright spot of 3 by 7 km in size, is interpreted to result from shallow gas accumulation related to a grounded iceberg. This feature represents another, more local area of gas accumulation that is closely related to iceberg activity within the study area. The uppermost seismic units S 12 and S 13 belong to a fluvial, paralic paleo-environment, that is characterised by aggradational seismic reflectors.

This profile analyses the struggling process and revitalization initiatives of Harbin, {{which was the first}} city established after the liberation of China, featuring the largest land area and highest latitude among all Chinese-cities. The remarkable history of urban and industrial development once made Harbin the cradle of manufacturing in China, strongly supported by national government with concentration of SOEs. The city however has been suffering during the transition to a market economy. Its transition is painfully challenged by the strong socialist legacies of SOEs. This paper emphasizes that the new initiatives of Harbin, based on local endowments, <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> and geolocation, demonstrate great potential for successful revitalization.

40|$|One of the, Glaciological {{descriptions}} of Greenland and Antarctica {{were among the}} most outstanding events in the geographical investigations of the Earth, made in the 20 th century. They have shown that glaciations, traces of which were found in Europe and North America {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century, waxed and waned during the Pleistocene repeatedly and were synchronous with the expansions and reductions of the Antarctic ice sheet. Further analyses of the sea-bed sediments confirmed the fact of such synchronicity, and revealed that the durations of the Pleistocene glacial cycles (on the order of one hundred thousand years) were significantly longer then approximately forty thousand years alternations of the warm and <b>cold</b> <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> during the preceding Pliocene.
