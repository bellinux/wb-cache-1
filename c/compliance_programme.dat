40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the development and}} implementation of anti-corruption ethics and <b>compliance</b> <b>programme</b> in the African business environment. In the past decade, an international legal framework has been developed to tackle corruption both in public and private sectors. This framework includes the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), which entered into force in 2005, and the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, which entered into force in 1999. These instruments mandate that State Parties must criminalise and punish a variety of corrupt practices. Relevant domestic laws have a direct impact on business, especially in States Parties instruments that require the establishment of liability of legal persons for corrupt acts. The African Union Convention also requires States Parties to establish mechanisms to encourage participation by the private sector in the fight against unfair competition, respect of the tender procedures and property rights. The paper details various steps needed to efficiently and effectively implement anti-corruption ethics and <b>compliance</b> <b>programme</b> in the African context. The first part of the paper develops the primary objective of the corruption risk assessment which is to better understand the risk exposure so that informed risk management decisions may be taken. A structured approach for how enterprises could conduct an anti-corruption risk assessment will be outlined in this first section. The author argued in this same first section that each enterprise’s own risk assessment exercise is unique, depending on that enterprise’s industry, size, location, and other factors inherent to that organisation. The second part of the paper drafts the development and the implementation of an anti-corruption programme. The paper concludes by stating that an anti-corruption and <b>compliance</b> <b>programme</b> is not a panacea for fighting all the ills on corruption and fraud problems that a certain country or company is facing...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature and}} impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) involve major {{challenges}} {{for the management of}} liability issues in the workplace of the future. Risk management of these liability issues also needs to take account of other emerging trends in the workplace. The benefit of general regulatory regimes has been that they can be readily applied to novel situations to protect consumers and the community. When the public interest has required it, specific legislation has the capacity directly to address unsuitable business practices involving the use of ICTs and to provide appropriate consumer protection. Consistent with international objectives, a central element of the regulation of the future workplace environment will be the protection of individual human rights, particularly the right to privacy. The application of human rights concepts at a domestic level raises particular challenges in relation to the regulation of ICTs.

40|$|Judging by only {{economic}} incentives, Malaysian {{financial institutions}} (particularly banks) should completely ignore the Competition Act. The {{data show that}} Malaysian banks probably benefit from anti-competitive behaviour. Political and family connections likely facilitate such behaviour. Given that the Malaysian Competition Commission will likely lack the resources to investigate and sanction anti-competitive behaviour in Malaysia’s banking industry – the banks’ best response to the Act probably consists of ignoring it. Maximum fines of 10 million ringgit and revenue-tied penalties of only 10 % of worldwide revenue mean that banks still have strong incentives to engage in anti-competitive behaviour and to pay any low fine that might be levied. The best <b>compliance</b> <b>programme</b> for banks in Malaysia likely consists of actions that avoid detection rather than detecting and preventing anti-competitive behaviour. Private rights of action are unlikely to provide any stronger economic incentives for Malaysian banks to adopt strong antitrust compliance programmes and internal audit programmes.

There has been fairly extensive research into competition law compliance in Australia, and in particular, a Report based on a recent ACCC Enforcement and Compliance Survey noted that:- 'Those who have interacted with or been investigated by the ACCC generally report themselves to be more compliant. ' Accordingly, in this research we sought to ascertain the extent to which an infringement finding by the OFT altered awareness of, attitudes to, and methods of compliance with competition law.

40|$|LL. M. (Corporate Law) Commercial transgressions have a {{significantly}} {{negative impact on}} {{a large number of}} people, entire organisations, economies and society as a whole. These types of transgressions should be studied to arrive at appropriate and effective responses, which both prevent them from occurring and redress the harm caused when they do; including determining who should be held responsible. The individual liability approach to corporate transgressions only recognises individual liability and therefore proposes that a corporation cannot be held liable. The notion that juristic persons such as corporations cannot commit transgressions is however no longer followed in a number of jurisdictions. An increase in corporate crime has led many countries to a realisation that a more allencompassing approach to corporate liability is required. An enterprise liability approach holds that the corporation itself deserves to be held liable for its offences and commensurately punished. The accountability model goes a step further and proposes that all the individuals and parties (including the corporation) to a transgression should be allocated responsibility. There are broadly two approaches to attributing blame to a corporation, these being either on a nominalist or on a realist basis. On a nominalist basis the corporation’s liability arises or is derived from the actions of individuals within the corporation. The aggregation doctrine is based on the notion that the liability of a corporation is based on a derivative but collective responsibility. On a realist basis a corporation can be held liable in its own right, separate from any individual’s fault. Unlike with a nominalist/derivative liability approach, in terms of a realist or organisational model approach, a corporation can be held directly liable for its own acts and omissions. An organisational approach to corporate liability is seen as a workable and practical solution to holding modern corporations accountable for wrongdoing. The practices of levying administrative penalties and criminal prosecution are both widely used types of sanctions to corporate transgressions, although there are other forms of sanctions. To be effective a combination of sanctions may be warranted. If we are to focus on both deterrence and compliance in effectively responding to commercial transgressions, we cannot ignore the importance of effective and well-implemented <b>compliance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The role that regulatory agencies can play in promoting an understanding of the value of strong corporate codes and effective <b>compliance</b> <b>programmes</b> should be harnessed [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Cartels, {{which are}} {{considered}} {{as the most}} harmful anticompetitive practice, continue to exist in many sectors {{of the global economy}} in spite of the severe sanctions regularly imposed on the cartelists by the competition authorities worldwide. This suggests that the approach to antitrust enforcement requires rethinking, and the necessity to move beyond the traditional enforcement approach, to creating a pro-compliance culture in companies.  The paper suggests that robust <b>compliance</b> <b>programmes,</b> voluntarily implemented by companies to prevent infringements of competition law could be considered as one of the major elements of cartel deterrence. The paper reviews the pioneering experience of UK competition authorities in rewarding infringing companies for their efforts to comply with competition law – by reducing fines for committed violations, such as participation in cartels. The paper analyses the UK approach through the prism of its possible application in Russia, where antimonopoly laws continue to actively respond to the development of the best international competition practice, including cartel deterrence. The relative position of officials in the Russian antimonopoly body, the FAS, with respect to advocating antimonopoly compliance in Russia is presented in this work through an interview conducted by the author of this paper. The work formulates a three-step plan, embracing particular measures to develop competition compliance culture in Russia. </p...|$|R
