Mega Man X {{has also been}} made available for purchase on the Virtual Console service in Japan and North America in 2011 for the Wii, and later in Europe in 2012, {{as well as for}} the Wii U in 2013 and the New Nintendo 3DS in 2016. The game was ported to the Android operating system in Japan as a free download on November 18, 2011. Another remake of Mega Man X was released on the Apple iOS (iPhone and iPod Touch) on December 21, 2011. This version is based on the mobile phone version of the game and features touch controls, Game Center support, and a challenge mode with 80 levels. However, this version removed extra life power-ups, and separated the levels into chunks by black screen transitions, as opposed to the <b>continuous</b> <b>scrolling</b> of the original. Weapon and armor upgrades could also be purchased with actual money to ease the game's difficulty.|$|E

50|$|The Orbita mouse is a 2.4Ghz zero lag wireless, USB mouse. The {{cylindrical}} design {{allows the}} mouse to be spun 360 degrees for <b>continuous</b> <b>scrolling</b> or jogging, replacing the jerky up-down finger movement required by a traditional scroll wheel and enhancing user control. The mouse employs an electronic compass to detect rotation and maintain its orientation, and an optical sensor to detect normal mouse movement. The soft silicone shell encases all the buttons, aiding the user’s ability to grip the mouse. The mouse {{is powered by}} a Lithium Ion rechargeable battery. The design is intended to be ergonomic and enhance efficiency and productivity of users.|$|E
5000|$|In first-person shooter (FPS) games, {{the scroll}} wheel is usually set to change weapons. Because of this some gaming mice, such as Logitech G500, {{implement}} a locking feature that lets the mouse switch between scrolling in steps (needed for gaming) and <b>continuous</b> <b>scrolling</b> (good for web browsing). The scroll wheel is also sometimes {{used to control}} the zoom of scoped weapons and binoculars. FPS games {{with an emphasis on}} realism may choose to use the wheel for changing between stances or adjusting the range settings on iron sights. Since the introduction of tilting scroll-wheels, many FPS games use the left-right motion of the scroll wheel to cause the player to lean left and right. [...] A less common use is to use the mouse wheel to adjust the player's speed of movement.|$|E

5000|$|A codex (...) (from the Latin caudex for [...] "trunk of a tree" [...] or {{block of}} wood, book), plural codices (...) , {{is a book}} {{constructed}} {{of a number of}} sheets of paper, vellum, papyrus, or similar materials, with hand-written contents. The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge, and using a cover thicker than the sheets. Some codices are continuously folded like a concertina. The alternative to paged codex format for a long document is the <b>continuous</b> <b>scroll.</b> Examples of folded codices include the Maya codices. Sometimes people use the term for a book-style format, including modern printed books but excluding folded books.|$|R

50|$|The {{first game}} solely {{developed}} by Just Add Water {{and published by}} Oddworld Inhabitants, New 'n' Tasty! is a retelling of Abe's Oddysee with 2.5D visuals. The game remained a side-scrolling platformer, but has done away with the original's flip screen presentation in favour of smooth <b>continuous</b> <b>scrolling</b> and a dynamic camera for zooming in and out based on {{the movements of the}} player and the scenery. The story is completely identical to Oddysee and new FMV sequences have been added to recreations of the originals to further illustrate the plot. The soundtrack too has been recreated from scratch, with additional pieces added. New ’n’ Tasty! debuted on PS4 in July 2014, as part of an exclusive release with Sony in exchange for giving Oddworld Inhabitants their own booth at E3 in 2013, and centre stage at Sony's 2013 E3 presentation. Versions for Linux, Microsoft Windows and OS X were released on February 25, 2015 while the Xbox One version was released on March 27, 2015. The PlayStation 3 version was released on April 21, 2015 and the PlayStation Vita version was released on January 19, 2016. The Wii U version was released on February 11. The same day the Vita version was released, Oddworld Inhabitants and publisher Limited Run Games announced they would run a series of limited edition physical copies of New 'n' Tasty! for the Vita, marking the first physical copies of an Oddworld Inhabitants game since Stranger's Wrath released to the original Xbox in 2005. On 29 March 2016, Limited Run Games revealed there will also be a limited edition physical version for the PS4.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2012, Oddworld Inhabitants {{announced}} that the game {{will not be a}} remaster of the original PlayStation title, but a remake built from scratch with 2D gameplay and 3D graphics, using the original as a blueprint.The remake was described by series' creator Lorne Lanning as [...] "basically Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee being redone in a 3D physics engine as a 2D side-scrolling platformer," [...] stating the developers [...] "are not trying to reinvent any wheels."Images tweeted by the developers and first footage released at Eurogamer Expo on September 30, 2012 revealed the platformer will be presented in 2.5D (2D gameplay with 3D visuals) and has abandoned the original's flip screen aspect in favor of <b>continuous</b> <b>scrolling,</b> which dramatically changes the gameplay. In the original, the player could reset a screen's puzzle or AI, by returning to the previous screen and then re-entering the current one. Now, with realtime screen streaming, the developers needed to find a new way to reset enemy AI. However, Gilray has stated that they have discussed the idea of giving players the choice of playing the updated game with the original's style of flip screens. Originally, he explained that the game will have two modes: 'Classic Mode', [...] "which plays like the original game does, but still scrolls;" [...] and 'New 'n' Tasty Mode', which would have had control refinements and puzzle tweaks; though says that players will recognize screenshots identical to the original game and wants players to play both modes, and has included a platinum trophy in the PlayStation versions for completion of both modes. In {{the final version of the}} game, the idea of a New 'n' Tasty mode was scrapped and was replaced with three difficulty levels, Easy, Normal and Hard. Each difficulty level would have different amount of health whereas the Hard mode would include one hit kill from Sligs, Slogs, Scrabs, Paramties and Slingshot Mudokons.|$|E

5000|$|In re-releasing Oddworld's earlier {{games on}} the digital marketplace, Lanning was able to have an open {{dialogue}} with the fans. He found that audiences were asking for what would eventually become New 'n' Tasty! They wanted to see Abe in the classic 2D style of platformer game because gameplay was simpler, and players [...] "don’t want to spend time steering around the world making sure they’re looking in the right direction... {{they just want to}} absorb the experience and have tight controls, and... that rotoscope quality of a lifelike guy." [...] And with most of the horsepower of the game engine being saved by not needing to create player movement in 3D, it's allowed the developers to bring the quality of the environments and backgrounds into that of lifelike sets while still running at 60 frames per second. Stewart Gilray also confirmed the side-scrolling market still had a lot of life in it, and with their Unity engine bringing realtime scenery to life, it made sense. Unity was also the best option when choosing engines because it cost $5.000 for licensing, as opposed to their previous choice which would have cost $100,000. If they were to upgrade the game using modern technology, they wanted to make sure the game would use <b>continuous</b> <b>scrolling</b> instead of fixed flip screens, it had to have realtime dynamic lighting and realtime 3D visuals instead of pre-rendered bitmaps, it had to fix things they felt were wrong with the original game, and it had to add elements that were included in Stranger HD, such as difficulty levels, but maintain the original's difficulty and goriness. Oddworld Inhabitants and Just Add Water decided to use 3D technology while [...] "staying true to that platforming nature on the controls level" [...] and only if they could maintain the same experience players had with the original, to satisfy the fans of 2D games in a way that Lanning termed [...] "neo-stalgia". He defined neo-stalgia as a way of using newer technology to bring back nostalgic forms of gameplay. Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty! was the demonstration of that neo-stalgia - it utilizes new 3D technology, yet is still a 2D platformer - now commonly referred to in the video game industry as 2.5D. Just Add Water used the source code from the original game, and its sequel, as a base to produce the game.|$|E

500|$|<b>Continuous</b> vine <b>scrolls</b> in a {{great variety}} of designs of the same general type as the central motif, with few leaves and round fruits, were very common in {{slightly}} later religious Anglo-Saxon art, and are often combined with interlace in the same work, especially on Anglo-Saxon crosses, for example the Bewcastle Cross and the Easby Cross now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. [...] One face of the fragmentary silver cover of the portable altar also recovered from Cuthbert's coffin has a similar combination of elements, with both areas of interlace and, in the four corners, a simple plant motif with a central bud or leaf and a spiral shoot on either side. [...] The combination of different types of ornament within a panelled framework is highly typical of Northumbrian art, above all the Lindisfarne Gospels. [...] Interlace may well have still been believed to have some quasi-magical protective power, which seems to have been its function in pre-Christian Germanic art. [...] The vine motif here differs from the common <b>continuous</b> <b>scroll</b> type in that the stems cross over each other twice on each side, but crossing stems are also seen on the upper north face of the Bewcastle Cross and a cross in the church at Hexham. [...] Meyer Schapiro compares the motif with one in an initial in the later Book of Kells. [...] It was suggested by Berthe van Regemorter that in the St Cuthbert Gospel this design represents Christ (as the central bud) and the Four Evangelists as the grapes, following , [...] "I am the vine, ye are the branches", but this idea has been treated with caution by other scholars.|$|R

After showing that dwell time {{and number of}} visits are not appropriate for predicting revisitations in documents, we model the high-level reading task as a sequence of reading blocks and recognize long-distance scrolls as separators between them. A long-distance scroll {{is defined as a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>scrolling</b> action which causes the document to be navigated beyond a one-page distance. We propose a new technique, called the Head-Tail (HT) algorithm, to generate bookmarks at the head and the tail of reading blocks, whose validity is quantitatively verified by log data analysis. Two studies were conducted to investigate this HT implicit bookmarking technique. The first is a controlled experiment that compared the HT algorithm to the widely used simple recency algorithm for generating implicit bookmarks, in terms of revisit coverage ability and distance between bookmarks. Results showed the HT algorithm to be superior in both measures. The second is a more ecologically valid study that investigated implicit bookmarking performance in real reading tasks, using Adobe Reader integrated with our implicit bookmarking technique. Results showed that our technique covered 85. 1 % of revisitations and saved users from 66. 0 % of long-distance scrolling actions. We end with a discussion of how to encourage users to use implicit bookmarks...|$|E

It used graphics for {{representation of the}} structural properties: hierarchical decomposition, interconnection structure, {{and structure of the}} interfaces. The decomposition and interconnection structures are described by block diagrams. Low level modules are described by equations. Much effort has been devoted to the design of an integrated language both for analog control and logic control. It resulted in powerful module and interconnection concepts that make it possible to develop libraries of modules for different applications. The user can build systems from such libraries without having to deal with details of their implementation. Documentation can be obtained at different levels of detail.

5000|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Kamenetz entered Yale University, {{where he}} gave {{readings}} and published with poets Alan Bernheimer and Kit Robinson (later associated with the Language poets), and studied with Ted Berrigan. His first book, The Missing Jew (Dryad, 1979, {{was influenced by the}} Objectivist poets, especially Charles Reznikoff, whom he met at Stanford in 1973. Both poets relied on plain diction and paid attention to American Jewish identity and culture. Another enduring influence was Robert Duncan (poet), whom Kamenetz also met at that time, and later interviewed extensively about Duncan's interest in the Zohar and Jewish mysticism. Kamenetz typed The Missing Jew on a single <b>continuous</b> <b>scroll,</b> and the poems developed as commentaries on previous poems, as in the Jewish literary tradition of midrash. Joel Lewis, writing in the Forward, said, [...] "Mr. Kamenetz recovers Jewishness as a field for discourse, not sentimentalized imagery. In direct and imaginative address, he puts the question of Jewishness under discussion with large parts of honesty and humor." [...] Kamenetz continued to add to the book, and a new edition, nearly double in size, appeared in 1991 as The Missing Jew: New and Selected Poems (Time Being, 1991). His poems were anthologized in Voices Within the Ark (Avon, 1979), Jewish American Poetry (Brandeis, 2000), Jewish in America (U. of Michigan Press), Bearing the Mystery (Eerdmans), Best Jewish Writing 2003 (Jossey Bass), Blood to Remember: American Poets on the Holocaust (Time Being), Telling and Remembering: a Century of American Jewish Poetry (Beacon, 1997), and The Prairie Schooner Anthology of Contemporary Jewish American Writing (Nebraska, 1998). In The Lowercase Jew (Northwestern, 2003), Kamenetz adopted a form of verse essay to address issues of literary anti-Semitism. The title poem speaks to T.S. Eliot's use of a lower case spelling of [...] "jew" [...] in his poetry; another retells an incident in which [...] "Allen Ginsberg Forgives Ezra Pound on Behalf of the Jews." [...] Kamenetz's most recent book of poetry, [...] "To Die Next To You" [...] (Six Gallery Press, 2013) derives primarily from his experience with dreamwork and is a collaboration with artist Michael Hafftka.|$|R
