5|$|Although no <b>contemporaneous</b> {{or nearly}} <b>contemporaneous</b> sources made mention of any further children, Charles may have fathered two daughters, {{according}} to historians Zsuzsa Teke and Gyula Kristó. Zsuzsa Teke writes {{that they were}} born to Mary of Bytom, but the nearly <b>contemporaneous</b> Peter of Zittau wrote that she had died childless. Gyula Kristó proposes that a miniature in the Illuminated Chronicle, which depicts Elisabeth of Poland and five children, implies that {{she gave birth to}} Charles's two daughters, because Kristó identifies two of the three children standing on her right as daughters. The elder of Charles's two possible daughters, Catherine, who was born in the early 1320s, was the wife of Henry II, Duke of Świdnica. Their only daughter, Anne, grew up in the Hungarian royal court after her parents' death, implying that Charles and Elisabeth of Poland were her grandparents. Historian Kazimierz Jasiński says that Elisabeth, the wife of BoleslausII of Troppau, was also Charles's daughter. If she was actually Charles's daughter, she must have been born in about 1330, according to Kristó.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{there were}} {{detailed}} <b>contemporaneous</b> histories on Caligula, {{but they are}} now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula. Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the <b>contemporaneous</b> historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus {{was a friend of}} Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation. Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{scarcity}} of <b>contemporaneous</b> attestations for Menkauhor, modern Egyptologists consider his reign to have been perhaps {{eight or nine years}} long, as indicated by the much later historical sources.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Pew Research Center {{reported}} that 85% of Americans {{were familiar with}} the claim, and 30% believed it was true, backed by three <b>contemporaneous</b> polls. A poll in August 2012 found that 39% of Americans believed the claim.|$|E
5|$|The Land of Gorch {{takes place}} in a world far away from <b>contemporaneous</b> society. The {{characters}} live on a fictional, swamp-like planet in a fantasy genre. The set includes volcanoes and prehistoric themes. The environment is dismal and the puppets have grotesque physical appearances.|$|E
5|$|The Polkarpov TIS was {{a heavily}} armed Soviet heavy fighter {{designed}} {{during the early}} 1940s. Competing <b>contemporaneous</b> designs in the USSR included the Grushin Gr-1, Mikoyan-Gurevich DIS and Tairov Ta-3.|$|E
5|$|After Hunyadi {{defeated}} the Ottomans in Transylvania in March 1442, the Ottoman governor of Bulgaria accused Vlad of treachery, {{according to the}} <b>contemporaneous</b> Ottoman historian, Neşri. Murad summoned Vlad to Edirne to demonstrate his loyalty. Before departing, Vlad made his eldest son, Mircea, the ruler of Wallachia. Soon after he came to Edirne, he was captured at the sultan's command. He was held in captivity in Gallipoli.|$|E
5|$|Although stem lemuriforms like Djebelemur {{may have}} been <b>contemporaneous</b> with related toothcombed {{primates}} around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40mya according to the French paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot. This would conflict with the molecular clock estimates by evolutionary anthropologist Anne Yoder and others, which predict lemur–lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8mya.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from eastern Africa {{extending from the}} Rift Valley from Ethiopia to northern Tanzania represents the largest archaeological evidence of the shift from the Late Acheulian to the Middle Stone Age tool technologies. This transition is characterized by stratigraphic layering of Acheulian stone tools, a bifacial handaxe technology, underneath and even <b>contemporaneous</b> with MSA technologies, such as Levallois tools, flakes, flaked tools, pointed flakes, smaller bifaces that are projectile in form, and, on rare occasions, hafted tools. Evidence of the gradual displacement of Acheulian by MSA technologies is further supported by this layering and <b>contemporaneous</b> placement, {{as well as by}} the earliest appearance of MSA technologies at Gademotta and the latest Acheulian technologies at the Bouri Formation of Ethiopia, dated to 154 to 160 kya. This suggests a possible overlap of 100-150 thousand years.|$|E
5|$|At {{its height}} the company {{employed}} more than 700 people worldwide, the majority based in Canada. Symantec was following a general trend of large American firms buying smaller Canadian software companies. Other <b>contemporaneous</b> examples include Softimage and Zoom-it being bought by Microsoft, and Alias being bought by Silicon Graphics.|$|E
5|$|Bernsten said audiences <b>contemporaneous</b> {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such {{characters}}. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets behaving in such a mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly <b>contemporaneous</b> domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Cairano first {{documented}} work is from December 24, 1489 {{with his}} commission for {{the cycle of}} twelve statues of the Apostles to be installed in the first dome {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Brescia. The installation of Cairano's cycle is <b>contemporaneous</b> with Tamagnino's installation of the twelve angels in the lower section of the dome.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare is well attested in sources <b>contemporaneous</b> {{with his}} reign. The tombs {{of many of}} his courtiers and family members have been {{discovered}} in Giza, Saqqara and Abusir. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and, in a few cases, even record letters that the king sent to his officials. These letters, inscribed on the walls of tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.|$|E
5|$|He co-authored the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the {{aftermath}} of Enron, he co-sponsored (with Barbara Boxer) legislation, which was later propounded by Ted Kennedy, that reforms the 401(k) plan {{to minimize the risk}} of investment portfolios. The plan was opposed by President George W. Bush and faced strong opposition in Congress. Restrictions on retirement account allocations were in direct opposition to the <b>contemporaneous</b> movement towards self-directed individual retirement accounts for Social Security.|$|E
5|$|Hemmings had {{previously}} taught at Summerhill. In 1973, he was lecturer in Education at the University of Leicester. Other <b>contemporaneous</b> and significant biographies of Neill include Neill's autobiography (Neill! Neill! Orange Peel!, 1972) and Robert Skidelsky's Part Three of English Progressive Schools (1969). Jonathan Croall's Neill of Summerhill (1983) later cited Hemmings's book.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Carpenter {{and colleagues}} {{described}} material {{of a large}} nodosaurid from Utah, discovered in {{a member of the}} Cedar Mountain Formation called the Poison Strip Sandstone, which is <b>contemporaneous</b> with the Cloverly Formation. He originally referred it to Sauropelta as a possible new species, but it was never named. In more recent publications, Carpenter no longer refers the Poison Strip animal to Sauropelta, only to the family Nodosauridae.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Lichtenstein {{reproduced}} masterpieces by Cézanne, Mondrian and Picasso before embarking on the Brushstroke series in 1965. The Brushstrokes were <b>contemporaneous</b> with abstract painting {{that no longer}} emphasized the gestural aspect, with non-demonstrative modes carrying the day. Lichtenstein was identified with some such modes by critics and found himself linked to both Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland. Brushstrokes was the first element of the Brushstrokes series.|$|E
5|$|It {{was one of}} the texts, {{along with}} Thomas Bewick's <b>contemporaneous</b> A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made {{ornithology}} popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The book includes a description of the cirl bunting, discovered by Montagu in 1800 near his home in Kingsbridge, Devon.|$|E
5|$|Jeannette Ridlon Piccard (January 5, 1895 – May 17, 1981) was an American high-{{altitude}} balloonist, and {{in later}} life an Episcopal priest. She held the women's altitude record for nearly three decades, and according to several <b>contemporaneous</b> accounts was regarded as the first woman in space.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{made several}} {{alterations}} {{to the source}} images as he compiled them into this composition. He used themes in this work that relate to those expressed in several of his other works. The narrative content is also said to relate to themes from other works, but instead of Lichtenstein's own works it relates to Jackson Pollock's <b>contemporaneous</b> works.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre Ini is well attested in sources <b>contemporaneous</b> {{with his}} reign, {{for example in}} the tombs {{of some of his}} contemporaries {{including}} Nyuserre's manicurists Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum, the high officials Khufukhaf II, Ty, Rashepses, Neferefre-ankh and Khabawptah, and the priests of his funerary cult Nimaatsed and Kaemnefert.|$|E
5|$|Seven Irish airmail stamps {{were issued}} between 1948 and 1965 in the 1d, 3d, 6d, 8d, 1/-, 1/3 and 1/5 values. No {{specific}} airmail rate existed for the 1d and 3d stamps though their use was permitted on non-airmail correspondence; all others paid a <b>contemporaneous</b> rate when first produced. These {{were the only}} airmail stamps ever issued but many definitives and commemoratives have been produced in values that paid the postage rate for airmail service.|$|E
5|$|Solomon was {{set free}} during the canonization {{process of the}} first king of Hungary, Stephen I, in 1083. In an attempt to regain his crown, Solomon allied with the Pechenegs, but King Ladislaus {{defeated}} their invading troops. According to a nearly <b>contemporaneous</b> source, Solomon died on a plundering raid in the Byzantine Empire. Later legends say that he survived and died as a saintly hermit in Pula (Croatia).|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{sources for}} Medieval Scotland {{are much more}} limited than for <b>contemporaneous</b> England. The only burgh for which there are sources pre-dating 1400 is Aberdeen. The only large body of sources to survive from before 1400 are the cartularies of monasteries. For education, outside of {{occasional}} references in documents concerned with other matters, they amount {{to a handful of}} burgh records and monastic and episcopal registers.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{scientists}} {{proposed the}} name kurchatovium and the American scientists suggested the name rutherfordium {{for the new}} element. In 1992, the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided <b>contemporaneous</b> evidence to the synthesis of element 104 and that credit should be shared between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|The camera's {{resolution}} is two-and-a-half {{times higher than}} the handheld's screens. However, their {{resolution is}} considerably lower than <b>contemporaneous</b> digital cameras and mobile phones. This was done to help keep their price reasonable and to maintain a preferable response time for viewing photos in quick session, particularity since numerous applications will use them.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{question is}} {{which of the}} areas developed first and created a template for subsequent development. Haas rejects suggestions that maritime development at sites immediately adjacent to the coast was initial, pointing to <b>contemporaneous</b> development based on his dating. Moseley remains convinced that coastal Aspero is the oldest site, and that its maritime subsistence served {{as a basis for}} the civilization.|$|E
5|$|Tibet {{was once}} a strong power <b>contemporaneous</b> with Tang China (618–907). Until the Tibetan Empire's {{collapse}} in the 9th century, it was the Tang's major rival in dominating Inner Asia. The Yarlung rulers of Tibet also signed various peace treaties with the Tang, culminating in a treaty in 821 that fixed the borders between Tibet and China.|$|E
5|$|While Georgian and Classical {{evidence}} {{makes the}} <b>contemporaneous</b> Kartlian {{links with the}} Seleucids plausible (Toumanoff has even implied that the kings of Kartli might have aided the Seleucids in holding the resurgent Orontids of Armenia in check), Pharnavaz's alleged reform of the eristavi fiefdoms is most likely a back-projection of the medieval pattern of subdivision to the remote past.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} <b>contemporaneous</b> American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E
5|$|A subfamily, the Diplodocinae, {{was erected}} to include Diplodocus and its closest relatives, {{including}} Barosaurus. More distantly related is the <b>contemporaneous</b> Apatosaurus, {{which is still}} considered a diplodocid, although not a diplodocine, {{as it is a}} member of the subfamily Apatosaurinae. The Portuguese Dinheirosaurus and the African Tornieria have also been identified as close relatives of Diplodocus by some authors. The Diplodocoidea comprise the diplodocids, as well as dicraeosaurids, rebbachisaurids, Suuwassea, Amphicoelias and possibly Haplocanthosaurus, and/or the nemegtosaurids. This clade is the sister group to Macronaria (camarasaurids, brachiosaurids and titanosaurians).|$|E
5|$|According to {{the nearly}} <b>contemporaneous</b> chronicle of John of Küküllő, Louis {{launched}} his first campaign against {{a group of}} Transylvanian Saxons, who had refused to pay taxes, and forced them to yield {{in the summer of}} 1344. During his stay in Transylvania, Nicholas Alexanderwho was the son of Basarab, the ruling prince of Wallachiaswore loyalty to Louis on his father's behalf in Brassó (now Brașov in Romania); thus the suzerainty of the Hungarian monarchs over Wallachia was, at least outwardly, restored.|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several {{tests to}} verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The age of the inscription was taken into consideration, and found to be <b>contemporaneous</b> {{with the rest of}} the painting. Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work was too late to be a life portrait of Jane, but did not rule out the possibility of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|As {{the most}} {{abundant}} large predator in the Morrison Formation, Allosaurus {{was at the top}} of the food chain, probably preying on <b>contemporaneous</b> large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included ornithopods, stegosaurids, and sauropods. Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a hatchet.|$|E
