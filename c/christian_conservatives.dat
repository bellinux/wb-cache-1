25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century in the U.S., however, Decalogue monuments and plaques in government spaces had become a legal battleground between religious as well as political liberals and conservatives. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Americans United for Separation of Church and State launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the American Jewish Congress), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider culture war between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the Liberty Counsel, have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives</b> have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the U.S. Supreme Court {{as a threat to the}} expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.|$|E
500|$|Still {{reeling from}} his South Carolina experience, McCain made a February 28 speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, {{including}} Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as divisive; McCain declared, [...] "... we embrace the fine {{members of the}} religious conservative community. But {{that does not mean}} that we will pander to their self-appointed leaders." [...] He also made an off-the-cuff, unserious remark on the Straight Talk Express that referred to Robertson and Falwell as [...] "forces of evil", that came across as angry hostility to many <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives.</b> [...] McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29, as well as one in Washington.|$|E

His attempts at controversy included referring to homeless people as [...] "urban outdoorsmen" [...] on air, and called public education [...] "taxpayer-funded child abuse". Specific targets of criticism included <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives,</b> Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Max Cleland, and Cynthia McKinney He also expressed a negative opinion {{about the lack of}} Muslim outrage for the actions of Muslim terrorists and the riots that erupted in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.

500|$|Ethan Gutmann, a {{journalist}} reporting on China {{since the early}} 1990s, has attempted to explain the apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, [...] "Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum," [...] according to Gutmann. This, coupled with western skepticism of persecuted refugees, {{has resulted in a}} perception that Falun Gong practitioners tended to exaggerate, or [...] "spout slogans rather than facts." [...] Gutmann also observes that Falun Gong also lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom: liberals are wary of Falun Gong's conservative morality, <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives</b> don't accord the practice the same space as persecuted Christians, and the political center is wary of disrupting commercial and political relations with the Chinese government. Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources in responding to the persecution.|$|E
500|$|<b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives</b> were {{inspired}} by their victory, and saw {{an opportunity for a}} new, effective political cause. Gay activists were shocked to see how little support they received. An impromptu demonstration of over 3,000 Castro residents formed the night of the Dade County ordinance vote. Gay men and lesbians were simultaneously angry, chanting [...] "Out of the bars and into the streets!", and elated at their passionate and powerful response. The San Francisco Examiner reported that members of the crowd pulled others out of bars along Castro and Polk Streets to [...] "deafening" [...] cheers. Milk led marchers that night on a five-mile (8km) course through the city, constantly moving, aware that if they stopped for too long there would be a riot. He declared, [...] "This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force." [...] Activists had little time to recover, however, as the scenario replayed itself when civil rights ordinances were overturned by voters in Saint Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon, throughout 1977 and into 1978.|$|E
500|$|The Bible {{project has}} met with {{extensive}} criticism, including from fellow evangelistic <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives.</b> Rod Dreher, a conservative editor and columnist, described the project as [...] "insane hubris" [...] and [...] "crazy"; he further described the project as [...] "It's like what you'd get if you crossed the Jesus Seminar with the College Republican chapter at a rural institution of Bible learnin. Ed Morrissey, another conservative Christian writer, wrote that bending the word of God to one's own ideology makes God subservient to an ideology, {{rather than the other}} way around. Joseph Farah, editor-in-chief of WorldNetDaily, stated: [...] "I've seen some incredibly stupid and misguided initiatives by 'conservatives' in my day, but this one takes the cake" [...] and [...] "There's certainly nothing 'conservative' about rewriting the Bible". Creation Ministries International wrote [...] "Forcing the Bible to conform to a certain political agenda, no matter if one happens to agree with that agenda, is a perversion of the Word of God and should therefore be opposed by Christians as much as 'politically correct' Bibles." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode, {{dealing with}} [...] "one {{of the most}} {{divisive}} issues in American society" [...] according to The New York Times, became a subject of controversy after its broadcast. The authors of The Marriage and Family Experience called it [...] "one of the more controversial episodes of a frequently controversial cartoon." [...] Several conservative groups and American <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives</b> thought it was promoting same-sex marriage. Parents Television Council president L. Brent Bozell III criticized [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] for bringing up the issue. Even though {{he had not seen}} the episode himself, he commented that [...] "at a time when the public mood is overwhelmingly against gay marriage, any show that promotes gay marriage is deliberately bucking the public mood." [...] A researcher for the American Family Association, named Ed Vitagliano, claimed the presentation of same-sex marriage in the episode was [...] "very one-sided". He said that this episode proved [...] "Hollywood's blatant pro-homosexual bias" [...] because despite The Simpsons being [...] "generally kind of a wacky animated program" [...] it was not neutral on the issue. Bozell also worried about the influence the episode would have on children, despite the parental discretion advisory at the beginning, commenting: [...] "You've got a show watched by millions of children. Do children need to have gay marriage thrust in their faces as an issue? Why can't we just entertain them?" [...] Similarly, Vitagliano said that many children watch The Simpsons and Hollywood [...] "will pull out all the stops to promote same-sex marriage — and children will be influenced by it." ...|$|E

In 2000, Patrick Henry College was founded in Purcellville, Virginia, in large part for those who had been homeschooled. Although Henry's most famous declaration has proved as adaptable as ever {{in the hands of the}} Right (one sign at a Tea Party rally in 2010 read [...] "Give Me Liberty or Give Me Debt"), according to Kidd, [...] "few Americans today, Tea Partiers or others, take seriously Henry's fundamental criticisms [...] of the Constitution." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Discovery Institute aggressively {{promotes}} its Teach the Controversy {{campaign and}} intelligent design to the public, education officials and public policymakers. Its efforts are largely aimed at conservative Christian policymakers, {{where it is}} cast as a counterbalance to the liberal influences of [...] "atheistic scientists" [...] and [...] "Dogmatic Darwinists." [...] As a measure of their success in this effort, on 1 August 2005, during a round-table interview with reporters from five Texas newspapers, President Bush said that he believes schools should discuss intelligent design alongside evolution when teaching students {{about the origin of}} life. Bush, a conservative Christian, declined to go into detail on his personal views of the origin of life, but advocated the Teach the Controversy approach - [...] "I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought... you're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes." [...] <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives,</b> a substantial part of Bush's voting base, have been central in promoting the Teach the Controversy campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On November 7, 2007, evangelist, Christian Broadcasting Network founder, {{and past}} presidential {{candidate}} Pat Robertson endorsed Rudy Giuliani for President of the United States {{at a news}} conference in Washington, D.C. [...] This was viewed by observers as a key development in the race, as it gave credence that evangelicals and other social conservatives could support Giuliani despite some of Giuliani's positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights. [...] It also showed that support from evangelicals was split among multiple candidates, as withdrawn candidate Sam Brownback had recently endorsed John McCain and prominent figures Bob Jones III and Paul Weyrich had recently endorsed Mitt Romney; as the Baltimore Sun noted, [...] "It suggests that <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives</b> aren't ready to coalesce behind any single candidate and are unable to stop Giuliani from winning the nomination." [...] The action was protested by the U.S. Islamic advocacy group CAIR, which said that Robertson had [...] "a clear record of anti-Muslim bigotry" [...] and called on Giuliani to renounce the endorsement.|$|E
5000|$|Christian Voice {{sought to}} counter US President Jimmy Carter's {{influence}} over the American Christian community.

[...] After he took office, however, Carter disappointed many <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives</b> by supporting the Panama Canal Treaty and by taking what many <b>Christian</b> <b>conservatives</b> {{considered to be a}} soft stance on Communism. This perception caused Christian Voice and other Christian right organizations to rally behind Republican nominee Ronald Reagan in 1980. [...] During the 1980 US Presidential election, Christian Voice organized [...] "Christians for Reagan" [...] as a subdivision with the group and it also sponsored an advertising campaign that implied Carter approved of homosexual lifestyles. [...] The group gained even further notoriety when it issued [...] "moral report cards" [...] to grade the social voting patterns of members of Congress.|$|E
