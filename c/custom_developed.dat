5|$|The badnjak ceremony, {{originally}} performed {{only within}} the family, became a more public celebration. A <b>custom</b> <b>developed</b> before WorldWarI in the Kingdom of Serbia to lay the badnjak on a fire built in military barracks, so that the soldiers stationed there over Christmas could share in the holiday atmosphere. In the succeeding Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was standardized in army service regulations. On Christmas Eve, {{under the command of}} a specially appointed officer, the representatives of military units of a garrison formed a festive procession on horses, accompanied with music. Members of citizens' associations and other civilians of the garrison town usually joined the procession as it proceeded to the nearest wood to collect the badnjak. They felled a set number of trees, dedicated respectively to the Royal Palace, the military command of the town, the respective commands of units of the garrison, its oldest officer, and its officers' assembly house. The procession brought the trees to the barracks, in whose yard an open fire was built. The garrison commander then placed the trees ceremonially on the fire, and gave an appropriate address.|$|E

2500|$|Mary as Queen of Heaven is praised in the Salve Regina [...] "(Hail Queen)", {{which is}} sung {{in the time}} from Trinity Sunday until the Saturday before the first Sunday of Advent. In the vernacular, as a prayer to the Virgin Mary, the Hail Holy Queen is the final prayer of the Rosary. A German Benedictine monk, Hermann of Reichenau (1013–1054), {{allegedly}} composed it and it originally appeared in Latin, the prevalent language of the Catholic Church until Vatican II. Traditionally it has been sung in Latin, though many translations exist. In the Middle Ages, Salve Regina offices were held every Saturday. In the 13th century, the <b>custom</b> <b>developed</b> to greet the Queen of Heaven with the Salve Regina, which is considered {{the oldest of the}} four Marian antiphons. As a part of the Catholic Reformation, the Salve Regina was prayed every Saturday by members of the Sodality of Our Lady, a Jesuit Marian congregation. The Hail Holy Queen is also the final prayer of the Rosary.|$|E
2500|$|When Haman's name is {{read out}} loud during the public {{chanting}} of the Megillah in the synagogue, which occurs 54 times, the congregation engages in noise-making to blot out his name. The practice {{can be traced}} back to the Tosafists (the leading French and German rabbis of the 13th century). In accordance with a passage in the Midrash, where the verse [...] "Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek" [...] (...) is explained to mean [...] "even from wood and stones." [...] A <b>custom</b> <b>developed</b> of writing the name of Haman, the offspring of Amalek, on two smooth stones, and knocking them together until the name was blotted out. Some wrote the name of Haman on the soles of their shoes, and at the mention of the name stamped with their feet as a sign of contempt. Another method was to use a noisy ratchet, called a ra'ashan (from the Hebrew ra-ash, meaning [...] "noise") and in Yiddish a [...] Some of the rabbis protested against these uproarious excesses, considering them a disturbance of public worship, but the custom of using a ratchet in the synagogue on Purim is now universal, with the exception of Spanish and Portuguese Jews, who consider them a breach of decorum.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} several centuries, the <b>custom</b> <b>developed</b> among Ashkenazic Orthodox Jews (including Hassidic and Haredi Jews), that the family would [...] "sit shiva" [...] if and when one of their {{relatives}} would leave the fold of traditional Judaism. [...] The definition of [...] "leaving the fold" [...] varies within communities; some would sit shiva if a family member married a non-Jew; others would only sit shiva if the individual actually converted to another faith, and even then, some would {{make a distinction between}} those who chose to do so of their own will, and those who were pressured into conversion. [...] (In Sholom Aleichem's Tevye, when the title character's daughter converts to Christianity to marry a Christian, Tevye sits shiva for her and generally refers to her as [...] "dead.") [...] At the height of the Mitnagdim (anti-Hassidic) movement, in the early-to-mid nineteenth century, some Mitnagdim even sat shiva if a family member joined Hassidism. [...] (It is said that when Leibel Eiger joined Hassidism, his father, Rabbi Shlomo Eiger sat shiva, but his grandfather, the famed Rabbi Akiva Eiger, did not. It is also said that Leibel Eiger came to be menachem avel [...] ). [...] By the mid-twentieth century, however, Hassidism was recognized [...] as a valid form of Orthodox Judaism, and thus the (controversial) practice of sitting shiva for those who realign to Hassidism ceased to exist.|$|E
