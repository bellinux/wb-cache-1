2500|$|At {{the time}} of the hypercycle theory formulation, ribozymes were not known. After the {{breakthrough}} of discovering RNA's catalytic properties in 1982, it was realized that RNA had the ability to integrate protein and nucleotide-chain properties into one entity. Ribozymes potentially serving as templates and <b>catalysers</b> of replication can be considered components of quasispecies that can self-organize into a hypercycle without the need to invent a translation process. In 2001, a partial RNA polymerase ribozyme was designed via directed evolution. Nevertheless, it was able to catalyse only a polymerization of a chain having the size of about 14 nucleotides, even though it was 200 nucleotides long. The most up-to-date version of this polymerase was shown in 2013. While it has an ability to catalyse polymerization of longer sequences, even of its own length, it cannot replicate itself {{due to a lack of}} sequence generality and its inability to transverse secondary structures of long RNA templates. However, it was recently shown that those limitations could in principle be overcome by the assembly of active polymerase ribozymes from several short RNA strands. In 2014, a cross-chiral RNA polymerase ribozyme was demonstrated. It was hypothesized that it offers a new mode of recognition between an enzyme and substrates, which is based on the shape of the substrate, and allows avoiding the Watson-Crick pairing and, therefore, may provide greater sequence generality. [...] Various other experiments have shown that, besides bearing polymerase properties, ribozymes could have developed other kinds of evolutionarily useful catalytic activity such as synthase, ligase, or aminoacylase activities. Ribozymal aminoacylators and ribozymes with the ability to form peptide bonds might have been crucial to inventing translation. An RNA ligase, in turn, could link various components of quasispecies into one chain, beginning the process of a genome integration. An RNA with a synthase or a synthetase activity could be critical for building compartments and providing building blocks for growing RNA and protein chains as well as other types of molecules. Many examples of this kind of ribozyme are currently known, including a peptidyl transferase ribozyme, a ligase, and a nucleotide synthetase. A transaminoacylator described in 2013 has five nucleotides, which is sufficient for a trans-amino acylation reaction and makes it the smallest ribozyme that has been discovered. It supports a peptidyl-RNA synthesis that could be a precursor for the contemporary process of linking amino acids to tRNA molecules. An RNA ligase's catalytic domain, consisting of 93 nucleotides, proved to be sufficient to catalyse a linking reaction between two RNA chains. Similarly, an acyltransferase ribozyme 82 nucleotides long was sufficient to perform an acyltransfer reaction. Altogether, the results concerning the RNA ligase's catalytic domain and the acyltransferase ribozyme are in agreement with the estimated upper limit of 100 nucleotides set by the error threshold problem. However, it was hypothesized that even if the putative first RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases are estimated to be longer—the smallest reported up-to-date RNA-dependent polymerase ribozyme is 165 nucleotides long—they did not have to arise in one step. It is more plausible that ligation of smaller RNA chains performed by the first RNA ligases resulted in a longer chain with the desired catalytically active polymerase domain.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the methods}} for {{utilization}} of waste carbon dioxide consists in reaction of methane with carbon dioxide, referred to as dry reforming of methane. It is an intensely endothermic catalytic process that {{takes place at the}} temperature above 700 °C. Reaction of methane with carbon dioxide leads to formation of synthesis gas (syngas) that is a valuable chemical raw material. The energy that is necessary for the process to take place can be sourced from High Temperature Nuclear Reactors (HTR). The completed studies comprises a series of thermodynamic calculations and made it possible to establish optimum conditions for the process and demand for energy from HTR units. The dry reforming of methane needs also a catalytic agent with appropriate activity, therefore the hydrotalcite <b>catalyser</b> with admixture of cerium and nickel, developed at AGH University of Technology seems to be a promising solution. Thus, the researchers from the Institute for Chemical Processing of Coal (IChPW) in Zabrze have developed a methodology for production of the powdery hydrotalcite <b>catalyser</b> and investigated catalytic properties of the granulate obtained. The completed experiments confirmed that the new <b>catalyser</b> demonstrated high activity and is suitable for the process of methane dry reforming. In addition, optimum parameters of the were process (800 °C, CO 2 :CH 4 = 3 : 1) were established as well. Implementation of the technology in question into industrial practice, combined with utilization of HTR heat can be a promising method for management of waste carbon dioxide and may eventually lead to mitigation of the greenhouse effect...|$|R

40|$|Trabajo presentado a la: "European Hydrogen Energy Conference" celebrada en Sevilla (España) del 12 al 14 {{de marzo de}} 2014. Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (MT-SOFC) have {{recently}} attracted much interest as they are more resistant to thermal cycling, and they present shorter start-up/shut-down times and higher volumetric power densities {{in comparison with the}} traditional planar geometry. Standard NiO-YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) tubes used in our laboratory are fabricated by either extrusion or cold isostatic pressing (CIP) of NiO, YSZ and pore former powders, followed by spray coating or dipcoating of the YSZ electrolyte. Both components are then co-sintered at 1400 ºC. Typical oxygen electrodes such as LSCF (lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite) or LSM (lanthanum strontium manganite) are deposited by dip-coating and sintered at 1150 ºC. Thermo-mechanical matching of cell components, <b>catalyser</b> coarsening and quality of interfaces are important issues in cell fabrication. Fabrication of electrodes by infiltration may contribute to reduce some of these problems as the cathode sintering stage is no longer needed. In this case we fabricate the oxygen electrode by infiltration of different cathode materials into a porous YSZ structure. One of the advantages of this fabrication method is an increased of TPB (triple-phase boundary) length compared with the standard cathode due to the smallest size of the dispersed <b>catalyser</b> particles having a higher surface area. In addition, since no sintering process of the cathode is needed the formation of nonconducting secondary phases such as non-conducting zirconates, and also the coarsening of the <b>catalyser</b> during sintering is eliminated. In the present work, results about infiltrated LSM cathodes using different LSM concentrations will be shown. The j-V (current density-voltage) measurements showed an increase of near 20...|$|R

The origin of the bands has been approached by considering photoluminescence of base resin and hardener taken separately, of their mixture, {{and in the course}} of curing. Most of the bands observed in the cured resin could be interpreted based on those found in the components taken separately. Fluorescence of the cured resin appears dominated by two broad bands that are characteristic of the hardener and exhibits a blue shift by up to 30 nm in the course of curing which could be used for cure monitoring purpose of the investigated system. Fluorescence of the base resin is clearly detected in the resin cured with tertiary amine as <b>catalyser.</b> However, it is very weak if the <b>catalyser</b> is not added. Two phosphorescence processes have been isolated in the cured resin, one of them being related to the base resin.
