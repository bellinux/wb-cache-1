40|$|Thesis (MNutr (Human Nutrition)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a regression equation to estimate weight of black male paraplegic South African subjects. Very few institutions in South Africa have wheel <b>chair</b> <b>scales</b> and very few paraplegic persons know what their weight is. People with spinal cord injury (SCI) are reported to have an increased risk to develop obesity and diseases of lifestyle. It is therefore important to monitor the nutritional status of these patients to prevent and treat the above diseases effectively. The aim was to develop an equation that incorporates variables or measurements that do not require a high level of skill and experience to be determined. The equipment needed for the determination of the measurements should also be easily accessible, for example a tape measure rather than a skin-fold caliper...|$|R
50|$|Palmer {{has fought}} against several alien and supernatural threats, {{as well as}} having his own rogues gallery: his arch enemy is Chronos the Time Bandit, the menace of the Bug-Eyed Bandit, the {{dangerous}} eco-terrorist Floronic Man, and the miniature misguided Bat-Knights of Elvaran. He also had several time travel adventures by means of Professor Alpheus V. Hyatt's Time Pool. The Atom {{is a member of}} several incarnations of the Justice League, and the team is gracious enough to supply a special <b>chair</b> <b>scaled</b> to his default size which can elevate to whatever height needed so he can easily partake in team meetings without having to go out of costume. There, he meets Hawkman (Katar Hol pre-Hawkworld, Carter Hall post-Hawkworld), one of his closest friends in the superhero community. Neither character achieved major popularity, and even in their heyday were mostly supporting characters, often with Palmer as a specialist in size alteration who was often needed to access extremely confined areas only he could access. Hawkman would manufacture prosthetic wings for a myna Ray saved, taking on the name Major Mynah and became the Atom's partner and steed.|$|R

40|$|One major {{priority}} {{for health care}} professionals is {{to minimize the risk}} of fall in the elderly population. While {{the quality of life of}} an individual is affected by fall accidents, management of post-fall disability in the elderly could be a huge economic burden to the society. Visually impaired elderly are at a higher risk of fall, because "vision", an important component contributing to balance, is disturbed. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an exercise programme, which focused on improvement of the functional balance of visually impaired elderly. Visually impaired elderly residents were randomly assigned to either the exercise training or control group. A multidimensional, individually tailored exercise programme was introduced by physiotherapists to the exercise group for 12 weeks. Functional balance status reflected by the Berg Balance <b>Scale,</b> <b>chair</b> stand test, and timed up-and-go test assessed before and after the 12 -week training programme was compared between the two groups. Results demonstrated a significant improvement in balance outcomes in the exercise group (p< 0. 05) but not in the control group. The results of this study suggest that a physiotherapist-designed stren~thening and balance-training programme can improve the functional balance status of visually impaired elderly.
