5|$|Teleosts may spawn in {{the water}} column or, more commonly, on the substrate. Water column spawners are mostly limited to coral reefs; the fish will rush towards the surface and release their gametes. This appears to protect the eggs from some predators and allow them to {{disperse}} widely via currents. They receive no parental care. Water column spawners are more likely than substrate spawners to spawn in groups. Substrate spawning commonly occurs in nests, rock crevices or even burrows. Some eggs <b>can</b> <b>stick</b> to various surfaces like rocks, plants, wood or shells.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they <b>can</b> <b>stick</b> together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E

500|$|Forty-five {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Kahne clinched the 20th pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 30.525 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Edwards. McMurray qualified third, Bill Elliott took fourth, and A. J. Allmendinger started fifth. Johnson, David Reutimann, Mark Martin, David Ragan and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. Hamlin only managed 37th, having getting close to the wall. The two drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Patrick Carpentier, and Michael McDowell. Once the qualifying session completed, Kahne commented, [...] "That was the best qualifying run by far since I joined Red Bull. I look forward to Sunday’s race.

500|$|Obama's {{selections}} of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial. Warren {{had a history}} of vocal opposition to same-sex marriage, and Lowery had a background as a civil rights activist. Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community. In the invocation, Warren asked for [...] "forgiveness for Americans 'when we fight each other' and 'civility in our attitudes even when we differ.'" [...] Warren mentioned Dr.MartinLuther King and Jesus in the invocation, and he concluded the invocation with the Lord's Prayer. Lowery used humor as he delivered the benediction. One of his messages was the statement that [...] "as we leave this mountaintop, help us {{to hold on to the}} spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family." [...] Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day [...] "when brown <b>can</b> <b>stick</b> around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead man and when white would embrace what is right". Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh decried Lowery's benediction, which quoted from [...] "Lift Every Voice and Sing" [...] (the [...] "Black National Anthem"), as racist, while Democrats disagreed. Another of Lowery's rhymes, [...] "When black will not be asked to get in back", borrowing (along with other lines in his conclusion) from the Big Bill Broonzy song [...] "Black, Brown and White", particularly offended the likes of Limbaugh who felt that Obama's ascension on that day symbolized the fact that America had come to that point already.|$|E

2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved {{to know what was going}} on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you <b>can</b> <b>stick</b> your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You <b>can</b> <b>stick</b> it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "outside of the box" [...] {{thinking}} {{incorporated by}} AMC in the Pacer {{as the first}} [...] "wide, small car" [...] attempted to capture a revolutionary change in marketplace, but {{a radical departure from}} what was accepted by consumers as [...] "good styling" [...] was a risky strategy. Only the largest firms <b>can</b> <b>stick</b> with a radical element until it [...] "grows," [...] and the automaker’s dominance in the marketplace may eventually establish it as a standard feature. However, by the late 1970s the styling research axiom no longer applied that if a car with some controversial styling was liked by {{at least half of the}} potential market segment; then chances were good that this feature was a differential advantage for the manufacturer. The AMC Pacer incorporated many controversial styling and design innovations that led to its market failure after five model years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{situation}} can be profitably {{compared to that}} which arises {{in the search for}} functions on the projective space P(V): in that setting, one would ideally like functions F on the vector space V which are polynomial in the coordinates of v≠0 in V and satisfy the equation F(cv)=F(v) for all non-zero c. Unfortunately, the only such functions are constants. If we allow denominators (rational functions instead of polynomials), we can let F be the ratio of two homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Alternatively, we <b>can</b> <b>stick</b> with polynomials and loosen the dependence on c, letting F(cv)=c'k'F(v). The solutions are then the homogeneous polynomials of degree [...] On the one hand, these form a finite dimensional vector space for eachk, and on the other, if we let k vary, we can find the numerators and denominators for constructing all the rational functions which are really functions on the underlying projective spaceP(V).|$|E
