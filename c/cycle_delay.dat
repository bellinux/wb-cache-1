40|$|Elevated mitotic {{recombination}} and cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delays</b> {{are two of}} the cellular responses to UV-induced DNA damage. Cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delays</b> in response to DNA damage are mediated via checkpoint proteins. Two distinct DNA damage checkpoints have been characterized in Schizosaccharomyces pombe: an intra-S-phase checkpoint slows replication and a G(2) /M checkpoint stops cells passing from G(2) into mitosis. In this study we have sought to determine whether UV damage-induced mitotic intrachromosomal recombination relies on damage-induced cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delays.</b> The spontaneous and UV-induced recombination phenotypes were determined for checkpoint mutants lacking the intra-S and/or the G(2) /M checkpoint. Spontaneous mitotic recombinants are thought to arise due to endogenous DNA damage and/or intrinsic stalling of replication forks. Cells lacking only the intra-S checkpoint exhibited no UV-induced increase in the frequency of recombinants above spontaneous levels. Mutants lacking the G(2) /M checkpoint exhibited a novel phenotype; following UV irradiation the recombinant frequency fell below the frequency of spontaneous recombinants. This implies that, as well as UV-induced recombinants, spontaneous recombinants are also lost in G(2) /M mutants after UV irradiation. Therefore, as well as lack of time for DNA repair, loss of spontaneous and damage-induced recombinants also contributes to cell death in UV-irradiated G(2) /M checkpoint mutants...|$|R

This is due to KP1019-induced death being independent of the cell’s p53 status. Studies have shown oxidative stress to contribute towards KP1019-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, KP1019 has been shown to counteract tumor resistance to other metal-based drugs. KP1019 {{does not appear to be}} susceptible to the same cancer cell mechanism of acquiring drug resistance as other metal-based drugs, and remains potent in cell-lines known for their drug resistance.

50|$|The {{operation}} is best {{explained in terms}} of the phase shift the network introduces. At low frequencies L is low impedance and C' is high impedance and consequently the signal passes through the network with no shift in phase. As the frequency increases, the phase shift gradually increases, until at some frequency, ω0, the shunt branch of the circuit, L'C', goes in to resonance and causes the centre-tap of L to be short-circuited to ground. Transformer action between the two halves of L, which had been steadily becoming more significant as the frequency increased, now becomes dominant. The winding of the coil is such that the secondary winding produces an inverted voltage to the primary. That is, at resonance the phase shift is now 180°. As the frequency continues to increase, the phase delay also continues to increase and the input and output start to come back into phase as a whole <b>cycle</b> <b>delay</b> is approached. At high frequencies L and L' approach open-circuit and C approaches short-circuit and the phase delay tends to level out at 360°.|$|E

Synchronous cell populations in G_ 1 -, S- and late-S/G_ 2 M-phase were used. Cells were irradiated with particles from Z = 10 (neon) up to Z = 96 (uranium) in the energy range from 2. 4 to 17. 4 MeV/u and the LET range from 415 to 16225 keV/#mu#m at the UNILAC at GSI, Darmstadt. For comparison, experiments with 250 kV X-rays were performed. For light particles like neon, cell cycle perturbations comparable to those after X-ray irradiation were found, and with increasing LET an increasing delay per particle traversal was observed. For the highest LET-values, extended delays in G_ 1 -, S- and G_ 2 M-phase were detected immediately after irradiation. A large fraction of the cells remained in S-phase or G_ 2 M-phase up to 48 h or longer after irradiation. No significant cell age dependence of <b>cycle</b> <b>delays</b> was detected for the very high LET values. In addition to cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delays,</b> two effects related to the DNA-content as determined by flow cytometry were found after irradiation with very high LET particles, which were attributed to cell fusion and to drastic morphological changes of the cells.

50|$|FIS1 is {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} mitochondrial fission via binding dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). By extension, FIS1 helps regulate {{the size and}} distribution of mitochondria in response to local demand for ATP or calcium ions. In addition, mitochondrial fission may lead to release of cytochrome C, which eventually leads to cell death.In a separate apoptotic signalling pathway, FIS1 interacts with BCAP31 to form a complex, the ARCosome. The ARCosome promotes cell death by bridging the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), allowing FIS1 to transmit a proapoptotic signal from the mitochondria to the ER and activate procaspase-8. The ARCosome then forms a platform with procaspase-8 to increase calcium load in the mitochondria, resulting in apoptosis.Additionally, FIS1 is involved in other modes of shaping mitochondrial morphology. For example, it interacts with TBC1D15 to regulate mitochondrial morphology, {{particularly with regard to}} lysosome and endosome fusion. FIS1 also prevents mitochondria elongation, which would otherwise lead to cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delay</b> or arrest, and ultimately, senescence. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction results in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which cause DNA damage and induce transcriptional repression, as well as induce mitophagy.|$|E
50|$|RNAase MRP and {{its role}} in pre-rRNA {{processing}} has been previously studied in Yeast cells. RNase MRP has been shown to cleave an internal transcribed spacer, specifically ITS1 at the specific site A3 of the rRNA precursor, leading, after additional trimming, to the formation of the mature 5′-end of 5.8S rRNA.Recent data that has been gathered using several temperature-sensitive RNase MRP mutants that showed that inactivation of RNase MRP leading to severe reduction of the abundance of all early intermediates in the typical rRNA processing pathway. However, the transcription of the rRNA precursor is not affected, thus suggesting that RNase MRP {{plays a key role in}} the processing of rRNA beyond the cleavage of the A3 site in ITS1.Further research in Yeast cell RNase MRP has shown a potential role in the regulation of the cell cycle. RNase MRP mutations led to missegregation of plasmids and caused cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delay</b> at the end of mitosis, followed by a buildup of cyclin B2 (CLB2) protein (resulting from increased CLB2 mRNA concentration that codes for the CLB2 protein). RNase MRP also demonstrated cleavage ability of the 5′-UTR of CLB2 mRNA that allows for rapid 5′-to-3′ degradation by XRN1, an exoribonuclease enzyme.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure the}} {{determinism}} required, most real-time Ethernet standards enforce a master-to-slave-only method of communications. This can {{conflict with the}} need for a node in the system to exchange data efficiently with a node other than the network master. The conventional method to achieve this in a master-slave network is to pass data from one slave node to the master, where it is reissued to one or more different slaves. For example, if several servo drives on a network are to be synchronized to a signal from another drive on the network, the master must fetch the signal from this drive and reissue it to all other drives on the network. Disadvantages to this method are that delays are induced due to the multiple cycles required, and the master’s processing load is increased as it must actively participate in the function, although it contributes nothing. Since no data is destroyed in a Sercos III telegram, data to and from any slave can be accessed by another node on the network without any additional <b>cycle</b> <b>delay</b> or master intervention. Additionally, as telegrams pass each node twice in a cycle (for both topology types), a node can even have the opportunity to access data supplied by a subsequent node. Two peer communication methods are defined in the Sercos III specification: Controller to Controller (C2C) for multiple masters to communicate with one another, and Cross Communication (CC) for multiple slaves.|$|E

The involvement of HR {{in maintaining the}} stability of the genome may provide a link with the disease phenotype found in these patients 1, 3. Homologous recombination repair (HRR) {{is often referred to as}} an error-free repair pathway, and advantageous to the cell. However, recombination is a double-edged sword and may also result in loss of heterozygocity leading to inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, or cause gross gene rearrangements that can activate proto-oncogenes 4, 5. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are known to be substrates for HRR in bacteria, yeast and mammals (see 3 for a review). However, it is reported that non-homologous end joining is the main pathway involved in repair of DSBs in mammalian cells 6 and that HR is likely most important in repair of DSBs occurring at replication forks, for instance when a DNA single-strand break (SSB) is converted into a DSB during replication 7.

40|$|Exposure of yeast {{cells to}} an {{increase}} in external osmolarity induces a temporary growth arrest. Recovery from this stress is mediated by the accumulation of intracellular glycerol and the transcription of several stress response genes. Increased external osmolarity causes a transient accumulation of 1 N and 2 N cells and a concomitant depletion of S phase cells. Hypertonic stress triggers a cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delay</b> in G 2 phase cells that appears distinct from the morphogenesis checkpoint, which operates in early S phase cells. Hypertonic stress causes a decrease in CLB 2 mRNA, phosphorylation of Cdc 28 p, and inhibition of Clb 2 p-Cdc 28 p kinase activity, whereas Clb 2 protein levels are unaffected. Like the morphogenesis checkpoint, the osmotic stress-induced G 2 delay is dependent upon the kinase Swe 1 p, but is not tightly correlated with inhibition of Clb 2 p-Cdc 28 p kinase activity. Thus, deletion of SWE 1 does not prevent the hypertonic stress-induced inhibition of Clb 2 p-Cdc 28 p kinase activity. Mutation of the Swe 1 p phosphorylation site on Cdc 28 p (Y 19) does not fully eliminate the Swe 1 p-dependent cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delay,</b> suggesting that Swe 1 p may have functions independent of Cdc 28 p phosphorylation. Conversely, deletion of the mitogen-activated protein kinase HOG 1 does prevent Clb 2 p-Cdc 28 p inhibition by hypertonic stress, but does not block Cdc 28 p phosphorylation or alleviate the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delay.</b> However, Hog 1 p does contribute to proper nuclear segregation after hypertonic stress in cells that lack Swe 1 p.

Disease progression is associated with genomic DNA changes (segmental gains, losses, or loss of heterozygosity).

40|$|The syncytial {{divisions}} of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo lack some of the well established cell-cycle checkpoints. It {{has been suggested that}} without these checkpoints the divisions would display a reduced fidelity. To test this idea, we examined division error frequencies in individuals bearing an abnormally long and rearranged second chromosome, designated C(2) EN. Relative to a normal chromosome, this chromosome imposes additional structural demands on the mitotic apparatus in both the early syncytial embryonic divisions and the later somatic divisions. We demonstrate that the C(2) EN chromosome does not increase the error frequency of the late larva neuroblast divisions. However, in the syncytial embryonic nuclear divisions, the C(2) EN chromosome produces a 10 -fold increase in division errors relative to embryos with a normal karyotype. During late anaphase of the neuroblast divisions, the sister C(2) EN chromosomes cleanly separate from one another. In contrast, during late anaphase of the syncytial divisions in C(2) EN-bearing nuclei, large amounts of chromatin often lag on the metaphase plate. Live analysis of C(2) EN-bearing embryos demonstrates that individual nuclei in the syncytial population of dividing nuclei often delay in their initiation of anaphase. These delays frequently lead to division errors. Eventually the products of the nuclei delayed in anaphase sink inward and are removed from the dividing population of syncytial nuclei. These results suggest that the Drosophila embryo may be equipped with mechanisms that monitor the fidelity of the syncytial nuclear divisions. Unlike checkpoints that rely on cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delays</b> to identify and correct division errors, these embryonic mechanisms rely on cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delays</b> to identify and discard the products of division errors...|$|R

We also found that PRCCTFE 3 expression confers in vitro and in vivo transformation onto various cell types, including those of the kidney. Here we show that de novo expression of the PRCCTFE 3 fusion protein provokes cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delay.</b> This delay, which is mediated by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 ((WAF 1 /CIP 1)), affects both the G 1 /S and the G 2 /M phases of the cell cycle and prevents the cells from undergoing polyploidization. We also show that the PRCCTFE 3 fusion protein binds directly to the p 21 ((WAF 1 /CIP 1)) promoter and that the PRCCTFE 3 -induced up-regulation of p 21 ((WAF 1 /CIP 1)) leads to activation of the pRB pathway.

According to the standard protocol, cells are fixed around 48 h and chromosome aberrations are scored [3]. However, heavy charged particles induce pronounced cell <b>cycle</b> <b>delays</b> that effect the tim...|$|R
30|$|Methods: 16 {{recordings}} (12  min each) of esophageal pressure (Pes), Paw {{and flow}} were obtained in obstructive (75  %) and restrictive (25  %) patients under PSV with clinical evidence of poor patient-ventilator interaction. Tracings of 4426 breaths were visually analyzed for detection of spontaneous respiratory activity both with Pes (reference method) and without Pes (waveform method) by different operators. Breaths {{were defined as}} assisted, unassisted or autotriggered, and assisted breaths as <b>delayed</b> triggered, early <b>cycled</b> or <b>delayed</b> <b>cycled.</b> The waveforms method was applied in a selection of tracings (20  min, 544 breaths) by 4 different operators for assessment of inter-rater agreement.|$|R
