5000|$|Maximum light {{absorption}} and heat insulation in a curtain is created through a lined curtain, which typically {{consists of an}} uncoated fabric at the front to provide {{the look and feel}} of the curtain, with a separate <b>coated</b> <b>fabric</b> attached at the rear to provide the insulative qualities. The <b>coated</b> <b>fabric</b> is typically referred to as a lining, which simply refers to a <b>coated</b> <b>fabric</b> that does not have any particular color or pattern. Curtains may be held back with tie-backs (a loop of cloth, cord, etc., placed around a curtain to hold it open to one side; typically passed through a ring on a hook attached to the wall, and fastened with a knot, button, or velcro; often adorned with tassels) or may be closed and opened with sticks called draw-pulls (rods made of plastic, wood, or metal that can be twisted and/or pulled) or curtain rods which are attached either to the runner or to the first hook. On some curtain rails/poles, there is a pulley system for opening and closing called a [...] "corded curtain track". The knobs at the end of these cords are called cord pulls or [...] "acorns". A roll-down or drop-down curtain has its fabric rolled around the curtain rod and is lowered down from above by a separate device (such as pictured at right) or by pulling the fabric itself, with curtains using the latter mechanism being called pull-down curtains.|$|E

SEM studies were carried out in order to investigate the surface structure of <b>coated</b> and uncoated <b>fabrics.</b> The temperature sensitive water vapor permeability at soft segment crystal melting point was observed for SMPU <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> When the experimental temperature reached the soft segment crystal temperature of SMPU, an abrupt change of water vapor permeability of SMPU <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics</b> were observed. The significant change of water vapor permeability of SMPU <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics</b> is due to the phase change of SMPU which causes density changes inside the membranes due to micro-Brownian motion of soft segment, therefore, enhanced the water vapor permeability through the <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The water vapor permeability of <b>coated</b> <b>fabrics</b> was also dependent on the primary structure of SMPU. When polycaprolactone glycol (PCL, Mn 3000 g mol- 1) was introduced in the polytetramethylene glycol (PTMG, Mn 2900 g mol- 1) based SMPU, the water vapor permeability decreases due to the increased interaction between the polymer chains due to presence of ester groups. In contrast increase of polyethylene glycol (Mn 3400 g mol- 1) in the SMPU backbone, the WVP increases due to the increasing hydrophilicity of the SMPU. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

50|$|Vinyl coated {{polyester}} is {{the most}} frequently used material for flexible fabric structures. It is made up of a polyester scrim, a bonding or adhesive agent, and exterior PVC coatings. The scrim supports the coating (which is initially applied in liquid form) and provides the tensile strength, elongation, tear strength, and dimensional stability of the resulting fabric. Vinyl-coated polyester is manufactured in large panels by heat-sealing an over-lap seam with either a radio-frequency welder or a hot-air sealer. A proper seam will be able to carry the load requirements for the structure. The seam area should be stronger than the original <b>coated</b> <b>fabric</b> when testing for tensile strength.|$|E

5000|$|Coated fabrics {{consist of}} a {{standard}} uncoated fabric with an opaque rubber backing applied {{to the rear of}} the fabric to provide improved light absorption. To create a <b>coated</b> <b>fabric,</b> a liquefied rubber polymer is applied in a single coat to an uncoated fabric and subsequently fused dry by means of a heated roller, in much the same way that a laser printer applies toner to a sheet of paper before fusing it dry. A fabric that has been through the coating process once is considered a [...] "1-pass-coated" [...] fabric, anecdotally referred to as [...] "dim-out" [...] or [...] "blackout" [...] because of the fabric's ability to absorb approximately 50-70% of a direct light source.

5000|$|Another {{field of}} {{research}} is the appearance and propagation of tears in the fabric, this issue has been partially investigated [...] and represents a fundamental data in {{the determination of the}} safety factor which should be used for a specific structure. Because tear propagation generally occurs at 25% UTS, the safety factor is generally higher than four. The test is carried out on a sample taken from a dismounted structure or by using conditioned samples of fabric which aim to reproduce the in-situ conditions. The load profile should reproduce the expected overload by pulling the sample until breakage, which should start far from the sample edge and the clamping system. The repetition of the test and different temperatures (generally -20 °C and +70 °C) offers important information about the joint behaviour at extreme conditions, such as heavy snow fall with temperatures below zero or a blast of wind during a hot summer. This type of test is generally required by designers and manufacturers and those in charge of the evaluation of the structure behaviour and the final test of the structure. Finally, in order to prevent collapses due to ponding and fluttering, the creep behaviour should be carefully considered in the design, choosing anchorages which enable periodical re-tensioning according to the predicted fall in the level of pre-stress. It is based on a monoaxial test but an accurate investigation requires the use of virgin cruciform samples of fabric and the force is applied by means of counter weights. The creep is defined as the “increase in strain with time when a constant force is applied” [...] and aims to describe the material behaviour when a constant force is applied {{over a long period of}} time. This has a considerable effect on the design and realisation of the membrane structure because a progressive increase in the material strain leads to a considerable reduction in the level of pre-stress initially induced in the structure. The sample should be maintained at a constant temperature and for specific applications it may require a proper climatic chamber for investigations at high and low temperatures.There are no complete studies about the dynamic behaviour of <b>coated</b> <b>fabric</b> and foils for structural applications. A dynamic test on coated fabrics can evaluate the response under fast loading and unloading cycles due to blasts of wind or other sources of stress. It should consider a conditioned fabric which reproduces the in-situ conditions and the testing apparatus should be able to apply a high speed load profile which is generally not possible with a common testing rig equipped with electric servomotors. The results of this type of test, despite the absence of research which can support these expectations, can highlight anomalies in the fabric strength and in the tear propagation with consequent adjustments in the safety factor applied.|$|E
