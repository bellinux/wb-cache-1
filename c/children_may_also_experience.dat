A longitudinal study tested whether children who are exposed to {{a heavy dose of}} violence come to regard it as normal behavior and subsequently behave more aggressively themselves. Participants were 777 children (8 to 12 years old) who completed questionnaires twice (6 months apart) about exposure to violence (witnessed and experienced), their own aggression, the aggression of peers, and normative beliefs about aggression. The results showed that witnessing violence predicted increases in aggression 6 months later through changes in normative beliefs. Likewise, experiencing aggression as a victim predicted increases in aggression 6 months later through changes in normative beliefs. These findings show that when children think violence is commonplace in many contexts, {{they are more likely to}} aggress against others. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of children's engagement in sport for their psychological, social, and physical health are well established.

In the current study, we proposed and tested a conditional process model of children's self-reported behavioral engagement and behavioral disaffection in sport based on selfdetermination theory. Results from a sample of 245 youth soccer players suggested that structure from coaches related positively to behavioral engagement and negatively to behavioral disaffection, and that these relations were mediated by athletes' basic psychological need satisfaction. Importantly, and in line with our hypotheses, these indirect effects were moderated by autonomy support from coaches, such that the mediation was evident only among those who reported higher levels of autonomy support. These findings underscore the importance of coaches' providing guidance, expectations, and feedback (i. e., structure) in a way that respects athletes' volition (i. e., autonomy support) ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MA (Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Gestalt {{theory and}} Positive Psychology formed the {{underlying}} theoretical frameworks of this study. Both Gestalt theory and Positive Psychology adopt a positive outlook towards human nature {{with the possibility}} of individuals becoming self-supporting and fully functioning. Both theories also regard awareness to be paramount in establishing healthy self-regulation and optimal well-being. Both Gestalt theory and Positive Psychology provided the link between the concepts, and were also used to describe the main concepts in the study. A review of the literature shows that children living in underprivileged communities often face many environmental stressors that can impact on their well-being and optimal psychological, cognitive, emotional and physical functioning. When this occurs, children are often not able to meet very important needs. They may have to find alternative ways to „survive‟ and protect themselves from certain stressors and cope with their environment. Very often these coping strategies are dysfunctional and certain parts within the child can become cut off or pushed aside, severing healthy contact with the environment. The <b>child</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> a sense of numbing and lack of awareness of senses, emotions and thoughts. The child is therefore living out of awareness. The literature suggests that the process of artmaking can contribute to facilitating awareness, which can enhance selfunderstanding and possibly lead to a greater sense of well-being. The researcher attempted to explore the kinds of awareness that could be facilitated through the artmaking process. A qualitative research design with a phenomenological strategy of enquiry was used for this study. Seven children in middle childhood living in a low socio-economic community took part in the study. They were between the ages of eleven and twelve years and had suffered some form of environmental stress. They had been subjected to substance and alcohol abuse, violence, death and divorce. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were used in order to understand what awareness may have been facilitated in children during the art-making process. The data collected were analysed thematically. The results revealed that the art-making process enabled the participants to experience certain kinds of awareness. The participants became aware of certain emotions and feelings like happiness, enjoyment, calmness, pride and mastery, as well as feelings of anger, sadness and denial. The participants were able to recognise and express positive emotions, but it appeared that the more complex emotions were recognised although not expressed. The most common emotion experienced by the participants was the sense of happiness and enjoyment they seemed to feel as they worked with the different art materials. It appeared that the playful nature of the art-making process kept them engaged and in contact with the process. The participants also became aware of a range of tactile experiences that each art medium offered; clay, paint, collage, hand printing and texture rubbings. These tactile experiences led them to an awareness of feelings and associations. The findings also indicated that the participants became aware of a sense of agency, as they appeared {{to have a sense of}} control and empowerment over the art mediums. This element of control over the art mediums seemed to afford the participants the ability to change what they did not like in their art work. This ability to change things appeared to feed back to, and enhance, their sense of empowerment. Through the findings of the study, as well as from the literature, this quality of empowerment, control and change is important for children in need living in a stressful environment, as it may foster a sense of agency that they may not find from their environment. Another significant finding seemed to be the participants‟ awareness of their context in terms of an unavailability of certain environmental resources to fulfil their needs, namely financial resources and nurturing. The participants‟ awareness centred around basic survival needs, for example lack of sufficient food, but also their awareness of relational needs and challenges, for example overcrowded households, alcohol-abusing parents and divorce.

40|$|Child care in New Zealand and Australia {{has become}} {{a crucial part of}} the child-rearing system, and most {{preschool}} children spend a prolonged period in at least one away-from-home environment for a substantial part of the day. Because so many preschool children are exposed to a child care environment before entering school, the transition from child care to primary school is interesting to consider. In numerous studies teachers report that day care graduates are more aggressive in their first year of school than home-reared children. However, teachers often fail to discriminate between assertive and aggressive behavior, and this distinction for child care graduates is important. Children in child care tend to have infrequent contact and short interactions with caregivers, causing them to be more skilled in areas of social competence, including assertion skills. <b>Child</b> care graduates <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> more anxiety when interacting with strange adults than with strange peers, and some teachers may misinterpret this anxiety as communicative incompetence. For a smooth transition from child care to school, beginning grades need to provide a child-centered environment and beginning grades teachers need to ensure that children are offered adult interaction which stimulates an atmosphere of cooperation, coordination, and continuity.

5000|$|The {{culture and}} {{environment}} in which <b>children</b> are raised <b>may</b> {{play a role in}} the achievement gap. For example, many black middle-class households are headed by a single parent who may not have the time to devote to a child's education. Another explanation that has been suggested for racial and ethnic differences in standardized test performance is that standardized IQ tests and testing procedures are culturally biased toward European-American middle class knowledge and experiences. Social psychologist Claude Steele suggests that minority <b>children</b> and adolescents <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> stereotype threat—the fear that they will be judged to have traits associated with negative appraisals and/or stereotypes of their race or ethnic group which produces test anxiety and keeps them from doing as well as they could on tests. According to Steele, minority test takers experience anxiety, believing that if they do poorly on their test they will confirm the stereotypes about inferior intellectual performance of their minority group. As a result, a self-fulfilling prophecy begins, and the child performs at a level beneath his or her inherent abilities. Some researchers also hypothesize that in some cases, minorities, especially African American students, may stop trying in school because they do not want to be accused of [...] "acting white" [...] by their peers. [...] It has also been suggested that some minority students simply stop trying because they do not believe they will ever see the true benefits of their hard work. As some researchers point out, minority students may feel little motivation to do well in school because they do not believe it will pay off in the form of a better job or upward social mobility. By not trying to do well in school, such students engage in a rejection of the achievement ideology—that is, the idea that working hard and studying long hours will pay off for students in the form of higher wages or upward social mobility.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how childhood trauma experienced by Indigenous {{children can be}} overcome by appropriate interventions. IntroductionWhile many Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian children grow up in safe homes and live in safe communities, {{there are some who}} do not. In the case of Indigenous children, some families and communities are unable to, or are still working to, heal the trauma of past events, including displacement from Country, institutionalisation and abuse. The Stolen Generations also represent a significant cause of trauma. In 2008, an estimated 8 % of Indigenous people aged 15 and over reported being removed from their natural family and 38 % had relatives who had been removed from their natural family. This trauma can pass to children (inter-generational trauma). Indigenous <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> a range of distressing life events including illness and accidents, hospitalisation or death of close family members, exposure to violence, family disintegration (with kin networks fragmented due to forced removals, relationship breakdown and possibly incarceration) and financial stress.

This resource sheet examines these effects and explores how they can be tackled. It focuses on the design and delivery of trauma-informed and trauma-specific children’s services and care...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT On {{the basis}} of a {{qualitative}} study of 20 Norwegian lullaby-singing parents, this article explores the human Bildung potential of parents’ lullaby singing to their children at bedtime. Some parents may experience a personal reawakening when singing as they more easily can express themselves openly and rich and get in contact with emotional layers of their own childhood. Secondly, the act may afford a sort of “musical mindfulness”, which is a unique as well as collective mindful and calm self-with-other-cultivation. The lullaby singing then becomes {{an important part of the}} forming and exploring of the parent-child intimate and social relationship through a musical journey that facilitates the creation and sharing of a personal family signature and convivial atmosphere. Parents’ singing also fosters children’s love of music and singing. The <b>children</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> and learn about the language of intimacy, self-regulation, sensitive timing and musical taste through their parents’ singing. Furthermore, the act facilitates the child’s language acquisition and the development of inner images and free associations. In addition, the lullaby act – as a cultural activity and way of thinking – may open up for a deeper world encountering and value orientation. This can be linked to a broader way of understanding the concept of Bildung as lullaby-singing touches upon human aspects of interconnectedness, spirituality and solidarity, but also a view of it as an end-in-itself. Nonetheless, parents who are blindly reproducing the tradition or being insensitive and highly goal-oriented, ruin the free space of the present intimate moment and will not fulfill the act’s human potential.

40|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{is the use}} of physical force, or threat of force, against a current or former partner in an intimate relationship, resulting in fear and emotional and/ or physical suffering. Domestic violence can also include sexual abuse, emotional abuse and financial abuse. Domestic {{violence is}} a serious social issue that affects all communities and cuts across racial, ethnic and economic lines. It is estimated that one in four of all women are assaulted by a partner or ex-partner during their lifetime. In Rhode Island in 1999, there were 7, 363 domestic violence incidents reported to police. How Does Domestic Violence Affect Children? Children exposed to domestic violence in their homes suffer trauma even if they, themselves, are not physically harmed. They may witness their mother being abused, hear their mother’s cries or a batterer’s threats, and/or observe the results of a violent event through their mother’s injuries or broken furniture. National surveys of mothers show that in homes where there is domestic violence, 87 % of children have witnessed the abuse. Exposure to domestic violence can limit children’s cognitive development and their ability to form close attachments. Children who witness domestic violence may experience anxiety, fear, sleep disruption, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and have problems in school. Some studies of young males have linked witnessing violence at home to youth violence and adult criminal behavior. In addition to the effects on children from witnessing violence, children in homes where a parent is abusive to a partner are at increased risk of child abuse. It is estimated {{that more than half of}} the perpetrators who abuse their partner also abuse their children. <b>Children</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>experience</b> a great deal of instability when a parent escapes an abusive home. A 1990 study by the Ford Foundation found that 50 % of homeless women and children were fleeing domestic violence. In Rhode Island in 1999, 42 % of the families seeking shelter at a homeless shelter reported that they were fleeing domestic violence; 387 Rhode Island children spent time in a domestic violence shelter; and 1, 335 children received services from domestic violence agencies...|$|E
