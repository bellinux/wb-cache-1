25|$|Law No. 275010 created, in November 2001, the Electricity Social Compensation Fund (FOSE).

The fixed discount applies to consumers between 30 and 100 kWh and the proportional discount is targeted {{to those with}} consumptions below 30 kWh. The amount of the discounts is financed through a surcharge in the tariff paid by the regulated consumers with monthly consumptions above 100 kWh.|$|E
25|$|Domestic water {{charges in}} Ireland were thus {{prohibited}} under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997, passed in May 1997 {{shortly before the}} June 1997 general elections in which Fine Gael lost to Fianna Fáil under Bertie Ahern. However, because of popular discontent, the new government chose not to pursue domestic water charges. Instead, it embarked on consultations {{which resulted in the}} 1998 Water Services Pricing Policy. This policy banned <b>cross-subsidy</b> of domestic services from non-domestic charges. For non-domestic users, the policy required the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from these users. It also foresaw the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006. Domestic operational costs were to be paid for through a local government fund, and capital costs were to be financed through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.|$|E
40|$|Rate {{regulations}} in insurance markets often impose <b>cross-subsidies</b> in insurance premiums from low-risk consumers to high-risk consumers. This paper develops {{the hypothesis that}} premium <b>cross-subsidies</b> affect risk taking by insurance consumers, and tests this hypothesis by examining the marginal impact of premium subsidies and overcharges on future insurance costs. The empirical analysis uses 1990 – 2003 rating cell-level data from the Massachusetts automobile insurance market, in which regulation produced large <b>cross-subsidies</b> across cells. Consistent with the hypothesized effects, premium subsidies {{are found to be}} significantly related to higher future insurance costs, and the opposite effects are found for premium overcharges. ...|$|R

40|$|Rate {{regulation}} has a {{long history}} in insurance markets. In many states an important goal of regulation is to reduce price variation across purchasers, and specifically to reduce price levels for high-risk purchasers. That feature of rate regulation leads to price <b>cross-subsidies</b> from low-risk purchasers to high-risk purchasers. Consumers who are charged higher prices in order to finance <b>cross-subsidies</b> to high-risks may be less likely to purchase insurance and to reduce participation in insured activities. These adverse selection effects will lead to a higher proportion of high-risk consumers and a higher proportion of insurance purchased by high-risks. 1 In addition, because <b>cross-subsidies</b> reduce the links between insurance risk and insurance prices, all consumers face reduced incentives for loss prevention and safety investments due to moral hazard. The article tests the hypothesis that insurance price subsidies lead to higher insurance cost growth. To squarely focus on the impact of regulatory price subsidies rather than that of price regulation more generally, the paper makes use of data from the Massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market. <b>Cross-subsidies</b> were explicitly built into the rate structure through rules that limit rate differentials and differences in rate increases across driver rating categories.

25|$|There {{have also}} been campaigns to urge people to {{conserve}} water, reducing consumption from 165 litres {{per person per day}} in 2003 to 155 litres in 2009. The target is to lower it to 140 litres by 2030. Public education was an important instrument to promote water conservation. For example, a Water Efficiency Labeling Scheme for taps, showerheads, toilets and washing machines was introduced so that consumers could make informed choices when making purchases. Also, the tariff structure was modified. While tariffs historically included a <b>cross-subsidy</b> from industries that paid a higher price to residential users that paid a lower price for social reasons, this policy was ended and residential users were charged a tariff that covers the full costs of supply. The level of water losses - more precisely defined as non-revenue water - is one of the lowest in the world at only 5%.|$|E
25|$|Residential {{consumers}} {{outside the}} PRA areas and thus likely {{not to be}} among the poorest, are charged below-cost electricity prices for consumption below 700 kWh/month, a very high threshold by international standards. About 80% of residential users outside the PRA areas fall into this category. This subsidy is drawn from the Tariff Stabilization Fund (FET), which was designed to reduce the impact of high oil prices. The financial burden in this case is transferred to the distribution companies, which have found themselves unable to cover their costs in a scenario of rising oil prices, low efficiency and a limited customer base that could be charged to finance the <b>cross-subsidy.</b> This situation has forced the government to provide much higher than expected subsidies to the sector, which in turn translates into reduced ability to finance investments in other key sectors such as health and education. The government has started to reduce cross-subsidies gradually, with the final objective of limiting them to households with monthly consumption below 200 kWh, which is closer to thresholds for subsidized residential electricity encountered in other countries.|$|E

Metered connections are charged at a volumetric rate, while unmetered connections are charged at a flat rate {{based on the}} rateable value of the property. The rateable value system {{was intended as a}} cross subsidy from wealthier to poorer households. However, since rateable values are often outdated, the subsidy is poorly targeted. Since more and more highly rated households opt for metering, flat rates for the remaining unmetered customers are being increased to compensate for the lost revenue. As a result, the already imperfect <b>cross-subsidy</b> system is unwinding.

40|$|Governments can use {{regulation}} {{to pay for}} public goods out of the pockets of consumers, rather than taxpayers. For example, the Affordable Care Act underwrites care for women and the infirm through higher insurance premium payments by healthy men. Building on a classic article from Richard Posner, we show that these “cross-subsidies” between consumers are a common feature of modern law, ranging from telecommunications to intellectual property to employee benefits. Critics of the ACA, {{and even some of}} its supporters, argue that taxes would be a better choice. Taxes are said to be more transparent, and to fit better with the recommendations of public finance economics. We show how these same arguments can be extended to many other contemporary <b>cross-subsidies.</b> We also argue, however, that the critics may well be wrong. Drawing on recent theoretical and empirical advances, we show that <b>cross-subsidies</b> can be more efficient than taxes, especially when they are used to redistribute wealth on grounds other than income, such as the ACA’s transfer from men to women. We then apply our analysis to several key contemporary <b>cross-subsidies,</b> including personal-injury law, patents, class action lawsuits, paid family leave, and of course the ACA...|$|R

50|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{the situation}} is often characterized by <b>cross-subsidies</b> {{with the intent to}} make water more affordable for residential low-volume users that are assumed to be poor. For example, industrial and commercial users are often charged higher tariffs than public or residential users. Also, metered users are often charged higher tariffs for higher levels of consumption (increasing-block tariffs). However, <b>cross-subsidies</b> between residential users do not always reach their objective. Given the overall low level of water tariffs in developing countries even at higher levels of consumption, most consumption subsidies benefit the wealthier segments of society. Also, high industrial and commercial tariffs can provide an incentive for these users to supply water from other sources than the utility (own wells, water tankers) and thus actually erode the utility's revenue base.|$|R
