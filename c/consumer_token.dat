40|$|Incorporating {{time to the}} {{security}} management system {{is an important step}} to streamline its integration with other resource management functions in the real-time distributed systems. In addition to protecting its security properties, minimizing operational overheads of security management is also a major design issue. In this paper, we propose a timed zero knowledge proof (TZKP) protocol to support the session based secure access control of timed resources for anonymous consumers. On the basis of Eng-Okamoto’s general disposable authentication (GDA) model, we show that the service provider (SP) can authorize the timed resource access by adding session to a control variable in GDA. The consumer who receives timed access authorizations (TAAs) from the SP may choose to transfer them to others. In classical ZKP protocols, each transfer instance requires spending of one <b>consumer</b> <b>token,</b> which makes this desirable feature costly. To minimize the transfer overhead, we propose the multisource reusability (MSR) condition that allows a consumer to reuse its token for multiple transactions with protected anonymity when no double spending of TAA occurs. TZKP not only reduces the amount of tokens that need to be withdrawn by consumers, but also eliminates the need {{to keep track of the}} tokens once their marked sessions are expired. On the basis of the proven security properties of GDA in each session, together with the introduction of session time and the reduced cost transfers, we show that TZKP protocol can be efficiently used for secure access of the shared computing resources for anonymous consumers. Experiments run on DETER testbed show that TZKP has small to moderate run time, and can be easily expanded for large scale applications...|$|E
40|$|E-business, {{information}} serving, and {{ubiquitous computing}} will create heavy request traffic from strangers or even incognitos. Such requests must be managed automatically. Two {{ways of doing}} this are well known: giving every incognito consumer the same treatment, and rendering service in return for money. However, different behavior will be often wanted, e. g., for a university library with different access policies for undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, alumni, citizens of the same state, and everyone else. For a data or process server contacted by client machines on behalf of users not previously known, we show how to provide reliable automatic access administration conforming to service agreements. Implementations scale well from very small collections of consumers and producers to immense client/server networks. Servers can deliver information, effect state changes, and control external equipment. Consumer privacy is easily addressed by the same protocol. We support consumer privacy, but allow servers to deny their resources to incognitos. A protocol variant even protects against statistical attacks by consortia of service organizations. One e-commerce application would put the <b>consumer's</b> <b>tokens</b> on a smart card whose readers are in vending kiosks. In e-business we can simplify supply chain administration. Our method {{can also be used}} in sensitive networks without introducing new security loopholes. Comment: 31 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the service {{composition}} based on security properties of services from an end user perspective. End users are usually not expert in computer security, but expert users of computer software. They typically either own or work for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The proposed framework attempts to demonstrate that end users of small enterprises can compose a service based application based on the security profiles of software services. The paper argues that the security concerns of various stakeholders of services should be specified differently. The paper envisions a framework with which end users could select services consistent with their preferred security features suitable for their businesses. With the same <b>token,</b> <b>consumers</b> of such applications can easily understand the security profile of services {{in order to make}} a B 2 B transaction. This will provide end users more power to force the service developer to offer better security-aware services. The main contribution of this paper is a framework on which further work could be initiated. Scopu...|$|R
40|$|We {{are living}} {{at a moment}} of {{profound}} and prolonged media transition: the old scripts by which media industries operated or consumers absorbed media content are being rewritten. As those changes occur, we need to work across the historic divide in academic research between work on media industries and work on media audiences. Media companies can no longer be meaningfully studied {{in the absence of an}} under-standing of how they relate to their consumers. By the same <b>token,</b> <b>consumers,</b> audi-ences, fan communities, users, call them what you wish, can no longer be meaningfully understood without a better understanding of the economic and technological contexts within which they operate. The articles contained within this special issue of Conver-gence, each in its own way, represents a rapprochement between industry studies and audience research. In this context, media can be seen as the key drivers and accelerators of a growing integration between culture and commerce. Brought down to first principles, media mediate – between people, communities, organizations, institutions, and industries. In the classic model, a small number of media companies were homogenizing cultur...|$|R
