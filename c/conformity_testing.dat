30|$|Being a {{real-time}} distributed system, ERTMS can {{be considered}} as complex industrial system. It also uses a great number of actors and, as it is a railway signalling system, it must comply with very strict safety constraints. It is then necessary to check and validate the ERTMS system in order to give confidence to all parts [17]. These checking activities suggest various techniques such as: static analysis, model checking, and <b>conformity</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Conformity</b> <b>tests</b> verify if an implementation satisfies the behaviour described in the specification. This method detects the errors of implementation by performing sequences of actions; in order to determine whether system behaviours are those initially specified. This type of test was developed for the validation of communication protocols [29]. <b>Conformity</b> <b>tests</b> have three steps: (1) the derivation of tests scenarios which aims to generate abstract test scenarios {{on the basis of the}} protocol specification, (2) allows the implementation of test scenarios in order to make them executable for a particular implementation, and (3) apply the implemented test scenarios in order to determine the conformity verdict.|$|R

First, the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) homogeneity in the reservoir was evaluated using Raman spectroscopy (mapping) : the API distribution within the industrial drug reservoirs {{was found to}} be homogeneous while API aggregates were detected in laboratory scale samples manufactured with a non optimal mixing process. Second, the crosslinking process of the reservoirs was monitored at different temperatures with NIR spectroscopy. <b>Conformity</b> <b>tests</b> and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed on the collected data to find out the relation between the temperature and the time necessary to reach the crosslinking endpoints. An agreement was found between the <b>conformity</b> <b>test</b> results and the PCA results. Compared to the <b>conformity</b> <b>test</b> method, PCA had the advantage to discriminate the heating effect from the crosslinking effect occurring together during the monitored process. Therefore the 2 approaches were found to be complementary. Third, based on the HPLC reference method, a NIR model able to quantify the API in the drug reservoir was developed and thoroughly validated. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression on the calibration set was performed to build prediction models of which the ability to quantify accurately was tested with the external validation set. The 1. 2 % RMSEP of the NIR model indicated the global accuracy of the model. The accuracy profile based on tolerance intervals was used to generate a complete validation report. The 95 % tolerance interval calculated on the validation results indicated that each future result will have a relative error below ± 5 % with a probability of at least 95 %.

In this contribution the quality objectives compiled by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) for a series of biophysical essential climate variables (ECVs) are investigated {{from the point of view}} of <b>conformity</b> <b>testing</b> as used in legal metrology. Unlike current validation efforts, <b>conformity</b> <b>testing</b> requires that the maximum permissible uncertainty of the candidate and reference ECV estimates does not exceed a predefined fraction of the applicable tolerance interval. Given that the GCOS accuracy criterion is defined with respect to a local reference it is the uncertainty of both the in situ and the satellite ECV estimates that matter. Our findings suggest that, 1) current GCOS quality objectives must be complemented before they may serve as quality requirements for <b>conformity</b> <b>testing,</b> 2) a consensus on the choice of decision rule must be sought (between data providers and users) since this has a direct impact on what is deemed compliant, and 3) the uncertainty associated with current field validation methods for biophysical ECVs is unlikely to meet the ISO- 13528 criteria.

40|$|The European {{train control}} system (ETCS) {{is one of the}} core parts of the European rail traffic {{management}} system (ERTMS) [1]. It has been specified by a European team in the last years [2]. The specification is published by the European Railway Agency (ERA). Different industry suppliers developed products according to this specification. Now those products have to be tested according to the testing requirements. Technical tests are used to prove that the product fulfil the technical requirements of the specification. They are called the <b>conformity</b> <b>tests.</b> Operational tests are used to show that the system fulfils the operational requirements of the railway operator. The idea presented here aims to show, that technical tests as well as operational tests can be defined according to a common standard. The main advantage of this approach is to perform the tests in the same lab environment. The system under test should be integrated in the Lab only once. Both kinds of tests can be executed without any modification of the lab integration. This leads on the one hand to a significant reduction of integration effort in the lab {{and on the other hand}} to a reduction of redundancy in the tests itself. This second increase in efficiency needs a methodical basis for the definition of the tests to be executed. This methodical base supports the optimization of the tests. Practically seen the approach allows identifying which parts of the requirements are already tested in the technical tests. In the next step the operational tests are designed by using test cases from the technical tests and adding the missing operational test cases. Finally the operational tests can be designed by focussing on the requirements which not tested yet. The full contribution shows the method of designing tests and the suitable test environment. As a perspective an approach for the generation of field test templates from the operational lab tests is given. The approach used for the <b>conformity</b> <b>tests</b> for ETCS can be extended for operational and safety lab tests as well as for operational field tests.
