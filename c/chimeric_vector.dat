40|$|Efficient {{infection}} with adenovirus (Ad) vectors based on serotype 5 (Ad 5) requires {{the presence of}} coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptors (CAR) and αv integrins on cells. The paucity of these cellular receptors {{is thought to be}} a limiting factor for Ad gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells. In a systematic approach, we screened different Ad serotypes for interaction with noncycling human CD 34 + cells and K 562 cells on the level of virus attachment, internalization, and replication. From these studies, serotype 35 emerged as the variant with the highest tropism for CD 34 + cells. A <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> (Ad 5 GFP/F 35) was generated which contained the short-shafted Ad 35 fiber incorporated into an Ad 5 capsid. This substitution was sufficient to transplant all infection properties from Ad 35 to the <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector.</b> The retargeted, <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> attached to a receptor different from CAR and entered cells by an αv integrin-independent pathway. In transduction studies, Ad 5 GFP/F 35 expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) in 54 % of CD 34 + cells. In comparison, the standard Ad 5 GFP vector conferred GFP expression to only 25 % of CD 34 + cells. Importantly, Ad 5 GFP transduction, but not Ad 5 GFP/F 35, was restricted to a specific subset of CD 34 + cells expressing αv integrins. The actual transduction efficiency was even higher than 50 % because Ad 5 GFP/F 35 viral genomes were found in GFP-negative CD 34 + cell fractions, indicating that the cytomegalovirus promoter used for transgene expression was not active in all transduced cells. The <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> allowed for gene transfer into a broader spectrum of CD 34 + cells, including subsets with potential stem cell capacity. Fifty-five percent of CD 34 + c-Kit+ cells expressed GFP after {{infection with}} Ad 5 GFP/F 35, whereas only 13 % of CD 34 + c-Kit+ cells were GFP positive after infection with Ad 5 GFP. These findings represent the basis for studies aimed toward stable gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells...|$|E

Wild-type AAV is a non-pathogenic member of the parvoviridae family and inherently replication-deficient. The broad transduction profile, low immune response {{as well as the}} strong and persistent transgene expression achieved with these vectors has made them a popular and versatile tool for in vitro and in vivo gene delivery. rAAVs can be easily and cheaply produced in the laboratory and, based on their favourable safety profile, are generally given a low safety classification. Here, we describe a method for the production and titering of chimeric rAAVs containing the capsid proteins of both AAV 1 and AAV 2. The use of these so-called <b>chimeric</b> <b>vectors</b> combines the benefits of both parental serotypes such as high titres stocks (AAV 1) and purification by affinity chromatography (AAV 2).

However, pre-existing anti-vector immunity may limit the practical application of rAd 3. In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence and neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers to Ad 3 and alternate serotypes in normal healthy adults in southern China. Sera samples had a high seroprevalence (80. 00 %) against Ad 3 and Ad 7 (85. 83 %), compared with Ad 14 (22. 50 %). Furthermore, 19. 17 % and 25. 83 % of samples had high-titer neutralizing antibodies to Ad 3 and Ad 7, respectively, compared with 3. 33 % against Ad 14. We constructed a chimeric adenovirus, rAd 3 H 14, designed to evade anti-vector immunity by replacing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) -expressing hexon of the rAd 3 EGFP vector with a hexon from Ad 14. The <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> rAd 3 H 14 was not neutralized in vitro efficiently by Ad 3 NAbs using sera from mice and normal healthy human volunteers.

Transcription of the episomal human MT-IIA gene is initiated from its authentic start sites and is regulated by the level of cadmium in the growth medium. The presence of the human MT-IIA gene allows the BPV replicon to function even though it is ligated to an intact copy of pBR 322.

Classical methods of gene transfer, such as transfection, are inefficient and limited mainly to delivery into actively proliferating cells in vitro. The development of viral vector gene delivery systems is beginning to circumvent these initial setbacks. Several kinds of viruses, including retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and herpes simplex virus, have been manipulated for use in gene transfer and gene therapy applications. As different viral vector systems have their own unique advantages and disadvantages, they each have applications for which they are best suited.

However, the role of NAbs directed against other capsid components, particularly the adenovirus fiber, remains unclear. Here we show that Ad 5 NAbs target both hexon and fiber fol-lowing vaccination and natural infection. Utilizing neutralization assays with capsid <b>chimeric</b> <b>vectors,</b> we observed that NAb responses to hexon appeared dominant and NAb responses against fiber were subdominant in sera from vaccinated mice, vacci-nated humans, and naturally exposed humans.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{recombinant}} of viral and bacterial systems have been engineered as vectors to express foreign genes for vaccination and/or gene therapy.

To circumvent this problem we developed a strategy using different <b>chimeric</b> <b>vectors</b> which share only the expression of common specific antigens desired for immunization.

Efficient adenovirus-mediated delivery of the L 1 element into cultured human cells results in subsequent retrotransposition and stable integration of the transgene. L 1 retrotransposition frequency was found to correlate with increasing multiplicity of infection by the <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector,</b> and further retrotransposition from newly integrated elements was not observed on prolonged culture.

We generated a series of chimeric Env proteins of Moloney murine leukemia virus containing EGFR ligands, where TLD was inserted into different regions. These chimeric proteins were successfully produced, if the translocation domain was not located at the immediate N-terminus of Env. The ability to transduce murine cells via the ecotropic receptor varied but correlated with the amount of Env proteins incorporated into the virions. <b>Chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> particles could bind to EGFR, demonstrating the functional exposure of the peptide ligand.

For several medical applications (prenatal diagnosis, artificial bone, vaccination, and cardiovascular disease), we demonstrate the applicability of these novel vectors. In addition, screening cell types derived from different species revealed that cellular receptors for human subgroup B adenoviruses are not conserved between rodents and primates.

This approach has allowed expression and over-expression of proteins of interest as well as the understanding of both virus life cycles and eukaryotic cell mechanisms. Beginning in the late eighties gene transduction has been applied to clinical trials but mainly restricted to cancer treatment and genetic diseases. More recently it has been proposed for the cure of infectious diseases (AIDS), vascular diseases and others (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease). Viral vectors have been progressively modified in order to increase their transduction efficiency and to reduce their toxicity, immunogenicity and inflammatory potential. In this respect, much has been done in the last few years. By adding genes belonging to other viral species to the vectors' DNA, scientists were able to re-direct their tissue-specificity or to control protein expression. More recently, in the attempt of overcoming the limitations of each viral species, so-called <b>chimeric</b> viral <b>vectors</b> have been generated by combining favourable features of two or more different viruses into one.

A recent clinical trial for X-CGD using a spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) –based γ-retroviral vector has demonstrated clear therapeutic benefits in several patients although complicated by enhancer-mediated mutagenesis and diminution of effectiveness over time due to silencing of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). To improve safety and efficacy, we have designed a lentiviral vector that directs transgene expression primarily in myeloid cells. To this end, we created a synthetic chimeric promoter that contains binding sites for myeloid transcription factors CAAT box enhancer–binding family proteins (C/EBPs) and PU. 1, which are highly expressed during granulocytic differentiation. As predicted, the chimeric promoter regulated higher reporter gene expression in myeloid than in nonmyeloid cells, and in human hematopoietic progenitors upon granulocytic differentiation. In a murine model of stem cell gene therapy for X-CGD, the <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> resulted in high levels of gp 91 phox expression in committed myeloid cells and granulocytes, and restored normal NADPH-oxidase activity.

40|$|Coexpression of {{different}} effector molecules {{from a single}} vector (a dual-function vector) may provide enhanced efficacy. Thus far most of the reported anti-HIV dual-function vectors express different effector RNAs as a chimeric molecule. In our study involving retroviral vectors coexpressing a U 5 ribozyme and either an anti-tat or anti-rev antisense RNA, chimeric vectors exhibit poor potency in several important functional aspects, including inhibition of HIV replication, protection against cytopathic effects, and suppression of target gene function. Surprisingly, such a poor efficacy of <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> function {{was not associated with}} a lower level of effector RNA expression. These results indicate that expression of two effector RNAs as a chimeric molecule can lead to interference, reducing their global biological effects. More importantly, we have demonstrated that such interference can be avoided by coexpressing these effector RNAs as separate molecules through a new dual-function vector, called a dual-effector cassette (Dec) vector, developed in this study. We also define some of the design alterations that might affect the efficacy of the Dec vector and demonstrate that forward-designed Dec vectors are more efficacious than reverse-designed Dec vectors, which express a lower level of effector RNA owing to the instability of the 5 ' effector cassettes in the provirus. We believe that the principle of Dec vector design may also be applicable for the coexpression of other therapeutic RNA effectors in many gene therapy applications.

It was found that SG 235 -TRAIL preferentially replicated in gastric cancer cell lines, SGC- 7901 and BGC- 823 compared to in normal human fibroblast BJ cells. Also, when compared with a replication-deficient <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> Ad 5 / 35 -TRAIL, SG 235 -TRAIL mediated a higher level of the transgene expression via viral replication in the cancer cells. Further, because of the more efficient cell-entry and infection, SG 235 -TRAIL induced stronger cell apoptosis than the Ad 5 CRAD vector, ZD 55 -TRAIL In addition, SG 235 -TRAIL in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug, taxol, produced a synergistic cytotoxic effect in cancer cells in vitro without causing significant toxicity to normal cells. In the gastric tumor xenograft mouse model, intratumoral SG 235 -TRAIL injection produced a significant antitumor effect 14 days after treatment. Pathological examination demonstrated TRAIL expression and associated apoptosis in majority of SG 235 -TRAIL-treated tumor cells. These results suggest that SG 235 -TRAIL is a potential novel, efficient anti-cancer agent, and in combination with taxol, it would be even more useful with considerably low toxic side effects.

Comparative immunogenicity studies between vectors of different serotype were performed in mice, with careful consideration of the infectious titer of vector preparations, since this parameter can confound studies based solely on viral particle estimation.

Yeast transformed with GAL 4 -bearing plasmid become constitutive for expression of the galactose/melibiose genes, even in normally repressing (glucose) medium. Multiple copies of the GAL 4 plasmid also increase expression of the structural genes in inducing (galactose) medium and can partially overcome the effects of a dominant super-repressor mutant, GAL 80 S. Using an internal deletion in GAL 4, we have demonstrated that these dosage effects are due to overproduction of GAL 4 positive regulatory product rather than an effect of the flanking sequences titrating out a negative regulator. These results point to the importance of competitive interplay between the positive and negative regulatory proteins in the control of this system. We have also used the dosage effect of GAL 4 plasmid in combination with different GAL 4 and GAL 80 alleles to create new phenotypes.

Intramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice with the chimeric constructs {{in the form of}} naked DNA elicited humoral responses to antigens from both viruses within 2 to 6 weeks postinjection. No anti-HCV responses were obtained in mice immunized with the vector expressing the HCV sequence in the nonfusion context. Sera from chimera-injected mice specifically recognized both HCV capsid and HBV surface antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot testing. Anti-HCV serum titers formed plateaus of approximately 1 : 3, 000; these remained stable {{until the end of the}} study (18 weeks postinfection). Anti-HBV immune responses were found to be lower in the chimera-injected animals (2, 000 mIU/ml). This is the first report of the use of DNA-based immunization for the generation of immune responses to an HCV protein. In addition, these findings show that it is possible to elicit responses to viral epitopes from two distinct viruses via DNA immunization with <b>chimeric</b> <b>vectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recombinant Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an {{attractive}} viral vector system owing to its ability to allow high efficiency of viral protein expression. To produce recombinant pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) virions, we designed a <b>chimeric</b> SFV/HIV <b>vector</b> system that contains both the HIV- 1 cis- and trans-acting elements under the transcriptional control of the SFV replicase and investigated {{the ability of the}} hybrid SFV/HIV system to produce lentiviral particles capable of transducing target cells. Co-transfection of target cells with the two helper SFV packaging system RNAs along with each SFV/Gag-Pol, SFV/VSV(G) as well as SFV/HIV- 1 vector unit replicon led to the generation of efficient transducing competent recombinant SFV/HIV particles. In contrast, co-transduction of target cells with the SFV/HIV chimeric virions produced recombinant particles with low transducing ability. Our data suggest that both the genomic and the subgenomic RNAs containing the HIV- 1 vector unit were negatively selected for incorporation into recombinant particles, {{despite the fact that the}} SFV-driven HIV- 1 vector replicon was the only one containing a lentiviral packaging sequence. The results of this study provide insights relevant to the design of <b>chimeric</b> lentiviral <b>vectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{adenovirus}} fiber {{protein is}} responsible for attachment of the virion to unidentified cell surface receptors. There {{are at least two}} distinct adenovirus fiber receptors which interact with the group B (Ad 3) and group C (Ad 5) adenoviruses. We have previously shown by using expressed adenovirus fiber proteins {{that it is possible to}} change the specificity of the fiber protein by exchanging the head domain with another serotype which recognizes a different receptor (S. C. Stevenson et al., J. Virol. 69 : 2850 - 2857, 1995). A chimeric fiber cDNA containing the Ad 3 fiber head domain fused to the Ad 5 fiber tail and shaft was incorporated into the genome of an adenovirus vector with E 1 and E 3 deleted encoding beta-galactosidase to generate Av 9 LacZ 4, an adenovirus particle which contains a chimeric fiber protein. Western blot analysis of the <b>chimeric</b> fiber <b>vector</b> confirmed expression of the chimeric fiber protein and its association with the adenovirus capsid. Transduction experiments with fiber protein competitors demonstrated the altered receptor tropism of the <b>chimeric</b> fiber <b>vector</b> compared to that of the parental Av 1 LacZ 4 vector. Transduction of a panel of human cell lines with the <b>chimeric</b> and parental <b>vectors</b> provided evidence for a different cellular distribution of the Ad 5 and Ad 3 receptors. Three cell lines (THP- 1, MRC- 5, and FaDu) were more efficiently transduced by the vector containing the Ad 3 fiber head than by the Ad 5 fiber vector. In contrast, human coronary artery endothelial cells were transduced more readily with the vector containing the Ad 5 fiber than with the <b>chimeric</b> fiber <b>vector.</b> HeLa and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were transduced at equivalent levels compared with human diploid fibroblasts, which were refractory to transduction with both vectors. These results provide evidence for the differential expression of the Ad 5 and Ad 3 receptors on human cell lines derived from clinically relevant target tissues. Furthermore, we show that exchange of the fiber head domain is a viable approach to the production of adenovirus vectors with cell-type-selective transduction properties. It may be possible to extend this approach to the use of ligands for a range of different cellular receptors in order to target gene transfer to specific cell types at the level of transduction...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{packaging}} strategy {{combining the}} salient features of two human parvoviruses, namely the pathogenic parvovirus B 19 and the nonpathogenic adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV), {{was developed to}} achieve erythroid cell-specific delivery as well as expression of the transduced gene. The development of such a <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> system was accomplished by packaging heterologous DNA sequences cloned within the inverted terminal repeats of AAV and subsequently packaging the DNA inside the capsid structure of B 19 virus. Recombinant B 19 virus particles were assembled, as evidenced by electron microscopy as well as DNA slot blot analyses. The hybrid vector failed to transduce nonerythroid human cells, such as 293 cells, as expected. However, MB- 02 cells, a human megakaryocytic leukemia cell line which can be infected by B 19 virus following erythroid differentiation with erythropoietin (N. C. Munshi, S. Z. Zhou, M. J. Woody, D. A. Morgan, and A. Srivastava, J. Virol. 67 : 562 – 566, 1993) but lacks the putative receptor for AAV (S. Ponnazhagan, X. -S. Wang, M. J. Woody, F. Luo, L. Y. Kang, M. L. Nallari, N. C. Munshi, S. Z. Zhou, and A. Srivastava, J. Gen. Virol. 77 : 1111 – 1122, 1996), were readily transduced by this vector. The hybrid vector was also found to specifically target the erythroid population in primary human bone marrow cells {{as well as more}} immature hematopoietic progenitor cells following erythroid differentiation, as evidenced by selective expression of the transduced gene in these target cells. Preincubation with anticapsid antibodies against B 19 virus, but not anticapsid antibodies against AAV, inhibited transduction of primary human erythroid cells. The efficiency of transduction of primary human erythroid cells by the recombinant B 19 virus vector was significantly higher than that by the recombinant AAV vector. Further development of the AAV-B 19 virus hybrid vector system should prove beneficial in gene therapy protocols aimed at the correction of inherited and acquired human diseases affecting cells of erythroid lineage...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{presently}} used adenovirus (Ad) vectors {{are based}} on serotype 5. However, the application of these vectors {{is limited by the}} native tropism of Ad 5. To address this problem, a series of fiber chimeric vectors were produced {{to take advantage of the}} different cellular receptors used by Ad of different subgroups. In this study we utilize an Ad 5 -based <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> containing sequences encoding the Ad 35 fiber knob domain instead of the Ad 5 knob (Ad 5 / 35 L) to analyze factors responsible for selection of intracellular trafficking routes by Ads. By competition analysis with recombinant Ad 5 and Ad 35 knobs we showed that the Ad 5 / 35 L vector infected cells through a receptor different from the Ad 5 receptor. Intracellular trafficking of Ad 5 and Ad 5 / 35 L viruses was analyzed in HeLa cells by tracking fluorophore-conjugated Ad particles, by immunostaining for capsid hexon protein, by electron microscopy, and by Southern blotting for viral DNA. These studies showed that the interaction with the Ad 35 receptor(s) predestines Ad 5 / 35 L vector to intracellular trafficking pathways different from those of Ad 5. Ad 5 efficiently escaped from the endosomes early after infection. In contrast, Ad 5 / 35 L remained longer in late endosomal/lysosomal compartments and used them to achieve localization to the nucleus. However, a significant portion of Ad 5 / 35 L particles appeared to be recycled back to the cell surface. This phenomenon resulted in significantly less efficient Ad 5 / 35 L-mediated gene transfer compared to that of Ad 5. We also demonstrated that the selection of intracellular trafficking routes was determined by the fiber knob domain and did not depend on the length of the fiber shaft. This study contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern the infection of retargeted, capsid-modified vectors which have potential application for hematopoietic stem cell and tumor gene therapy...|$|E
40|$|Following {{receptor}} binding and internalization, intracellular trafficking of adenovirus (Ad) among subgroups B and C is different, with {{significant amounts of}} Ad serotype 7 (Ad 7) (subgroup B) virions found in cytoplasm during the initial hours of infection while Ad 5 (subgroup C) virions rapidly translocate to the nucleus. To evaluate {{the role of the}} fiber in these differences, we examined intracellular trafficking of Ad 5, Ad 7, and Ad 5 f 7 (a <b>chimeric</b> <b>vector</b> composed of the Ad 5 capsid with the fiber replaced by the Ad 7 fiber) by conjugating Ad capsids directly with Cy 3 fluorescent dye, permitting the trafficking of the capsids to be examined by fluorescence microscopy. The human lung carcinoma cell line A 549 was infected with Cy 3 -conjugated viruses for 10 min followed by a 1 -h incubation. Ad 5 virions rapidly translocated to the nucleus (within 1 h of infection), while Ad 7 virions were widely distributed in the cytoplasm at the same time point. Interestingly, chimeric Ad 5 f 7 virions behaved similarly to Ad 7 but not Ad 5. In this regard, the percentages of nuclear localization of Ad 5, Ad 7, and Ad 5 f 7 at 1 h following infection were 72 % ± 4 %, 32 % ± 6 %, and 38 % ± 2 %, respectively. Consistent with these observations, fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that most of the Ad 5 DNA was detected at the nucleus after 1 h, {{but at the same time}} point, DNA of Ad 7 and Ad 5 f 7 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Quantification of the kinetics of Ad genomic DNA delivery to the nucleus using a fluorogenic probe-based PCR assay (TaqMan PCR) demonstrated that the percentages of nuclear association of Ad 5 DNA and Ad 5 f 7 DNA at 1 h postinfection were 80 % ± 13 % and 43 % ± 1 %, respectively. Although it has been generally accepted that Ad fiber protein mediates attachment of virions to cells and that fibers dissociate during endocytic uptake, these data suggest that in addition to mediating binding to the cell surface, fiber likely modulates intracellular trafficking as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{gene for}} an enzyme with single or dual {{specificity}} on complex carbohydrates has been transferred from its native host (Thermoanaerobium brockii), a thermophilic anaerobe, into Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Most {{of the gene}} coding region is in a 2. 2 -kilobase PstI fragment that is common to the E. coli and B. subtilis <b>chimeric</b> <b>vectors</b> pCPC 902 and pCPC 903, respectively. Although the T. brockii debranching enzyme secreted from B. subtilis was unglycosylated and had less thermostability, more enzyme was secreted from B. subtilis (0. 80 to 1. 0 U/ml) than from T. brockii (0. 23 U/ml). E. coli did not export any measurable enzyme. From the fermentation broth of B. subtilis containing pCPC 903, three active species of the debranching enzyme were separated; two species are possibly protease digestion products of the larger protein (105, 000 molecular weight). Whereas the enzyme can cleave all of the alpha- 1 [...] 6 glucosidic linkages (and none of the alpha- 1 [...] 4 bonds) in pullulan, it hydrolyzed mostly alpha- 1 [...] 4 and {{very few of the}} alpha- 1 [...] 6 linkages in starch.

ANCA are detected by different assays, but {{the correlation between the}} results of these assays is generally poor. The overall aim {{of the study was to}} provide a framework for the future development of new assays with an increased diagnostic yield. In order to express discrete epitopes of human PR 3 (hPR 3), the nonantigenic molecules murine PR 3 (mPR 3) and human leucocyte elastase (HLE) were used as a framework. We constructed recombinant <b>chimeric</b> <b>vectors</b> and were able to produce 6 hPR 3 /mPR 3 proteins and 3 hPR 3 /HLE proteins. Anti-PR 3 monoclonal antibodies differed in their binding pattern to the chimeras, but no distinct binding region could be identified for any monoclonal antibody. The recombinant hPR 3 /mPR 3 were also tested in ELISA with sera from patients with Wegener's granulomatosis with renal involvement. The results show that patients have antibodies to different constructs, indicating that the patients vary in their antibody repertoire from the beginning of the disease, and that patients may have antibodies from a broad range of clones early in the course of the disease. Recombinant hPR 3 /mPR 3 chimeric proteins have a potential to be used as antigens in future ANCA assays...|$|R

In cell cultures, these FFV-FCV vectors efficiently transduced and expressed a hybrid fusion protein consisting of the essential FFV Bet protein and the attached FCV E domains. The stability of the vectors in vitro was inversely correlated {{to the size of}} the heterologous insert. The deletion of a part of the FFV U 3 sequence in these FFV-FCV vectors did not interfere with replication and titer in cell cultures but increased the genetic stability of the hybrid <b>vectors.</b> Selected <b>chimeric</b> <b>vectors</b> were injected into immunocompetent cats and persisted in the transduced host concomitant with a strong and specific humoral immune response against vector components. In a substantial number of cats, antibodies directed against the FCV E domain were induced by the FFV-FCV vectors, but no FCV-neutralizing activities were detectable in vitro. When the vaccinated cats were challenged with a high-titer FCV dose, sterile immunity was not induced by any of the hybrid FFV-FCV vectors. However, the FFV-FCV vector with a truncated U 3 region of the long terminal repeat promoter significantly reduced the duration of FCV shedding after challenge and suppressed the appearance of FCV-specific ulcers. Possible mechanisms contributing to the partial protection will be discussed...|$|R
