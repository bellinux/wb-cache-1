25|$|Vitamin D (<b>calciferol)</b> {{is needed}} for several functions, {{including}} calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth. Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against osteoporosis. Vitamin D is produced in the body when ultraviolet rays from the sun hit the skin; outdoor exposure is needed because UVB radiation does not penetrate glass. It is present in salmon, tuna, mackerel and cod liver oil, with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks and beef liver, and in some mushrooms.|$|E
50|$|There is an {{important}} feature of calciferols toxicology, that they are synergistic with anticoagulant toxicants, that means, that mixtures of anticoagulants and calciferols in same bait are more toxic than a sum of toxicities of the anticoagulant and the <b>calciferol</b> in the bait, so that a massive hypercalcemic effect {{can be achieved by}} a substantially lower <b>calciferol</b> content in the bait, and vice versa, a more pronounced anticoagulant/hemorrhagic effects are observed if the <b>calciferol</b> is present. This synergism is mostly used in <b>calciferol</b> low concentration baits, because effective concentrations of calciferols are more expensive than effective concentrations of most anticoagulants.|$|E
40|$|The {{intracellular}} cGMP {{concentration in}} normal human cultured fibroblasts was increased 2 - to 3 -fold by 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol [1 alpha, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3] in a dose-dependent manner between 0. 01 nM and 1 microM. The response was detectable within 1 min, reached a maximum (225 % +/- 8 % of baseline) at 6 - 8 min, and {{was no longer}} detectable at 30 min. The half-maximal effect of 1 alpha, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 was at 1. 8 nM, and 24, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol showed an estimated EC 50 100 -fold higher. 1 beta, 25 -Dihydroxycholecalciferol, 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol, and cholecalciferol had no detectable effect. Human skin fibroblasts with three different types of 1 alpha, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 receptor defect {{did not respond to}} 1 alpha, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 exposure with cGMP increase; however, the same cells (like normal cells) responded to testosterone or sodium nitroprusside with a rapid rise of cGMP.

40|$|The fourth countrywide {{nutrition}} survey was initiated and co-ordinated by the Hungarian Food Safety Office jointly to the yearly Household Budget Survey of Hungarian Central Statistical Office in 2009. The dietary assessment {{was performed by}} trained interviewers and skilled dieticians using a complex questionnaire system, containing three-day diary, short food frequency questionnaire and questions on taking of dietary supplements and on prevalence of food allergy.

From fat soluble vitamins, the average daily intakes of vitamins A and D were lower than the national recommendations in case of both genders, meaning low intake for around 60 % (in case of retinol) and 80 – 90 % (in case of <b>calciferols)</b> of adults. The intakes of some water soluble vitamins belonging to B group, vitamin C and folates were low as well.

40|$|Nutritional {{genomics}} (nutrigenomics) {{is a broad}} {{field that}} relates the genome to nutrition, and includes the effects of dietary components on the expression of genes and on the repair of genetic damage. Bioactive forms of vitamin A (retinoids) and D (<b>calciferols),</b> for example, can modulate gene expression programs and thereby affect reproduction, development, and many other physiological functions, e. g., reviewed in [1 - 3], discussion below. An individual’s genetic and epigenetic uniqueness influences the ability to produce, metabolize, transport or store nutrients, and can result in unique nutritional requirements. Nutrients and other dietary factors can contribute to disease prevention and therapy through several strategies whereby their intake is increased or decreased to (a) help control the effects of genetic mutations that cause diseases or contribute to disease risk, and (b) influence expression of genes that typically lack such genetic mutations but contribute to disease risk. Nutritional epigenetics (nutriepigenetics, a term I use since 2008) is defined as one component of category b, and includes dietary factors that modulate gene expression {{through some of the}} covalent modifications of chromatin components. Such modifications create marks or patterns, e. g., DNA methylation, that may be heritable through somatic (mitotic) or germ cell (meiotic) divisions. Category a is the more classic domain of nutritional genetics (nutrigenetics) and this term {{can also be used to}} encompass dietary factor-dependent transcriptional modulation of gene expression that is not based on epigenetic patterns.

50|$|Additional {{anticoagulant}} {{renders the}} bait more toxic to pets {{as well as}} human. Upon single ingestion, solely calciferol-based baits are considered generally safer to birds than second generation anticoagulants or acute toxicants. A specific antidote for <b>calciferol</b> intoxication is calcitonin, a hormone that lowers the blood levels of calcium. The therapy with commercially available calcitonin preparations is, however, expensive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Calciferols</b> (vitamins D), {{cholecalciferol}} (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) {{are used}} as rodenticides. They are toxic to rodents {{for the same reason}} they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few IUs per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble vitamins, they are toxic in larger doses, causing hypervitaminosis. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes hypercalcemia, raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into ionised form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, CaHCO3+), which circulates dissolved in the blood plasma. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that blood vessels, kidneys, the stomach wall and lungs are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and excitation propagation between atrias and ventriculas), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol and 0.1% ergocalciferol when used alone, which can kill a rodent or a rat.|$|R
40|$|Context: In humans, {{few studies}} have {{compared}} the potencies of ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol in improving and maintaining vitamin D status. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate {{the effects of a}} single very large dose of both <b>calciferols</b> on serum changes of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D], 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25 (OH) 2 D], ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) at baseline, and at 3, 7, 30, and 60 d. Design: This was a prospective randomized intervention study. Setting: The study was performed in a nursing home residence. Participants: A total of 32 elderly female patients (age range 66 - 97 yr), with vitamin D deficiency was included in the study. Intervention: Participants were randomized into four groups of eight to receive a single dose of 300, 000 IU ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol by oral (os) or im route. Results: 25 (OH) D levels sharply increased at d 3 only when vitamins were given os. The 30 -d basal difference in serum 25 (OH) D was significantly greater after cholecalciferol os administration (47. 8 ± 7. 3 ng/ml) compared with other forms (D 3 im: 15. 9 ± 11. 3; D 2 os: 17. 3 ± 4. 7; D 2 im: 5 ± 4. 4; all P < 0. 001). The area under the curve (AUC) of the serum 25 (OH) D against time (AUC 60) was: D 3 os, 3193 ± 759 ng × d/ml vs. D 2 os, 1820 ± 512, P < 0. 001; and D 3 im, 1361 ± 492 vs. D 2 im, 728 ± 195, P < 0. 01. 25 (OH) D significantly influences PTH levels at 3 (P < 0. 03), 7 (P < 0. 01), 30 (P < 0. 01), and 60 d (P < 0. 05). At 60 d, the form of vitamin (cholecalciferol) significantly lowers PTH levels (P = 0. 037). Conclusions: Cholecalciferol is almost twice as potent as ergocalciferol in increasing serum 25 (OH) D, when administered either by mouth or im. 25 (OH) D plays a role in modulating serum PTH.

40|$|During {{the past}} 10 years {{considerable}} interest has developed regarding {{the problems and}} management of renal osteodystrophy and the related disorders of divalent ion metabolism which may accompany prolonged renal failure. In large part this interest has been forced upon us by the great incidence of clinically florid osseous disease which has accompanied prolonged treatment with hemodialysis and successful renal transplantation. Currently, attention is directed towards early recognition and definition of bone disease in patients with renal failure before clinically overt osteodystrophy has developed. The use of bone biopsy is now becoming a more routinely used adjunct to both the diagnosis and management. A second and recent stimulus to this interest {{has come from the}} significant advances in the understanding of the possible altered metabolism of the steroid, <b>calciferol</b> 1 (vitamin D), in the uremic state and, more particularly, an appreciation of the key role of the kidney in this process. Since the pioneering work of Liu and Chu [1] and the subsequent studies of Dent, Harper and Philpot [2] and Stanbury and Lumb [3], it has been recognized that many patients with renal insufficiency demonstrate both features of a deficiency of <b>calciferol</b> and a resistance to treatment with doses of <b>calciferol</b> which are physiologically effective in normal individuals. The major manifestations of this disorder include: a) intestinal malabsorption of calcium [4 - 11], b) a hypocalcemia resistant to correction with exogenous parathyroid extract [12, 13], and c) defective bone matrix and cartilage mineralization, e. g., rickets or osteomalacia [14 - 18]. The histological appearances of the latter are entirely similar to those of a simple nutritional <b>calciferol</b> deficiency. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that correction of the impaired calcium absorption and healing of the bone lesions may only be accomplished with the use of pharmacological doses of the <b>calciferol</b> steroids [2, 3, 17]. Moreover, it has not been possible to correlate the etiology of renal disease or the degree of renal insufficiency with therapeutic <b>calciferol</b> requirements. Kleeman et al [19] have emphasized that calciferol-resistance may occur in the earliest stages of renal failure and need not be manifest in an “all-or-none“ manner. In general, however, clinical azotemic osteodystrophy and/or calcium malabsorption are not usually seen until glomerular filtration is reduced to less than 20 to 30 ml/min or serum creatinine concentrations become less than 2. 5 mg/ 100 ml [11, 20, 21]...|$|E

When dispersed, intact cells were used, nuclear uptake of 1, 25 -dihydroxy[23, 24 (n) 3 -H]cholecalciferol [1, 25 (OH) 2 [3 H]D 3) was temperature-dependent, optimal at 45 min at 37 degrees C, and saturable. In competition experiments with other calciferols, the 1, 25 (OH) 2 [3 H]D 3 uptake showed specificity indistinguishable from that reported for 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 receptors from <b>calciferol</b> target tissues. Analysis of 1, 25 (OH) 2 [3 H]D 3 nuclear uptake in fibroblast strains from six normal adults (four male, two female) yielded an average binding capacity (R 0) of 10, 600 +/- 2, 000 (SEM) nuclear sites per cell and an apparent dissociation contant (Kd) of 0. 50 +/- 0. 07 (SEM) x 10 (- 9) M. Donor sex, donor age, or anatomic site of origin of the cell line did not affect the characteristics of uptake. Similar nuclear uptake was demonstrable with cultured MCF- 7 cells (derived from human breast cancer) when assayed in the same fashion. When hypertonic extracts of nuclei obtained from skin fibroblasts incubated with 1, 25 (OH) 2 [3 H]D 3 were subjected to centrifugation on sucrose gradients, a single peak of radioactivity sedimented at approximately 3 S; when excess 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 was coincubated during the cellular uptake phase, this 3 S peak was not observed. Molybdate was an essential buffer component for receptor stabilization during cell fractionation and sedimentation analysis. In summary, by using fibroblasts cultured from normal human skin, we have identified a process of nuclear uptake of 1, 25 (OH) 2 [3 H]D 3 with the affinity, saturability, and specificity characteristics of a steroid hormone [...] receptor interaction. This method should be useful in studying 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 recept physiology in cells from normal persons as well as in cells from patients who have disorders in the responsiveness of <b>calciferol</b> target tissues...|$|E

The species proved to be resistant to warfarin (up to 0. 5 %) and difenacoum (0. 005 %), but brodifacoum (0. 005 %) gave complete mortality after three days' feeding. <b>Calciferol</b> (0. 1 %), though toxic, was significantly unpalatable. Zinc phosphide (5. 0 %) presented in a choice test for two days against unpoisoned feed gave 100 % mortality, {{and appears to be}} the most suitable of these compounds for the control of M. auratus in the field...|$|E
