One of {{the most}} {{important}} indicators of use of electronic means (RECs), technical protection of information (TZI) is reliable, because any failure (non-functional), a structural unit of complex proofing may or may leak information outside the controlled area, or to external influence on a system where information is created, processed, stored or kept. The value of reliability of the RECs should be as high as possible and the means to achieve them must be provided even at the design stage to create a structural model of the future RECs. The highest quality is achieved RES parametric optimization of all or most of the initial parameters of the model. After the formation of a structural model of designing structural components of the RECs and determine their structural parameters and calculate the key features of the device. This makes it possible to calculate the values K of all single, partial and complex criteria. To achieve the highest quality to successive iterations to optimize the parametric variation of the primary values of variables and it allows to increase the resistance of RES to external mechanical influences, while maintaining the original shape and size of the selected design elements that are applied to these materials. The main objects of optimization in the RES must be structural and structural units of the first order (SKM 1) - the so-called cells and SMEs - a functionally complete RECs, which are placed on a plastic, metal or <b>ceramic</b> <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board (PCB). In total across a variety of RES SKM 1 is at least 67 - 85 % of the structural elements, so we can assume that they, and should be considered as basic objects, constructive and functional parameters of perfection to be achieved in the first place. For them, and must first be established methods of design of optimal structures. Numerical simulation shows that the rational layout of elements {{on the basis of the}} printed circuit board or substrate micro can, in some cases increase the probability of failure of RES by mechanical action on 45 - 50 %, and with heat - 20 - 35 %. As a result, the parametric optimization of structural topology of the modules with the above elements will be obtained and maximum reliability of the design RES. ????? ?? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ???????

40|$|Pulsed {{high power}} fast kickers {{are being used}} to change beam trajectories in {{particle}} accelerators. The fast rise and fall time of pulse waveform demands a transmission line structure for the kicker deflector design. The ideal design will be parallel metal plates. However, it uses very long straight sections to achieve the required deflection. In accelerators with constrained straight sections, high permeability materials such as ferrite have to be used to gain deflection efficiency. The transmission line kicker magnet is also referred as traveling wave kicker magnet. Its construction is based on distributed 1 -C cells along the longitudinal direction. The magnetic cells and capacitive cells are interleaved to simulate the characteristic impedance of a transmission line to minimize pulse reflection, and provide adequate frequency bandwidth to transmit the kicker pulse with fast rise and fall time. The magnetic cells are usually made of ferrite ceramics, but the capacitive cells have been made with different materials. For traveling wave kickers with higher impedance, the parallel plate vacuum capacitor has been used in CERN and KEK design. Others have used <b>ceramic</b> capacitors, <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> boards, and high permittivity ceramics as the capacitive cell. The high dielectric material has the advantage of compactness for low impedance kicker magnet construction. It continues to be very attractive for future kicker magnet applications. The high voltage phenomena associated with high dielectric ceramic materials have been widely reported in many industrial application areas. Their implication in the traveling wave magnet application has to be well understood. In this presentation, the areas requiring further quantitative study will be outlined...|$|R
