Application like ES file explorer uses smb protocol for file transfer which is less secure and has performance issues.

AVSDC is divided into following two parts: 1. Automatic Voice Signal Detection (AVSD) 2. Automatic Voice Signal Compression (AVSC) Automatic Voice Signal Detection (AVSD) is used to identify constitutional and unconstitutional voice signal automatically which is performed on the basis of frequency, pitch value, formant value, and sequence of words in the voice signal for several samples of the same voice. An underline purpose of AVSD is to identify fake voice in the security system. Frequency is being mapped to the frequency domain by computing its DFT using the FFT algorithm. Sequence of words is computed by continuously computing difference between absolute averages of two adjacent significant windows and comparing it to a predefined threshold. Word Identification System is part of AVSD which is designed to checkout whether recorded words in proper sequence are not. Normally, sometimes spoken words of voice may be recorded very fast, smoothly, or loudly. The main idea behind the word identification system is to first train it with several versions of the same word, thus yielding a “reference fingerprint”. Then, subsequent words can be identified based on how close they are to this fingerprint. The whole idea is evaluated on the basis of Euclidean distance theory. Automatic Voice Signal Compression (AVSC) takes. wav stereo file as an input and compress 50 to 60 percent of the source file at about 45 kbps with high quality voice signal by taking the help of adaptive wavelet packet decomposition and psychoacoustic model. AVSC takes. wav stereo file as an input and creates. wav mono file after compression. After compression minor distortion is also possible. The main feature of AVSC is that file extension does not change after compression. In other words, compression is done from. wav to. wav extension. AVSC takes. wav stereo file as an input and after compression it creates. wav mono file as an output. AVSC also computes entropy and SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) of the source file during the compression...|$|E
