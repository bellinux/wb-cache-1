60|$|The {{odds were}} too {{great for the}} assailants, who were forced at last to fall back along the dyke to the south gate and to {{re-enter}} the town. It was already five weeks since the English had arrived {{to take part in}} the defence, and the struggle now began upon a great scale -- thirty cannon and eight culverins opening fire upon the walls. The heaviest fire was on St. James' day, the 25th of July, when 4000 shots were fired between three in the morning and five in the afternoon. While this tremendous cannonade was going on, the boys could not but admire the calmness shown by the population. Many of the shots, flying over the top of the walls, struck the houses in the city, and the <b>chimneys,</b> <b>tiles,</b> and masses of masonry fell in the streets. Nevertheless the people continued their usual avocations. The shops were all open, though the men employed served their customers with breast and back pieces buckled on, and their arms close at hand, so that they could run to the walls at once {{to take part in the}}ir defence did the Spaniards attempt an assault upon them. The women stood knitting at their doors, Frau Menyn looked as sharply after her maids as ever, and washing and scouring went on without interruption.|$|R

It was {{one of a group of}} such businesses in the area, with others at Cardowan, Garnkirk, Heathfield and Glenboig. Gartcosh Fireclay Works eventually closed down in the 1950s, when local supplies of fireclay were exhausted.|$|R

5000|$|This cemetery's {{name means}} [...] "tile factory", {{as it was}} begun in the grounds of a tile works in 1915. The <b>chimneys</b> of the <b>tile</b> works were very visible and {{provided}} a means for the opposing side to calibrate their shells.

5000|$|There had {{probably}} been a pottery on the site in medieval times, {{as evidenced by the}} excavation of medieval tiles there. The pottery was founded in 1865 in the hamlet of Aller between the village of Kingskerswell and the town of Newton Abbot and had originally produced simple kitchenware. In 1868 it was taken over by John Phillips (born 1835 in Shaugh Prior), a clay merchant who lived in Newton Abbot. Phillips changed the focus of the company to make builders' earthenware—drainpipes, roof <b>tiles,</b> <b>chimney</b> pots and the like. The company was listed in an 1870 directory as [...] "Phillips, John & Co., manufacturers of architectural pottery and firebricks".|$|R
40|$|On November 24, 2004, Northern Italy {{was struck}} by a Ml= 5. 2 {{earthquake}} located near the Garda Lake. A few smaller events followed the main shock. The felt area was very large, ranging from Venice to Milan, and from Ljubljana (Slovenia) to Pisa. Significant damage occurred in the epicentral area, which is approximately the same of the October 30, 1901 earthquake. The day after the quake, reconnaissance teams performed a macroseismic survey of the affected area in order to define the damage scenario. Damage was mostly concentrated in the area west of Lake Garda, between the town of Salò and the Valsabbia valley. Damage to old masonry buildings consisted in partial collapses, falling of <b>chimneys</b> and roof <b>tiles</b> and large cracks in walls. Some churches and towers were also damaged. There was almost no damage to reinforced concrete (RC) structures...|$|R
40|$|In the {{industrial}} area of tiles craftsmen there is {{air pollution in}} the form of smoke, dust; and also noise pollution that coming from the chimney of ground grinding machine, ash and the <b>chimney</b> during the <b>tiles</b> burning season.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{generation}} {{contributes to}} obtain a more sustainable energetic system giving its potential to harvest waste heat and convert it into electric power. In the present study a computational optimal net generation of 108. 05 MWh/year was produced out of the flue gases of a real tile furnace located in Spain (the equivalent to supply the energy to 31 Spanish dwellings). This maximum generation has been obtained through the optimization of the hot and cold heat exchangers, the number of thermoelectric modules (TEMs) installed and the mass flows of the refrigerants, including the temperature loss of the flue gases {{and the influence of}} the heat power to dissipate over the heat dissipators. The results are conclusive, the installation of more TEMs does not always imply higher thermoelectric generation, so the occupancy ratio (δ) has to be optimized. The optimal generation has been achieved covering the 42 % of the surface of the <b>chimney</b> of the <b>tile</b> furnace with TEMs and using heat pipes on the cold side, which present smaller thermal resistances than the finned dissipators for similar consumptions of their fans. Moreover, the high influence of the consumption of the auxiliary equipment shows the importance of considering it to obtain realistic usable electric energy from real applications.
