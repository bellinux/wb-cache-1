5000|$|Plutarch {{wrote in}} his Life of King Artaxerxes that the Persian king was {{required}} {{to go to the}} ancient capital of Pasargadae for his coronation ceremony. Once there, he entered a temple [...] "to a warlike goddess, whom one might liken to Artemis" [...] (whose name is unknown today, nor can this temple be located), and there divested himself of his own robe, substituting the one worn by Cyrus I at his crowning. After this, he had to consume a [...] "frail" [...] of figs, eat turpentine and drink a <b>cup</b> of <b>sour</b> milk. Plutarch observed that [...] "if they add any other rites, it is unknown to any but those that are present at them".|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Ruddock {{moved to}} Crystal Palace on a free transfer, {{spending}} one season there before signing for Division Two side Swindon Town. He scored twice for Swindon, with goals against Colchester {{in the league}} and Hartlepool in the FA <b>Cup.</b> Relations turned <b>sour</b> when Ruddock refused to quit after being advised to do so by a specialist; during a period of time where the club was in serious financial difficulties. The club responded by appointing Steve Coppell as assistant manager and taking Ruddock's coaching duties away. The board eventually stopped paying Ruddock's wages in an attempt to drive him out. He took the club to an employment tribunal and in December 2002 received £57,000, representing money lost in wages and loyalty payments, with an agreement to terminate his contract as player/coach.|$|R
50|$|Brentford {{continued}} to play cup and friendly matches until 1896, when the club was elected into the Second Division of the London League. Buoyed by the goalscoring of Oakey Field and playing {{in front of an}} average home attendance of 1,500 at Shotter's Field, the Bees finished second behind Bromley to secure promotion to the First Division after losing just one match all season. Brentford had its finest season yet in its short existence in 1897-98, finishing as runners-up in the London League First Division and winning the London Senior Cup and the Middlesex Senior <b>Cup.</b> The only <b>sour</b> note was that the club had still yet to find a permanent home and finished the season having again lost money due to having to play matches on neutral grounds. Brentford would later re-enter the London League for the 1900-01 season and remained until the end of 1903-04, experiencing little success, due to the club's main focus being on the Southern League competition.|$|R
5000|$|AD Mlekara Subotica {{was founded}} on March 4, 1955 in Subotica under the name [...] "Co - {{operative}} Dairy - Independent Business Organization [...] ". In 1957, Mlekara Subotica purchased its first used trucks, a batch pasteurizer with ribbed cooler and a separator pasteurizer. At that time, the first chemical analyses of milk quality, regarding acidity analyses and the assessment of milk fat content were made. In May 1959 [...] "Co- operative Dairy" [...] became Mlekara Subotica. In 1963, instead of milk churns, glass packaging for milk and yogurt were introduced. In 1968, Mlekara Subotica is awarded with a Yugoslav Oscar for packaging, more precisely for plastic <b>cup</b> packaging for <b>sour</b> cream. New, so called “Dutch tanks” {{for the production of}} cheese were purchased. In 1972, Mlekara Subotica had moved to a new location. It meant better working conditions and {{a significant increase in the}} number of employees involving their better qualification structure.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Dyslipidemia {{has been}} {{considered}} as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. Alternative medicine has {{a significant role in}} treatment of dyslipidemia. There are controversial findings regarding the effects of sour tea on dyslipidemia. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of aqueous extract of dried calyx of sour tea on polygenic dyslipidemia. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was done on 43 adults (30 - 60 years old) with polygenic dyslipidemia that were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The control group was trained in lifestyle modifications at baseline. The intervention group was trained for lifestyle modifications at baseline and received two <b>cups</b> of <b>sour</b> tea daily, and both groups were followed up for 12 weeks. Lipid profile was evaluated at baseline, and six and 12 weeks following the intervention. In addition, dietary and physical activity assessed at baseline for twelve weeks. Results: Mean concentration of total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C significantly decreased by up to 9. 46 %, 8. 33 %, and 9. 80 %, respectively, after 12 weeks in the intervention group in comparison to their baseline values. However, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio significantly increased  by up to 3. 15 %, following 12 weeks in the control group in comparison to their baseline values. This study showed no difference in lipid profiles between the two groups, except for HDL-C concentrations. Conclusion: sour tea may have significant positive effects on lipid profile of polygenic dyslipidemia subjects and these effect might be attributed to its anthocyanins and inflation factor content. Therefore, sour tea intake with recommended dietary patterns and physical activity can be useful in regulation of lipid profile in patients with polygenic dyslipidemia...|$|R
