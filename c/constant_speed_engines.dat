50|$|Research is {{underway}} in large corporations and small companies. Focus has now switched to smaller vehicles. The system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars. A drawback {{was that the}} power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load. A British company (Artemis Intelligent Power) made a breakthrough introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor/pump, the Digital Displacement® motor/pump. The pump is highly efficient at all speed ranges and loads, giving feasibility to small applications of petro-hydraulic hybrids. The company converted a BMW car as a test bed to prove viability. The BMW 530i, gave double the mpg in city driving compared to the standard car. This test was using the standard 3,000 cc engine, with a smaller engine the figures {{would have been more}} impressive. The design of petro-hydraulic hybrids using well sized accumulators allows downsizing an engine to average power usage, not peak power usage. Peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator. A smaller more efficient <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> <b>engine</b> reduces weight and liberates space for a larger accumulator.|$|R

The work has been performed indoors at the Noise and Vibration Laboratory at Volvo Trucks, Göteborg. Partly in the powertrain rig where the truck cab, with standard noise muffler and noise shields, was built up around the driveline, and partly in the truck noise chamber where the rear tires where encapsulated. The sound power level in third octave bands was measured according to ISO 3744 using a parallelepiped measurement surface. The tested vehicle is a typical long distance truck with a 480 hp engine. The simulated load was 30 tonnes and 18 tonnes for the powertrain rig and the truck noise chamber respectively. The results indicate that the vehicle speed dependent source model shows too high values at higher speeds.

50|$|With the Liberty engine, {{operating}} at 500 to 2,000 rpm {{and with the}} Hispano-Suiza 300 hp {{operating at}} 1,400 to 2,200, {{it was found that}} the friction torque increases approximately as a linear function of <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> at a given air density, and approximately as a linear function of density at a <b>constant</b> <b>speed.</b> This means that the friction horsepower increases approximately as the square of the speed. Actually the reIation of torque and speedis such that the friction horsepower increases with speed raised to a power between the first and second, this power increasing with speed, approaching the square. The relation depends upon the <b>engine</b> design and <b>speed</b> and the air density.

There is no doubt that for a given process of combustion and at a <b>constant</b> <b>speed</b> the <b>engine</b> power is directly proportional to the weight of charge supplied; in other words, proportional to the charge density at the beginning of compression. As a consequence, if operating conditions are sensibly constant except for altitude, the engine power -will be closely proportional to the air density. The volumetric efficiency increases with increase of air temperature at constant pressure, so that power does not decrease as fast as the air density when the temperature is raised, due to changes in vaporization and heat transfer.|$|R
