40|$|The <b>Cable</b> <b>Board</b> {{has reached}} {{tentative}} conclusions that geothermal development and underwater cable transmission are technically, economically, financially and socially feasible. It {{is too early}} to determine whether the entire project can be developed by private entities or, if not, the extent of the role state government must play in the financing, construction, operation and ownership of the geothermal project. If the legislative recommendations made in this report are accepted, and a master coordinated development plan is drawn and permitted, we can then readily determine the capability of the private sector to carry out the plan, and the extent of state assistance or participation that is required. This report sets forth the preliminary views and recommendations of the <b>Cable</b> <b>Board</b> based upon its activities to date. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} years of the British Empire, with a number of states federated or close to independence, a treaty with clearer {{financial}} divisions, responsibilities, and governance was established that would eventually replace the Pacific <b>Cable</b> <b>Board.</b> A treaty Commonwealth Telegraph Agreement was signed between Commonwealth nations in London, 1948 that formed the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation.|$|R
50|$|The centre {{is housed}} in the {{original}} building used as the western terminus of the British Empire's worldwide undersea cable called the All Red Line. Originally {{the site of the}} Pacific <b>Cable</b> <b>Board</b> (PCB) <b>Cable</b> Station, which served as the eastern terminus of the trans-Pacific telegraph cable linking Canada to Fanning Island (1,600 kilometres south of Hawaii). The telegraph cable operated from 1901 to 1959.|$|R
25|$|In 1902, the Pacific <b>Cable</b> <b>Board</b> {{laid the}} first trans-Pacific {{telegraph}} cable from Bamfield, British Columbia to Fanning Island (Tabuaeran) in the Line Islands and from Fiji to Fanning Island, thus completing the All Red Line, {{a series of}} telegraph lines circumnavigating the globe completely within the British Empire. The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the British Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including Palmyra Island were disfavored {{due to the lack}} of adequate landing sites.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1890s, {{agreement}} was reached that the cable should be laid. However debate about management of the cable laying project and ownership of the completed cable continued for some years. Finally, {{it was agreed that}} funding should be shared between the governments of Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. A committee named the Pacific <b>Cable</b> <b>Board</b> was formed made up of members from each of these countries. The Pacific Cable Act (1901) gave this board responsibility for managing the project and operating the completed cable.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{in some detail}} the servo system of the Unimation Puma robot, a common laboratory and industrial robot. The Unimation controller has a classical hierarchical structure as shown in Figure 1. 1. The host, in the factory configuration an LSI- 11 / 2 running the VAL robot language, communicates with the Arm Interface Board (AIB) over a bidirectional parallel bus. The AIB in turn communicates with six digital servo boards over a custom wired DEC double-height backplane, see Figure 1. 2. These boards execute commands (such as position setpoint setting, reading current encoder values, and miscellaneous parameter setting) as well as implementing the position control loop. They connect through the backplane to the analog servo boards which implement nested velocity and current control loops.

There was a cat-like activity about the carpenter and his mates as they cut, sawed, lashed, and bolted together the various spars and planks which formed the raft.

50|$|Lining was dangerous, as it {{was only}} the single cable that {{prevented}} the vessel from being washed downstream and likely wrecked. Any use of a <b>cable</b> on <b>board</b> a vessel was also hazardous to the crew. On October 15, 1907, at 8:30 am, while Oregona was lining through Clackamas Rapids, the lining cable became tangled in the sternwheel of a nearby steamer, the Ruth. A deckhand on Oregona, Virgil K. Pollard, was caught in a loop of the cable, which tightened around his legs, severing both legs six inches (152 mm) above the ankles. The injured deckhand brought a legal action against the Ruth.|$|R
