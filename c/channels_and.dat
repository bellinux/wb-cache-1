5|$|Nemegt sediments {{preserve}} large river <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> {{soil deposits}} that indicate {{a far more}} humid climate than those suggested by the underlying Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts. Sediment was deposited in the <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> floodplains of large rivers. The rock facies of this formation suggest the presence of mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some flood control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined flood control <b>channels,</b> <b>and</b> other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E
5000|$|At Montezuma Castle National Monument, white-throated woodrat {{abundance}} {{was generally}} greater in an active riparian <b>channel</b> <b>and</b> floodplain than a mesquite bosque that was 7 to 13 feet (2-4 m) above the <b>channel</b> <b>and</b> floodplain and {{not subject to}} flooding. The active riparian <b>channel</b> <b>and</b> floodplain was dominated by desert willow, velvet ash, Arizona sycamore, and velvet mesquite. The mesquite bosque was dominated by velvet mesquite, catclaw acacia, and broom snakeweed. Despite greater abundance of white-throated woodrat in the active riparian <b>channel</b> <b>and</b> floodplain, body weights of male white-throated woodrat were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the mesquite bosque, suggesting that it was [...] "higher quality" [...] habitat.|$|R

5|$|The three known Deinocheirus {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of}} the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago. The rock facies of the Nemegt Formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Such large river <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> soil deposits are evidence of a far more humid climate than those found in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts occurred. Sediment was deposited in the <b>channels</b> <b>and</b> floodplains of large rivers.|$|E
