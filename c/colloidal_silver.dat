5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with <b>colloidal</b> <b>silver</b> have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered <b>colloidal</b> <b>silver</b> causes acute silver poisoning.

The standing water left following the rainfall caused concern of outbreaks of various diseases, including cholera. Consequently, the population was warned to boil or otherwise disinfect water to prevent disease. In areas where the storm's impact made it difficult to boil water due to the unavailability of gas or stoves, 70,000 jars with <b>colloidal</b> <b>silver</b> were distributed. Additionally, laboratory testing of refuse coming from individuals with gastrointestinary illnesses commenced as a precaution to identify outbreaks of cholera and other diseases, and over 82,000 vaccines were applied throughout the region.

40|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>colloidal</b> {{effects on}} the excited-state {{structure}} and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of p-N,N-dimethylaminobenzoic acid (DMABA) in aqueous cyclodextrin (CD) solutions have been investigated by UV-VIS absorption, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, and transient Raman spectroscopy. As the con-centration of silver colloids increases, {{the ratio of the}} ICT emission to the normal emission (Ia /Ib) of DMABA in the aqueous α-CD solutions are greatly decreased while the Ia /Ib values in the aqueous β-CD solutions are significantly enhanced. It is also noteworthy that the ICT emission maxima are red-shifted by 15 - 40 nm upon addition of silver colloids, implying that DMABA encapsulated in α-CD or β-CD cavity is exposed to more polar environment. The transient resonance Raman spectra of DMABA in <b>silver</b> <b>colloidal</b> solutions demon-strate that DMABA in the excited-state is desorbed from <b>silver</b> <b>colloidal</b> surfaces as demonstrated by the dis-appearance of νs (CO 2 −) (1380 cm− 1) with appearance of ν (C-OH) (1280 cm− 1) band, respectively.

Physicochemical properties, effectiveness against microorganism including  Staphylocoocous aureus ATCC 6538 P, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739,Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404, MRSA, Mycobacterium spp., HSV- 1 and H 1 N 1, and biocompatibility tests were carried out according to relevant standards. Results: X-ray diffraction (XRD) scan was performed on the sample and verify single phase of silver particles in the compound. The size of the silver particles in the solution, measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniqu, ranged 80 - 90 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed spherical shape with smooth surface of the silver nanoparticles. SilvoSept® reduced 5 log from the initial count of 107 CFU/mL of Staphylocoocous aureus ATCC 6538 P, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Aspergillus niger ATCC 16404, MRSA, Mycobacterium spp. Further assessments of SilvoSept solution exhibited a significant inhibition on the replication of HSV- 1 and H 1 N 1. The biocompatibility studies showed that the solution was non-allergic, non-irritant and noncytotoxic. Conclusion: Findings of the present study showed that SilvoSept® wound rinsing solution containing nano silver particles is an effective antiseptic solution against a wide spectrum of microorganism.
