5|$|In dogs, <b>canine</b> {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder {{can lead to}} self-inflicted injuries, for example <b>canine</b> lick granuloma. Captive birds are sometimes known to engage in feather-plucking, causing damage to feathers that can range from feather shredding to the removal of most or all feathers within the bird's reach, or even the mutilation of skin or muscle tissue.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, <b>canine</b> herpes, <b>canine</b> brucella, <b>canine</b> parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the <b>canine</b> distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest <b>canine</b> distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of <b>canine</b> distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb in lemurs {{normally}} {{consists of}} six teeth (four incisors and two canines), although indriids, monkey lemurs, and some sloth lemurs {{only have a}} four-tooth toothcomb due {{to the loss of}} either a <b>canine</b> or an incisor. Because the lower <b>canine</b> is either included in the toothcomb or lost, the lower dentition can be difficult to read, especially since the first premolar (P2) is often shaped like a <b>canine</b> (caniniform) to fill the canine's role. In folivorous (leaf-eating) lemurs, except for indriids, the upper incisors are greatly reduced or absent. Used together with the toothcomb on the mandible (lower jaw), this complex is reminiscent of an ungulate browsing pad.|$|E

40|$|Background: Palatally {{impacted}} maxillary <b>canines</b> {{may appear}} unsightly after treatment because {{of changes in}} position and colour. Aim: To determine if palatally impacted <b>canines</b> treated either by surgical exposure and orthodontic repositioning or by creation of space in the arch and unassisted eruption have different aesthetic outcomes. Methods: Twenty eight subjects with unilateral palatally impacted <b>canines</b> who had completed orthodontic treatment at least 6 months previously were recruited from three specialist practices. In 14 subjects the <b>canines</b> had been treated by surgical exposure, orthodontic extrusion and repositioning in the arch (SE group) and in the remainder the deciduous <b>canines</b> were extracted and excess space created in the arch for the <b>canines</b> to erupt naturally (OT group). The contralateral <b>canines</b> were used as controls. The mean pretreatment ages of {{the subjects in the}} SE and OT groups were 13. 5 (SD: 1. 6) years and 13. 5 (SD: 1. 3) years respectively. The position and colour of the <b>canines</b> were assessed on post-treatment study models and 35 mm slides using the American Board of Orthodontics Objective Grading System (ABO OGS) and subjective appraisal by two orthodontists. Each subject used a semantic scale to rate the aesthetic outcome of treatment. Results: Sixty four per cent of the treated <b>canines</b> in the SE group were significantly more ‘intruded’ than the treated <b>canines</b> in the OT group (p = 0. 004) and the control <b>canines</b> (p = 0. 004). The ABO OGS grades of the <b>canines</b> in the SE and OT groups were similar (p = 0. 173). While the assessors detected a lack of labial root torque and gingival margin changes in the <b>canines</b> in the SE group, the subjects in both groups were satisfied with the appearance of the <b>canines</b> post-treatment. Conclusions: Palatally impacted <b>canines</b> treated by surgical exposure, extrusion and orthodontic treatment {{were more likely to be}} displaced vertically (‘intruded’) after treatment than palatally impacted <b>canines</b> treated by extraction of the overlying deciduous <b>canines</b> and creation of excess space in the arch. Small occlusal and aesthetic changes detected by the orthodontists, but not the ABO OGS, did not appear to detract from the satisfaction of the subjects with the results of orthodontic treatment.

50|$|Babirusa are {{notable for}} the long upper <b>canines</b> in the males. The upper <b>canines</b> of male {{babirusa}} emerge vertically from the alveolar process, penetrating though the skin and curving backward over {{the front of the}} face and towards the forehead. The lower <b>canines</b> also grow upwards. The <b>canines</b> of the female are either reduced or absent. The structure of the male’s <b>canines</b> vary by species. In the golden babirusa, the upper <b>canines</b> are short and slender with the alveolar rotated forward to allow the lower <b>canines</b> to cross the lateral view. The Togian babirusa also has the same characteristics and the upper <b>canines</b> always converge. The North Sulawesi babirusa has long and thick upper <b>canines</b> with a vertically implanted alveolar. This caused the upper <b>canines</b> to emerge vertically and not cross with the lower <b>canines.</b> Babirusa also vary by species in other characteristics. The golden babirusa has a long, thick pelage that is white, creamy gold, black or gold overall and black at the rump. The pelage of the Togian babirusa is also long but not as that of the golden babirusa. The Togian babirusa has a tawny, brown or black pelage that is darker on the upper parts than in the lower parts. The North Sulawesi babirusa has very short hair and appears bald. The female babirusa has only one pair of teats.|$|R

5|$|Lemurs are unusual {{since they}} have great {{variability}} in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and <b>canine</b> tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true lemur (genus Eulemur), the gray-headed lemur (E. albocollaris) and the red lemur (E. rufus), exhibit size differences in <b>canine</b> teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), but {{the difference between the}} genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the blue-eyed black lemur (E. macaco), to nearly imperceptible {{in the case of the}} common brown lemur (E. fulvus).|$|E

5|$|Salanoia durrelli has a {{more robust}} {{dentition}} than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas. The first and second upper incisors are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced diastema (gap) from the <b>canine</b> tooth. The <b>canine</b> is more robust than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The first upper premolar is small, but {{the second and third}} are larger; these two teeth are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The fourth premolar is large, as is the first molar. The second upper molar is less than one-third the size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed mongoose, which is about two-thirds the size of the first molar. The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower <b>canine,</b> premolars, and first molar are well-developed. The second molar is broad, but smaller than in the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{differences in}} the root and canal configurations of mandibular permanent anterior incisors and <b>canines</b> in an Iranian population by means of Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images. Materials and Methods: Four hundred CBCT images of mandibular permanent incisors and <b>canines</b> that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated. Vertucci´s classification {{was used to evaluate}} the number of roots, number of root canals, root lengths, root curvatures and canal types. Results: Totally 632 central incisors, 614 lateral incisors and 608 <b>canines</b> were evaluated. The average length of the mandibular central, lateral incisors and <b>canines</b> was 21. 3 ± 0. 10, 21. 9 ± 0. 13 and 25. 1 ± 0. 11 mm, respectively. All of the mandibular central and lateral inci-sors had one root, but the incidence of single-rooted mandibular <b>canines</b> and two-rooted mandibular <b>canines</b> was 96. 3 % and 4. 7 %, respectively. The majority of mandibular cen-tral, lateral incisors and <b>canines</b> had one canal (72. 7 %, 70. 6 % and 71. 8 %, respectively).

5|$|The skull {{is similar}} in shape to that of M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper <b>canine</b> (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The <b>canine</b> is less {{well-developed}} than in M.mystacinus. There is a clear cusp present {{on the side of}} the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M.mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but M.brandtii has an even larger cusp on P4.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right <b>canine.</b> Like other therocephalians, the <b>canine</b> of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider {{near the top of the}} tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the <b>canine</b> tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E
40|$|Agenesis of {{permanent}} <b>canines</b> {{is a rare}} condition, and that of both maxillary and mandibular permanent <b>canines</b> is extremely rare. It may occur either isolated or in association with other dental anomalies. Reports of such cases are very scarce in the literature. Need for early diagnosis of such conditions should be emphasized because of functional, esthetic, and psychological problems which should be evaluated and treated appropriately. The present paper presents a report of bilaterally missing permanent maxillary and mandibular <b>canines.</b> This case might contribute in the future studies of incidence of agenesis {{of permanent}} <b>canines...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Both the maxillary and mandibular <b>canines</b> {{are called}} the [...] "cornerstone" [...] of the mouth because they are all located three teeth away from the midline, and {{separate}} the premolars from the incisors. The location of the <b>canines</b> reflect their dual function as they complement both the premolars and incisors during chewing. Nonetheless, the most common action of the <b>canines</b> is tearing of food. There is a single cusp on <b>canines,</b> and they resemble the prehensile teeth found in carnivorous animals. Though similar, there are some minor differences.|$|R
50|$|The incisors {{are often}} reduced in ruminants, and are {{completely}} absent {{in the upper}} jaw. The <b>canines</b> are enlarged and tusk-like in the Suina, and are used for digging {{in the ground and}} for defense. In ruminants, the males' upper <b>canines</b> are enlarged and used as a weapon in certain species (mouse deer, musk deer, water deer); species with frontal weapons are usually missing the upper <b>canines.</b> The lower <b>canines</b> of ruminants resemble the incisors, so that these animals have eight uniform teeth in the frontal part of the lower jaw.|$|R
5|$|The upper incisors {{have two}} cusps {{and the upper}} <b>canine</b> has three—a large central one, a small but {{well-developed}} one at the back, and a small cuspule at the front. The front upper premolar is projected outside the toothrow, so that the <b>canine</b> before it and back premolar behind it touch. The first lower incisor has two cusps and the second has three. On the second lower molar, the protoconid cusp is notably taller than the hypoconid; these cusps are about as high in T.goodmani.|$|E
5|$|Their skulls {{are fairly}} narrow and elongated, with small braincases. Their <b>canine</b> teeth are {{relatively}} long. Sexual dimorphism {{of the skull}} is more pronounced than in corsac foxes, with female red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males, with wider nasal regions and hard palates, as well as having larger canines. Their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower muzzles, less crowded premolars, more slender <b>canine</b> teeth, and concave rather than convex profiles.|$|E

5000|$|Nimravids {{are placed}} in tribes by some authors to reflect closer {{relationships}} in genera within the family. Some nimravids evolved into large toothed, cat-like forms with massive flattened upper <b>canines</b> and accompanying mandibular flanges. Some had dentition similar to felids, or modern cats, with smaller <b>canines.</b> Others had moderately increased <b>canines</b> in a more intermediate relationship between the saber-toothed cats and felids. The upper <b>canines</b> were not only shorter, but also more conical, {{than those of the}} true saber-toothed cats (Machairodontinae). These nimravids are referred to as [...] "false sabre-tooths".|$|R

5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, <b>canine</b> distemper, infectious <b>canine</b> hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E
