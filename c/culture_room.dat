40|$|The {{achievement}} of productive goals in plant mass propagation with {{the efficiency and}} efficacy demanded from market competence of in vitro plants nowadays has an unstopped increase of workers productivity, mainly the laminar flow hood operators which are the fundamental force for the in vitro production and its fundamental indicators.

Before leaving for there, Gillian sends Mika to the Kyoto Summit, where the Chief was going to attend (and the Snatcher-Chief was going to attack the leaders).

40|$|Facing the {{controversial}} {{memory of the}} Risorgimento, Fascism was compelled to measure itself against Garibaldi, the nation's most celebrated and popular hero. The result was an exaltation of the alleged continuity between Redshirts and Blackshirts, marked by an emphasis on patriotic voluntarism that removed Garibaldi's adherence {{to the principles of}} liberty and democracy from his legacy. The article shows that the eclectic nature of Fascist <b>culture</b> left <b>room</b> for more radical interpretations that didn't fit the image of Garibaldi as a "disciplined revolutionary"...|$|R
30|$|The culturing {{method used}} in the present study is based on Kühne and Heller [26]. Coconut fiber was used as {{substrate}} (CFS; e.g., Exo Terra® Plantation Soil) and was defaunated by deep-freezing briquettes at temperatures[*]≤[*]−[*] 18  °C for at least 24  h. Rearing cages (35 [*]×[*] 35 [*]×[*] 60  cm, Aerarium size M; Papa Papillion) were each equipped with two stainless steel gastronomical containers filled with substrate. For substrate preparation, 200  g of frozen CFS was mixed with 1  l of water, resulting in approximately 2.9  l of moist substrate. Moistened CFS is biologically inert and requires additional organic material to promote fungal growth. The pre-moistened substrate for one container was mixed with 100  g of shredded oatmeal (average grain size 4  mm), resulting in a substrate depth of approximately 5  cm in the containers. After a large number of adults hatched in a cage, the content of one of the CFS containers was replaced. The temperature and humidity in the <b>culturing</b> <b>room</b> ranged from 20 to 30  °C and 50 to 70 %, respectively, and the light cycle was set to 12 / 12  h. Humidity loss through evaporation was compensated for every working day by spraying water on the substrate surface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flavonoids are {{compounds}} which act as antioxidants in both {{plant and}} human. These substances {{are found in}} reproductive tissues. Tobaccos expressing ORF of PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1 (PAP 1) involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were used for investigating the flavonoid profiles and antioxidant activity of petals and compared to wild type (WT) tobacco. Approximately two months, the tobacco grown in a <b>culturing</b> <b>room</b> had produced flowers for harvesting. The petal tissues were extracted with the solvent of acidic methanol and water. These extracts were measured the specific wavelength of flavonoid derivatives by using a spectrophotometer. The petal extract of H 7 line showed the highest content of all detected flavonoid subgroups. However the petal extract of transgenic line H 5 and H 7 had {{significantly higher levels of}} anthocyanin (pelargonidin) than those of the other transgenic and WT tobaccos. An antioxidant activity of the petal extract was evaluated by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•) assay. An effective concentration of the extract which scavenged DPPH radical by 50 % (EC 50) was presented. EC 50 of the H 5 and H 7 transgenic extracts was approximately two folds less than that of WT extract Therefore anthocyanin may highly affect on antioxidant activities...|$|R
