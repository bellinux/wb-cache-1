40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the influence of applied load and rotational speed on the performance of a 100 mm diameter plain journal bearing with two axial grooves located at ± 90 º to the load line has been carried out. The applied load varied from 2 to 10 kN, whereas the rotational speed ranged from 1000 to 4000 rpm. Measurements of hydrodynamic pressure, temperature profiles at the oil-bush and oil-shaft interfaces, oil flowrate and minimum film thickness under steady state conditions have been performed and the results discussed. The operating conditions were found to affect significantly the temperature profile inside the bearing. At low eccentricity tests the maximum temperature occurred at the unloaded lobe of the bearing, with the downstream groove contributing poorly to bearing cooling. As eccentricity increased, a temperature increase in the loaded lobe of the bearing was observed, along with a temperature decrease in the unloaded lobe. At high eccentricities the downstream groove was found to contribute significantly to bearing <b>cooling.</b> <b>Shaft</b> temperature and oil outlet temperature {{did not seem to be}} significantly affected by increasing load...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the safety, procedure time and rate of complete ablation of this new modality. Material and methodsHospital medical ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. A total of 98 nodules in 72 patients (59 male, 13 female; mean age 57 (± 4. 6) years, range 50 – 70 years) with HCC were treated with microwave ablation at our institution from June 2010 to February 2011. A 14 G <b>cooled</b> <b>shaft</b> Amica probe was introduced into the tumors under analgesic sedation and by US guidance. The patients were then followed up with contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) and serum α-fetoprotein levels. ResultsOne month after therapy, complete ablation was obtained in 96 % (94 / 98) nodules. The complete ablation rate in tumors ⩽ 3 cm and those > 3 cm were 98 %, and 94 %, respectively. MW ablation success was higher with nodules ⩽ 3 cm (57 / 58, 98. 3 %) in comparison to nodules > 3 cm (37 / 40, 92. 5 %) : however, the difference was non-significant (P= 0. 301). No complication occurred related to the ablation procedure, only minor complications post-ablation, as pain in (3 / 72) patients, mild fever in (48 / 72) patients, and discharge from wound in (2 / 72) patients. No local recurrence was detected, however, new lesions at other sites of the liver occurred in 11 (15 %) patients. ConclusionSonographically guided percutaneous microwave ablation proved to be safe, fast, and effective for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|R

30|$|There {{has been}} a {{recently}} increasing interest about MWA for SRMs [20]. MWA was developed to overcome the major limitations of RFA in the liver; i.e. the heat-sink effect. Microwave technology {{is based on the}} application of an electromagnetic wave (915 – 2, 450  MHz) through an antenna that causes the tissue water molecules to rotate and re-orientate, thus increasing their kinetic energy resonating with the applied waves. The latter produces heat and increases tissue temperature to nearly 100  °C. Compared to RFA, no grounding pads are necessary and a larger area is ablated as higher temperatures are reached within the tumour regardless of tissue electrical conductance. Moreover, MWA operates independently of any electrical current convection and is not limited by tissue impedance, desiccation or charring and heat sink phenomena. The most recent microwave generators using the higher frequency of 2, 450  MHz are producing more homogeneous and more spherical ablation results without the “rat-tail” ovoid shape ablation results of the first generation 9.15 -MHz devices [21, 22]. In addition, internally <b>cooled</b> antenna <b>shafts</b> have been developed to enhance efficacy at higher energies without collateral damage. Hence, 2, 450 -MHz devices with internal cooling are becoming the norm nowadays for the predictable ablation of tumours up to 4 – 5  cm in a variety of solid organs.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the prediction of the low cycle thermal fatigue behavior of a component in a developmental (ATD) high pressure liquid oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) for the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). This component is called the Turnaround Duct (TAD). The TAD is a complex single piece casting of MAR-M- 247 material. Its function is to turn the hot turbine exhaust gas (1200 F hydrogen rich gas steam) such that it can exhaust radially out of the turbopump. In very simple terms, the TAD consists of two rings connected axially by 22 hollow airfoil shaped struts with the turning vanes placed at the top, middle, and bottom of each strut. The TAD is attached to the other components of the pump via bolts passing through 14 of the 22 struts. Of the remaining 8 struts, four are equally spaced (90 deg interval) and containing a cooling tube through which liquid hydrogen passes on its way to <b>cool</b> the <b>shaft</b> bearing assemblies. The remaining 4 struts are empty. One of the pump units in the certification test series was destructively examined after 22 test firings. Substantial axial cracking was found in two of the struts which contain cooling tubes. None of the other 20 struts showed any sign of internal cracking. This unusual low cycle thermal fatigue behavior within the two cooling tube struts is the focus of this study...|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the billets for rolling. In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the roller hearth furnace. In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled shaft rollers, namely rollers without insulation, rollers with insulating screens placed between the barrel and the shaft, and rollers with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of rollers with water-cooled shaft greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the <b>cooling</b> water and <b>shaft</b> was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled shaft rollers of various designs are explored. The water-cooled shaft rollers without isolation, rollers with screen and rollers with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a pipe and shaft, as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the barrel of roller allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the furnace rolls with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{project was}} {{performed}} in collaboration with Scania CV AB, Engine Materials group. The purpose with the project was to investigate different ceramic TBC (Thermal Barrier Coating) thermal insulation properties inside the combustion chamber. Experimental testing was performed with a Single-Cylinder engine with TBC deposited on selected components. A dummy-valve was developed and manufactured specifically for this test in order to enable a water cooling system and to ease the testing procedure. The dummy-valve consists of a headlock, socket, valve poppet and valve shaft. Additionally, a copper ring is mounted between the cylinder head and the valve poppet to seal the system from combustion gases. Thermocouples attached to the modified valve poppet and valve shaft measured the temperature during engine test to calculate the heat flux. The TBCs consisted of three different materials: 7 - 8 % yttrium-stabilized zirconia (8 YSZ), gadolinium zirconia and lanthanum zirconia. The 8 YSZ TBC was tested as standard, but also with microstructural modifications. Modifications such as pre-induced segmented cracks, nanostructured zones and sealed porosity were used. The {{results indicated that the}} heat flux of 8 YSZ-standard, 8 YSZ-nano and 8 YSZ-segmented cracks was in level with the steel reference. In the case of 8 YSZ-sealed porosity the heat flux was measured higher than the steel reference. Since 8 YSZ-standard and 8 YSZ-sealed porosity are deposited with the same powder it is believed that the high heat flux is caused by radiative heat transfer. The remaining samples have had some microstructural changes during engine testing. 8 YSZ-nano had undergone sintering and its nanostructured zones became fewer and almost gone after engine testing leading to less heat barrier in the top coat of the TBC. However, for 8 YSZ-segmented cracks and gadolinium zirconia lower heat flux was measured due to the appearance of horizontal cracks. These cracks are believed to act as internal barriers as they are orientated perpendicular to the heat flow. During long-time (5 hour) engine tests the 8 YSZ-standard exhibited the same phenomena: a decrease in heat flux due to propagation of horizontal cracks. One-dimensional heat flux was not achieved and the main reason for that was caused by heating and <b>cooling</b> of the <b>shafts</b> outer surface. However, the dummy-valve system {{has proven to be a}} quick, easy and stable to perform tests with a Single-Cylinder engine. Both water-cooling and long-time engine tests were conducted with minor issues. The dummy-valve has been further developed for future tests. Changes to the valve shaft are the most remarkable: smaller diameter to reduce heat transfer and smaller pockets to ensure better thermocouple positioning. Another issue was gas leakage from the combustion chamber through the copper ring and valve poppet joint. The copper ring will be designed with a 1 mm thick track to improve sealing, hence better attachment to the valve poppet...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Large cooling systems consume up to 25 % of {{the total}} {{electricity}} used on deep level mines. These systems are integrated with the water reticulation system to provide chilled service water and cool ventilation air. Improving the energy efficiency of these large cooling systems is an important electrical demand-side management initiative. However, {{it is critical that}} the service delivery and system performance be maintained so as to not adversely affect productivity. A novel demand-side management strategy, based on variable water flow, was developed to improve the energy efficiency of large cooling systems like those found on deep mines. The strategy focuses on matching the cooling system supply to the demand through the use of modern energy efficient equipment, such as variable speed drives. The strategy involves the modulation of evaporator, condenser, bulk air cooler and pre-cooling water according to partial load conditions. A unique central energy management system was developed to integrate the proposed strategies on large cooling systems. The system features a generic platform and hierarchical network architecture. Real-time energy management is achieved through monitoring, optimally controlling and reporting on the developed strategy. The system is robust and versatile and can be applied to various large cooling systems. The feasibility of the strategy and energy management system was first investigated through the use of an adapted and verified simulation model and a techno-economic analysis. The strategy was then implemented on four large mine cooling systems and its in situ performance was assessed as experimental validation. The results of the Kusasalethu surface cooling system are discussed in detail as a primary case study while the results of the Kopanang, South Deep South Shaft and South Deep Twin <b>Shaft</b> <b>cooling</b> systems are summarised as secondary case studies. The potential to extend the variable water flow strategy to other industrial cooling systems is assessed through an investigation on the cooling system of the Saldanha Steel plant. Results indicate that, over a period of three months, average electrical load savings of 606 - 2 609 kW (29. 3 - 35. 4 %) are realised on the four systems with payback periods of 5 - 17 months. The average electrical load saving between the sites is 33. 3 % at an average payback period of 10 months. The service delivery and performance of the cooling system and its critical subsystems are not adversely affected. The potential to extend the method to other large cooling systems is also shown. The developed variable water flow strategy is shown to improve the energy efficiency of large cooling systems, making a valuable contribution towards a more sustainable future. This thesis is presented as a detailed discussion of the entire research process. The key results have also been summarised in a series of five research articles attached as independent annexures. Three articles have been published in international scientific journals, one has been presented at and published in the proceedings of an international conference and one is still under review.
