5|$|The 300 pages {{removed from}} the A Game of Thrones {{manuscript}} served as {{the opening of the}} second book, entitled A <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings. It was released in February 1999 in the United States, with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages. A <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings was the first book of the Ice and Fire series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on The New York Times Best Seller list in 1999.

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Marvel vs. Capcom: <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Super Heroes was {{announced}} by Capcom on December 1, 1999. The game, titled Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, was initially {{developed for the}} Sega NAOMI arcade board, marking Capcom's first attempt at a fighting game outside of the CP System II and III hardware systems. It features several significant gameplay changes from <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Super Heroes, such as three-on-three tag team battles, a new character assist system, and a more simplified control scheme. Marvel vs. Capcom 2 also includes a roster of 56 playable fighters, drawing numerous character sprites from Capcom's previous Marvel-licensed fighting games. Following its release in Japanese arcades in 2000, the game received ports to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox, Xbox 360, and iOS devices {{over the course of}} twelve years.|$|E
5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E

5|$|By 1862, navies across Europe {{had adopted}} ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either {{completed}} or under construction, though the British vessels were larger.

5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter.
