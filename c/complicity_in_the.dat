5|$|On 27 February 2002, a train {{carrying}} Hindu pilgrims {{was burned}} {{outside the town}} of Godhra, killing 59 people. The incident {{was seen as an}} attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks. The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced. Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread. The then-Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and several high-ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the violence, as were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim-owned properties. In April 2009, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases. In 2012, Modi was cleared of <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> violence by the SIT and BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, who later held a cabinet portfolio in the Modi government, was convicted of having orchestrated one of the riots and sentenced to 28 years imprisonment.

40|$|A {{holistic}} {{analysis of}} the implication of businesses in genocides that combines historical evidence with tentative theorization is so far unavailable. This paper aims to contribute to start to fill this gap and, ultimately, to start a process of preventive learning concerning private sector involvement in genocides. Based on a literature review, the paper identifies four main roles – victim, preventer, direct accomplice and indirect accomplice – and three main motivations – profit maximization, economic survival and institutional pragmatism – concerning corporate <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> genocides. Subsequently, <b>the</b> paper explores the concrete roles that companies played <b>in</b> three of <b>the</b> most uncontested cases of corporate <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> genocide: <b>the</b> Jewish, Kurdish and Darfurian genocides. The paper compares <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which scholars have analyzed the roles of companies in these genocidal processes and the motivations that drove companies to play this particular role. Based on these case illustrations, the most pertinent knowledge gap concerning corporate <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> genocides is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of empirical data about the interests and motives driving corporate decision-making throughout genocides. The paper concludes that this knowledge gap {{needs to be addressed}} if we are to better understand and potentially prevent corporate <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> genocide...|$|R

40|$|This article {{outlines}} a ‘mutual inquiry’ based {{approach to}} supervision using techniques,  concepts and insights drawn from social work supervision experience, a current Ph. D.  institutional ethnographic research project and intersectionality. Good supervision of social work {{students and staff}} can progress efforts towards identifying and combatting discrimination, important steps towards a more socially just society. Reducing  discrimination also improves the quality of service provision with clients, often members  of the most marginalised groups <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community. Supervision to reduce discrimination needs to be shaped by humility rather than the more popular goal of competence. Humility is fostered when a supervisor and supervisee consider their work together from the standpoints of clients, and purposefully contemplate their <b>complicities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creation  and maintenance of discriminatory practices. This supervision approach aims to create the  vision, and ability, to challenge discriminatory policies and practices as they are normalised  and inflect at individual, supervision, organisational and societal levels...|$|R

5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate.

Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E
5|$|With {{political}} and geographic division came religious division. One {{part of the}} Armenian Church claimed it wanted to be separate from the head, whose seat was in Echmiadzin, Armenian SSR. Some Armenians in the US thought Moscow tried to use the Armenian Church to promote Communists' ideas outside the country. The Armenian Church thus separated into two branches, Echmiadzin and Cilician, and started to operate separately. In the US, Echmiadzin branch churches of the Armenian Apostolic Church would not admit members of the ARF. This {{was one of the}} reasons why the ARF discouraged people from attending these churches and brought the representatives from a different wing of the church, the Armenian Catholicate of Cilicia, from Lebanon to the US. In 1933, members of ARF were convicted in the assassination of Armenian archbishop Levon Tourian in New York City. Prior to his murder, the archbishop had been accused of being exclusively pro-Soviet by the ARF. The ARF was legally exonerated from any direct <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assassination.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, {{and he was}} apprehended at {{his home}} in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking laudanum shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.|$|E

He was transferred east as strategos of the Thracesian Theme but, {{as soon as his}} <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affair was confirmed, was recalled to Constantinople. There he was imprisoned, beaten and publicly paraded in the Mese along with the other conspirators, and later tonsured and forced to enter the Stoudios Monastery. Theodora herself was placed in a convent, but she apparently continued to conspire with Diogenes, who planned to take advantage of Romanos's absence on campaign in the East in 1032 to escape to the Balkans. The plot was leaked to Romanos by Theophanes, metropolitan of Thessalonica, and the conspirators were arrested. Diogenes was brought to the Palace of Blachernae for interrogation by John the Orphanotrophos, but he committed suicide, throwing himself off a wall, rather than confess under torture and implicate his fellow conspirators.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all this, Captain Pierre-Jean Daniel André, {{the head}} of the Marash detachment, {{requested}} additional reinforcements but, due to the indecisiveness of his superior, Lt.

Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French had already lost the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed. On 21 January, General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attacks and demanded that they {{put an end to the}} hostilities.

5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' <b>complicity</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assassination of King Premislaus in 1296.
