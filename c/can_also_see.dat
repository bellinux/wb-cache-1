5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
25|$|From Xalapa you <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the Pico de Orizaba, {{the highest}} peak in Mexico (5,366m or 18,490 feet). It {{is also the}} third highest peak in North America.|$|E

25|$|Visitors <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> {{remains of}} the former Enderly sawmill and farm, {{including}} the Enderly family burying ground, by driving west along U.S. Route 44/55 a short distance past the West Trapps Trailhead, and turning right onto Clove Road to the Preserve's Coxing Trailhead.|$|E
25|$|The {{right-hand}} side constant requires four indices {{and is a}} fourth-rank quantity. We <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> that this quantity must be a tensor {{because it is a}} linear transformation that takes the strain tensor to the stress tensor. We can also show that the constant obeys the tensor transformation rules for fourth-rank tensors.|$|E
25|$|The Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) in Auckland {{displays}} {{a replica of}} Pearse's aircraft. For the alleged centenary of Pearse's flight, a replica motor was added. The two, combined successfully, became airborne. Visitors to the museum <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> his last flying machine {{and the remains of}} his first aircraft.|$|E

25|$|From the 1970s, {{the city}} had a sizable {{population}} growth. The city then extended to the Causse d'Auge. In the 1980s and 1990s, one <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> that the department was depopulating overall, while its prefecture was expanding. Culture and sport took more importance {{in the life of}} the city.|$|E
25|$|Today, most {{developed}} countries have {{a network of}} weather radars, which remains the main method of detecting signatures likely associated with tornadoes and other severe phenomenons as hail and downbursts. Radar is always available, in places and times where spotters are not, and <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> features that spotters cannot, {{in the darkness of}} night and processes hidden within the cloud as well as invisible processes outside the cloud.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{scientific}} community, {{there is already}} considerable agreement {{in the form of}} the schematics used to represent electronic circuits, chemical symbols, mathematical symbols, and the Energy Systems Language of systems ecology. We <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the international efforts at regularizing symbols used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the internet.|$|E

25|$|From {{the above}} angle sum formula we <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> that the Earth's surface is locally flat: If we draw an {{arbitrarily}} small triangle {{in the neighborhood}} of one point on the Earth's surface, the fraction f of the Earth's surface which is enclosed by the triangle will be arbitrarily close to zero. In this case the angle sum formula simplifies to 180°, which we know is what Euclidean geometry tells us for triangles on a flat surface.|$|E
25|$|A {{day at the}} National Museum of Rural Life {{gives an}} {{opportunity}} for visitors {{to get back to}} the land and experience the traditional way of life as it was on the rural and partly mechanised Scottish farm of the 1950s. Ploughing, sowing, haymaking and harvesting are all carried out on this working farm. Interpretation guides enable visitors to understand and appreciate the many activities which are part and parcel of the Scottish farming year. Tractor rides take visitors to the farm where they <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the herd of pedigree Ayrshire cattle which calve from January–March being milked every day at 3.00pm and the Kittochside flock of Scottish blackface ewes (sheep) which lamb in early April.|$|E
25|$|Ten days later, on 6 November, Kiyoaki has {{dinner with}} his parents; they discuss his otachimachi (divination ritual), {{that had been}} held on 17 August 1909, and mention that Satoko has just {{rejected}} an offer of marriage. This explains her mysterious question. Kiyoaki and his father play billiards, then go for a stroll that reminds Kiyoaki of his father's former womanising. The marquis tries {{to persuade him to}} go with him to a brothel and he walks away in disgust. Later he cannot sleep, resolving to take revenge on Satoko for deliberately perplexing him. We are shown Kiyoaki's bedroom: a screen bearing poems of Han Shan, and a carved jade parrot. We <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> that Kiyoaki has three moles in a row {{on the left side of}} his torso, a fact that becomes important in later books.|$|E

25|$|In versus mode, four {{additional}} {{players can}} {{take control of}} the special infected—apart from the witch, who remains computer-controlled. Each infected player is randomly assigned a class of special infected when they enter a spawn mode. While in spawn mode, the infected can quickly roam around the map in search of an appropriate place in which to spawn. This location must be sufficiently distant from any survivor, out of the line of sight of any survivor, and outside restricted areas such as safe rooms. Upon death, the infected player must wait up to 10–25 seconds before re-entering spawn mode, depending on how many players are on the infected team. When a tank is spawned in the game, infected players receive a message indicating which player will control it. The human-controlled infected can see their teammates' outlines through walls similar to the survivors, but <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> each survivor's outline, which is colored according to the survivor's health and fades out if the survivor refrains from attacking, running and vocalizing. Vertical pathways exclusive to the infected, such as pipes and vines, are marked with animated symbols for the infected players. These can be climbed and used for ambushes.|$|E
25|$|About 57 {{percent of}} Russia is tundra—a treeless, marshy plain. The tundra is Russia's northernmost zone, {{stretching}} from the Finnish border {{in the west to}} the Bering Strait in the east, then running south along the Pacific coast to the northern Kamchatka Peninsula. The zone is known for its herds of wild reindeer, for so-called white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and for days of total darkness in winter. The long, harsh winters and lack of sunshine allow only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although several powerful Siberian rivers traverse this zone as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean, partial and intermittent thawing hamper drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps of the tundra. Frost weathering is the most important physical process here, gradually shaping a landscape that was severely modified by glaciation in the last ice age. Less than one percent of Russia's population lives in this zone. The fishing and port industries of the northwestern Kola Peninsula and the huge oil and gas fields of northwestern Siberia are the largest employers in the tundra. With a population of 180,000, the industrial frontier city of Norilsk is second in population to Murmansk among Russia's settlements above the Arctic Circle. From here you <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the auroras (northern lights).|$|E
25|$|These rocks {{were later}} unconformably {{covered by the}} Cape Supergroup. The Cape Supergroup is divided into eight {{formation}}s, the three oldest of which are present on the Peninsula. The lowest present is the reddish Graafwater formation which consist of shales and sandstone. The Graafwater Formation can be clearly seen in the cutting on the second hairpin bend as the Ou Kaapse Weg (road) goes up the slope from Westlake on to the Silvermine plateau. In the cutting one <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>see</b> the abrupt and obvious transition into the Table Mountain Sandstone (or, as it is currently known, the Peninsula Formation Sandstone) above it. Looking up the slope from below to the first hairpin bend, the granite basement on which the Graafwater formation rests is visible. And in the cutting at the first hairpin bend, the ocher-colored, gritty clay into which the granite weathers is clearly displayed. The relatively thin Graafwater layer (no more than about 60–70m thick on the Cape Peninsula) is overlain by the prominent Peninsula Formation, which consist mainly of hard, erosion resistant, quartzitic sandstone, which form the high, prominent, almost vertical cliffs of the Cape Peninsula. At {{the very top of}} Table Mountain, at Maclear's Beacon, is a small remnant of the Pakhuis Diamictites, better represented in the Cederberg Mountains, 200km to the north of Cape Town.|$|E
