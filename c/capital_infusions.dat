25|$|In 1825, Leavitt {{moved to}} New York City {{and went into}} {{business}} with his brother-in-law Daniel Appleton, who formerly worked as a Boston dry goods merchant but who had founded D. Appleton & Co., a large store on Exchange Place opposite the Customs House, to sell books. Appleton put up the capital for the founding of a publishing business with his brother-in-law Leavitt. The store on Exchange Place was divided into two sections, with Appleton's son William later taking charge of the bookselling functions. After five years of partnership, and feeling he could continue his business without further <b>capital</b> <b>infusions</b> from his brother-in-law, Jonathan Leavitt went into business for himself, opening a store at Broadway and John Streets and hiring George Palmer Putnam (then aged 16) as his apprentice and right-hand man. Appleton and his son subsequently moved their business to what was known as Clinton Hall, on Beekman Street, where they established themselves as well-known booksellers. With his partnership with Appleton dissolved, Leavitt became the leading publisher of religious and theological works in New York city.|$|E

50|$|Co-promotion plays a {{major role}} in the {{pharmaceutical}} industries because in today’s market, pharma companies are in a situation of falling productivity. Accessing to new products through association with biotech companies allows pharma companies to expand their influence and guarantee their success over the market. The industry itself has a complex manufacturing and as a consequence a less competitive market. Therefore, those companies prefer to make co-promotion agreements because they can be able to have a more stable revenue stream which is strategically preferred. Co-promotion is also considered as an advantage for emerging companies in terms of <b>capital</b> <b>infusions,</b> sharing of risks for product development and for regulatory or commercialisation expertise.|$|E

5000|$|What {{causes the}} {{existence}} of zombie banks are bad loans. In slow economies, businesses who borrowed from banks become unable to pay the loans back. The <b>capital</b> <b>infusions</b> received primarily from the government, but also from central bank loans, form zombie banks. This phenomenon is generally referred to as regulatory forbearance. It is giving the lender leverage to enable the banks to postpone the recognition of their losses. The government is giving zombie banks leeway in hopes {{that they will be}} able to make profits over time to cover and reverse their losses and revitalize. Rather than pressing businesses for repayment, zombie banks extend their loans with the money received from the government, which in turn causes {{the existence of}} zombie companies.|$|E

5000|$|Trying {{to deflate}} {{speculation}} and keep inflation in check, the Bank of Japan sharply raised inter-bank lending rates in late 1989. This sharp policy caused the bursting of the bubble and the Japanese stock market crashed. Equity and asset prices fell, leaving overly leveraged Japanese banks {{and insurance companies}} with books full of bad debt. The financial institutions were bailed out through <b>capital</b> <b>infusions</b> from the government, loans and cheap credit from the central bank, {{and the ability to}} postpone the recognition of losses, ultimately turning them into zombie banks. Yalman Onaran of Bloomberg News writing in Salon stated that the zombie banks were {{one of the reasons for}} the following long stagnation. Additionally Michael Schuman of Time magazine noted that these banks kept injecting new funds into unprofitable [...] "zombie firms" [...] to keep them afloat, arguing that they were too big to fail. However, most of these companies were too debt-ridden to do much more than survive on bail-out funds. Schuman believed that Japan's economy did not begin to recover until this practice had ended.|$|E
50|$|PEGs {{spend much}} time {{developing}} strategic plans and an investment case for a new platform to determine why they are buying a business and how to generate an attractive return. This analysis is usually even more comprehensive for businesses that are new to a PEG. For add-on acquisitions, PEGs sometimes lean more on the expertise of its relevant portfolio company's management to determine the fit, synergies and strategic benefits of a transaction. For new platforms, PEGs view each transaction as stand-alone. There are no synergies, {{there is only a}} transaction with an investment rationale on how to grow the business and generate a targeted return. That rationale is the driver behind the deal, and it defines how the PEG creates value through things like <b>capital</b> <b>infusions,</b> operating partners and even future add-on acquisitions. As a result, the strategy behind the deal is more open-ended. The PEG has a greater degree of operating flexibility and seeks more avenues of growth to maximize the probability of a successful investment.For new platforms, PEGs require that the company not only be self-sustaining, but be scalable. The ability to grow the company is the rationale behind the deal. The PEG seeks avenues of growth to maximize value of the investment.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Feldstein {{was widely}} {{considered}} a leading candidate to succeed chairman Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. This {{was in part}} due to his prominence in the Reagan administration and his position as an economic advisor for the Bush presidential campaign. The New York Times wrote an editorial advocating that Bush choose either Feldstein or Ben Bernanke due to their credentials, and the week of the nomination The Economist predicted that the two men had the greatest probability of selection out of the field of candidates. Ultimately, the position went to Bernanke, possibly because Feldstein was a board member of AIG, which announced the same year that it would restate five years of past financial reports by $2.7 billion. Subsequently, AIG suffered a massive financial collapse that {{played a central role in}} the worldwide economic crisis of 2007-08 and the ensuing global recession. The firm was rescued only by multiple <b>capital</b> <b>infusions</b> by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, which extended a $182.5 billion line of credit. Although Feldstein was not explicitly linked to the accounting practices in question, he had served as a Director of AIG since 1988. In March 2007, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation announced that one of four 2007 Bradley Prizes to honor outstanding achievement would be awarded to Feldstein. [...] On September 10, 2007, Feldstein announced that he would be stepping down as president of NBER effective June 2008.|$|E

5000|$|The {{problem of}} debt {{overhang}} {{was used as}} a justification by governments to inject capital into banks around the world after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the subsequent falls in stock markets worldwide. Nevertheless, many governments in the financial crisis of 2008, including the United States, primarily bought newly issued preferred stock. Preferred stock is similar to debt in that it gets paid before common stock; it also pays regular dividends that are similar to interest. Thus, the <b>capital</b> <b>infusions</b> of Troubled Assets Relief Program's Capital Purchase Program (TARP CPP) in the United States may have done little to cure debt overhang problems in the United States largest banks. Academic research suggests that if the government bought common stock or toxic assets in troubled banks that the debt overhang problem would be better corrected. [...] Nevertheless, if a bank is very insolvent, subsidies will have to be extremely large to correct the problems of debt overhang and unsecured debt and preferred stock holders may have to bear some losses. [...] Interviews with many bank executives found that many banks were not eager to increase lending after receiving TARP funds. [...] The Congressional Review Panel, created to oversee the TARP, concluded on January 9, 2009 that, [...] "Although half the money has not yet been received by the banks, {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} have been injected into the marketplace with no demonstrable effects on lending." ...|$|E
