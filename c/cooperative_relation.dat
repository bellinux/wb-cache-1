40|$|Abstract: How {{and why did}} {{human being}} acquire the ability of verbal communication? To {{consider}} the problem concerned with the origin of a verbal communication, we should consider why verbal communication brings a profit {{for the survival of}} individuals. In our previous study we examined the condition under which common words to express objects emerge among agents who pursue their own profit by computer simulations. The results indicated that the word which points out an object and a <b>cooperative</b> <b>relation</b> emerges, when agents can obtain more profit from the object by cooperation. However, neither a word nor a <b>cooperative</b> <b>relation</b> for non-profitable objects such as a predator was emerged. Then, what kind of environmental condition brings altruistic behaviors among agents? In the previous study the duplication and death of agents were determined by a comparative assessment. In this study we examine whether altruistic behavior with common words emerges without mutual mimicry of words among agents when agents are evaluated by an absolute assessment. The result suggests that selection of agents by absolute evaluation brings altruistic behaviors, however, stable cooperative behavior with common words emerges under only narrow range of selection pressure...|$|E

40|$|When most of {{academic}} approaches of inter-firm cooperation focus essentially on the <b>cooperative</b> <b>relation,</b> {{the aim of}} this paper is to show, building upon L. Boltanski and P. Bourdieu's works, that it is necessary, in order to understand the mechanisms of cooperation, to study above the relation itself, the subjectivity of the partners. This conducts to reconstruct the socioprofessional trajectories of the key-actors and to appreciate their proximity. Our main hypothesis is that the farther their trajectories are, the less possible the cooperation is. This hypothesis is debated through the diachronic case study of a cooperation. inter-firm cooperation;socioprofessional trajectories;desingularisation;habitus;agreement. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{variation}} of the minimum cooperative guards problem, called the minimum weakly cooperative guards problem, both are the variations of the art gallery problem. The <b>cooperative</b> <b>relation</b> between stationary guards is represented by a guards visibility graph in which all vertices correspond to guards and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the corresponding guards can see each other in the polygon. Our problem requires that not only the number of guards which can see the given polygon is minimized but also the resulting guards visibility graph must have no isolated vertices. The NP-hardness of the minimum weakly cooperative guards problem for simple polygons directly follows from that of the minimum cooperative guards problem. We propose an optimal linear time algorithm to solve the problem for 1 -spiral polygons which is based upon the dynamic programming approach...|$|E

A new <b>cooperative</b> <b>relation</b> between global and detailed routers is introduced {{to improve the}} successful routing ratio. The actual numbers of available tracks (capacity), {{which could be used}} to route the nets, are calculated during detailed routing to be used at global routing. 100 % successful routing ratio of MCM benchmarks has been obtained. This router consists of two phases with two different ways of grid assignment to decrease the communication cost. Each phase consists of cooperative global and detailed routing processes. The first phase is aimed for routing short nets using few messages. Remaining nets are routed in the second phase. In the first phase, we divide the routing area into square partitions and assign one partition to each processor. Then, we rotate these square partitions to route all short nets around the boundaries. In the second phase, the routing area is divid [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The public {{increasingly}} holds companies {{accountable for}} environmental misbehavior in their supply chains. To offset that risk corporations start initiatives to green their supply chains. Yet suppliers {{often fail to}} properly participate in these initiatives. This paper presents a conceptual framework to explain supplier participation in green initiatives, by investigating customer requirements, supplier readiness, relational norms and customer investment as possible drivers. The framework and hypotheses were tested using survey data of 54 German automotive suppliers. Partial least squares methodology was deployed for hypothesis testing. The study found supplier readiness and customer requirements to be significant drivers in supplier participation. Relational norms and customer investment did not per se yield significant importance for explaining supplier participation, but when taking into account firm size, the data suggests that <b>cooperative</b> <b>relation</b> norms and customer investment work as an additional driver in green supply chain management for larger suppliers. This research {{is one of the}} few studies that explore drivers for supply chain participation at the supplier's level...|$|E

In this text we investigate the existence of a Lyapunov function associated to a gradientlike system, semigroups or evolution processes. Because of that, a detailed study of Morse theory plays a central role. The applicability of the results explained here is exemplified by studyng the attractor of a three dimensional mutualistic model of two plants in competition and a pollinator with <b>cooperative</b> <b>relation</b> with plants. Also we compare the dynamical properties of the system {{in the absence of the}} pollinator. We observe how cooperation is a common fact to increase biodiversity.

40|$|Abstract Background Nitroglycerin can induce {{relaxation}} of swine carotid artery without sustained reductions in [Ca 2 +] i or myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) phosphorylation. This has been termed force suppression and {{been found to}} correlate with ser 16 -phosphorylation of heat shock protein 20 (HSP 20). We tested {{for the existence of}} this mechanism in a smooth muscle that is not responsive to nitric oxide. Methods Isometrically mounted mucosa free rabbit bladder strips were contracted with carbachol and relaxed with 8 -Br-cGMP, forskolin, or isoprenaline. Results Contraction was associated with a highly <b>cooperative</b> <b>relation</b> between MRLC phosphorylation and force such that very small increases in MRLC phosphorylation induced large increases in force. Relaxation induced by 8 -Br-cGMP, forskolin, or isoprenaline did not shift the MRLC phosphorylation-force relation from that observed with carbachol alone, i. e. there was no force suppression. HSP 20 content was negligible (approximately two hundred-fold less than swine carotid). Conclusion The lack of force suppression in the absence of HSP 20 is consistent with the hypothesized role for HSP 20 in the force suppression observed in tonic smooth muscles. </p...|$|E
