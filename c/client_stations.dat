Augmented stereo views results from superimposing 3 D anatomical models with real organ views. A reliable distributed framework for relaying stereoscopic visual feedbacks between a telerobotic server and a <b>client</b> <b>station</b> is proposed. The distributed components are based on DirectX, Visual C#, and Window sockets. We used a multi-threaded execution to promote concurrency in grabbing, transmitting, receiving, processing, and displaying image data using head-mounted display (HMD) technology. The <b>client</b> <b>station</b> provides components that support augmented reality (AR), i. e. superimposing animated graphic model with real views from the operating site.

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a hybrid medium access scheme {{that can provide}} a {{virtually}} collision-free environment for an infrastructure high-speed WLAN.

In the proposed scheme, every station employs the standard CSMA mechanism and the master station schedules backoff timers for every <b>client</b> <b>station.</b> The master station sends the backoff timer information together with the data or control frames destined to each given <b>client</b> <b>station.</b> A piggybacking frame exchange mechanism is provided to enhance throughput of the proposed system and a prioritized backoff-timer scheduling scheme is given to provide QoS support.

40|$|The high {{bandwidth}} demand of Internet applications has recently driven {{the need of}} increasing the residential download speed. A practical {{solution to the problem}} is to aggregate the bandwidth of 802. 11 access points (APs) backhauls in range. Since 802. 11 devices are usually single radio, the communication to APs on different radio channels requires a time-division multiple access (TDMA) policy at the <b>client</b> <b>station.</b> With an in-depth experimental analysis and a customized 802. 11 driver, in this paper, we show that the usage of multi-AP TDMA policy may cause degradation of the TCP throughput and an underutilization of the AP backhauls. We then introduce a simple analytical model that accurately predicts the TCP round-trip time (RTT) with a multi-AP TDMA policy and propose a resource allocation algorithm to reduce the observed TCP RTT with a very low computational cost. Our proposed scheme runs locally at the <b>client</b> <b>station</b> and improves the aggregate throughput up to 1. 5 times compared to state-of-the-art allocations. We finally show that the throughput achieved by our algorithm is very close to the theoretical upper bound in key simulation scenarios...|$|R

Douglas was CEO and Todd Frostad, formerly of Digital River and a commercial real estate businessman, was president and co-owner. The company hired 5 other meteorologists.

The metric introduced in this association mechanism measures the real-time traffic load through channel based load detection and suits both coordinated and uncoordinated wireless mesh networks. Because of the random characteristics of wireless links and {{the variability of}} network conditions, dynamic re-association should be involved. To avoid association oscillation during re-associations, we in-troduce oscillation avoidance schemes, which consist of periodic <b>client</b> <b>station</b> (STA) scan and re-association threshold.

50|$|The initial {{authentication}} {{process is}} carried out either using a pre-shared key (PSK), or following an EAP exchange through 802.1X (known as EAPOL, which requires {{the presence of an}} authentication server). This process ensures that the <b>client</b> <b>station</b> (STA) is authenticated with the access point (AP). After the PSK or 802.1X authentication, a shared secret key is generated, called the Pairwise Master Key (PMK). The PSK is derived from a password that is put through PBKDF2-SHA1 as the cryptographic hash function. In a pre-shared-key network, the PSK is actually the PMK. If an 802.1X EAP exchange was carried out, the PMK is derived from the EAP parameters provided by the authentication server.|$|R
