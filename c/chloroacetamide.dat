40|$|Durante este trabajo de tesis {{doctoral}} se ha demostrado que las cloroacetamidas son intermedios de gran utilidad para la síntesis de heterociclos nitrogenados a través de procesos radicalarios o no radicalarios. En este trabajo, hemos descrito por primera vez la espirociclación desaromatizante en bencenos no activados utilizando ciclación radicalaria con transferencia de átomo, a partir de benciltricloroacetamidas por tratamiento con CuCl en acetonitrilo y activación por microondas. Mientras que las N-(-metilbencil) tricloroacetamidas sometidas a condiciones radicalarias tenía dos rutas principales, la formación de morfanos y la generación de normorfanos a través de una transferencia 1, 4 de hidrógeno y ciclación radicalaria con inversión de configuración en el centro bencílico y con memoria de quiralidad. Asimismo, como resultado de una investigación enfocada a la preparación de enaminas, a partir de 4 -tricloroacetamidociclohexanona y pirrolidina, hemos descrito una nueva ruta para la síntesis de 6 -azabiciclo[3. 2. 1]octanos (normorfanos). La reacción se llevó a cabo en 5 minutos ya sea sin disolvente o bien en tolueno y bajo activación por microondas. El proceso de carbamoilación o reacción tipo haloformo intramolecular a partir de cetonas no tenía precedentes en la literatura. Esta metodología fue aplicada a la síntesis del sistema tricíclico presente en el producto natural cephalocyclidin A. Los resultados anteriormente obtenidos con las tricloroacetamidas propiciaron el uso de dicloroacetamidas en su lugar para conseguir el proceso radicalario. De este modo, se logró desarrollar una nueva ruta de síntesis de 2 -azabiciclo[3. 3. 1]nonanos a través de la ciclación radicalaria de cetonas enlazadas a dicloroacetamidas en presencia de pirrolidina, AIBN y TTMSS bajo activación por microondas durante cinco minutos. Esta metodología fue aplicada con éxito a la síntesis del núcleo tricíclico del inmunosupresor FR 901483. Asimismo, se investigó la síntesis de pirrolidinonas y piperidinonas funcionalizadas a partir de dicloro- y monocloroacetamidas lineales utilizando química no radicalaria. Estas cloroacetamidas fueron fácilmente preparadas por reacción de las aminas correspondientes con metilvinilcetona y posterior tratamiento con cloruro de dicloro- o cloroacetilo en un proceso one-pot. Mientras que el derivado con el ter-butilo sobre el nitrógeno experimenta una ciclación espontánea, la ciclación de las cloroacetamidas lineales fue lograda a través de una condensación de Darzens. During this PhD work we {{have demonstrated}} that <b>chloroacetamides</b> are valuable and versatile intermediates for the synthesis of different nitrogen containing heterocycles using either radical or non-radical processes. Thus, we reported the first dearomative spirocyclization under ATRC conditions using a Cu(I) catalyst to access 2 -azaspiro[4. 5]decanes by treatment of benzyltrichloroacetamides with CuCl, in acetonitrile and with microwave activation. The results obtained with the different trichloroacetamides {{used in this study}} show the importance of having a bulky group on the nitrogen to achieve the cyclization process. When N-(-methylbenzyl) trichloroacetamides were submitted to the ATRC conditions described previously for the synthesis of morphans, the radical course of the reaction followed two main pathways. The first one, provided morphans through an ATRC from the 1 -(carbamoyl) dichloromethyl radical with the amide Z-conformation, which underwent cyclization upon the ,-unsaturated nitrile followed by a diastereoselective chlorine atom transfer. In the second, as observed under reductive conditions, the same radical in its E conformation underwent a 1, 4 -hydrogen transfer generating a benzylic radical that reacts with the unsaturated ,-nitrile with configurational inversion at the quaternary stereogenic center involving memory of chirality (MOC). Additionally, {{as a result of an}} investigation aimed at the preparation of enamines from 4 -trichloroacetamidocyclohexanones and pyrrolidine, we discovered a new route for the synthesis of 6 -azabicyclo[3. 2. 1]octane ring (normorphan) present in many natural and non-natural compounds. The 5 min reaction was achieved under solvent-free conditions or using microwave activation in toluene. The process involves an unprecedented intramolecular -carbamoylation of ketones or an intramolecular haloform-type reaction of trichloroacetamides promoted by enamine (generated in situ) as counter-reagents. The methodology was applied to enantiopure N-(-methylbenzyl) trichloroacetamidocyclohexanone providing the expected normorphans which were separated and converted to the corresponding amino alcohols for their future use as organocatalysts. The methodology was successfully extended to additional substrates to provide the azatricyclic structure that constitutes the ring core of the pentacyclic natural product cephalocyclidin A. Additionally, enlargement of the side chain bearing the trichloroacetamide had a significant impact on the course of the reaction since it provided the anti-Bredt seven-membered ring alone. The structure of this unprecedented type of anti-Bredt ring (3 -azabicyclo[4. 3. 1]dec- 5 -ene) is present in many natural compounds with few reported methodologies for its preparation. The results previously obtained with trichloroacetamides led us to use dichloroacetamides instead to achieve the radical process. Thus a new route for the synthesis of 2 -azabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonanes was reported using a radical cyclization of dichloroacetamide-tethered ketones in the presence of pyrrolidine, AIBN and TTMSS and under microwave activation. In a five-minute one-pot process, after the generation of an enamine, intramolecular addition of a chloromethylcarbamoyl radical, and oxidation of the -aminoalkyl radical intermediate, the resulting iminium salt evolved to the corresponding enamine and, after a workup, to the alkylated ketone. The methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of the tricyclic core of immunosuppressant FR 901483 and also to the preparation of the 3 -azabicyclo[4. 3. 1]decane structure through formation of the seven membered ring. Finally, the synthesis of functionalized pyrrolidines and piperidines from linear monochloro- and dichloroacetamides using non-radical chemistry was investigated. These <b>chloroacetamides</b> were easily prepared from methyl vinyl ketone and the corresponding amine followed by treatment with dichloro or chloroacetyl chloride in a one-pot reaction. Here also, the t-butyl group on the nitrogen allowed the reaction to go further providing the corresponding polyfunctionalized piperidine with an acceptable yield. The cyclization process was also achieved using Darzens conditions in the presence of sodium methoxide or potassium t-butoxide to afford the above mentioned epoxides with good yields. Application of the methodology to monochloroacetamides provided the piperidine or the pyrrolidine ring depending on the nature of the substituent on the nitrogen atom...|$|R
40|$|The central aim of {{this work}} was to develop new ring {{destruction}} routes to 2, 8 -bridged isoquinolinophane derivatives and to study the properties of these systems. The bridged derivatives were to the obtained from appropriately substituted nitrogen-containing tetracyclic precursors. The first approach to these precursors focused on the photolysis of vinylogous <b>chloroacetamides</b> as the key process to form the required C-C bond and ring D in these precursors (Chapter 2). This approach gave two novel benz-fused medium ring compounds, together with tetracyclic oquinones. However the initially required precursors {{could not be obtained}} by this photolytic approach. Attention was then directed to the use of carbonyl transposition methods as the key process to place the required functionality in the correct position on the tetracyclic systems (Chapter 3). The starting tetracyclic compounds were readily prepared using previously reported methods. The successful synthesis of several new tetracyclic precursor compounds, derivatives of the 8, 9 -dimethoxy- 2, 3, 6, 11, 11 a, 11 b-hexahydro- 10 -methyl- 1 Hbenzo[de]lpyrido[3, 2, 1 -ij]quinolin- 11 (5 H) -ol (78), were achieved, although the desired stereochemistry was not obtained for all of of them. The hydroxyl group at the 11 -position was introduced via a hydroboration/ oxidation sequence and further oxidation gave ketonic derivatives. The attempted fragmentation of the tetracyclic precursors (91, 95, 97, 102) using various methods are described in Chapter 4. The use of either the retro-Mannich reaction or the Grob fragmentation resulted in several products, but the desired 2, 8 -bridged isoquinolinophane derivatives could not be prepared by this C-C cleavage methodology. This was considered to be due, at least in part, to stereochemical constraints. There is still considerable potential in this area if the correct stereochemistry can be achieved in the appropriate Grob or retro-Mannich precursors. A subsiduary {{aim of this}} work was to study the aromaticity of strained, nitrogen-containing 1, 7 -bridged naphthalenophanes. This was achieved by calculating the π-bond order from measured 4 J ortho-benzylic coupling constants between an aromatic methyl and the adjacent protons. The preparation of various new methyl substituted naphthalenophanes was achieved and 1 H n. m. r. studies were carried out on the compounds. It was found that the two five-atom bridged compounds prepared readily underwent a Diels-Alder type dimerization of the non-methoxylated rings. The naphthalenic C-C bonds in the non-methoxylated ring showed evidence of bond fixation as their bond orders deviated from expected values. The π-bond order of the C-C double bonds in the compounds isolated from the Diels-Alder dimerization was also assessed (Chapter 5). In all this work, 1 H, 13 C n. m. r. and associated spectroscopic techniques were used extensively in assigning structures to products, and confirmation of stereochemical and other features was obtained in a number of cases by single crystal X-ray structure determinations. Although the main aim of this work was not fully realized several advances were achieved. These included the preparation of two new benzfused, bridged medium ring systems and the development of synthetic routes to new derivatives of nitrogen-containing tetracyclic systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{functions}} of plant glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) under normal growth conditions are poorly understood, but their activity as detoxification enzymes has been harnessed in agriculture for selective weed control. Herbicide safeners protect monocot crops from herbicide injury but have {{little effect on}} weedy monocot or dicot species. Protection by safeners is associated with expression of herbicide-metabolizing enzymes including GSTs, but the basis for selective action of safeners between monocots and dicots is not known. To address this question we have studied the response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to various safeners. Benoxacor, fenclorim, and fluxofenim did not protect Arabidopsis from herbicide injury but did induce RNA expression of the glutathione-conjugate transporters encoded by AtMRP 1, AtMRP 2, AtMRP 3, and AtMRP 4. These safeners also induced the organ-specific expression of AtGSTU 19 and AtGSTF 2, two previously characterized Arabidopsis GSTs from different classes of this enzyme family. RNA hybridization, immunoblot, and reporter gene analyses indicated expression of AtGSTU 19 induced by safeners predominated in roots. To test the hypothesis that increased expression of AtGSTU 19 would be sufficient to provide tolerance to <b>chloroacetamide</b> herbicides, a chimeric gene was produced containing the open reading frame for this GST driven by a constitutive promoter. Plants containing this transgene had a modest increase in AtGSTU 19 protein, predominantly in roots, but this {{had no effect on}} tolerance to <b>chloroacetamide</b> herbicides.

The enzyme, assayed with metolachlor as a substrate, was purified approximately 200 -fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q resins, and affinity chromatography on S-hexylglutathione agarose from total GST activity present in etiolated shoots. The purified protein migrated during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as a single band with a molecular mass of 27 kD. Using nondenaturing PAGE, we determined that the native protein has a molecular mass of about 57 kD and that the protein exists as a dimer. Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed only a single protein with an isoelectric point of 5. 75 and molecular mass of 27 kD. These results further suggest that the protein exists as a homodimer of two identical 27 -kD subunits.

40|$|Two half-sandwich d 6 -rhodium(III) {{complexes}} of {{the general}} formula [(η 5 -Cp∗) Rh(N^N) Cl]Cl where N^N is a phenanthroline or a bispyridine methane derivative carrying a thiol-targeting maleimide or <b>chloroacetamide</b> function were synthesized and characterized. Both complexes were able to catalyse the transfer hydrogenation of 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroacetophenone in aqueous medium using formate or phosphite as hydrogen donor. Covalent anchoring of these complexes to the cysteine endoproteinase papain yielded hybrid metalloproteins with transfer hydrogenase properties. Under optimized conditions of pH, hydrogen donor concentration and catalyst load, conversion of substrate was nearly quantitative within 24 h at 40 °C and the (S) -enantiomer was obtained preferably albeit with a modest enantiomeric excess of 7 - 10 %. Covalent docking simulations complemented the experimental findings suggesting a molecular rationale for the observed low enantioselectivity. The harmonious use of experimental and theoretical approaches represents an unprecedented starting point for driving the rational design of artificial metalloenzymes built up from papain with higher catalytic efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The general aim of {{the work}} was to explore the design and {{synthesis}} of new ligands which could have potential to mimic the action of neurotransmitters at the dopaminergic or serotonergic receptor sites. The {{first part of the}} project involved studies on the design and development of medium-ring cyclophane-based potential prodrugs which could be ultimately converted to an endogenous ligand, dopamine. A photochemical route to the m-cyclophane lactams was improved and extended. New chloroacetamides and derivatives were prepared for photochemical investigation. Photolysis of (40) gave rise to a new m-cyclophane analogue (64) in good yield whose structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In addition, a range of other m-cyclophanes (65), (66) and (67) were obtained from the photolysis of chloroacetamides (42), (44) and (46) respectively. Photolysis of other new <b>chloroacetamide</b> derivatives (52), (53), (54), (57), (58), (59), (60), (61) and (63), however, did not result in the formation of m-cyclophane lactams. Benzazepinone analogues or nonheterocyclic products were obtained instead. Mechanistic pathways for the products were indicated. The usefulness of the photochemical approach to medium ring heterocycles was further extended. Photolysis of N-chloroacetamide derivatives, 3 -chloroacetyl- 7, 8 -dimethoxy- 4, 5 -dihydro-lH- 3 -bezazepin- 2 (3 H) -one (86) in aqueous acetonitrile gave 11 a-hydroxy- 8, 9 -dimethoxy- 5, 6, 11,lla-tetrahydrooxazolo[2, 3 -b][3]benzazepin- 2 -(2 H) -one (87) in good yield. This representative of a new heterocyclic system could be converted into the 11 a-ethoxy derivative (88) by recrystallization from ethanol. The structure of (88) was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Work was also conducted to develop methods to modify the bridging chain of the m-cyclophane derivatives as part of the potential prodrug studies. Further to this effort, some new chemistry associated with approaches to fused indole systems from the m-cyclophane precursors was uncovered. Reaction of cyclophane lactams (8) and (64) with N-bromosuccinimide {{in the presence of a}} catalytic amount of azobisisobutyronitrile led to new seven membered ring fused indolic derivatives (104 - 112) via C-N intramolecular cyclisation. The reaction, however, did not proceed with N-protected lactam functionality in the bridging ring. Alternative C-C cyclisation in (8) by using boron tribromide gave the previously reported imine (102) which, in turn, was used to prepare the new tricyclic <b>chloroacetamide</b> derivatives (119), (120) and (121) for photochemical investigation. Ultraviolet irradiation of the silylated eneamide (121) afforded a benzopyran <b>chloroacetamide</b> derivative (122) in low yield. The second part of this project was involved with the design and development of non-natural ligands for serotonergic sites and was carried out under a scientific exchange program at the Universite of Orleans (France). A new series of 3, 4 -dihydro- 3 -amino- 2 H-benzopyran derivatives with various C 5 -substituents, (146), (143), (145), (137), (158), (159), (160), (141) and (178) were successfully prepared. The substituents were introduced via palladium-mediated cross-coupling reactions. The effect of these different groups in the 5 -position on the interactions with 5 HT 1 A-and 5 HT 7 -subtype receptors was evaluated. In vitro studies, carried out by the pharmaceutical company SERVIER indicated that these derivatives are very active agonists while the ketones (145) and (160) are more potent than the lead compounds at the serotonergic receptor sites. In an extension of this work,an azido derivative, (69) was also synthesised for future photo-affinity labelling of the above receptors...|$|E
40|$|The preemergence <b>chloroacetamide</b> {{herbicide}} metazachlor was encapsulated in biodegradable {{low molecular}} weight poly(lactic acid) micro- and submicroparticles, and its release to the water environment was investigated. Three series of particles, S, M, and L, varying in their size (from 0. 6 to 8 μm) and with various initial amounts of the active agent (5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % w/w) were prepared by the oil-in-water solvent evaporation technique with gelatin as biodegradable surfactant. The encapsulation efficiencies reached were about 60 % {{and appeared to be}} lower for smaller particles. Generally, {{it was found that the}} rate of herbicide release decreased with increasing size of particles. After 30 days the portions of the herbicide released for its highest loading (30 % w/w) were 92 %, 56 %, and 34 % for about 0. 6, 0. 8, and 8 μm particles, respectively. The release rates were also lower for lower herbicide loadings. Metazachlor release from larger particles tended to be a diffusion-controlled process, while for smaller particles the kinetics was strongly influenced by an initial burst release. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|Reactions of the {{isoquinoline}} alkaloids, aporphine, papaverine, pavine, and berberine {{have been}} studied. The main {{aim of the}} work was to explore a potential route to the new strained aza(l, 9) phenanthrenophane derivatives 23 a, 23 b, and 24 using the readily-available aporphine alkaloid, boldine as a starting material. A ring construction approach to the aza(1, 9) phenanthrenophane derivative 23 a via a photochemical reaction of phenanthrene <b>chloroacetamide</b> derivatives 28 b or 28 c was pursued (Chapter 2). Photolysis of 28 b {{gave rise to the}} reduced aza(1, 9) phenanthrenophane analogue 47 in low yield. In addition, a range of other novel heterocyclic products were obtained from the photolysis of 28 b and 28 c including the phenanthroazepinone derivatives 44 a or 44 b, the spiro compounds 45 a or 45 b, and the fused medium size ring derivatives 46 a, 46 b, 48 a, and 48 b. Mechanistic pathways for the products were also indicated. All compounds prepared from these photolyses are representative of a new heterocyclic system. A ring destruction approach to the aza(1, 9) phenanthrenophane derivatives 23 b and 24 through ring expansion of the quinoline 21 and 22 a by a cyanogen bromide reaction was also investigated (Chapter 3). The closest result which has been achieved in the approach to compound 23 b is the preparation of the intermediate 59. Two more steps are still required to afford the final compound 23 b. The first is the selective reduction of the double bond to give the quinoline 21 and the second is the cyanogen bromide ring destruction with elimination. Unfortunately, the reduction of the phenanthrene system in 23 b could not be achieved. The cyanogen bromide reaction of 22 a in ethanol-free chloroform, in the presence of potassium carbonate produced two compounds 76 and the reduced (1, 9) phenanthrenophane derivative 77 respectively. The reaction of 22 b with cyanogen bromide under the same conditions as for 22 a gave 79, 80, and 81 respectively. Further work described in this thesis was directed towards the preparation of new nitrogen-containing heterocyclic systems for later pharmacological and chemical evaluation. A photochemical reaction of <b>chloroacetamide</b> derivatives was employed to approach the isoquino[l, 2 -b][3]benzazepine ring systems in 25 a-c (Chapter 4). This new synthetic approach is efficient and potentially generalisable to a range of other 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline precursor derivatives, including chiral forms. It also offers scope for the introduction of further functionality into the [3]benzazepine moiety. Further reactions based on papaverine were also undertaken to prepare new systems including 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrahydro- 6 -(α-hydroxy- 3, 4 -dimethoxy) benzyl- 8, 9 - dimethoxy- 3 -methyl- 3 -benzazocin- 4 (1 H) -one 27, the isoquino[2, 1 -d][1, 4]benzodiazocinone 101, 5, 6 -dihydro- 8, 9, 13, 14 -tetramethoxy- 1 H-isoquino[2, 1 -d][1, 4]benzodiazocine- 2, 3 -dione 118, and 1, 10 -dihydro- 7, 8, 12, 13 - tetramethoxy- 2 H-indolo[2, 3 -e][3]benzazonin- 4 (3 H) -one 119 (Chapter 5). In continuation of the work on the transformations of alkaloids, reactions based on pavine 11 and berberine 12 (Chapter 6), including the preparation of 13 - acetyl- 5, 6, 11, 12 -tetrahydro- 12 -hydroxy- 2, 3, 8, 9 -tetramethoxydibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene- 5, 11 -imine 120 from a photochemical reaction on a <b>chloroacetamide</b> derivative of 11, were investigated. The preparation of the chlorinated homoprotoberberine 126 and protopine 132 derivatives from berberine was also achieved. New isoquino[2, 1 -c][1, 3]benzodiazepine derivatives were produced in moderate to high yields by reaction of 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 6, 7 -dimethoxy- 1 -[(3, 4 - dimethoxy- 2 -aminophenyl) methyl]isoquinoline 133 with carbon disulfide or triphosgene and by hydrogenation of the nitro substituted isoquinolines 138 a or 138 b derived from dihydropapaverine (Chapter 7). This new synthetic approach is very efficient and potentially generalisable to a range of other tetrahydroisoquinoline precursor derivatives. It also offers scope for the introduction of further functionality into the [1, 3]benzodiazepine moiety...|$|E
40|$|We {{obtained}} a stable transformed fish (EPC) cell line containing a reporter gene {{under the control}} of the tilapia HSP 70 promoter. Expression of the reporter gene, coding for a green fluorescent protein (GFP) -luciferase fusion protein, was assessed by measuring the luciferase enzymatic activity by luminometry and the GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The clone was characterized for its capacity to respond to heat shock treatment. The results show high induction after 1 h at 37 degrees C of treatment, up to 500 -fold. In addition, its convenience to detect a large range of cellular stressors was evaluated. We observed high induction when Cd 2 +, Zn 2 +, Hg 2 + or Cu 2 + was added, but not Pb 2 +. In addition, activation of the reporter gene was observed in the presence of other compounds such as acetyl chloride, tetrachlorophenol, <b>chloroacetamide</b> and sodium arsenite. In conclusion, this cell line can be used as a rapid, cheap and easy biological test to determine cellular stress induced by environmental pollutants, alone or in conjunction with other, more specific assays.

40|$|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) {{in plants}} have been implicated in the {{detoxification}} of agrochemicals such as herbicides. Herbicide safeners are compounds that enhance the herbicide-detoxifying activity of GSTs and other proteins in grass crops but not in target weeds. Little is known about how safeners induce detoxification systems in plants. In this study, Arabidopsis was evaluated as a model to study safener response mechanisms in higher plants, {{in an attempt to}} understand the basis for GST regulation by safeners. ^ In the current study, several safeners were shown to induce the expression of specific Arabidopsis GSTs at the RNA and protein levels, and to enhance GST activity against herbicides and model substrates. However, all safeners did not induce the same profile of GSTs in Arabidopsis, suggesting multiple pathways are involved in the regulation of GST expression by safeners. ^ When GSTs from safener-treated plants were purified by affinity chromatography and displayed by 2 -D SDS-PAGE, a 26 kD protein that was induced by a number of safeners was identified as a novel GST, AtGSTU 19. When expressed in E. coli, AtGSTU 19 had high activity with model substrates and conjugated several <b>chloroacetamide</b> herbicides to GSH at rates similar to those reported for herbicide-metabolizing GSTs in sorghum and maize. Based on its activity and abundance in protein extracts, it is likely that AtGSTU 19 accounts for {{a large proportion of the}} increase in GST activity following safener treatment. Levels of AtGSTU 19 RNA and protein increased predominantly in roots in response to safeners that are used in cereal crops to reduce <b>chloroacetamide</b> injury. ^ The tissue-specific expression of AtGSTU 19 was examined in vivo using transgenic lines that carrying a GFP reporter gene driven by the AtGSTU 19 promoter. Low basal expression of the reporter in roots was observed in untreated plants, while expression was induced moderately in shoots and highly in roots of safener-treated plants. The effect of overexpressing AtGSTU 19 in Arabidopsis on herbicide tolerance was investigated. The results suggest that localization of GST expression to certain plant tissues is an important factor determining safener efficacy. ^ Finally, a proteomic analysis of the Arabidopsis GST family examined the expression of eight abundant GSTs, including AtGSTU 19, before and after safener treatment. MS-MS was used to identify differentially-labeled tryptic peptides derived from GST proteins in control and safener-treated plants. Differences in the abundance of these peptides indicated that expression of specific GSTs changed in response to safener-treatment. ^ This work establishes Arabidopsis as a model to study the regulation of GSTs by safeners, and offers an explanation for differences in safener action between cereal crops and weeds. ...|$|E
