2500|$|A new {{candidate}} biomarker for copper excess {{as well as}} deficiency {{has emerged}} in recent years. This potential marker is a <b>chaperone</b> <b>protein,</b> which delivers copper to the antioxidant protein SOD1 (copper, zinc superoxide dismutase). It is called [...] "copper chaperone for SOD1" [...] (CCS), and excellent animal data supports its use as a marker in accessible cells (e.g., erythrocytes) for copper deficiency as well as excess. CCS is currently being tested as a biomarker in humans.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, Cln3 {{seems to}} be the size sensor in budding yeast, as it {{exhibits}} the necessary properties of a translational sizer and is the most upstream regulator of Start. A critical question remains, however, as to how its activity is rendered size dependent. As noted above, any translational size sensor should be at constant concentration, and thus constant activity, in the cytoplasm as cells grow. In order to detect its size, the cell must compare the absolute number of sizer molecules to some non-growing standard, with the genome the obvious choice for such a standard. It was originally thought that yeast accomplished this with Cln3 by localizing it (and its target, Whi5) to the nucleus: nuclear volume was assumed to scale with genome content, so that an increasing concentration of Cln3 in the nucleus could indicate increasing Cln3 molecules relative to the genome. However, the nucleus has recently been shown to grow during G1, irrespective of genome content, undermining this model. Recent experiments have suggested that Cln3 activity could be titrated directly against genomic DNA, through its DNA-bound interaction with SBF-Whi5 complexes. Finally, other models exist that do not rely on comparison of Cln3 levels to DNA. One posits a non-linear relationship between total translation rate and Cln3 translation rate caused by an Upstream open reading frame; [...] another suggests that the increase in Cln3 activity at the end of G1 relies on competition for the <b>chaperone</b> <b>protein</b> Ydj1, which otherwise holds Cln3 molecules in the Endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
50|$|Prefoldin is {{one family}} of <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> {{found in the}} domains of eukarya and archaea. Prefoldin acts in {{combination}} with other molecules to promote protein folding in cells where there are many other competing pathways for folding. <b>Chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> perform non-covalent assembly of other polypeptide-containing structures in vivo.

5000|$|The {{mitochondrial}} unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is {{a cellular}} stress response {{related to the}} mitochondria. The UPRmt results from unfolded or misfolded proteins in mitochondria beyond the capacity of <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> to handle them. The UPRmt can occur either in the mitochondrial matrix or in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the UPRmt, the mitochondrion will either upregulate <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> or invoke proteases to degrade proteins that fail to fold properly. UPRmt causes the sirtuin SIRT3 to activate antioxidant enzymes and mitophagy.|$|R

2500|$|Plant viruses {{need to be}} {{transmitted}} by a vector, most often insects such as leafhoppers. One class of viruses, the Rhabdoviridae, has been proposed to actually be insect viruses that have evolved to replicate in plants. The chosen insect vector of a plant virus will often be the determining factor in that virus's host range: it can only infect plants that the insect vector feeds upon. This was shown in part when the old world white fly {{made it to the}} United States, where it transferred many plant viruses into new hosts. Depending on the way they are transmitted, plant viruses are classified as non-persistent, semi-persistent and persistent. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet of the insect and on the next plant it feeds on, it inoculates it with the virus. Semi-persistent viral transmission involves the virus entering the foregut of the insect. Those viruses that manage to pass through the gut into the haemolymph and then to the salivary glands are known as persistent. There are two sub-classes of persistent viruses: propagative and circulative. Propagative viruses are able to replicate in both the plant and the insect (and may have originally been insect viruses), whereas circulative can not. Circulative viruses are protected inside aphids by the <b>chaperone</b> <b>protein</b> symbionin, produced by bacterial symbionts. [...] Many plant viruses encode within their genome polypeptides with domains essential for transmission by insects. In non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses, these domains are in the coat protein and another protein known as the helper component. A bridging hypothesis has been proposed to explain how these proteins aid in insect-mediated viral transmission. The helper component will bind to the specific domain of the coat protein, and then the insect mouthparts — creating a bridge. In persistent propagative viruses, such as tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), there is often a lipid coat surrounding the proteins that is not seen in other classes of plant viruses. In the case of TSWV, 2 viral proteins are expressed in this lipid envelope. It has been proposed that the viruses bind via these proteins and are then taken into the insect cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.|$|E

50|$|N-linked glycans are {{extremely}} important in proper protein folding in eukaryotic cells. <b>Chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as calnexin and calreticulin, bind {{to the three}} glucose residues present on the core N-linked glycan. These <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> then serve {{to aid in the}} folding of the protein that the glycan is attached to. Following proper folding, the three glucose residues are removed, and the glycan moves on to further processing reactions. If the protein fails to fold properly, the three glucose residues are reattached, allowing the protein to re-associate with the chaperones. This cycle may repeat several times until a protein reaches its proper conformation. If a protein repeatedly fails to properly fold, it is excreted from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by cytoplasmic proteases.|$|R
50|$|Crystallins are {{water-soluble}} {{proteins that}} compose over 90% of the protein within the lens. The three main crystallin types {{found in the}} human eye are α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. Crystallins tend to form soluble, high-molecular weight aggregates that pack tightly in lens fibers, thus increasing the index of refraction of the lens while maintaining its transparency. β and γ crystallins are found primarily in the lens, while subunits of α -crystallin have been isolated {{from other parts of}} the eye and the body. α-crystallin proteins belong to a larger superfamily of molecular <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins,</b> and so it is believed that the crystallin proteins were evolutionarily recruited from <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> for optical purposes.

40|$|ATP {{dependent}} proteolytic {{degradation of}} misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix is {{mediated by the}} PIM 1 protease and depends on the molecular <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> mt-hsp 70 and Mdj 1 p. Chaperone function is essential to maintain misfolded proteins in a soluble state, a prerequisite for their degradation by PIM 1 protease. In the absence of functional mt-hsp 70 or Mdj 1 p misfolded proteins either remain associated with mt-hsp 70 or form aggregates and thereby are no longer substrates for PIM 1 protease. Mdj 1 p is shown to regulate the ATP dependent association of an unfolded polypeptide chain with mt-hsp 70 affecting binding to as well as release from mt-hsp 70. These findings establish a central role of molecular <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> in the degradation of misfolded proteins by PIM 1 protease and thereby demonstrate a functional interrelation between components of the folding machinery and the proteolytic system within mitochondria. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cooperation of {{constituents}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) with <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> in degrading proteins mediate {{a wide range}} of cellular processes, such as synaptic function and neurotransmission, gene transcription, protein trafficking, mitochondrial function and metabolism, antioxidant defence mechanisms, and apoptotic signal transduction. It is supposed that {{constituents of}} the UPS and <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins</b> are recruited into aggresomes where aberrant and potentially cytotoxic proteins may be sequestered in an inactive form. Results To determinate the proteomic pattern of synthetic proteasome inhibitor (PSI) -induced inclusions in PC 12 cells after proteasome inhibition by PSI, we analyzed a fraction of PSI-induced inclusions. A proteomic feature of the isolated fraction was characterized by identification of fifty six proteins including twenty previously reported protein components of Lewy bodies, twenty eight newly identified proteins and eight unknown proteins. These proteins, most of which were recognized as a profile of proteins within cellular processes mediated by the UPS, a profile of constituents of the UPS and a profile of <b>chaperone</b> <b>proteins,</b> are classed into at least nine accepted categories. In addition, prolyl- 4 -hydroxylase beta polypeptide, an endoplasmic reticulum member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, was validated in the developmental process of PSI-induced inclusions in the cells. Conclusions It is speculated that proteomic characterization of an isolated fraction of PSI-induced inclusions in PC 12 cells might offer clues to appearance of aggresomes serving as a cellular defensive response against proteasome inhibition. </p...|$|R
