At the lowest, least general level there are {{a large number of}} narrow first-order factors; at a higher level, there are a relatively small number - somewhere between five and ten - of broad (i.e., more general) second-order factors (or group factors); and at the apex, there is a single third-order factor, g, the general factor common to all tests.

It is common that researchers compute composite scores of repeated measures and use them as multiple indicators of growth factors (baseline performance and growth) assuming measurement invariance between latent classes. Considering that the assumption of measurement invariance does not always hold, we investigate the impact of measurement noninvariance on class enumeration and parameter recovery in GMM through a Monte Carlo simulation study (Study 1). In Study 2, we examine the class enumeration and parameter recovery of the second-order growth mixture modeling (SOGMM) that incorporates measurement models at the first order level. Thus, SOGMM estimates growth trajectory parameters with reliable sources of variance, that is, <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> <b>variance</b> of repeated measures and allows heterogeneity in measurement parameters between latent classes. The class enumeration rates are examined with information criteria such as AIC, BIC, sample-size adjusted BIC, and hierarchical BIC under various simulation conditions. The results of Study 1 showed that the parameter estimates of baseline performance and growth factor means were biased {{to the degree of}} measurement noninvariance even when the correct number of latent classes was extracted. In Study 2, the class enumeration accuracy of SOGMM depended on information criteria, class separation, and sample size. The estimates of baseline performance and growth factor mean differences between classes were generally unbiased but the size of measurement noninvariance was underestimated. Overall, SOGMM is advantageous in that it yields unbiased estimates of growth trajectory parameters and more accurate class enumeration compared to GMM by incorporating measurement models...|$|E

The study was concerned with whether the length of time children spend in a self-contained, learning disabilities program has any effect on the children's level of self-perceived competence. Social reference group as well as the child's I. Q., age, and gender were also considered. Following a review of the literature, self-concept was viewed as being multivariate in nature, and the Self-Perception Profile for Children became the selected instrument for the study. Factor analysis had been found to support the viewpoint that six subdomains of self-perceived competence existed: Scholastic Competence, Social Acceptance, Athletic Competence, Physical Appearance, Behavioral Conduct, and Global Self-Worth. Fifty-eight children who were between the ages of 8 years and 0 months through 11 years and 11 months, enrolled in self-contained, learning disabilities classes, were included in the study and were requested to fill out the Self-Perception Profile for Children on two separate occasions. They compared themselves with children who were enrolled in self-contained, learning disabilities programs as well as children who were enrolled in regular programs. A controlled-order effect was utilized. Statistical methodology included a t-test, the Pearson Coefficient of Correlation, and multiple regression analysis: both a stepwise and a full-model. Data analysis did not support the contention that a relationship exists between the length of time a child remains in a self-contained, learning disabilities program and the child's level of self-perceived competence on any of the six subscales. Furthermore, the social reference group was found to have no bearing upon a child's levels of self-perceived competence. While some relationships were found between the other independent and dependent variables, they were of such low magnitude that they accounted for only a very limited percentage of <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> <b>variance.</b> Recommendations for further study involving the aspects of achievement and more varied populations were made...|$|E

Auditors must feel empowered {{to act as}} agents of change or their decisions and actions cannot {{be influenced by the}} discourse. Their every response depends upon their ability to perceive themselves as potential mediators of change. A review of the literature supports the notion that women auditors are affected by biological, social, historical, and psychological forces which serve to inform their ability to perceive themselves as agents of change. In many instances, their lack of perceived personal power is apparent. The {{purpose of this study was}} to construct and analyze an instrument developed for the purpose of measuring perceived personal power. The instrument was designed and validated through a Delphi process. The questionnaire contained thirty-six (36) items, with a four-point Likert type scale used to indicate the respondent's attitude. Questions were completed by 300 randomly selected female students at Oregon State University. The mean age of the respondents was twenty years, 34 percent were married and the mean years of university classwork completed was 2. 4 years. The Hoyt-Stunkard method was used to assess reliability.

40|$|Although {{self-concept}} {{has been}} a prominent and highly utilized hypothetical construct in psychological research for many years, studies attempting to establish the validity of self-concept instruments are relatively few in number. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the cross-structural validity of selected self-concept measures [...] to determine if self-reports and behavioral ratings of self-concept measure the same construct. There were 202 subjects who participated in the study. They were selected from a pool of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth grade regular education students whose parents had signed permission to participate. One male and one female were selected from each classroom. Certified psychometrists administered two self-concept instruments and one anxiety measure to the students in their regularly assigned buildings, Order of test administration was counterbalanced among buildings, Each teacher completed two behavioral ratings of self-concept and one behavioral rating of anxiety on the male and female selected from his or her classroom, Order of completion was counterbalanced among teachers. A multitrait-multimethod analysis was conducted to determine cross-structural validity. Four different correlations were analyzed: (1) monotrait-monomethod, (2) heteromethod-monotrait, (3) heterotrait-monomethod, and (4) heterotrait-heteromethod. The. 01 level was used to establish statistical significance of the correlations. Results of this study demonstrated that there is little cross-structural validity between the self-report measures and behavioral rating forms used: 1. The <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> <b>variance</b> was not sufficient enough to consider the methods comparable in spite of the fact that there was a statistically significant relationship between self-report measures and behavioral ratings of self-concept. 2. Method variance contributed to the substantial concurrent validity between the Children's Self-Concept Scale and the Self-Esteem Inventory. Similarly, method variance contributed to the substantial concurrent validity between the Inferred Self-Concept Scale and the Behavior Rating Form. 3, High negative correlations between self-concept and anxiety within each method suggested that self-concept and anxiety share enough common method variance to disallow the use of anxiety as a totally distinct trait. 4, Self-reports and behavioral ratings may each measure a different aspect of self-concept [...] the experienced and the presented. Therefore, a combination of the two methods might yield a more global assessment of self-concept. Department of Educational PsychologyThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

40|$|Mixed-State conditionally {{heteroscedastic}} latent factor models {{attempt to}} describe a complex nonlinear dynamic system with a succession of linear latent factor models indexed by a switching variable. Unfortunately, despite the framework’s simplicity exact state and parameter estimation are still intractable because of the interdependency across the latent factor volatility processes. Recently, a broad class of learning and inference algorithms for time series models have been successfully cast {{in the framework of}} dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN). This paper describes a novel DBN-based switching conditionally heteroscedastic latent factor model. The key methodological contribution of this paper is the novel use of the Generalized Pseudo-Bayesian method GPB 2, a structured variational learning approach and an approximated version of the Viterbi algorithm in conjunction with the EM algorithm for overcoming the intractability of exact inference in mixed-state latent factor model. The conditional EM algorithm that we have developed for the maximum likelihood estimation, is based on an extended switching Kalman filter approach which yields inferences about the unobservable path of the <b>common</b> <b>factors</b> and their <b>variances,</b> and the latent variable of the state process.

Whether allostatic load mediators covary and thus warrant treatment as a unitary construct remains to be established and, in particular, the relation of allostatic load parameters to the metabolic syndrome requires elucidation. Here, we employ confirmatory factor analysis to test: 1) whether a single <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> underlies variation in physiological systems associated with allostatic load; and 2) whether allostatic load parameters continue to load on a single <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> if a second factor representing the metabolic syndrome is also modeled. Participants were 645 adults from Allegheny County, PA (30 – 54 years old, 82 % non-Hispanic white, 52 % female) who were free of confounding medications. Model fitting supported a single, second-order <b>factor</b> underlying <b>variance</b> in the allostatic load components available in this study (metabolic, inflammatory and vagal measures). Further, this <b>common</b> <b>factor</b> reflecting covariation among allostatic load components persisted when a latent factor representing metabolic syndrome facets was conjointly modeled.
