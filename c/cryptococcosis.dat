5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, <b>cryptococcosis,</b> histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|The family {{currently}} comprises 18 genera (plus synonyms), containing around 250 valid species. Significant genera include Tremella, {{two species}} of which are edible and commercially cultivated, and the yeast genus Cryptococcus, several species of which are human pathogens, causing <b>cryptococcosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flucytosine, {{also known}} as 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), is an {{antifungal}} medication. It is specifically used, together with amphotericin B, for serious Candida infections and <b>cryptococcosis.</b> It may be used by itself or with other antifungals for chromomycosis. Flucytosine is used by mouth and by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Opportunistic {{activity}} by combinations of otherwise normal bacterial flora, such as aerobic streptococci, Neisseria, Actinomyces, spirochetes, and Bacteroides species can prolong the ulcerative process. Fungal causes include Coccidioides immitis (valley fever), Cryptococcus neoformans (<b>cryptococcosis),</b> and Blastomyces dermatitidis ("North American Blastomycosis"). Entamoeba histolytica, a parasitic protozoan, is sometimes {{known to cause}} mouth ulcers through formation of cysts.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{partnership between}} Hazen in New York City and Brown in Albany {{was due in}} part to the efficiency of the United States Postal Service in the 1940s. In her New York City laboratory, Hazen cultured organisms found in soil samples and tested their ability to fight against two fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus responsible for the chronic disease <b>cryptococcosis,</b> which affects lungs, skin, and other body parts like the central nervous system, and Candida albicans, which causes candidiasis, which can be minor in some cases (e.g. a vaginal yeast infection), or a serious infection in patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If she found such promising antifungal activity in a particular culture, she would mail it to Brown in a mason jar.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{appearance}} can {{be associated}} with histoplasmosis, <b>cryptococcosis,</b> and coccidioidomycosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cryptococcosis</b> can rarely {{occur in}} the non-immunosuppressed people, {{particularly}} with Cryptococcus gattii.|$|E
50|$|The European Commission has {{designated}} AR-12 as {{an orphan}} drug {{for use in}} combination with other drugs for treatment of two infections diseases, <b>cryptococcosis</b> and tularaemia. AR-12 received an orphan drug designation in combination with the antifungal drug fluconazole for <b>cryptococcosis</b> of the brain. It also received this designation for tularaemia in combination with the antibacterial drug gentamicin.|$|E

50|$|Many common infections {{can spread}} by {{airborne}} transmission {{at least in}} some cases, including: Anthrax (inhalational), Chickenpox, Influenza, Measles, Smallpox, <b>Cryptococcosis,</b> and Tuberculosis.|$|E
50|$|Penicilliosis due to Penicillium marneffei is now {{the third}} most common {{opportunistic}} infection (after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and <b>cryptococcosis)</b> in HIV-positive individuals within the endemic area of Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cryptococcosis</b> is {{also seen}} in cats and {{occasionally}} dogs. It {{is the most}} common deep fungal disease in cats, usually leading to chronic infection of the nose and sinuses, and skin ulcers. Cats may develop a bump over the bridge of the nose from local tissue inflammation. It can be associated with FeLV infection in cats. <b>Cryptococcosis</b> is most common in dogs and cats but cattle, sheep, goats, horses, wild animals, and birds can also be infected. Soil, fowl manure, and pigeon droppings are among the sources of infection.|$|E

50|$|Distribution is {{worldwide}} in soil. The prevalence of <b>cryptococcosis</b> {{has been increasing}} over the past 20 years for many reasons, including the increase in incidence of AIDS and the expanded use of immunosuppressive drugs.|$|E
50|$|Once {{considered}} rare, its occurrence {{has increased}} due to AIDS. It {{is now the}} third most common opportunistic infection (after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and <b>cryptococcosis)</b> in HIV-positive individuals within the endemic area of Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cryptococcosis</b> is {{believed}} to be acquired by inhalation of the infectious propagule from the environment. Although the exact nature of the infectious propagule is unknown, the leading hypothesis is the basidiospore created through sexual or asexual reproduction.|$|E
50|$|Bird {{control is}} {{important}} because pest birds can create health-related problems through their feces, including histoplasmosis, <b>cryptococcosis,</b> and psittacosis. Bird droppings may also cause damage to property and equipment. Birds also frequently steal from crops and fruit orchards.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cryptococcosis</b> is a {{defining}} opportunistic infection for AIDS, {{and is the}} second-most-common AIDS-defining illness in Africa. Other conditions that pose an increased risk include certain lymphomas (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma), sarcoidosis, liver cirrhosis, and patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy.|$|E

It is typically given by injection into a vein ...|$|E
50|$|Systemic mycoses due to {{opportunistic}} pathogens are infections {{of patients}} with immune deficiencies who would otherwise not be infected. Examples of immunocompromised conditions include AIDS, alteration of normal flora by antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy, and metastatic cancer. Examples of opportunistic mycoses include Candidiasis, <b>Cryptococcosis</b> and Aspergillosis.|$|E

50|$|It is {{suspected}} that paramyxoviruses, such as PMV 1 that causes of Newcastle disease may be spread by Corvus splendens. Outbreaks of Newcastle disease in India were often preceded by mortality in crows. They {{have also been}} found to carry Cryptococcus neoformans, which can cause <b>cryptococcosis</b> in humans.|$|E
50|$|Penicillium {{species are}} usually {{regarded}} as unimportant {{in terms of}} causing human disease. Penicillium marneffei, now called Talaromyces marneffei, discovered in 1956, is an exception. This is the only known thermally dimorphic species of Penicillium, and it can cause a lethal systemic infection (penicilliosis) with fever and anaemia similar to disseminated <b>cryptococcosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pests, species causing diseases, {{and their}} vectors, have direct {{importance}} for humans. When {{they are found}} to be cryptic species complexes, the ecology and virulence of each of these species needs to be reevaluated to devise appropriate control strategies. An example are cryptic species in the malaria vector Anopheles, or the fungi causing <b>cryptococcosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Opportunistic {{activity}} by combinations of otherwise normal bacterial flora, such as aerobic streptococci, Neisseria, Actinomyces, spirochetes, and Bacteroides species can prolong the ulcerative process. Fungal causes include Coccidioides immitis (valley fever), Cryptococcus neoformans (<b>cryptococcosis),</b> and Blastomyces dermatitidis ("North American Blastomycosis").

50|$|Cryptococcal {{meningitis}} (infection of the meninges, {{the tissue}} covering the brain) {{is believed to}} result from dissemination of the fungus from either an observed or unappreciated pulmonary infection. Often there is also silent dissemination throughout the brain when meningitis is present. Cryptococcus gattii causes infections in immunocompetent people (fully functioning immune system), but C. neoformans v. grubii, and v. neoformans usually only cause clinically evident infections in persons with some form of defect in their immune systems (immunocompromised persons). People with defects in their cell-mediated immunity, for example, people with AIDS, are especially susceptible to disseminated <b>cryptococcosis.</b> <b>Cryptococcosis</b> is often fatal, even if treated. It is estimated that the three-month case-fatality rate is 9% in high-income regions, 55% in low/middle-income regions, and 70% in sub-Saharan Africa. As of 2009 there were globally approximately 958,000 annual cases and 625,000 deaths within three months after infection.|$|E
50|$|Filobasidiella neoformans and F. bacillispora {{are known}} only from {{laboratory}} cultures {{of their respective}} yeast states (Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii). The presence of haustorial cells on their hyphae indicate that they are (or were) parasites of other fungi, but their original host species are unknown. Both yeasts are human pathogens, responsible for <b>cryptococcosis,</b> and are now cosmopolitan in distribution.|$|E
50|$|Granulomas {{are seen}} {{in a wide variety}} of diseases, both {{infectious}} and non-infectious. Infections that are characterized by granulomas include tuberculosis, leprosy, histoplasmosis, <b>cryptococcosis,</b> coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis and cat scratch disease. Examples of non-infectious granulomatous diseases are sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, berylliosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, pulmonary rheumatoid nodules and aspiration of food and other particulate material into the lung.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cryptococcosis</b> {{is a very}} {{subacute}} {{infection with}} a prolonged subclinical phase lasting weeks to months in persons with HIV/AIDS {{before the onset of}} symptomatic meningitis. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence rates of detectable cryptococcal antigen in peripheral blood is often 4-12% in persons with CD4 counts lower than 100 cells/mcL.Cryptococcal antigen screen and preemptive treatment with fluconazole is cost saving to the healthcare system by avoiding cryptococcal meningitis. [...] The World Health Organization recommends cryptococcal antigen screening in HIV-infected persons entering care with CD4<100 cells/μL. This undetected subclinical cryptococcal (if not preemptively treated with anti-fungal therapy) will often go on to develop cryptococcal meningitis, despite receiving HIV therapy. [...] <b>Cryptococcosis</b> accounts for 20-25% of the mortality after initiating HIV therapy in Africa. What is effective preemptive treatment is unknown, with the current recommendations on dose and duration based on expert opinion. Screening in the United States is controversial, with official guidelines not recommending screening, despite cost-effectiveness and a 3% U.S. cryptococcal antigen prevalence in CD4<100 cells/μL.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the most}} common {{presentation}} of <b>cryptococcosis</b> is of C. neoformans infection in an immunocompromised person (such as persons living with AIDS), the C. gattii is being increasingly recognised as a pathogen in what is presumed to be immunocompetent hosts, especially in Canada and Australia. This {{may be due to}} rare exposure and high pathogenicity, or to unrecognised isolated defects in immunity, specific for this organism.|$|E
