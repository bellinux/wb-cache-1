2500|$|Hells Gate Airtram {{starts at}} {{the parking lot of}} the Trans-Canada Highway and descends to its lower {{terminal}} on the opposite side of Fraser River next to the pedestrian suspension bridge, where there is an observation deck, a restaurant, a gift shop and other tourist attractions. It was built in 1970 by the Swiss manufacturer Habegger Engineering Works and opened on 21 July 1971. Its two cabins can carry 25 people each, plus the cabin attendant. Each cabin travels up and down along its own track rope at a maximum speed of 5m/s (18km/h, 984ft/min) over an inclined length of 341m (1118ft). The horizontal distance between the terminals is 303m (994ft) and their difference in altitude is 157m (515ft). The mean inclination between the terminals is 51%. The track ropes have a diameter of 40mm, the haul rope connecting the two cabins via the drive bull wheel in the [...] upper terminal has a diameter of 19mm and its <b>counter</b> <b>rope</b> 15mm. The track ropes are anchored in the upper terminal and are tensioned by two concrete blocks of 42 tons each suspended inside the lower terminal where the blocks have a leeway of 7.9m to move up and down. The haul rope and its <b>counter</b> <b>rope</b> are tensioned by a counterweight of 3.5 tons, also in the lower terminal. The max output of the motor is 140 HP (104kW). The total carrying capacity of the aerial tramway is 530 passengers per hour (one way).|$|E

2500|$|In either case, Ali {{was able}} to {{occasionally}} <b>counter</b> off the <b>ropes</b> with blows to the face and penetrated Foreman's defense. Ali continued to take heavy punishment to the body and occasionally a hard jolt to the head. Ali later said he was [...] "out on his feet" [...] twice during the bout. Eventually, Foreman began to tire, and his punches became increasingly wild, losing power in the process. An increasingly confident Ali taunted Foreman throughout the bout. Late in the eighth round, Foreman was left off balance by a haymaker, and Ali sprang off the ropes with a flurry to Foreman's head, punctuated by a hard right cross that landed flush on the jaw, knocking Foreman down. Muhammad Ali was the first boxer to stop Foreman.|$|R
25|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Edge faced Booker T. Booker T gained the {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the match. However, Edge recovered by <b>countering</b> Booker's top <b>rope</b> attack with a hurricanrana and followed this up with a spinning heel kick off the top rope. Booker T executed a Scissors Kick, for a near-fall while Edge delivered a spear for a near fall. After performing his own version of Booker's Spinaroonie, Edge won the match with an Edgecution. Backstage, a cautious Hurricane was interviewed by Jonathan Coachman about winning the Hardcore Championship. The Hurricane's sidekick, Mighty Molly, appeared and suggested the two should go to their Hurri-Cycle. Just as Hurricane headed to that direction, Molly smashed a frying pan onto {{the back of his head}} and pinned him to become the new Hardcore Champion.|$|R
2500|$|Foreman {{remained}} inactive during 1975. In 1976, {{he announced}} a comeback and stated his intention of securing a rematch with Ali. His first opponent {{was to be}} Ron Lyle, who had been defeated by Muhammad Ali in 1975, via 11-th round TKO. At {{the end of the}} first round, Lyle landed a hard right that sent Foreman staggering across the ring. In the second round, Foreman pounded Lyle against the ropes and might have scored a KO, but due to a timekeeping error the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and Lyle survived. In the third, Foreman pressed forward, with Lyle waiting to <b>counter</b> off the <b>ropes.</b> In the fourth, a brutal slugfest erupted. A cluster of power punches from Lyle sent Foreman to the canvas. When Foreman got up, Lyle staggered him again, but just as Foreman seemed finished, he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head, knocking down Lyle. Lyle beat the count, then landed another brutal combination, knocking Foreman down for the second time. Again, Foreman beat the count. Foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered looking down at the canvas and seeing blood. In the fifth round, both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches, looking crude. Each man staggered the other, and each seemed almost out on his feet. Then, as if finally tired, Lyle stopped punching, and Foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until Lyle collapsed. Lyle remained on the canvas and was counted out, giving Foreman the KO victory. The fight was named by The Ring as [...] "The Fight of the Year." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{funicular}} railway operates by 'hauling' up one carriage using electric motors {{to pull the}} haul rope as the other carriage descends at the same time. The system is powered by two stationary in series 500 kW electric motors, a gear box and a 'soft start-soft stop' control system which can increase the electrical frequency and vary the current and voltage to control the carriage speeds as they approach or leave a station. A hydraulically operated 'counter' rope is connected to both carriages to maintain haul rope tension. The two carriages are permanently connected by the haul rope and the <b>counter</b> <b>rope</b> and can never operate independently.|$|E
