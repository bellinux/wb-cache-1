All formulations were prepared using a rate 60 : 40 (w/w) of sucrose and pulp, plus 0. 5 % pectin and the products reached to average of 65 % soluble solids content. The jellies were analyzed by chemical and physicochemical (titratable acidity, pH, soluble solid content, dry matter, total protein, lipids, vitamin C and calories) and sensory characteristics; also were evaluated levels of P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu and Mn. It was used a hedonic scale of 7 points to evaluate the attributes: overall impression, spreadability, brightness, flavor, texture and color, and also was verified the purchase intention score. The titratable acidity and pH ranged from 0. 46 to 0. 64 % and 3. 35 to 3. 64, respectively, that are within the range found at most fruit jellies. The soluble solids content ranged between 65. 2 and 65. 5 ºBrix.

40|$|Renal hypertrophy, {{induced by}} uninephrectomy (UNi), {{results in a}} 40 50 % {{increase}} in the RNA content per cell 4 days postoperatively (1). Virtually {{no change in the}} DNA content occurs over the 4 -day period (2). During the first 4 days of renal hypertrophy, incorporation of labeled nucleosides (uridine, orotate, and cytidine) into RNA showed no increase. Rates of synthesis of total kidney RNA from UNI mice, determined by measuring the labeling rates of RNA and UTP, showed no increase when compared to shams (3). Since the rate of synthesis is unchanged after UNI, the accretion of rRNA could occur by a decrease in degradation. However, the half-life of rRNA labeled before UNI is identical to sham value. Apparently RNA accretion during kidney hypertrophy does not occur by increased rate of transcription or decreased degradation of rRNA. These facts are compatible with the hypothesis that excess production and rapid degradation of newly synthesized rRNA occurs in the unstimulated kidney and that during renal hypertrophy the degradation is reduced.

Factor A was non-supplementation or supplementation with CH in the concentrate. Factor B was supplementation with RBO at 0 % or 4 % in the concentrate mixture. The four dietary treatments were (T 1) control (Concentrate with non-CH plus 0 % RBO; C), (T 2) Concentrate with CH plus 0 % RBO (<b>CH),</b> (<b>T</b> 3) Concentrate with non-CH plus 4 % RBO (RBO), and (T 4) Concentrate with CH plus 4 % RBO (CHRBO). The cows were offered concentrate, {{at a ratio of}} concentrate to milk production of 1 : 2, and urea-lime treated rice straw was fed ad libitum. Urea-lime treated rice straw involved 2. 5 g urea and 2. 5 g Ca(OH) 2 (purchased as hydrated lime) in 100 ml water, the relevant volume of solution was sprayed onto a 100 g air-dry (91 % DM) straw, and then covering the stack with a plastic sheet for a minimum of 10 d before feeding directly to animals. The CH based concentrate resulted in significantly higher roughage intake and total DM intake expressed as a percentage of BW (p< 0. 05). Ruminal pH, NH 3 -N, BUN and total VFA did not differ among treatments, while RBO supplementation increased propionate, but decreased acetate concentration (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, the population of total ruminal bacteria was significantly lower on the RBO diet (p< 0. 05). In contrast, the total ruminal bacteria and cellulolytic bacteria on the CH diet were higher than on the other treatments. Supplementation with CH increased (p< 0. 05) F. succinogens and R. flavefaciens populations, whereas the populations of B. fibrisolvens and M. elsdenii were increased on the RBO diet. In addition, supplementation with CH and RBO had no effect on milk production and composition in dairy cows, while fatty acid composition of milk was influenced by RBO supplementation, and resulted in significantly lower (p< 0. 05) concentrations of both short-chain and medium-chain FA, and increased (p< 0. 05) the proportion of long-chain FA in milk fat, as well as significantly increased cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA and total CLA. In conclusion, RBO or CH exhibited specific effects on DM, rumen fermentation, microbial population, milk yield and composition in lactating dairy cows, which were not interactions between CH and RBO in the diets. Feeding lactating dairy cows with RBO could improve fatty acid in milk fat by increasing cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA...|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{reaction of}} CH 4 and <b>CH</b> 3 <b>T</b> by silica- and alumina-supported catalysts was studied. The oxidation rate of methane was pseudo-first order {{with respect to}} the methane pressure and the catalytic activity of Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was higher than that of the Pt/SiO 2 catalyst. A kinetic isotope effect was observed for the oxidation reaction on the Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst; the activation energies for CH 4 and <b>CH</b> 3 <b>T</b> were 19. 2 and 17. 3 Kcal/mol, respectively. A large part of the tritium in <b>CH</b> 3 <b>T</b> was removed as the tritiated water, but some of it was trapped on the supported catalyst. Tritium was also found to be trapped on the surface of alumina, the amount being comparable to that observed for the Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Thus, the exchange reaction between <b>CH</b> 3 <b>T</b> and hydroxyl group on the Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is considered to a predominant role in the trapping of tritium on the catalyst. In regard to waste handling, the above findings demonstrate contamination of the oxidation catalyst due to the captured tritiu...|$|R
