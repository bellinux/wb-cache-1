Impulse purchases and <b>convenience</b> <b>goods</b> fall into this category. The purchase leads to feelings of satisfaction which, in turn, reinforces the purchase behavior. When this approach is the dominant purchase mode, advertising messages should [...] "congratulate" [...] customers on their purchase choice and the media strategy should be weighted towards options that reach customers when they {{are close to the}} point-of-purchase such as billboards, sales promotion and point-of-sale displays.

40|$|New plane-strain lateral {{consolidation}} equations are formulated that {{neglect the}} well resistance of vertical drains but are applicable for both Darcian and non-Darcian flow. The results of consolidation analyses using conventional Darcian (linear) flow {{and the new}} solution based on non-Darcian (exponential) flow are compared. A good match has been obtained between equivalent plane-strain and axisymmetric solutions. The advantage of the equivalent plane-strain procedure is that it not only matches the average degree of radial (axisymmetric) consolidation but also yields a more realistic excess pore pressure distribution in the lateral direction than the Darcian flow condition. The relevant parameters are illustrated graphically for <b>convenience.</b> <b>Good</b> agreement was obtained between the prediction of the new equivalent plane-strain solution and field data from a test area in Ska-Edeby, Sweden.

However, the general quality, range and size of city centre shops is poor, so Swansea is usually ranked outside the top 50 retail centres in the UK on various industry listings. The poor retail performance {{is believed to be}} the result of several factors, including poor urban design, lack of recent development and competition from out-of-town shops at Fforestfach and Morfa.|$|E
