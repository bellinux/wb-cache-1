5|$|Romney's {{liabilities}} included having run {{for senator}} {{and serving as}} governor {{in one of the}} nation's most liberal states and having taken positions in opposition to the party's <b>conservative</b> <b>base</b> during that time. Late during his term as governor, he had shifted positions and emphases to better align with traditional conservatives on social issues. Skeptics, including some Republicans, charged Romney with opportunism and a lack of core principles. As a Mormon, he faced suspicion and skepticism by some in the Evangelical portion of the party.|$|E

25|$|It {{would be}} no {{exaggeration to say that}} the Republican Party has been in a state of panic since the defeat of Mitt Romney, not least because the {{election}} highlighted American demographic shifts and, relatedly, the party's failure to appeal to Hispanics, Asians, single women and young voters. Hence the Republican leadership's new willingness to pursue immigration reform, even if it angers the <b>conservative</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{political}} {{dominance of}} the liberal consensus even into the Nixon years can best be seen in policies such as the successful establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency or his failed proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income {{by way of a}} negative income tax. Affirmative action in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. Even the Nixon [...] "War on Drugs" [...] allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, Republican or Democrat. Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and his policy of détente with the Soviet Union were probably more popular with liberals than with his <b>conservative</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The race drew {{significant}} {{national attention}} {{because of the}} relatively large amount of support for a third-party candidate from the national <b>conservative</b> <b>base.</b> Fiscal and social conservative groups backed Hoffman's candidacy. The Susan B. Anthony List embarked on a $100,000 independent expenditure campaign for Hoffman. Many notable Republicans, including former Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin, Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, endorsed Hoffman rather than the Republican candidate because they deemed Scozzafava insufficiently conservative and ideologically indistinguishable from the Democrat. Scozzafava also drew strong opposition from the Tea Party movement, with national Tea Party leader Michael Johns saying that his opposition to Scozzafava [...] "was {{the first time in}} my 25-year political and policy career that I ever opposed a Republican candidate." ...|$|E

Max Rafferty, a native of Louisiana, also considered running that year but instead successfully sought his second and final term as superintendent of public instruction, a nonpartisan position. In his 1998 work Triumph of the Right: The Rise of the California Conservative Movement, Kurt Schuparra called Shell [...] "embittered" [...] because the former Assemblyman believed {{that he should have}} the support of the <b>conservative</b> <b>base</b> that he had served so long and faithfully. Vernon Cristina, a Shell loyalist from 1962, tried to talk his friend out of running and instead to support Ronald Reagan. [...] "You don't have the ingredients to win," [...] said Cristina. Goldwater asked Rus Walton, who had been Shell's 1962 campaign manager, to convince Shell to defer to Reagan, but Walton declined to deliver the message to his old friend.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last major}} push for congressional action came in 1996–1997. [...] Several bills had been {{introduced}} in both the House and the Senate. The most prominent was Senator Don Nickles' [...] "Paycheck Protection Act," [...] which Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott re-introduced in 1998. The issue became caught in campaign finance reform legislation that year. Section 501 of the [...] "Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1997" [...] (BRCA) merely codified the Beck decision, but the [...] "Paycheck Protection Act" [...] went much further and required all workers to affirm {{on an annual basis}} whether their dues could be used for political purposes. Senator Lott offered the Nickles bill as an amendment to the BRCA, which many Democrats (and some Republicans) saw as a poison pill amendment. Under procedures adopted by the Senate, Senators would need to reject the Lott amendment before voting on the BRCA. But with Republicans unwilling to vote against the amendment (which was popular with their <b>conservative</b> <b>base),</b> the Lott amendment was added to the BRCA and the Beck amendment died along with the BRCA after a number of other procedural votes.|$|E
2500|$|After the convention, Clinton and Gore began a {{bus tour}} around the United States, while the Bush/Quayle {{campaign}} began to criticize Clinton's character, highlighting accusations of infidelity and draft dodging. The Bush campaign emphasized {{its foreign policy}} successes such as Desert Storm, {{and the end of}} the Cold War. Bush also contrasted his military service to Clinton's lack thereof, and criticized Clinton's lack of foreign policy expertise. However, as the economy was the main issue, Bush's campaign floundered across the nation, even in strongly Republican areas, and Clinton maintained leads with over 50 percent of the vote nationwide consistently, while Bush typically saw numbers in the upper 30s. As Bush's economic edge had evaporated, his campaign looked to energize its socially <b>conservative</b> <b>base</b> at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. At the Convention, Bush's primary campaign opponent Pat Buchanan gave his famous [...] "culture war" [...] speech, criticizing Clinton's and Gore's social progressiveness, and voicing skepticism on his [...] "New Democrat" [...] brand. After President Bush accepted his renomination, his campaign saw a small bounce in the polls, but this was short lived, as Clinton maintained his lead. The campaign continued with a lopsided lead for Clinton through September, until Ross Perot decided to re-enter the race. Ross Perot's re-entry in the race was welcome by the Bush campaign, as Fred Steeper, a poll taker for Bush, said, [...] "He'll be important if we accomplish our goal, which is to draw even with Clinton." [...] Initially, Perot's return saw the Texas billionaire's numbers stay low, until he was given the opportunity to participate in a trio of unprecedented three-man debates. The race narrowed, as Perot's numbers significantly improved as Clinton's numbers declined, while Bush's numbers remained more or less the same from earlier in the race as Perot and Bush began to hammer at Clinton on character issues once again.|$|E
