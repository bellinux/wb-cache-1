50|$|The {{use of the}} {{commutation}} {{table was}} independently developed in England-apparently between the years 1788 and 1811—by George Barrett, of Petworth, Sussex, who {{was the son of}} a yeoman farmer, and was himself a village schoolmaster, and afterwards farm steward or bailiff. It has been usual to consider Barrett as the originator in England of the method of calculating the values of annuities by means of a commutation table, and this method is accordingly sometimes called Barrett's method. (It is also called the <b>commutation</b> <b>method</b> and the columnar method.) Barrett's method of calculating annuities was explained by him to Francis Baily in 1811, and was first made known to the world in a paper written by the latter and read before the Royal Society in 1812.|$|E

Under suitable conditions, (1. 1) will imply existence of a unitary propagator U(s; t) for H(t), that is, H(t) = U(t; s) H(s) U(s; t); U(t; s) = U(t; s) Γ 1 = U(s; t) : (1. 2) As a trivial consequence we conclude that the norm kH(t) k of H(t) is independent of t.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a matrix converter. Matrix converters belong to the category of direct frequency converters. A converter does not contain DC-link and the output voltage is provided by direct switching of voltage from the input phases. This is enabled by 9 bidirectional switches, which are provided by anti-serial connection of 18 IGBT transistors. The absence of a DC-link is great advantage of the matrix converter, but it also increases the requirements on the converter control.

40|$|Abstract. A novel four-step {{commutation}} {{is proposed}} with unequal step for each bidirectional switch cell {{on the basis}} on analysis of many proposed <b>commutation</b> <b>methods</b> of matrix converter in this paper. The first and fourth step can be shorter than {{the second or third}} one because the actual switching on or off of output current happens on the second and third steps.

Second, the required switching states are flexibly realized {{in the form of the}} look-up table by programming in VHDL language for 36 switching combinations of input sectors with output ones.

H 577 P EE 2014 Changxvi, 117 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmIn this {{research}} different sensorless methods that could reliably help {{to remove the}} need to use position sensors in switched reluctance motors(SRM) are developed. These methods are different to the conventional ones by providing unique rotor positions without relying on premeasured motor magnetic characteristics. The approach is systematic and mathematical. The relationship among motor phase inductance profiles is investigated and three types of functions to model their relationship are presented. Through regression analysis the function coefficients are found. Methods to linearize these functions for regression are explained. These coefficients are then {{used to calculate the}} rotor positions at standstill or flying restart. The estimation accuracies and efficiencies of the methods using the three functions are compared. These methods are collectively called the Linear Regression Position Estimation Methods(LRPEM). Two methods for position estimation on a running motor are also developed. A special event called Adjacent Phase Inductance Profiles Crossing(APC) when an SRM is running is used to turn the motor into a low resolution encoder. The speed and position values obtained from this encoder are fed to a Kalman filter where detailed rotor position values are produced. The low resolution encoder is used to commutate the phases with limited speed and torque capability, while the high resolution outputs from the Kalman filter are used for fine commutations. The two <b>commutation</b> <b>methods</b> are compared and the effects from mutual couplings, voltage drops and magnetic saturation are shown. Department of Electrical EngineeringPh.
