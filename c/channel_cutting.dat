40|$|The {{alluvial}} deposits of braided rivers consist of channel-form bounding surfaces due to <b>channel</b> <b>cutting</b> and migration. It is unknown, however, {{to what extent}} these bounding surfaces result either from more gradual channel processes or from large but infrequent flood events. Field measurements of morphodynamically formed bounding surfaces associated with floods are not currently available. Flume experiments are useful here since concurrent observations of channel migration {{and the formation of}} bounding surfaces can be made whilst conditions are controlled. We report on two flume experiments with the objective {{to determine the effects of}} floods on i) <b>channel</b> <b>cutting</b> and migration and ii) alluvial architecture of braided gravel-bed rivers. One of the experiments has a constant bankfull discharge, and the other is run with a schematized long-duration low flow and short-duration high flow but otherwise similar conditions. High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are used to monitor channel migration and to create the three-dimensional braid-belt architecture. The data demonstrate that the flood events result in longer bars and more frequent chute cutoffs. The DEMs show neither deeper channels nor bar aggradation during multiple flood events compared to a steady bankfull discharge. Consequently, the braid-belt architecture that forms during these large floods does not significantly differ from the stratigraphic architecture that forms during more frequent bankfull flows. This implies that these events cannot be differentiated based on stratigraphy. Furthermore, we find that between 10 % and 40 % of the mean channel depth is preserved. This can be used to characterize braid-belt architecture for purposes of reservoir engineering and provides error bounds to reconstruct paleochannel dimensions from stratigraphy...|$|E
30|$|One of the {{key issues}} in {{high-performance}} TFTs is high on/off ratio for efficient switching behavior. In {{the case of a}} CNT channel, the as-grown CNT network usually contains both semiconducting and metallic CNTs [145]. These metallic CNT paths reduce the on/off ratio of the transistor [146]. Since controlling the ratio of semiconducting to metallic CNTs leads to a trade-off between on/off ratio and charge carrier mobility of a transistor, engineering the proper parameter is important in terms of the type of applications. In the case of zero band gap graphene, opening the band gap is a big challenge in the way of achieving a higher on/off ratio in transistors [127]. Here, we introduce several strategies for increasing the on/off ratio of a transistor. In CNTs, electrical thinning and selective <b>channel</b> <b>cutting,</b> and separation approaches are described below. BLG and nanoribbon approaches will be discussed for increasing the on/off ratio in graphene transistors.|$|E
40|$|Ultrashort laser pulses with {{durations}} in the femtosecond range up {{to a few}} picoseconds {{provide a}} unique method for the structuring of practically all materials with high precision and minimal thermal and mechanical influence of the surrounding. Due to the high intensities obtained in the focal volume even at moderate pulse energies not only surface structuring becomes possible but also the precise three-dimensional structuring within the bulk of transparent samples due to efficient nonlinear absorption processes. However, to exploit the full potential, a detailed knowledge of the interaction process of these intense pulses with matter is indispensable. Thus, this chapter describes the fundamentals of ultrashort pulse micromachining, including the absorption in transparent and absorbing materials, the energy relaxation processes, the resulting material modifications (ablation and bulk damage/modification), and some experimental considerations.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments to investigate the relationship between channel geometry and tectonic forcing in steady state landscapes at various uplift rates. The experimental setup consists of uniformly uplifted silica paste eroded by artificial rainfall. In this setup, erosional landscapes evolve by growth and amalgamation of incisions, which organize into a drainage network whose dynamics are {{a function of the}} interaction between vertical <b>channel</b> <b>cutting,</b> hillslope erosion, and sediment transport. High-precision (0. 5 mm pixel size) digital elevation models were constructed using a stereogrammetric camera system. From this data, channel bed slope was found to be independent of discharge and position on the experimental surface and to increase linearly with uplift rate. Geometric parameters of the flow, such as channel width or depth, could not be observed directly during the experiments. Using laminar flow equations for the mean flow velocity, these parameters were back calculated, and relationships to the imposed substrate uplift rate were derived. Channel width, cross-sectional area, and wetted perimeter decrease with increasing uplift rate to a limit value, hydraulic radius and flow depth increase slightly, and flow velocity increases approximately linearly with increasing uplift rate. These results are qualitatively consistent with recent field surveys and highlight the importance of channel width and slope variations in accommodating channel response to variable rock uplift rates...|$|E

40|$|A stratigraphic {{radiocarbon}} {{study at}} the Wilicox Playa and vicinity in Cochise County, southeastern Arizona has revealed a sedimentary sequence reflecting the lake level chronology of ancient Lake Cochise. The lower green clay was deposited in a lake at least 30 miles long from before 30, 000 years ago until about 13, 000 years ago. A marl formation which began depositing about 25, 000 years ago and continued until the lake diminishe to about its present state 13, 000 years ago, indicates a warm, moist climate at that time. The period from 13, 000 B. P. (before present) and 11, 000 B. P. was one of alluvial deposition north of the playa and <b>channel</b> <b>cutting</b> east of the playa.

In a small (f 8 km 2), upland sub-basin, differences in nuclide concentrations between bedrock outcrops and hillslope colluvium suggest weathering of bedrock beneath a colluvial cover is a more significant source of sediment (40 104 kg year 1) than weathering of exposed bedrock surfaces (10 104 kg year 1).

Although mapping the required 2500 -m isobath is relatively straight forward, locating the geomorphic foot of the slope is, in many areas, equivocal and requires mapping {{large areas of the}} lower slope. The large-area mapping required to support an UNCLOS submission, generates a dataset useful to a wide spectrum of disciplines and the new bathymetric maps will represent roadmaps {{for the next generation of}} continental-margin studies. As part of the U. S. UNCLOS effort, the entire U. S. Atlantic margin between the 1 and 5 km isobaths was mapped in 2004 and 2005. A 12 -kHz multibeam echosounder was used to provide bathymetry and co-registered backscatter, 3. 5 -kHz CHIRP profiler and gravity data were also collected. The bathymetric data cover 3 ̆e 600, 000 km 2 with a spatial resolution of 100 m. Eight New England Seamounts were mapped in their entirety. Talus piles, moats and sediment banks are common features around the seamounts. The northern seamounts fall along two trends; Balanus, Picket and Retriever Seamounts trend 118 deg whereas Retriever, Physalia and Bear Seamounts trend 94 deg. The change in trends occurred about 100 my ago. Mytilus Seamount and two other unnamed seamounts are offset 70 km to the SE and trend 108 deg. The trends and changes in trend suggest that the relationship of the seamounts to a single hotspot trend is too simplistic. Submarine canyon-channel systems (CCS) dominate the northern third of the Atlantic lower slope and rise, are less ubiquitous in the middle third and are rare in the southern third. The northern CCSs are composed of canyon channels distributed along the upper slope that are captured down slope by a single channel. Channel capture has resulted in hanging valleys of 10 to 100 m high. In the northern area, a CCS is composed of a broad channel plain incised by a narrow channel. This rejuvenation of <b>channel</b> <b>cutting</b> suggests a change has occurred in its equilibrium profile. The CCSs of the middle third of the margin are single-channel systems.

The timing and processes {{which led to the}} last connection between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea is still under keen debate. During ASSEMBLAGE European Project (EVK 3 -CT- 2002 - 00090) a seismic transect was shot from the Danube Delta down to the Deep Sea fan and four long piston cores (longer than 30 m) were recovered on specific targets. The seismic transect was analysed in term of sequence stratigraphy and a succession of depositional sequences and eroded phases were evidenced and the stacking pattern was made down to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The results obtained from the four core analyses allowed to complete and date the stratigraphic sequences evolution, from the Danube Delta down to the continental shelf edge. From this transect analysis it comes that since the LGM, the Black Sea evolution was induced by several important paleo-environmental changes underlined by a succession of systems tracts: (1) a lowstand system tract at - 160 m with a first erosion surface on the shelf associated with a proDelta extension formed during the LGM; (2) then a high-stand system tract at - 40 m can be associated with the Bölling-Alleröd Black Sea high-stand; (3) a second low-stand system tract between - 80 m and – 120 m associated to a second erosion surface on the shelf formed since the Younger Dryas and marked by a second proDelta.

40|$|The {{drainage}} {{pattern on}} the western piedmont of the Sierra de La Cantera is divergent, typical of alluvial fans and showing anomalies that {{are directly related to}} the trace of La Cantera thrust. In previous studies, two types of anomalies were identified: upstream of the fault scarp, rivers have a broom-shaped pattern, while downstream – in the hanging block – streams become denser, more sinuous and incised. In this contribution, these morphotectonic aspects were analyzed in detail, making direct and indirect analysis to quantify the relationship between these anomalies and the faults affecting alluvial fans. In addition, the influence of neotectonic activity on smaller water course patterns in the alluvial fan areas was investigated in order to find indicators of on-going vertical movements, since the spatial arrangements of these piedmont channels are determined by slope and structure, where active faults cause diversions or anomalies. Topographic profiles in two selected <b>channels</b> <b>cutting</b> across the trace of the fault were performed using a differential GPS in order to establish the relationship between the sinuosity and slope of these rivers. The results obtained allow us to state that the most sinuous channels have lower slopes and are located in the hanging wall of the fault. Morphometric analysis of scarps stated that active tectonics have played an essential role in controlling the drainage pattern in the piedmont, leading the rivers to adjust to these slope variations.

50|$|Certain {{extraordinary}} {{features were}} produced when the retreat {{of the ice}} sheet had progressed {{so far as to}} open an eastward outlet for the marginal lakes. This outlet occurred along the depression between the northward slope of the Appalachian plateau in west-central New York and the southward slope of the melting ice sheet. When this eastward outlet came to be lower than the south-westward outlet across the height of land to the Ohio or Mississippi river, the discharge of the marginal lakes was changed from the Mississippi system to the Hudson system. Many well-defined <b>channels,</b> <b>cutting</b> across the north-sloping spurs of the plateau in the neighborhood of Syracuse, New York, mark the temporary paths of the ice-bordered outlet river. Successive channels are found at lower and lower levels on the plateau slope, indicating the successive courses taken by the lake outlet as the ice melted farther and farther back. On some of these channels, deep gorges were eroded heading in temporary cataracts which exceeded Niagara in height but not in breadth. The pools excavated by the plunging waters {{at the head of the}} gorges are now occupied by little lakes. The most significant stage in this series of changes occurred when the glacio-marginal lake waters were lowered so that the long escarpment of Niagara limestone was laid bare in western New York. The previously confluent waters were then divided into two lakes. The higher one, Lake Erie, supplied the outflowing Niagara River, which poured its waters down the escarpment to the lower, Lake Ontario. This gave rise to Niagara Falls. Lake Ontario's outlet for a time ran down the Mohawk Valley to the Hudson River. At this higher elevation it was known as Lake Iroquois. When the ice melted from the northeastern end of the lake, it dropped to a lower level, and drained through the St. Lawrence area. This created a lower base level for the Niagara River, increasing its erosive capacity.|$|R
