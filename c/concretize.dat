25|$|While Conservative Judaism would {{affirm that}} the Torah is Divine in its origin, the revelation at Sinai {{is seen as}} the {{beginning}} of a relationship and not the final word. Interpretation is understood as our communal attempt to understand the will of a compassionate Divine partner. As we mature we are able to understand God's will for us more clearly. If a law appears unconscionable, we would say that the shortcoming is either our previous understanding or that circumstances have so changed that the rule no longer meets its intended result...The Conservative movement maintains {{that the purpose of the}} law in the first place is largely to <b>concretize</b> moral values, and so the specific form of the law can and should be changed if it is not effectively doing that. In other words, the Aggadah should control the halakha.|$|E
25|$|Festinger’s other {{well-known}} {{theory of}} cognitive dissonance, proposed in 1957 offers further evidence for {{why such a}} process might occur. Because emotional experiences are unexpected, they can affect one’s self-concept and thus challenge one’s system of beliefs. According to Festinger, when people’s expectations do not manifest themselves, a cognitive dissonance is created between the expectations and reality and people seek to reduce this dissonance by rationalizing the discrepancy. So after experiencing an emotion, people {{would be expected to}} communicate the event with others in order to help reduce their cognitive dissonance. An article by Thoits emphasizes the importance of the ability of others to assist in the process of coping. Other people are able to offer new perspectives on interpretations of the emotional event. In previous studies, Rimé concluded that emotions necessitate “cognitive articulation” because of their dense, complex nature. By using language to express an experience, people are forced to classify and organize the contents of the emotions, and furthermore can <b>concretize</b> and objectivize the experience into a script that can be more easily understood.|$|E

The MTYDP serves as a guiding framework for youth development and empowerment. It outlines steps that will help <b>concretize</b> what the youth themselves desire. The plan is a broad guide for action, and young Filipinos play a very important role in ensuring that the recommended policies, programs, and courses of actions are carried out.|$|E
5000|$|Many whistleblowers {{have stated}} that they were {{motivated}} {{to take action to}} put an end to unethical practices, after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations. A 2009 study found that whistleblowers are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices, as opposed to a gradual worsening. There are generally two metrics by which whistleblowers determine if a practice is unethical. The first metric involves a violation of the organization's bylaws or written ethical policies. These violations allow individuals to <b>concretize</b> and rationalize blowing the whistle. On the other hand, [...] "value-driven" [...] whistleblowers are influenced by their personal codes of ethics. In these cases, whistleblowers have been criticized for being driven by personal biases.|$|E
