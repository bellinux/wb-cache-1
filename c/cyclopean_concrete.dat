50|$|Ringedals Dam is a {{gravity dam}} by Ringedalsvatnet at Tyssedal in Odda {{municipality}} {{in the county}} of Hordaland, Norway. The dam was built in stages between 1909 and 1918 {{in connection with the}} hydroelectric power plant in Tyssedal and the factories in Odda. When the dam was completed in 1918 it was one of Europe’s largest gravity dams with a reservoir capacity of 222 million m3. The dam is built in <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>concrete</b> with 30% large-sized stones (plums) and dressed on both sides with approximately 20,000 m² of hand-cut granite stone, the largest of its kind in Norway. The dam is crowned by the date and initials of managing director Ragnvald Blakstad and topped with merlons in Neo-Romanesque style.|$|E
40|$|The Post Falls South Channel Dam {{is located}} on the Spokane River in Post Falls, Idaho. The {{concrete}} gravity dam was constructed in 1906 and was recently rehabilitated. The rehabilitation project included several design elements; the primary objectives were the replacement of the six spillway gates and hoists and significant rehabilitation of the concrete. The South Channel Dam rehabilitation encountered several challenges due to the age and condition of the existing structure, the large scale of the rehabilitation, and the location of the project. The concrete rehabilitation addressed several challenges which are presented in detail. The existing <b>concrete</b> consisted of <b>cyclopean</b> concrete; <b>concrete</b> demolition and surface preparation also revealed large voids and substantial areas of low strength material. This paper presents lessons learned along with procedural methods implemented for effective change management during construction. The project was ultimately a success in a large part due to the team approach and practices implemented during construction...|$|R
