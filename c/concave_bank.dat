40|$|International audienceThis study {{examined}} the temporal dynamics and longitudinal distribution of wood over a multi-decadal timescale at the river reach scale (36 km) and a meander bend scale (300 ? 600 m) in the Ain River, a large gravel-bed river flowing through a forested corridor, and adjusting to regulation and floodplain land-use change. At the 36 km scale, more wood was recruited by bank erosion in 1991 ? 2000 than since the 1950 s. The longitudinal distribution of accumulations was similar between 1989 and 1999, but in both years individual pieces occurred homogeneously throughout the reach, while jam distribution was localized, associated with large <b>concave</b> <b>banks.</b> A relationship between {{the mean number of}} pieces and the volume recruited by bank erosion (r 2 = 0 · 97) indicated a spatial relationship between areas of wood production and storage. Wood mass stored and produced and channel sinuosity increased from 1993 to 2004 at three meander bends. Sinuosity was related to wood mass recruited by bank erosion during the previous decade (r 2 = 0 · 73) and both of these parameters were correlated to the mean mass of wood/plot (r 2 = 0 · 98 and 0 · 69 respectively), appearing to control wood storage and delivery at the bend scale. This suggests a local origin of wood stored in channel, not input from upstream trapped by preferential sites. The increase in wood since 1950 is a response to floodplain afforestation, to a change from braided to meandering channel pattern in response to regulation, and to recent large floods. We observed temporal stability of supply and depositional sectors over a decade (on a reach scale). Meander bends were major storage sites, trapping wood with <b>concave</b> <b>banks,</b> also delivering wood. These results, and the link between sinuosity and wood frequency, establish geomorphology as a dominant wood storage and recruitment control in large gravel-bed rivers...|$|R

5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{secondary}} flow in the boundary layer along {{the floor of the}} river bed. The boundary layer is not moving fast enough to balance the pressure gradient and so its path is partly downstream and partly across the stream from the <b>concave</b> <b>bank</b> toward the convex bank, driven by the pressure gradient. [...] The secondary flow is then upward toward the surface where it mixes with the primary flow or moves slowly across the surface, back toward the <b>concave</b> <b>bank.</b> [...] This motion is called helicoidal flow.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{circular}} {{path of a}} stream around a bend {{the surface of the}} water is slightly higher near the <b>concave</b> <b>bank</b> (the bank with the larger radius) than near the convex bank. This slight slope on the water surface of the stream causes a slightly greater water pressure on the floor of the stream near the <b>concave</b> <b>bank</b> than near the convex bank. This pressure gradient drives the slower boundary layer across the floor of the stream toward the convex bank. The pressure gradient is capable of driving the boundary layer up the shallow sloping floor of the point bar, causing sand, gravel and polished stones to be swept and rolled up-hill.|$|E

Based on the primary and secondary flows in a meandering channel, erosion (deposition) occurs along the <b>concave</b> (convex) <b>bank</b> (Abad and Garcia 2009; Hubbard et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011) and {{is associated with a}} dip change from <b>concave</b> to convex <b>bank</b> orientation. The direction of internal dip parallel to the meandering loop axis is the largest and named the ‘true dip’, whereas the direction of internal dip is away from the meandering loop axis, which is known as the ‘apparent dip’ (true dip[*]>[*]apparent dip) (Fig.  3 B–B′ profile). Additionally, when the internal dip sets change direction, it may indicate that the channel pattern converts into another. Furthermore, the riffle zone is located in the bend inflection where one-way transverse circulation transforms into parallel circulation (the down-cut ability of parallel circulation is weak), which usually carries sand and results in thin sand body accumulation.|$|R

The vegetation recovery index (C) was proposed to calculate and evaluate the vegetation recovery rate. The results showed that the vegetation restoration rate has achieved 47. 1 % in natural plant succession one year after the earthquake.

5000|$|When a river {{reaches a}} low-lying plain, often {{in its final}} course to the sea or a lake, it meanders widely.

In contrast, both lateral erosion and undercutting occur on the cut bank or <b>concave</b> <b>bank</b> (the bank with the greater radius.) Continuous deposition on the convex bank and erosion of the <b>concave</b> <b>bank</b> of a meandering river cause {{the formation of a}} very pronounced meander with two [...] banks getting closer. The narrow neck of land between the two neighboring concave banks is finally cut through, either by lateral erosion of the two concave banks or by the strong currents of a flood. When this happens, a new straighter river channel is created and an abandoned meander loop, called a cutoff, is formed. When deposition finally seals off the cutoff from the river channel, an oxbow lake is formed. This process can occur over a time scale from a few years to several decades and may sometimes become essentially static.|$|E
40|$|Research {{concerning}} {{changes of}} intensity of suspended load transport {{was done in}} the lower course of the Obra river near Miêdzyrzecz (Western Poland). Hydrological measurements were realized within 1 km long and 70 – 150 m wide section of the Obra river valley, which is situated about 3 km north-west of Miêdzyrzecz. Detailed analysis of relation between suspended sediment concentration and discharge afforded possibility for preliminary determining the way of suspended sediment supply to the river bed during high water stages. It was supposed that exposures of glacial and fluvioglacial sediments in high <b>concave</b> <b>banks</b> could be an important factor influencing the amount of delivery of suspended material. On the other hand, normal hysteretic loops (oriented clockwise) were observed in cross-sections 4 and 5. That fact would suggest that transported material originates form the Obra river bed or its nearest neighborhood. Besides, the process of sediment accretion was observed on the fragment of drowned floodplain during high water stages. This investigation allowed to illustrate the mechanism of forming floodplain sediments both at present and in the past. The problem of changes of amount of suspended load in longer time periods also was discussed. On the basis of measurement data and hydrological data from Miêdzyrzecz water-gauge, annual amount of suspended load was calculated for years 1971 – 1991. The main factor, which influenced the amount of sediment transport, was frequency of high water stages and hydraulic conditions of flow in the river bed. Flood events also were very important because of increased possibilities of suspended sediment supply from floodplain and steep bank slopes...|$|R
40|$|Bend {{instability}} is {{the process}} whereby perturbations of the planform distribution of a channel relative to a straight configuration may grow, driven by erosion at <b>concave</b> <b>banks</b> and deposition at convex banks, leading {{to the development of}} a meandering pattern. Here we investigate the nature of this instability; that is, we ascertain under what conditions bend instability is convective or absolute. In the former case, an initial nonpersistent, small perturbation localized in space is convected away, eventually leaving the flow domain unperturbed. In the latter case, perturbations spread in both the upstream and downstream directions, eventually affecting the whole flow domain. In convective instabilities, the spatial-temporal development of perturbations is somewhat dependent on the characteristics of the initial perturbation which is required to be persistent in time. On the contrary, absolute instabilities are able to amplify perturbations, even if triggered at some initial time and then ceased. If bend instability is convective, planform information migrates only in one direction, while in the absolute regime, information is propagated in both directions. We show that bend instability is most often, though not invariably, convective at both a linear and nonlinear level. Moreover, the group velocity of perturbations changes sign as the width to depth ratio of the channel crosses some threshold value (the resonant value of Blondeaux and Seminara (1985)) : Below (above) resonance, information is propagated downstream (upstream). We discuss the implications that these findings have on the morphological characteristics of meandering rivers (in particular, the sense of skewing of meander bends and the direction of meander migration). We also clarify how the choice of appropriate boundary conditions in numerical simulations of planform evolution is crucially dependent on the nature of bend instability and on its subresonant or superresonant regime...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{processes}} {{near the}} (<b>concave)</b> outer <b>bank</b> in curved river reaches are investigated {{in a laboratory}} flume, with focus {{on the influence of}} the bank roughness. An outer-bank cell of reversed secondary flow occurs for all the investigated roughness configurations of the outer bank. The cell widens the outer-bank boundary layer, which reduces the flow forcing on the bank, but also advects high-momentum fluid toward {{the lower part of the}} bank, which enhances the flow forcing on the bank. Increasing the roughness of the outer bank causes a considerable widening and strengthening of the outer-bank cell, which amplifies both effects on the flow forcing. The widening of the outer-bank boundary layer induced by the outer-bank cell reduces the effective width of the channel, i. e., the width where most of the discharge is conveyed, which increases significantly the sediment transport capacity in the central part of the channel. The near-bank processes are qualitatively similar but show considerable quantitative variations around the bend. The outer-bank cell reaches its maximum strength in the zone that is most vulnerable to bed scour and bank erosion, which corroborates its morphological relevance. The outer cell is mainly generated by reversed near-surface gradients in the profile of the streamwise velocity. The anisotropy of the cross-stream turbulence is the major mechanism opposed to the outer-bank cell. Increasing roughness of the outer bank amplifies all dominant mechanisms but does not modify their relative importance. The relevance of the experimental results for natural curved river configurations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of rivers in Tuscany have channel planforms, which are neither {{straight}} nor what is usually understood as meandering. In the typical case, they consist of an almost straight, slightly incised main channel fringed with large lateral bars and lunate-shaped embayments eroded into the former flood plain. In the past, these rivers have not been recognised as an individual category and have often been considered to be either braided or meandering. It is suggested here {{that this type of}} river planform be termed pseudomeandering. A typical pseudomeandering river (the Cecina River) is described and analysed to investigate the main factors responsible for producing this channel pattern. A study reach (100300 m) was surveyed in detail and related to data on discharge, channel changes after floods and grain-size distribution of bed sediments. During 18 months of topographic monitoring, the inner lateral bar in the study reach expanded and migrated towards the <b>concave</b> outer <b>bank</b> which, concurrently, retreated by as much as 25 m. A sediment balance was constructed to analyse bar growth and bank retreat in relation to sediment supply and channel morphology. The conditions necessary to maintain the pseudomeandering morphology of these rivers by preventing them from developing a meandering planform, are discussed and interpreted as a combination of a few main factors such as the flashy character of floods, sediment supply (influenced by both natural processes and human impact), the morphological effects of discharges with contrasting return intervals and the short duration of flood events. Finally, the channel response to floods with variable sediment transport capacity (represented by bed shear stress) is analysed using a simple model. It is demonstrated that bend migration is associated with moderate floods while major floods are responsible for the development of chute channels, which act to suppress bend growth and maintain the low sinuosity configuration of the river.

Any chance irregularity is exaggerated, and in time a series of large serpentines or meanders is developed, the most-symmetrical examples at present being those near Greenville, Mississippi.

This tendency is counteracted by the sudden occurrence of cut-offs from time to time, so that a fairly constant length is maintained.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} to secure uniformity of depth {{in a river}} by lowering the shoals obstructing the channel depends {{on the nature of}} the shoals. A soft shoal in the bed of a river is due to deposit from a diminution in velocity of flow, produced by a reduction in fall and by a widening of the channel, or to a loss in concentration of the scour of the main current in passing over from one <b>concave</b> <b>bank</b> to the next on the opposite side. The lowering of such a shoal by dredging merely effects a temporary deepening, for it soon forms again from the causes which produced it. The removal, moreover, of the rocky obstructions at rapids, though increasing the depth and equalizing the flow at these places, produces a lowering of the river above the rapids by facilitating the efflux, which may result in the appearance of fresh shoals at the low stage of the river. Where, however, narrow rocky reefs or other hard shoals stretch across the bottom of a river and present obstacles to the erosion by the current of the soft materials forming the bed of the river above and below, their removal may result in permanent improvement by enabling the river to deepen its bed by natural scour.|$|E

By 1907 the state of Kansas had answered a Missouri petition and filed for ownership of the island, which was declared part of Kansas on March 22, 1909, by the United States Supreme Court (in 1940, the USGS mapped the state boundary as a straight north-south line demarcating a small eastern portion of [...] "Fairfax Airport" [...] in Missouri.)

As the axis was so rotated that the concave-bank end turned downstream, the scour diminished rapidly, the eroded depth along the outer bank becoming sensibly uniform. It increased again, however, with a further rotation of the axis. The optimum angle of rotation for the axis of the upstream dam, when scour was the slightest, was ascertained to be about 15 ° for the discharge 10 l/s and about 5 ° for 5 l/s. With the latter rate of discharge, an appreciable scour was observed back of the downstream dam in close proximity to the outer bank, when the axis of the upper dam was inclined some twenty degrees to the initial direction...|$|E

The Beni River, an Amazonian free meandering river, makes the transition between Andean ranges and Amazonian lowlands. For the period 2002 - 2006, an assemblage of tools and methods ({{water and sediment}} discharges, topometric and bathymetric surveys, sedimentation rate estimations from unsupported Pb- 210 and sediment trapping system) was used to jointly analyse the influence on the sediment budget of external factors (mainly water and sediment discharge) and the inherent behaviour of the system. The main issue addressed is {{the investigation of the}} complex relationship between 'morphological conditioning' of fluvial landform and process. The first part of the study was undertaken with the aim of linking erosion-deposition in an active meander with water and sediment fluxes. The three inter-annual evolutions are characterized by very unequal sediment budgets; the first two intervals underwent predominant erosion, and the latter slight accumulation. Digital elevation models, evaluated for the active meander, demonstrate that sedimentation on the point bar depends more on external factors than erosion of the <b>concave</b> <b>bank,</b> which fluctuates slightly. The second part of the study, focusing on water and sediment exchanges between active bend and floodplain, examines the respective parts played by overbank flow and by an abandoned channel on the diffusion and sequestration of sediment. The association of short-and long-term estimation of sedimentation rates suggests that floodplain construction is associated with two different processes and rhythms of sediment transportation.

40|$|The Hennisdijk fluvial {{system in}} the central Rhine-Meuse delta is an {{abandoned}} Rhine distributary that was active on a wide floodplain from 3800 to 3000 years BP. Cross-sectional geometry, lithological characteristics and planform patterns of the channel-belt deposits indicate lateral migration of the Hennisdijk palaeochannel. Channel-belt deposits are around 10 m thick and 200 ¿ 400 m wide. A gravelly facies near {{the base of the}} channel-belt deposits represents channel-lag and lower point-bar deposits. The axis of the channel belt is dominated by a sandy facies (medium and coarse sand), showing an overall fining upward trend with multiple cycles. This facies is interpreted as lower and middle point-bar deposits. The sandy facies is capped by a muddy facies, which is 1 ¿ 2 m thick near the axis of the channel belt and thickens to 5 ¿ 6 m along the margins. It laterally interfingers with the sandy facies that occurs near the channel-belt axis, but it has sharp, erosive outer contacts marking the edges of the channel belt. The muddy facies comprises inclined heterolithic stratification (IHS) (fine/medium sand¿mud couplets) in its upper part. The relatively thin muddy facies with IHS that occurs near the channel-belt axis is interpreted as upper point-bar deposits with lateral accretion surfaces, formed under marine influence. Along the margins of the channel belt the muddy facies consists of thick, fairly homogeneous, successions of mud with variable sand content, and fine sand. Based on facies geometry and position, this part of the muddy facies is interpreted as counterpoint deposits, formed along the upstream limb of the <b>concave</b> <b>bank</b> of a channel bend.
