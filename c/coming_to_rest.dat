5|$|On 25 May 1933, a {{passenger}} train was derailed at , London, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> foul of an adjacent line. Locomotive No. 1618, hauling {{a passenger}} train, {{was in a}} side-long collision with it. Five {{people were killed and}} 35 were injured. The cause of the accident was the failure to implement a speed restriction on a section of track that was under maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The Bonanza had {{impacted}} terrain at high speed, {{estimated to}} have been around , banked steeply {{to the right and}} in a nose-down attitude. The right wing tip had struck the ground first, sending the aircraft cartwheeling across the frozen field for , before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> against a wire fence at the edge of Juhl's property.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the islands}} {{were said to have}} Culdee {{connections}}, and had chapels on them. Various saints also have connections with the islands. St Thaney or Thenaw was reputedly the mother of St Kentigern and {{is said to have been}} cast adrift in an oarless coracle in deep waters beyond the Isle of May by her father King Leudonus, which resulted in an abundance of fish in the seas nearby. St Adrian of May was murdered there by invading Danes in 870 (who killed St Monance in the same raid). He was buried in a stone coffin on the island but is said to have floated across the Firth before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> in a churchyard at Anstruther. The Isle of May has a long history of ecclesiastical activity and there are various remains including that of a 13th-century Benedictine church.|$|E
50|$|Rest-stroke apoyando; {{the finger}} that plucks a string {{rests on the}} next string—traditionally used in single melody lines—versus free-stroke tirando (plucking the string without <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> on the next string).|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} he stood still, looking before him with an intense gaze, a gaze rapt and immobile, that seemed to watch the minute quivering of a {{delicate}} balance, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At 0900, Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers from [...] {{attacked}} the still-burning Heian Maru, a torpedo striking her amidships {{on the port}} side. She sank soon after, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> on her port side in about 110 feet of water.|$|R
5|$|Passengers {{said that}} the {{carriages}} of the train began rocking and swaying violently before the train left the rails and careered down an embankment, with the first carriages jack-knifing {{and most of the}} train <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> in a field. The train was reported as being evacuated around midnight. Emergency crews scanned the train with thermal imagery equipment to make sure there was no one still inside. Up to 500 rescuers attended the scene, along with at least 12 ambulances, at least five fire engines, three Royal Air Force Sea King search and rescue helicopters, the International Rescue Corps, three civilian mountain rescue teams plus RAF Leeming Mountain Rescue Team, and one Merseyside Police helicopter. The rescue operation was hindered by rain, darkness, and access problems caused by the narrow country lanes and muddy fields. Emergency vehicles experienced difficult conditions, needing to be towed by farm vehicles or tractors after becoming bogged down in mud.|$|E
5|$|In November {{a number}} of sailors aboard El Scipión took {{advantage}} of her officers' shore leave and mutinied, seizing control of the ship. The vessel, repurposed as a pirate ship, began operating in the Mona Passage and was later seen at Mayagüez before disappearing from the record. Cofresí was linked to El Scipión by pirate Jaime Márquez, who admitted under police questioning on Saint Thomas that boatswain Manuel Reyes Paz was a Cofresí associate. The confession hints that the ship was captured by Hispaniola authorities. Cofresí is recorded in the Dominican Republic, where his crew reportedly rested off Puerto Plata province. On one excursion, the pirates were intercepted by Spanish patrol boats {{off the coast of}} Samaná Province. With no apparent escape route, Cofresí is said to have ordered the vessel's sinking and it sailed into Bahía de Samaná before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> near the town of Punta Gorda. This created a diversion, allowing him and his crew to escape in skiffs they rowed to shore and adjacent wetlands (where the larger Spanish ships could not follow). The remains of the ship, reportedly full of plunder, have not been found.|$|E
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} race start, reports of rain falling on the track caused the start to be delayed by around ten minutes. Race control {{eventually}} deemed the race to be dry enough {{to be called a}} dry race, thus the rain tyres were not necessary, but would be required later in the race. Dario Franchitti and Alex Tagliani led the field to the line, with the circuit still being dusty from the previous night's repair work. Dust clouds engulfed the start-finish straight, blinding many of the midfield runners. The top five runners managed to negotiate the first chicane cleanly, while behind, half a dozen cars were involved in a first-corner crash. Takuma Sato misjudged his braking into the first corner and clipped the rear of Will Power's Penske machine, which spun him into Scott Dixon. Hélio Castroneves could not avoid running into Dixon's stationary car at the first corner. After many drivers went down the escape road to avoid being involved in the crash, a separate accident took place between Marco Andretti and Mario Moraes. Moraes lost control of his KV Racing Technology car behind Ana Beatriz, hit Andretti and became airborne before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> across the cockpit of Andretti's car. It took several minutes to extricate Andretti from his damaged machinery, but was uninjured and very critical of Moraes' driving. The crash resulted in a seven-lap caution period, and eliminated Sato, Moraes and Andretti from the race. Dixon and Castroneves both recovered to the pit lane to repair damage.|$|E
5000|$|Ryan Newman had a {{crash in}} this race, {{in which his}} car got clipped by Ken Schrader coming off of turn 4 and slid down the front straightaway, {{flipping}} violently in the tri-oval and <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> on its roof.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} months grey seals can be seen hauled out on rocks, islands, and shoals not far from shore, {{occasionally}} <b>coming</b> ashore <b>to</b> <b>rest.</b> In the spring recently weaned pups and yearlings occasionally strand on beaches after becoming separated from their group.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stone is}} {{released}} as the thrower approaches the hog line, {{at which point}} the turn is imparted by a slight clockwise or counter-clockwise twist of the handle from around the two or ten o'clock position to the twelve o'clock on release. A typical rate of turn is about [...] rotations before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 18 April 1918, {{a freight}} train became divided, the rear part <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> inside Redhill Tunnel, Surrey. Due to a signalman's error, another freight train ran into the wagons and was derailed. A third freight train ran into the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1987, a {{chartered}} Beechcraft King Air (LN-PAG) {{with six}} passengers crashed during landing at Stord Airport, Sørstokken, 20 metres {{ahead of the}} runway. The aircraft skidded for about 100 metres before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> in a snow bank. There were no injuries.|$|E
25|$|Pilots {{would often}} claim {{that one could}} fly a P-47 through a brick wall and live, in the post-war era one Air National Guard Thunderbolt plowed into the second story of a factory, {{shearing}} off its wings, with the crumpled fuselage eventually <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> inside the building, the pilot walked away alive.|$|E
50|$|Closer {{to the end}} of the trunk, the {{vertices}} of the IK curve {{are given}} lower weights. Thus, for example, if the goal curve was parented to the elephant and a gravity field was in effect, if the elephant stopped walking, the end of the IK curve and, thus, the end of the trunk would continue to move, dangle back and forth, ultimately <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> in the position determined by the goal curve.|$|R
60|$|Shorty, {{listening}} at {{the closed}} door, {{heard all the}} sounds of a windlass hoisting a load, and caught himself unconsciously attempting to estimate the depth of shaft out of which this load was being hoisted. Next came a pause, and in his mind's eye he saw the bucket swinging short to the windlass. Then he heard the quick lower-away and the dull sound as of the bucket <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> abrupt <b>rest</b> {{on the edge of the}} shaft. He threw open the door, beaming.|$|R
50|$|In 1967 he {{was hired}} to drive Cotton Owens' Dodge. He ran 14 races, and had 3 top-5 finishes. On lap 81, he tangled with another driver at Darlington, went over the guardrail, and flipped {{numerous}} times before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest.</b> The wrecks frustrated McQuagg, and he scaled back his schedule to mainly local tracks. He retired from racing to become a commercial pilot, which was a skill {{he had learned to}} travel quickly between races. His last start came in World 600 in 1974.|$|R
25|$|In a {{somewhat}} similar phenomenon, the dam portion {{east of the}} center section had also broken into several larger and smaller pieces. Unlike the western side, most of these ended lying near {{the base of the}} standing section. The largest fragments fell across the lower portion of the standing section, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> partially on its upstream face.|$|E
25|$|Pascack Valley Line train #1614 {{left the}} Spring Valley station in Spring Valley, New York, at 7:23a.m. EDT, bound for Hoboken. Entering the Hoboken {{terminal}} around 8:45a.m., the train {{went over the}} bumper block and through the rail concourse, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> at the wall right before the station's waiting area. The cab car sustained major structural damage.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, George {{finds the}} sphinx in charred ruins and its doors open. His time machine sits just inside. He enters, the doors close, and George is {{attacked}} {{in the dark}} by Morlocks. George sends his time machine hurtling into the past, back to 1900, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> on the lawn outside his home, where the story had begun, and now ends.|$|E
6000|$|The roof {{is entirely}} by Paul Veronese, and the {{traveller}} who really [...] loves painting, {{ought to get}} leave {{to come to this}} room whenever he [...] chooses; and should pass the sunny summer mornings there again and [...] again, wandering now and then into the Anti-Collegio and Sala dei [...] Pregadi, and <b>coming</b> back <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> under the wings of the couched lion [...] {{at the feet of the}} [...] "Mocenigo." [...] He will no otherwise enter so deeply [...] into the heart of Venice.|$|R
50|$|Asiana Airlines Flight 162 (OZ162/AAR162) was {{a regular}} short-haul {{international}} passenger flight from Incheon International Airport near Seoul, South Korea, to Hiroshima Airport in Hiroshima, Japan. On 14 April 2015, the Airbus A320-232 aircraft touched down short of the runway, struck the localizer array, skidded onto the runway on its tail, and spun 120 degrees before finally <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> on the grass, opposite the terminal building. The aircraft suffered substantial damage to the left wing and engine. Of the 82 people aboard, 27 (25 passengers and two crew) were injured, one seriously.|$|R
50|$|On 20 February 2004 a Learjet 25B {{owned by}} Skylinks Jets overran runway 8 by about 1750 ft feet. The {{aircraft}} touched down midway along the runway. A complete loss of brakes and a failed emergency drag-chute {{resulted in the}} aircraft overrunning the runway, crashing through the airport perimeter fence, across a four-lane highway and <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> at a warehouse structure. The cause of the accident was the pilot-in-commands mis-calculation of fuel needed and {{a failure of the}} flight crew to deploy the emergency drag-chute and main-gear brakes upon landing.|$|R
25|$|Practice summary: At 2:19p.m., rookie Conor Daly {{crashed in}} turn one, {{the first major}} {{incident}} of the week. Halfway through the turn, the rear end stepped out, and he made contact with the SAFER barrier at the exit one with the right side. He spun through the southchute, and the car nearly overturned, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> upright in turn 2. Daly exited the car and was uninjured.|$|E
25|$|When Flight 420 {{was near}} the runway threshold, the {{severely}} damaged left wing failed. The aircraft then rotated 90 degrees to the left: fuel spilled from the aircraft and ignited. The aircraft spiralled and crashed, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> {{on the left side}} of Runway 24L. All 2 crew members and 9 passengers on board were killed. 2 passengers initially survived the crash, but ultimately died of their injuries.|$|E
25|$|The year 2000 Code {{was a major}} change, {{and added}} the No ball {{sanction}} for waist-high fast beamers, balls bouncing over head height, and balls bouncing more than twice or <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> {{in front of the}} striker. It also removed the judgement of intent to intimidate on fast short pitched bowling. Prior to 2000, one No Ball run penalty was only scored if no runs were scored otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 May 1998 two {{train drivers}} died when their freight train derails near Robertson, {{south-west}} of Wollongong, NSW. The train {{they were driving}} was 1BY4 Brisbane to Whyalla Steel Train headed by NR3, NR26 and NR57. At 05:30 in the pouring rain and heavy fog, the abutments of a recently replaced road overbridge collapsed onto the tracks. The leading locomotive derailed onto its side and the roof was ripped off by the abutments of the new bridge. The train then pushed the locomotive into a mound of mud before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, {{two people}} were killed when a motor vehicle and an express down service X'Trapolis train {{collided}} at the Surrey Hills Level Crossing. Severe damage resulted to the train and the vehicle when the vehicle was dragged 150 meters before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a mangled <b>rest</b> between the station platform and train. The station underpass was also damaged. The investigation is ongoing.|$|R
25|$|Similar to a funnel, a half-pipe {{features}} a slide in which riders oscillate back and forth. However, {{this style of}} ride does not feature any enclosed sections. On a Waterfun Product Sidewinder or Sidewinder Mini, riders oscillate several times before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> {{at the base of}} the slide. Riders then need to walk off the slide returning their tube to the next riders. On a WhiteWater West Boomerango or Family Boomerango, riders are sent down a steep drop and up a steep hill on the other side, before sliding backwards down another path to the end of the slide.|$|R
25|$|On 22 August 1999, China Airlines Flight 642 (an MD-11 {{operated}} by subsidiary Mandarin Airlines), which was landing at Hong Kong International Airport during Typhoon Sam after {{a flight from}} Bangkok International Airport (now Bangkok Don Mueang International Airport), rolled over and caught fire, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> upside down beside the runway. Of the 315 passengers and crew on board, three {{people were killed and}} 219 were injured.|$|E
25|$|On 4 August 1920, the 13.10 {{train from}} Ford had a brake failure. The train hit the buffer stops, {{demolishing}} them, {{going through the}} station and Albert Road, eventually <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> in Franciscan way. There were about thirty passengers in the train, of whom thirteen suffered from minor injuries, or {{from the effects of}} shock. The driver and fireman escaped injury by jumping from the foot-plate just before the collision occurred.|$|E
25|$|As {{the year}} turned, 77a Squadriglia was re-equipped with Nieuport 17 single-seat fighters. In March 1917, it began {{receiving}} Spad VIIs, which it embalzoned with the squadron {{symbol of a}} heart in a white circle. The unit was drawn into the northern frontier fighting at Caporetto. As {{a result of that}} Italian defeat, the squadron was forced to relocate rapidly three times. After <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> at Marcon, the squadron was attached as part of 13o Gruppo.|$|E
60|$|In {{this state}} of mind, and much worn and fagged in body, with soiled and rent {{garments}} that told of weeks upon weeks of toil, he entered the circle, or open space before referred <b>to,</b> and, <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a stand, <b>rested</b> {{the butt of his}} gun on one of his snowshoes, heaved a deep sigh, and looked round, as if undecided how to act.|$|R
50|$|Whilst {{en-route}} but nearing {{its destination}} the aircraft experienced severe turbulence and was cleared to successively lower altitudes {{in an attempt}} to avoid the turbulence. During the descent the aircraft entered a region of severe precipitation, which caused both engines to flame-out due to very high levels of water ingestion. The crew managed to re-light both engines but lost control and impacted the ground. The aircraft struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing low attitude, bounced and then struck the ground a second time, sliding along the ground <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> inverted. Both crew and eleven of the passengers were killed in the accident.|$|R
50|$|On May 27th 2017, A Summit Air (former Goma Air) Let L-410, {{registration}} 9N-AKY {{performing a}} freight flight from Kathmandu to Lukla (Nepal) with three crew, was on final approach to Lukla's runway 06 at about 14:04L (08:19Z) with poor visibility when the aircraft contacted a tree {{short of the}} runway and subsequently contacted ground about 3 meters/10 feet below the runway level. The aircraft slid down the slope before <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a <b>rest</b> about 200 meters below the runway level. The captain was killed and the first officer died in hospital almost eight hours later. The third crew member received injuries and was evacuated to Kathmandu the following day after the weather had cleared.|$|R
