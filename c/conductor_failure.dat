50|$|Dead-end towers {{are used}} at regular {{intervals}} in a long transmission line to limit the cascading tower failures that might occur after a <b>conductor</b> <b>failure.</b> An in-line dead-end tower will have two sets of strain insulators supporting the lines in either direction, with the lines connected by a jumper between the two segments. Dead-end towers can resist unbalanced forces due to line weight and tension, contrasted with suspension towers which mostly just support the conductor weight and have relatively low capacity for unbalanced load. Dead-end towers may use earth anchor cables {{to compensate for the}} asymmetric attachment of the conductors. They are often used when the power line must cross a large gap, such as a railway line, river, or valley.|$|E

This {{software is}} scrutinised for its usability and for errors such that it can be revised to improve the usability of the tool. The type of software being studied is used to ensure optimum design performance and reduce the probability of a <b>conductor</b> <b>failure</b> on distribution lines. The algorithms for calculating tension, sag and clearance values take into account research into optimum design tensions. This ensures low bending forces due to conductor vibration. An algorithm for creep is designed based on common life expectancy of line conductors. The design methodology and algorithms were then put into software form as RSAT.

40|$|DIII-D {{has been}} {{operating}} {{for the last year}} with limited volt-second capabilities due to structural failure of a conductor lead to one of the ohmic heating (OH) solenoids. The <b>conductor</b> <b>failure</b> was due to poor epoxy impregnation of the overwrap of the lead pack, resulting in copper fatigue and a water leak. A number of structural analyses were performed to assist in determining the failure scenario and to evaluate various repair options. A fatigue stress analysis of the leads with a failed epoxy overwrap indicated crack initiation after 1, 000 cycles at the maximum operating conditions. The failure occurred in a very inaccessible area which restricted design repair options to concepts which could be implemented remotely. Several design options were considered for repairing the lead so that it can sustain the loads for 7. 5 Vs conditions at full toroidal field. A clamp, along with preloaded banding straps and shim bags, provides a system that guarantees that the stress at the crack location is always compressive and prevents further crack growth in the conductor. Due to the limited space available for the repair, it was necessary to design the clamp system to operate at the material yield stress. The primary components of the clamp system were verified by load tests prior to installation. The main body of the clamp contains a load cell and potentiometer for monitoring the load-deflection characteristics of the clamp and conductors during plasma operation. Strain gages provides redundant instrumentation. If required, the preload on the conductors can be increased remotely by a special wrench attached to the clamp assembly...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} numerical validation {{of two different}} failure test data. These are: (1) suspension insulator failure test and (2) <b>conductor</b> <b>failure</b> test. The first failure scenario deals with {{the study of the}} effect of dynamic load on adjacent towers due to a broken suspension insulator; while the second scenario deals with the effect of dynamic load on a tower when the adjacent tower has failed due to conductor rupture. The published data were gathered from full scale as well as scale model tests for model validations. A finite element model of the line was developed using three different element types. Incremental nonlinear dynamic analysis was carried out in the time domain using a commercially available software package. [...] Using full-scale test data from broken insulator at the suspension point, a numerical model was developed. Upon validation of the numerical model with the test results, a sensitivity study was carried out for various insulator lengths, ice thicknesses and initial tensions {{to determine the effects of}} these parameters on the impact loads on the tower cross arm. Results of the study show that the impact loads are less sensitive to the change in insulator length and initial tension but they do vary significantly when the ice loads are increased. The magnitude of the effect of incremental ice thickness has not been quantified in any previous study. A coordination of strength study showed that a suspension insulator failure can increase the conductor tension considerably thus initiating conductor rupture and therefore, a possible cascade failure in the longitudinal direction. [...] Using the scale model test data for broken conductor, a numerical model was developed where a number of towers were allowed to fail (one at a time) in a preferred sequence and the peak forces predicted on the surviving tower. This predicted peak force was compared to the experimental results and a reasonable correlation was established. Results show clearly that by allowing a few structures to fail, the longitudinal peak load on the surviving tower can be reduced significantly. This information can then be used in the design of the anti-cascading tower for proper cascade failure containment. [...] The study results show clearly that the analysis of dynamic load assessment on transmission system is possible and is cost effective using commercially available finite element software. ...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{photovoltaic}} array installations, {{which include}} residential and intermediate applications, {{are subject to}} building and electrical codes and to product safety standards. The National Electrical Code (NEC) Article 690, titled Solar Photovoltaic Systems, contains provisions defining acceptable levels of system safety and emphasizes the system design and its installation. The Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL), document titled: Proposed First Edition of the Standard for Flat Plate Photovoltaic Modules and Panels, UL- 1703, identifies module and panel construction requirements that ensure product safety. Together these documents describe requirements intended to minimize hazards such as shock and fire. Although initial focus of these requirements is on single crystal silicon modules, they are generic in nature, and are equally applicable to high voltage (30 Vdc), multikilowatt, thin film systems. A major safety concern is insulation breakdown within the module or array wiring system, or discontinuities within the electrical <b>conductors.</b> These <b>failures</b> can result in ground faults, in circuit arcs, or exposure to hazardous electrical parts. Safeguards are discussed...|$|R
40|$|When the {{superconductor}} is {{subjected to}} local thermal perturbations, {{a large amount of}} joule heat may be generated in the conductor, which may lead to a quench. In a quench event, a normal zone irreversibly spreads throughout the <b>conductor</b> leading to <b>failure</b> of the superconducting device. In this paper, we will discuss the one-dimensional quench behavior in the coated conductors with internal defects or interface defects. Based on the numerical procedure given in the previous works, the normal zone propagation is studied by using the finite difference method. The numerical results are presented to discuss the normal zone propagation. We consider the effect of internal defect on the nonuniform temperature propagation. For the conductor with interface defects, it can be found that the normal zone propagation velocity is increased by defects...|$|R
40|$|Proton Exchange Membrane for Fuel Cell (PEMFC) {{application}} {{is an alternative}} source of energy for both mobile and stationary application due to its high efficiency, zero emission and environmental friendliness. Conventional PEMFC operates with Nafion membrane. Besides the high cost and the environmental hazards related with its disposal, Nafion {{also needs to be}} hydrated to be an effective proton <b>conductor.</b> The <b>failure</b> for Nafion to be operated above 100 °C further complicates the design of fuel stack system. Therefore, it is desirable to explore an alternative, PEMFC that is capable to operate above 100 °C in order to improve its efficiency. Porous silica materials are identified as potential candidate as PEMFC due to their moderate proton conductivity, excellent water retention at high temperature and high molecular sieving capabilities. In order to drive water out from the electrode, thus preventing flooding; surface modification of porous silica materials with hydrophobic chains is essential. In the studies, the development of porous silica materials composite which are zeolite A, MCM- 41, and aerogel loaded with sulfonated poly (styrene-co-divinylbenzene) as proton conducting membrane was carried out. The results show that PEMFC from functionalized silica based materials show appreciable conductivity compared to Nafion. The result indicate that the proton of MCM- 41 sulfonated poly (styrene-co-divinylbenzene) shows similar proton conductivity with aerogel sulfonated poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) as 8. 8345 X 10 - 3 Scm- 1 and 6. 485 X 10 - 3 Scm- 1 respectively...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the certain}} rain-wind conditions, bundled {{conductors}} exhibit a rain-wind induced large-amplitude vibration. This type of vibration {{can cause the}} fatigue fractures of <b>conductors</b> and fatigue <b>failures</b> of spacers, which threaten the safety operation and serviceability of high-voltage transmission line. To reveal the mechanism of rain-wind induced vibration of bundled conductors, a series of 2 -dimensional CFD models about the twin bundled conductors with rivulets are developed to obtain the curves of aerodynamic coefficients with the upper rivulet angle. The influences of the forward conductor’s aerodynamic shielding and the upper rivulet’s aerodynamic characteristics on the leeward conductor are discussed. Furthermore, a 2 -dimensional 3 DOF model for the rain-wind induced vibration of the leeward conductor is established. The model is solved by finite element method and Newmark method, {{and the effects of}} the wind velocity and the upper rivulet’s motion on vibration amplitude of the leeward conductor are analyzed. By contrast with the wake-induced vibration, it can easily find that the characteristics of rain-wind vibration are obviously {{different from those of the}} wake-induced vibration, and the main reason of the rain-induced vibration may be due to the upper rivulet’s motion...|$|R
40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems, the fault frequently involves arcing and burning {{for all the}} wiring exposed to mechanical damage and other insulation stresses including wiring not fixed and connected by flexible cords and cables. The IEC Standard 60364 stops the design of electric power systems at the outlets of branch circuits or at the fixed equipment. A complete design instead should {{take care of the}} connections of the portable equipment and of extension cords (as requested by NFPA 70) that are exposed to arc-faults and may cause fire and/or electric shock hazard. The cords supplying the Class II equipment are without a grounding protection <b>conductor,</b> so the <b>failure</b> of the double insulation, caused by external damage, can't be expected to be easily detected as a ground fault. A protection must be provided to prevent the fault from extinguishing itself without being detected and remaining energized, thus presenting an electric shock hazard by direct contact with a live part, rendered accessible after local insulation failure. The authors highlight this worst case and suggest the protection achieved by wiring the circuits, particularly extension cords, with special power cables. Ground-fault-forced cables, GFFCs convert a line-to-line fault into a line to ground fault, that will be detected and protected by ordinary ground fault protective devices (GFPDs). By adopting the GFFC type of cables internally to Class II equipment, the disconnecting supplying measure could be extended to equipment also...|$|R
40|$|Cascade {{failure of}} {{electrical}} transmission lines {{can be caused}} by a number of reasons. Dynamic forces like equipment <b>failure,</b> <b>conductors</b> rupture in any span, heavy wind loads, snow accumulation on conductors and structural members or ice shedding are known to be the main reasons for such a collapse. The primary objective of this investigation was to study the dynamic behavior of supporting towers, collapse of supporting towers and longitudinal dynamic maximum forces that were induced on the adjacent supporting towers due to conductors rupture in any span. The study was performed on transmission lines, whose supporting towers were modeled with (a) Linear elastic truss and beam elements, (b) Moment-Curvature beam elements, with elastic-plastic material properties, and (c) Towers with load limiting devices or tower load controllers (TLC). The transmission lines modeled with linear elastic truss and beam elements were used to perform the free vibration analysis to calculate the damping properties of the towers and the transmission lines. Each of these models was used to conduct static and transient dynamic analyses due to broken conductors in the middle span. The transient dynamic analyses were carried out with bare conductor (no-ice-loads) loading and 25 -mm (1 -inch) radial ice loading conditions. The linear material models do not predict the failure or cascading of the transmission line towers, however considering the elements as moment-curvature beam models with elasto-plastic materials showed that the towers adjacent to the span, where conductors are ruptured, experienced large impact forces causing the adjacent towers to collapse. And the use of TLCs was able to limit the length of this cascade failure...|$|R
