2500|$|... "Roller cam brakes" [...] are centre-pull {{cantilever}} brakes actuated by {{the cable}} pulling a single two-sided sliding cam. [...] (First and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is {{most common and}} is described here.) [...] Each arm has a <b>cam</b> <b>follower.</b> [...] As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart. [...] As {{the top of each}} arm moves outward, the brake shoe below the pivot is forced inward against the rim.|$|E
2500|$|In {{all models}} {{of this family}} of engines the {{cylinder}} heads are of aluminum alloy, screwed and shrunk onto steel barrels. Spark plug inserts and intake valve seats are made from aluminum-bronze alloy, while the exhaust valve seats are steel. The engines all employ hydraulic tappets which operate in aluminum guides that are machined into the crankcase. The tappets are built from four parts, a <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> body, cup, cylinder, and piston and operate with clearances of [...] to [...] The pushrods are steel and feature pressed-in ball ends.|$|E

2500|$|Sliding {{friction}} between {{the surface of the}} cam and the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the cam and follower are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant motor oils contain additives specifically to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve lifters slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the cam and follower are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new lifters on an old cam but never old lifters on a new cam. In some engines the followers have rollers which eliminate the sliding friction and wear but add mass to the valvetrain.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{negative}} logic selector bail that is {{displaced by the}} interposer in turn pulls a latch interposer and link which causes a selector latch near the cycle shaft to be {{pulled away from the}} latch bail. The latches pulled away in this manner are disengaged {{for the rest of the}} cycle, while the remaining latches take part in character selection, hence the term [...] "{{negative logic}}". The minus five selector bail pulls an interposer and link which causes a latch to disengage from a cam, allowing it to move an additional input into the whiffletree that subtracts five units of rotation from any negative logic inputs. An additional [...] "low velocity" [...] selector latch is also engaged by certain keys, such as '.' and '_', which require a reduced striking force so as not to cut the paper; this selector latch engages the low velocity control <b>cam</b> <b>follower,</b> which pulls the low velocity cable connected to the cam in the carrier, causing the low velocity lobe to be used instead of the usual high velocity lobe. Additionally, punctuation marks are deliberately placed about the ball so the maximum amount of energy is used to position the element prior to striking, further reducing the impact.|$|E

50|$|The <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> used in Sportster engines, K models, big twin {{side valve}} models, and the side-valve W model series were a {{slightly}} shorter {{version of the}} followers used in the larger motors, but with the same 0.731 in diameter body and 0.855 in diameter roller follower since 1929. The company used similar <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> for decades with minor changes, from the 1929 to the Eighties.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cam</b> <b>follower,</b> {{also known}} as a track follower, is a {{specialized}} type of roller or needle bearing designed to follow cam lobe profiles. Cam followers come in a vast array of different configurations, however the most defining characteristic is how the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mounts to its mating part; stud style cam followers use a stud while the yoke style has a hole through the middle.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{driving system}} for a stud type <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> is a slot, for use with a flat head screwdriver. However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric cam followers and those used in blind holes. Hex socket cam followers from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the <b>cam</b> <b>follower.</b> RBC Bearings' Hexlube cam followers feature a relubrication fitting {{at the bottom of}} the hex socket.|$|E

5000|$|... 1c 1937-39 SN 55000 - 125000 - In 1937 a {{triangular}} cam-follower replaced the circular Leica-type <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> {{and the speed}} dial was modified slightly to resemble the Leica II. 28mm and 100mm lenses were made available. A pocket tripod, self-timer, close-up lenses, darkroom equipment and filters appeared in this period.|$|E
50|$|While roller <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> {{are similar}} to roller {{bearings}}, {{there are quite a}} few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the outer race from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> the outer race is loaded at a single point, so the outer race needs a thicker cross-section to reduce deformation. However, in order to facilitate this the roller diameter must be decreased, which also decreases the dynamic bearing capacity.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 the 0.8 and 1.0 engines were updated again. New {{intake and}} exhaust systems, along with low-friction {{aluminum}} <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> with rollers were added, resulting in better economy.|$|R
50|$|Yoke type <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> {{are usually}} used in {{applications}} where minimal deflection is required, {{as they can}} be support on both sides. They can support the same static load as a heavy stud follower.|$|R

50|$|A cam and {{follower}} {{is formed}} by the direct contact of two specially shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the {{cam and follower}} determines {{the movement of the}} mechanism. In general a <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism's energy is transferred from cam to follower. The cam shaft is rotated and, according to the cam profile, the follower moves up and down. Now slightly different types of eccentric cam followers are also available in which energy is transferred from the follower to the cam. The main benefit of this type of <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps to rotate the cam 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical toys use {{several types}} of mechanisms. Because Cam toys are powered by a very large cam and even bigger <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> which {{transfers}} the cam rotation to the working area of the toy. The cam is unevenly rotated by placing the rotator out of the ideal center. This transforms the circular motion into motion that moves up and powers the toy.|$|E

The green handle is used to lower the red <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> onto the cam wheel attached to the propeller shaft. When the cam raises the follower, the blue rod is depressed against the spring, enabling the yellow trigger plate to be reached when the purple firing button is pressed.|$|E
50|$|Gear toys use {{gear wheels}} to {{transfer}} the power in the toy, to change the speed and direction of motion. They can be powered by hand (with a cram or cam and <b>cam</b> <b>follower)</b> or by wind-up mechanism. The different number of teeth in the gear wheels determine the speed transition from wheel to wheel. By chaining and distributing number of gear wheels this type of mechanical toys allows very complex motions.|$|E
50|$|For {{heavy-duty}} applications a roller design can be used. This employs {{two rows of}} rollers of larger diameter than used in needle roller <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> to increase the dynamic load capacity and provide some thrust capabilities. This design can support higher speeds than the full complement design.|$|R
5000|$|Cam timers {{and drum}} sequencers were {{primarily}} used with industrial machines to control repetitive sequencing operations. The <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> often operated hydraulic valves. Cam timers in industry were superseded {{with the introduction}} of programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which offer improved flexibility and more complicated control logic functions.|$|R
50|$|Stud type <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> are {{available}} with an eccentric stud. The stud has a bushing pushed onto it that has an eccentric outer diameter. This allows for adjustability during installation to eliminate any backlash. The adjustable range for an eccentric bearing is twice that of the eccentricity.|$|R
