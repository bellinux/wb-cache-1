5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, <b>contributing</b> and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a <b>contributing</b> property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of <b>contributing</b> property but they all retain the same basic characteristics. In general, <b>contributing</b> properties are integral parts of the historic context and character of a historic district.|$|E

5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, <b>contributing</b> to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, <b>contributing</b> to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
