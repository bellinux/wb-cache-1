25|$|One however {{needs to}} view these {{issues from the}} <b>context</b> <b>within</b> which Pozderac operated. Being part of the {{communist}} system Pozderac saw political ascendance possible only within the system. If one adds to this the patriarchic nature of the Balkans, his strong leadership was proven {{to be the only}} potent power that could make the difference in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the communist era. He was the follower of the conviction that political, legal, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic and other progress is based on the economic progress. He is credited for implementing processes that led the economic revitalization of Bosnia and Herzegovina that contributed to strengthening of the cultural independence and identity of Bosnia within Yugoslav federation.|$|E
25|$|Unger’s aim is twofold. First, {{to level}} a critique, expansion, and defense of modern {{thinking}} about the human and society “so that this practice can better withstand the criticisms that philosophy since Hume and Kant has leveled against it.” And second, to develop a prescriptive theory of human identity centered on what Unger calls the passions—our raw responses {{to the world that}} are ambivalent towards reasons but also act in the service of reason. He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the <b>context</b> <b>within</b> which the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Rimé et al. {{noted that}} in {{contemporary}} scientific research, emotions {{were considered to be}} responses to preceding events that are then restrained by self-control and self-restoration. As such, emotions were generally regarded as ephemeral and intrapersonal experiences. Rimé also later pointed out that attachment theory rendered emotional regulation to be of an interpersonal nature for children, yet to become mature adults one must become autonomous and capable of regulating emotions independently. In the field of psychology a healthy individual is typically seen as “self-contained, independent and self-reliant, capable of asserting himself and influencing his environment”. Riger also suggests that this individualistic view of emotional regulation could have been influenced by the <b>context</b> <b>within</b> which it had been studied, i.e. the United States.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{determinants}} of splicing work in an inter-dependent manner that depends on context, so that the rules governing how splicing is regulated from a splicing code. The presence of a particular cis-acting RNA sequence element may increase {{the probability that a}} nearby site will be spliced in some cases, but decrease the probability in other cases, depending on context. The <b>context</b> <b>within</b> which regulatory elements act includes cis-acting context that is established by the presence of other RNA sequence features, and trans-acting context that is established by cellular conditions. For example, some cis-acting RNA sequence elements influence splicing only if multiple elements are present in the same region so as to establish context. As another example, a cis-acting element can have opposite effects on splicing, depending on which proteins are expressed in the cell (e.g., neuronal versus non-neuronal PTB). The adaptive significance of splicing silencers and enhancers is attested by studies showing that there is strong selection in human genes against mutations that produce new silencers or disrupt existing enhancers.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the bishops}} of Râmnic, {{witnessing}} two decades of Austrian domination {{and a number of}} Austro-Turkish confrontations in Oltenia, visibly acquired a national identity and a feeling of cultural, linguistic and religious cohesion with other Romanians. This helps explain why in their town more than in the national capital Bucharest, where Ottoman pressures and the financial interests of Phanariote Princes and dignitaries restricted such sentiments, printing activity in Romanian was done with the intention of aiding the popular masses, and why in spite of the difficulties involved, they strove to preserve traditional cultural and spiritual ties to areas inhabited by Romanians. With this goal in mind, they took care to print the most needed religious texts in the best translations, to present and comment on them in careful prefaces, to promote notions of spiritual, religious, cultural and political unity and to enrich a literary Romanian language with a basis in liturgical use. Each of the ten bishops involved (as well as Galaction, after 1800) had his own particular merits shaped by the <b>context</b> <b>within</b> which he operated. While the writing of Anthim, defrocked and assassinated, were forbidden, those of Damaschin took on his literary and liturgical prestige. Chesarie, although only bishop for a short while, had original ideas on Romanian history, accounting for Iorga's appreciation.|$|E

In Parliament, Labouchère indignantly described 19 Cleveland Street as [...] "in no obscure thoroughfare, but nearly opposite the Middlesex Hospital". The house, which was located {{on the western side}} of Cleveland Street, no longer survives: it was demolished in the 1890s for an extension of the Hospital, which itself was bulldozed in 2005.

500|$|The {{sociology}} {{of knowledge is}} the study of the relationship between human thought and the social <b>context</b> <b>within</b> which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably Max Scheler, and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the {{sociology of}} knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in The Social Construction of Reality (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare socially constructed reality). The [...] "archaeological" [...] and [...] "genealogical" [...] studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence.|$|E

[...] He ultimately concluded that the entry is [...] "not a bad episode, exactly" [...] but that [...] "it's far from a great one." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10.

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, footage taken from the [...] "No Russian" [...] level was leaked on the Internet. Activision quickly {{clarified}} that the footage was real, and explained the level's <b>context</b> <b>within</b> the game. This early footage divided opinions among video game journalists. The Daily Telegraph Tom Hoggins felt that while he could not properly judge the level without having played it, he still questioned whether Infinity Ward had approached the level from the wrong direction by letting the player use grenades to [...] "treat these civilians as human bowling pins". Writing for The Guardian, Keith Stuart criticized the skip feature, describing it as a [...] "cop-out" [...] for a level that the developer intended players to experience. Jim Sterling of Destructoid however was fully supportive of the level, as he thought that it was a statement that video games could discuss controversial topics, which he felt that many developers would often shy away from. He concluded by saying that if [...] "No Russian" [...] was able to make players question if the payoff was worth human sacrifice, then video games could finally be considered an art form.|$|E
500|$|The graphic {{depiction}} {{of violence in}} The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was [...] "a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety", {{as opposed to being}} used as a method to achieve objectives. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was [...] "heavy, consequential and necessary", as opposed to gratuitous. USGamer's Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that, despite the [...] "incredibly brutal" [...] combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. Eurogamers Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the violence is not [...] "desensitized or mindless". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiq's Mitchell wrote that the violence is [...] "designed to be uncomfortable", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its <b>context</b> <b>within</b> the game.|$|E

500|$|The neo-classical monuments that proliferated {{at the end}} of the 18th {{century and}} the start of the 19th, such as The Kymin at Monmouth, were {{attempts}} to meld the concepts of Britishness with the Greco-Roman empires of classical antiquity. The new and expanding British Empire provided [...] "unprecedented opportunities for upward mobility and the accumulations of wealth", and so the [...] "Scottish, Welsh and Irish populations were prepared to suppress nationalist issues on pragmatic grounds". The British Empire was [...] "crucial to the idea of a British identity and to the self-image of Britishness". Indeed, the Scottish welcomed Britishness during the 19th century [...] "for it offered a <b>context</b> <b>within</b> which they could hold on to their own identity whilst participating in, and benefiting from, the expansion of the [...] Empire". Similarly, the [...] "new emphasis of Britishness was broadly welcomed by the Welsh who considered themselves to be the lineal descendants of the ancient Britons – a word that was still used to refer exclusively to the Welsh". For the English, however, by the Victorian era their enthusiastic adoption of Britishness had meant that, for them, Britishness [...] "meant the same as 'Englishness'", so much so that [...] "Englishness and Britishness" [...] and [...] "'England' and 'Britain' were used interchangeably in a variety of contexts". Britishness came to borrow heavily from English political history because England had [...] "always been the dominant component of the British Isles in terms of size, population and power"; Magna Carta, common law and hostility to continental Europe were English factors that influenced British sensibilities.|$|E
