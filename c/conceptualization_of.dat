In future studies, we encourage researchers to consider other forms of mixed-methods designs in which they combine distractor analysis techniques with qualitative methods in order to more fully understand students’ <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> the EDP.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, a major shift in fashion was taking place that {{extended}} beyond changes in mere style to changes in philosophical and social ideals. Prior to this time, the style and traditions of the “Ancien Régime” prevented the <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> “the self”. Instead, one’s identity was considered malleable; subject to change depending on what clothes one was wearing. However, by the 1780s, the new, “natural” style allowed one’s inner self to transcend their clothes.|$|E

25|$|Professionals, {{those who}} have a college education, and those whose work {{revolves}} around the <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> ideas have supported the Democratic Party by a slight majority since 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, professionals favored Democrats by a 12-percentage point margin. While the professional class was once a stronghold of the Republican Party, it has become increasingly split between the two parties, leaning in favor of the Democratic Party. The increasing support for Democratic candidates among professionals may be traced to the prevalence of social liberal values among this group.|$|E
25|$|Cicero was {{declared}} a righteous pagan by the Early Church, and therefore {{many of his}} works were deemed worthy of preservation. The Bogomils considered him a rare exception of a pagan saint. Subsequent Roman and medieval Christian writers quoted liberally from his works De Re Publica (On the Commonwealth) and De Legibus (On the Laws), and much of his work has been recreated from these surviving fragments. Cicero also articulated an early, abstract <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> rights, based on ancient law and custom. Of Cicero's books, six on rhetoric have survived, as well as parts of eight on philosophy. Of his speeches, 88 were recorded, but only 58 survive.|$|E

Clarification of the radiological appearance of the human mesentery resonates with the suggestions of Dodd and enables a clearer <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> mesenteric derangements in disease states. This is of immediate relevance in the spread of cancer from colon cancer and perforated diverticular disease, and in pancreatitis where fluid collections in the lesser sac dissect the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum and thereby extend distally within the latter.|$|E

25|$|Sagan wrote {{frequently}} {{about religion}} {{and the relationship between}} religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> God as a sapient being. For example: Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.|$|E

The term “free software” in the free software movement is meant to imply freedom of software exchange and modification. The term does not refer to any monetary freedom.
