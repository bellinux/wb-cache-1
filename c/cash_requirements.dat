These formulae accurately adjust the demand for money to the real needs of the branches, avoiding a surplus of money and, hence, minimizing the opportunity costs.|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} into homeownership {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult for first-home buyers.

Larger and longer cash flow shortages give rise to more equity than debt finance. After the shocks, firms gradually adjust their leverage back to pre-shock levels by retiring debt and issuing equity. Financing patterns during a shock are consistent with a pecking-order theory of finance, whereas the adjustment afterwards is consistent with a trade-off theory.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the welfare effect {{of foreign investment}} under quantitative restric-tions for a host country with a cash-in-advance constraint.

This result {{is contrary to the}} conven-tional view that foreign investment is non-immiserizing under quantitative restrictions.
