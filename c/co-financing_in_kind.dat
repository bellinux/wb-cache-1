The performance analyses show that the following matters should be addressed: increases in participation of the IDB as an agent in the projects for the LAC region, enlargement of the scale of <b>co-financing</b> <b>in</b> the IDB-brokered cases {{as well as in}} the LAC region, and reinforcement of the linkage between the SECCI Funds and international climate change funds.

The European Social Fund is one of two structural funds which act as financial resources for <b>co-financing,</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with national and private resources, activities that reduce economic disparities between regions. Resources from structural funds allocated to the Czech Republic are, by their character, classified and administered in accordance with particular Operational Programmes, which stem from a national strategic reference framework. Standard documents, approved by the European Commission, always accompany a programme period. In the thesis apriori are described and the administration procedures of selected Operational Programmes financed by the European Social Fund, are collated.

40|$|Many large {{government}} programs provide benefits <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> {{as opposed to}} in cash. Providing benefits <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> potentially distorts decisions and leads to a deadweight loss if recipients value the benefits less than a cost-equivalent cash transfer.

We complete what is to our knowledge one of the first empirical studies of {{the costs and benefits of}} providing transfers <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> as opposed to in cash. We focus on the case of the US Medicaid program's provision of <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> home health care benefits. Three state Medicaid programs completed randomized experiments that converted the usual in-kind benefits into cash benefits for a randomly-selected subset of benefit recipients.

40|$|Section 18 A of the Income Tax Act (Act 58 of 1962), {{as amended}} by the Revenue Laws Amendment Act (Act 45 of 2003) entitles a {{taxpayer}} (an individual or a legal entity, including a trust) to deduct annual donations to certain public benefit organisations, not exceeding 5 % of taxable income. The question arises whether the same tax deduction applies when a taxpayer decides to make a donation in cash {{as opposed to a}} donation of property <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare the effect on a taxpayer's taxable income of making a cash donation compared with a donation of property <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> It appears that the tax deduction in respect of donations is greater when a taxpayer decides to donate an amount in cash rather than a donation of property <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> The paper shows that, under current legislation, a donation of property made <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> can be structured in such a way that it will provide a taxpayer with an identical tax deduction.
