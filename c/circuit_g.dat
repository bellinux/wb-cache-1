40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{technique}} for powerperformance trade-off {{based on a}} profile-driven code execution methodology. Specifically, we {{show that there is}} an optimal level of parallelism for energy consumption and propose a compiler-assisted technique for code annotation that can be used at run-time to adaptively trade-off power and performance. As shown by experimental results, our approach is up to 23 % better than clock throttling and is as efficient as voltage scaling (up to 10 % better in some cases). The technique proposed in this paper can be used by an ACPI-compliant power manager for prolonging battery life or as a passive cooling feature for thermal management. 1 Introduction Power dissipation has become a critical design concern in recent years, driven by the increased levels of complexity and emergence of mobile applications.

40|$|AbstractIn Section 1 of {{this article}} we prove the following. Let f: G → G′ be a circuit surjection, i. e., a mapping of the edge set of G onto the edge set of G′ which maps <b>circuits</b> of <b>G</b> onto <b>circuits</b> of G′, where G, G′ are graphs without loops or {{multiple}} edges and G′ has no isolated vertices. We show that if G is assumed finite and 3 -connected, then f is induced by a vertex isomorphism. If G is assumed 3 -connected but not necessarily finite and G′ is assumed to not be a circuit, then f is induced by a vertex isomorphism. Examples of <b>circuit</b> surjections f: <b>G</b> → G′ where G′ is a <b>circuit</b> and <b>G</b> is an infinite graph of arbitrarily large connectivity are given. In general if we assume G two-connected and G′ not a circuit then any <b>circuit</b> surjection f: <b>G</b> → G′ may be written as the composite of three maps, f(G) = q(h(k(G))), where k is a 1 - 1 onto edge map which preserves circuits in both directions (the “ 2 -isomorphism” of Whitney (Amer. J. Math. 55 (1933), 245 – 254) when G is finite), h is an onto edge map obtained by replacing “suspended chains” of k(G) with single edges, and <b>G</b> is a <b>circuit</b> injection (a 1 - 1 circuit surjection). Let f: G → M be a 1 - 1 onto mapping of the edges of G onto the cells of M which takes <b>circuits</b> of <b>G</b> onto <b>circuits</b> of M where G is a graph with no isolated vertices, M a matroid. If there exists a circuit C of M {{which is not the}} image of a <b>circuit</b> in <b>G,</b> we call f nontrivial, otherwise trivial. In Section 2 we show the following. Let G be a graph of even order. Then the statement “no trivial map f: G → M exists, where M is a binary matroid,” is equivalent to “G is Hamiltonian. ” If G is a graph of odd order, then the statement “no nontrivial map f: G → M exists, where M is a binary matroid” is equivalent to “G is almost Hamiltonian,” where we define a graph G of order n to be almost Hamiltonian if every subset of vertices of order n − 1 is contained in some <b>circuit</b> of <b>G...</b>|$|R

If G is a graph and C is a <b>circuit</b> in <b>G,</b> we say that two <b>circuits</b> in <b>G</b> form a split of C if the symmetric difference of their edges sets {{is equal to the}} edge set of C, and if they are separated in G by the intersection of their vertex sets. García Moreno and Jensen, A note on semiextensions of stable circuits, Discrete Math. 309 (2009) 4952 – 4954, asked whether such a split exists for any <b>circuit</b> C whenever <b>G</b> is 3 -connected.

We show that if G can be evaluated over the integers modulo 2 k+ 1 in time t and space s, the problem can be decided with constant probability in O((kn + t) 2 k) time and O(kn + s) space. Based on this, we present new and faster algorithms for two well studied problems: (i) an O ∗ (2 mk) algorithm for the m-set k-packing problem and (ii) an O ∗ (2 3 k/ 2) algorithm for the simple k-path problem, or an O ∗ (2 k) algorithm if the graph has an induced k-subgraph with an odd number of Hamiltonian paths.

In songbirds, vocal exploration is induced by LMAN, {{the output of}} a basal ganglia-circuit that also contributes a corrective bias to the vocal output. This bias is gradually consolidated in RA, a motor cortex analogue downstream of LMAN. We develop {{a new model of}} such two-stage learning. Using stochastic gradient descent, we derive how the activity in 'tutor' <b>circuits</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> LMAN) should match plasticity mechanisms in 'student' <b>circuits</b> (e. <b>g.,</b> RA) to achieve efficient learning.
