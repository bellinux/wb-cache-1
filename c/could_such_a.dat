500|$|Like Zoromski, Abby West of Entertainment Weekly critiqued {{the episode}} for not {{involving}} Corporate, complaining [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> public-relations nightmare {{not lead to}} a visit or a phone call from Jan?" [...] West did however praise Jim and Dwight's impressions of each other as [...] "perfect" [...] bookendings. Writing for AOL TV, Jay Black called [...] "Product Recall" [...] "wonderful" [...] and highlighted the Jim-Dwight impersonations and Andy's discomfort upon discovering his girlfriend was a high school student. Black did however criticize Michael's press conference as [...] "over-the-top in an annoying way" [...] and Creed's actions as [...] "way over the line" [...] and [...] "despicable". Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A–.|$|E

[...] During this period {{he served in the}} Seminole Wars in Florida, the Mexican-American War, and spent 18571859 with the Mormon Expedition. In his diaries, he wrote about the Mormon faith with extreme disdain. [...] "Where else than in America <b>could</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> flat and puerile invention become enshrined as an established belief. From what trunk except one of the most vigeorous of free institutions <b>could</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fungus of absolutism arise?" [...] In a December 1857 letter he compared Mormonism to a [...] "snake coiled in the desert and concluded that it, like the snake, should be smitten immediately." [...] He was a strong advocate for use of military means to suppress what he viewed as the Mormon threat to American republicanism.|$|E

[...] "Not only were its members drawn from different sections of the country, but they represented the varied life of the capital city. Within the charm of the drawing-room, officials of the Government, legislators, writers, artists, scientists and private men and women met together, dropping, for the time being, all titles of distinction and becoming simply companions under the Egis of Learning." ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{orders of}} {{magnitude}} are not exact because they don't {{take into consideration the}} velocity of the Brownian particle, U, which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it. The larger U is, the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a Brownian particle can never increase without limit. <b>Could</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> process occur, it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type. And since equipartition of energy applies, the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle, , will be equal, on the average, to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid particle, [...]|$|E

50|$|At the time, the Shinpūren Rebellion had {{a ripple}} effect, {{spawning}} the Akizuki Rebellion and the Hagi Rebellion. Although this rebellion failed completely, {{the fact that}} a small, but determined band of men <b>could</b> create <b>such</b> <b>a</b> state of panic and <b>could</b> defeat <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large force proved to be an inspiration to political secret societies {{until the end of the}} Empire of Japan in 1945.|$|R
6000|$|The {{subsequent}} {{conversation in}} the smoking-room was as red-eared and disagreeable for Sir Isaac as any conversation could be.

[...] Their eyes were dreadful. Did they guess? Could they guess?

6000|$|... "Are {{you trying}} to be light and amusing," [...] {{returned}} Brown, severely, [...] "or {{are you supposed to}} be discussing the matter seriously? What attraction <b>could</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> girl have for such a man as Reuben Neil?" ...|$|E

50|$|In 1859, {{a new law}} was put {{in effect}} which allowed female {{teachers}} a formal degree.
