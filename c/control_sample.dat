5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the <b>control</b> <b>sample.</b>|$|E

30|$|With {{regard to}} {{limonene}} and n-decanol an UI reduction was found (compared to <b>control</b> <b>samples)</b> {{at the three}} lower solvent concentrations, meaning cells were still able to perform changes at fatty acids synthesis level, despite of the stress produced by solvents. At the two higher solvent concentrations the UI remained comparable to the <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> for both solvents.

25|$|Although {{physical}} characteristics and sizes at various instars {{have been used}} to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in gene expression. Three genes were measured in an experiment with Drosophila melanogaster: bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because {{they are likely to be}} in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed. However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high confidence level. Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique. One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages. The hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.|$|E
500|$|The {{rotational}} {{properties of}} Jupiter trojans {{are not well}} known. Analysis of the rotational light curves of 72 Jupiter trojans gave an average rotational period of about 11.2hours, whereas the average period of the <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> of asteroids in the asteroid belt was 10.6hours. The distribution of the rotational periods of Jupiter trojans appeared to be well approximated by a Maxwellian function,, where [...] is the average rotational period, [...] is the dispersion of periods. whereas the distribution for main-belt asteroids {{was found to be}} non-Maxwellian, with a deficit of periods in the range 8–10hours. The Maxwellian distribution of the rotational periods of Jupiter trojans may indicate that they have undergone a stronger collisional evolution compared to the asteroid belt.|$|E

Study design Tryptase, c-Kit, and MMP- 9 expression was evaluated in 20 cases of SCC, 20 cases of AC, and 7 cases of normal lip (<b>control</b> <b>samples)</b> by immunohistochemistry techniques. Results Tryptase+ and c-Kit+ MC densities were significantly higher in SCCs than in ACs and <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> (P <. 001). However, no significant difference was found when comparing tryptase+ and c-Kit+ MC densities between ACs and <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> (P values. 185 and. 516, respectively). MMP- 9 was strongly expressed in SCCs and moderately expressed in ACs and <b>control</b> <b>samples.</b> A highly significant association was found between tryptase+ MC density and the expression of MMP- 9 (P <. 001).

The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.|$|E

2500|$|A German {{study on}} {{childhood}} {{cancer in the}} vicinity of nuclear power plants, the KiKK study was published in December 2007. According to Ian Fairlie, it [...] "resulted in a public outcry and media debate in Germany which has received little attention elsewhere". It has been established [...] "partly {{as a result of an}} earlier study by Körblein and Hoffmann which had found statistically significant increases in solid cancers (54%), and in leukemia (76%) in children aged less than 5 within 5 km of 15 German nuclear power plant sites. It red a 2.2-fold increase in leukemias and a 1.6-fold increase in solid (mainly embryonal) cancers among children living within 5 km of all German nuclear power stations." [...] In 2011 a new study of the KiKK data was incorporated into an assessment by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) of the incidence of childhood leukemia around British nuclear power plants. It found that the <b>control</b> <b>sample</b> of population used for comparison in the German study may have been incorrectly selected and other possible contributory factors, such as socio-economic ranking, were not taken into consideration.

The water activity in <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> (without starter culture) and inoculated samples (inoculated with B. polymyxa D 05 - 1) remained constant throughout fermentation, whereas the pH value rose slightly during fermentation. Salt contents in both samples were constant in the range of 17. 5 – 17. 8 % during the first 60 days of fermentation and thereafter increased slowly. The inoculated samples had considerably lower levels of total volatile basic nitrogen (p <  0. 05) than <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> at each sampling time during 120 days of fermentation. Aerobic bacterial counts in inoculated samples were retarded during the first 60 days of fermentation and thereafter increased slowly, whereas those of <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> increased rapidly with increased fermentation time. However, the aerobic bacterial counts of <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> were significantly higher (p <  0. 05) than those of inoculated samples after 40 days of fermentation. In general, overall biogenic amine contents (including histamine, putrescine, cadaverine, and tyramine) in the <b>control</b> <b>samples</b> were markedly higher (p <  0. 05) than those of the inoculated samples throughout fermentation. After 120 days of fermentation, the histamine and overall biogenic amine contents in the inoculated samples were reduced by 34. 0 % and 30. 0 %, respectively, compared to <b>control</b> <b>samples.</b> These results emphasize that the application of starter culture with amines degrading activity in salted fish products was effective in reducing biogenic amine accumulation...|$|R
