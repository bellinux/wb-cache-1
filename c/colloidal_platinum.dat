The size, morphology, structure and optical properties of the colloids were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy. IR ablation leads to nanoparticles with mean diameter of 10 nm and a broad size distribution (width 5 nm). The nanoparticle size is significantly reduced upon UV ablation (2 nm mean diameter, 0. 3 nm distribution width) which also yields crystalline nanoparticles. Moreover at 266 nm the use of PVA yielded crystalline Pt nanorods of  10 x 70 nm 2.

Several laser wavelengths (1064, 532, and 266 nm) and stabilizing agents (citrate and polymers PEG, PVA, and PVP) were employed. Laser ablation with the infrared and visible wavelengths leads to spherical amorphous nanoparticles with a bimodal distribution of diameters, featuring a global maximum in the range 5 - 10 nm and a shoulder extending to 25 nm. Such bimodal distributions plausibly arise from thermal and explosive vaporization mechanisms occurring in different time scales, as proposed in earlier studies. Ultraviolet ablation of Pt at 266 nm, reported {{here for the first}} time, produces crystalline nanoparticles of small size (1 - 4 nm diameter), with a weak onset of larger particles (6 - 8 nm). The ablation at 266 nm also produced an appreciable yield of large rodlike particles of size ∼ 10 × 70 nm 2, especially in the presence of PEG and PVA. The Pt nanoparticles served to fabricate films capable of assisting the laser desorption ionization (LDI) of a model peptide.

Paul Alivisatos, ChairCatalyst design using nanocrystals unlocks {{a wealth}} of {{independently}} tunable parameters which can optimize the catalytic performance of a material. The controlled placement of nanocrystals with distinct size, shape and composition within a single particle combines the advantages of each individual component for targeted reactions. Furthermore, the tailored mixing {{of two or more}} elements within a single nanocrystal can lead to novel properties distinct from the single elements themselves. Such parameters can be useful in enhancing the activity, selectivity and stability of a catalyst under reaction conditions. Thus, special attention must be paid to the assembly of such catalysts. Solution phase synthesis is a versatile tool for creating complex nano-architectures in a rational and controlled manner. Catalytic reactions often have competing unwanted side reactions which lead to deactivation or degradation. Nanocrystal building blocks can be tuned to address these issues on an atomic level. Furthermore, structure-activity relationships can elucidate information regarding the nature of the active site when the catalyst itself has been carefully designed, assembled and thoroughly characterized. This dissertation covers the <b>colloidal</b> synthesis of <b>platinum</b> and ruthenium loaded chalcogenide semiconductor nanocrystals for applications in water splitting, as well as platinum-gallium alloy nanocrystals for propane dehydrogenation. Chapter 1 of this dissertation reviews the fundamentals of semiconductor nanocrystals, which covers the basic properties of nanocrystals, background on their colloidal synthesis and requirements to achieving solar water splitting. The design of a platinum and ruthenium loaded core/shell cadmium selenide/cadmium sulfide nanorod is introduced. Chapter 2 discusses the synthesis of this four component heterostructure, detailing crucial considerations that must be addressed when assembling such multicomponent structures. Initial photocatalytic studies are presented at the end, followed by synthetic approaches to replacing ruthenium with iron or cobalt oxide based materials.

In fact, access to and consumption of energy is highly effective on the quality of life. The consumption of all energy sources have been increasing and the projections show that this will continue in the future. Unfortunately, conventional energy sources are limited and they are about to run out. Solar energy is one of the major alternative energy sources to meet the increasing demand. Photovoltaic devices are one way to harvest energy from sun and as a branch of photovoltaic devices organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices have recently drawn tremendous attention because of their technological advantages for actualization of large-area and cost effective fabrication. The research in this dissertation focuses on both the mathematical modelling for better and more efficient characterization and the improvement of device power conversion efficiency. In the first part, we studied the effect of incident light power on the space charge regions of the Schottky barriers of the organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices, the current-voltage characteristics and performance of the devices and built a current-voltage model for the devices that involves these effects. The incident light power showed an effect on the Schottky barriers of the devices by changing the width of the space charge regions. This change directly affects the reverse bias current-voltage curves by increasing the current values and the slope of the curves. But under excessive incident light power; the space charge regions merge, the devices break down and work as ohmic devices. In the second part, we combined the two improvement methods, improving the charge carrier transport and improving absorption of the organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices. For charge carrier transport improvement, we presented deoxyribonucleic acid complexes as hole collecting and electron blocking layer on the anode side of the devices by using them as band energy diagram arranging layer, for absorption improvement with plasmonic effect of the particles, we present <b>colloidal</b> <b>platinum</b> nanoparticles as the surface plasmons. Deoxyribonucleic acid complex layer improved the device performance by improving the charge carrier hopping efficiency of the devices by arranging the band energy diagram in order to collect holes easily and block electrons diffusing to anode electrodes. <b>Colloidal</b> <b>platinum</b> nanoparticles layer improved the device performance by increasing the light-harvesting efficiency of the devices by increasing the rate of photon absorption.

Combination of these two novel materials in the same device showed a significant improvement as a 26 % increase in the power conversion efficiency of the devices.

Chlorination is effected catalytically by suitable carriers. The Friedel and Crafte reaction is effected also by suitable halides. Numerous condensations such as the Benzoin condensation, the Aldol condensation, the Claisen condensation, and also esterification are catalytically effected.

Catalysts are also employed in Organic analysis, as for example the use of <b>colloidal</b> <b>platinum</b> metals to convert Halogen compounds into Hydrogenated products and Halogen acid in the presence of Hydrogen (Borshe and Heimburger, Ber. 1915, 48, 452, 850). In Inorganic Chemistry a large number of reactions are catalytically accelerated. One of the best known is the decomposition of Potassium Chlorate in the Presence of Manganese Dioxide. Numerous catalyses are cited in the work of Dhar. (Ann. Chim. 11, 130 - 223, 1919). Hydrogen peroxide, another example of classical importance in chemical kinetics is decomposed by numerous agents, such as glass wool, salts of heavy metals, <b>colloidal</b> <b>platinum.</b> In Electrochemistry one may cite such examples as the addition of Fluorides in the preparation of Persulphates or percarbonates, (Muller and Friedberger, Z. Elektrochem., 1902, 8, 230), or the use of Lead Peroxide anodes in the oxidation of Chromates to Dichromates (Z. Elektrochem, 1905, 11, 863). Para-nitrotoluene with platinum anodes yields p-nitro-benzoic acid almost quantitatively. An enormous number of reactions is accelerated by radiant energy, according to photo chemical laws. A typical example is the union of Hydrogen and Chlorine, whose mechanism has occupied the attention of numerous workers. The photocatalytic combination of carbon-monoxide and Chlorine, of Sulphur Dioxide and Chlorine, of saturated, unsaturated, and aromatic hydro-carbons, and of acids (much as Acetic acid) and Chlorine furnish still further examples. Such reactions are further sensitive to the presence of ordinary material catalysts or anti-catalysts (See Griffiths and McKeowan, (“Photochemistry” p. 626. ...|$|E
40|$|Cyclohexanone, an unstrained ketone, {{was found}} to undergo decarbonylation in the {{presence}} of soluble platinum(II) complexes of the general formula [Pt(tolpy) Cl(L) ] (where tolpy is 2 -(4 -tolyl) pyridine and L is a neutral ligand) to afford the platinum carbonyl complex [Pt(tolpy) Cl(CO) ] as well as carbon monoxide, methane and butane. As such, the activation of the cyclohexanone must proceed via the cleavage of three carbon–carbon bonds. However, the stoichiometric balance of the reaction required additional hydrogen, which implied a coupled transfer hydrogenation step. As part of a mechanistic investigation, a number of novel cycloplatinated complexes were prepared and characterised and their ability to catalyse the decarbonylation reactions was investigated. Many of them were identified as active catalyst precursors and, in particular, this {{was found to}} be true for [Pt(tolpy) Cl(CO) ], suggesting that the reaction is catalytic. It was commonplace for reactions to be accompanied by decomposition to what was assumed to be <b>colloidal</b> <b>platinum.</b> In addition to cyclohexanone, a range of other carbonyl-containing substrates were investigated and examples of cyclic and acyclic ketones as well as aldehydes were found undergo decarbonylation under the conditions employed. A mechanistic investigation was undertaken involving in situ spectroscopic studies, dynamic light scattering, deuterium labelling and mercury poisoning experiments. A mechanism for the decarbonylation of cyclohexanone is proposed whereby fragmentation and transfer hydrogenation take place to afford acetaldehyde, which then undergoes decarbonylation to afford methane. For the family of complexes of formula [Pt(tolpy) Cl(L) ] prepared to study the mechanism, a combination of spectroscopic and computational techniques were employed to study the structural and bonding properties of the complexes and the relative trans-influence of the ligands. An ordered series for the trans-influence of the ligands was identified using bond lengths obtained from analyses of single crystal X-ray data and this trend was also consistent with quantum chemical calculations. The trend was also analysed for possible correlations with chemical shifts and coupling constants obtained from 1 H, 13 C 1 H, 15 N and 195 Pt 1 H NMR spectroscopy. ...|$|E
40|$|Although a {{thorough}} investigation of various methods of preparing pure, anhydrous acetone has been made (cf. Sadie), no investigations of methods for determining the moisture content of this solvent have previously been described. A solvent with a consistently low water content is essential for electrochemical measurements. Accordingly an extensive study of moisture content determination in acetone-was made. A modified Karl Fischer titration procedure {{was found to be}} most suitable for the very low moisture contents of the acetone used in this work. All A. C. conductance measurements made using two platinised electrodes are, in some degree, liable to errors due to polarization, end effects and the state of the electrode surfaces. Several workers have also found errors due to the presence of finely divided platinum, such as adsorption of electrolyte on the <b>colloidal</b> <b>platinum,</b> the shaking effect and catalysis of reactions in solution. These errors are reduced by using lightly platinised or bright platinum electrodes, but polished electrodes give rise to increased polarization errors. In this work conductance measurements were made using a new four-electrode A. C. potentiometer, which employs bright platinum electrodes enabling conductance measurements to be carried out in acetone without recourse to platinisation, thus avoiding errors due to the presence of platinum black, contact resistances of electrodes and the like. The measurements on this apparatus were shown to be independent of frequency using aqueous potassium chloride solutions, and the accuracy of the results was tested using aqueous sodium chloride solutions. Perchlorates have been considered by some investigators (e. g. Ross Kane) to be strong electrolytes in acetone solutions and other workers (e. g. Accascina and Schiavo) found the alkali perchlorates to be weak electrolytes. The approximate limiting ionic conductances calculated by these last named workers were at variance with those of other investigators (e. g. Kraus). It therefore appeared that a study of the conductances of solutions in acetone of perchloric acid and some of its salts by the new potentiometric method would be advantageous. The conductances of three alkali perchlorates and the previou 3 ly unknown conductances in acetone of ammonium perchloratey pure anhydrous perchloric acid and lithium chloride were measured by the potentiometric method. Limiting equivalent conductances and dissociation constants were calculated for all the electrolytes and the results discussed. These electrolytes were, in general, found to be relatively weak in acetone, although perchloric acid is considerably stronger than hydrochloric acid. The conductance results indicated that the potentiometric method should be generally applicable to electrolyte solutions in all solvents, and can be used to advantage in all cases influenced by the errors previously mentioned. It is generally recognized that interpretation of conductance data and the development of the theory of electrolyte solutions is seriously hindered by the lack of transport data in non-aqueous solvents. Transference measurements were undertaken using a conductimetric moving boundary method, and a limiting transport number for the anion constituent of potassium thiocyanate was obtained in acetone. This is the first reasonably accurate limiting transport number to have been measured in acetone. From the equivalent conductance data of this work, and the literature, the first limiting ionic conductances in acetone have been calculated and the results discussed. The limiting conductance of the hydrogen ion 101 cm² ohm-¹ equiv-¹, was not found to be anomalous, as for example, in water. Anions were found to have generally higher conductances than cations, which is consistent with the view that cations are in general, more solvated than anions in dipolar aprotic solvents. Conductance results of numerous workers have indicated considerable uncertainty about the entities present in acetone solutions of hydrogen chloride. In order to add to existing knowledge, tracer diffusion coefficients of hydrogen chloride in acetone solutions were measured at 15 &# 8304;, 25 &# 8304; and 35 &# 8304;C over a range of concentrations using hydrogen chloride labelled with chlorine - 36. The capillary tube method was used, and concentrations were measured by a scintillation counting procedure. Complete interpretation of the results is impossible in the light of present knowledge, but they appear to be consistent with suggestions, based on conductance measurements in this system, that hydrogen chloride polymers may be present...|$|E
