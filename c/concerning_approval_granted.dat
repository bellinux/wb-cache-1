The process, {{as a means of}} development control, requires that certain planning application be accompanied by a development proposal report which include a written statement and plan that describes the present condition of the land to which the application relates; and the proposed development, in particular on how it would {{have an effect on the}} environment. As the proposed development needs to be properly evaluated by the relevant decision making body, and thus necessitates involvement of various stages as well as approving agencies, a shift from the conventional working procedures to a computerised system environment is essential to be able to provide appropriate information for the purpose, apart from facilitate and enhance routine planning and development control processes.
