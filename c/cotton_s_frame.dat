40|$|While cotton, {{along with}} other major crops, has been subsidized by the U. S. federal {{government}} since the 1930 <b>s,</b> <b>cotton</b> subsidies {{are now in the}} focus of an international spotlight. The nature and extent of these subsidies have become a roadblock in negotiating multilateral and bilateral trade agreements. Sharp criticism came from the West and Central African countries during various Doha Round meetings. Also, efforts to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FAA) foundered at least partially over U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> subsidies. Now, Congress is watching to see if the United States will be required by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to revise its cotton subsidies in response to a dispute lodged by Brazil. One reason the international spotlight is on U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> subsidies, in contrast to other subsidizing nations, is the sheer size of U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> production and exports. The United States is the second-largest producer of cotton in the world, and the largest exporter. Therefore, U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> subsidies have global repercussions.

40|$|Textiles {{and apparel}} trade has been {{governed by the}} Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) for three decades. Trade {{restrictions}} have generated substantial welfare losses and price wedges in exporting and importing countries through trade distortions. Beginning in 1995, textiles and apparel trade underwent fundamental changes in trade flows and patterns. The World Trade Organization??s Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) aimed to remove all MFA quotas by January 2005. This study established an equilibrium displacement model to investigate the impact on textile and cotton sectors of different countries and country-groups of removing the MFA quota. The model specifies the basic linkages of textile and cotton markets in the United States, China and four other country-groups. With different assumptions about U. S. textile supply elasticity, foreign cotton exporters?? reaction {{and changes in the}} U. S. farm program payments, alternative scenarios are simulated to predict changes in domestic and import demand for textiles and apparel, import demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton,</b> domestic and import price of textiles and apparel, U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> price and adjusted world cotton price. Uniform distribution was imposed for selected parameters involved in the model to overcome the deficiency of equilibrium displacement models of assuming certainty of known related parameters. Results indicate increased import demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> by China, higher U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> supply, more textile and apparel supply from China, decreased domestic demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton,</b> and lower U. S. domestic demand for textiles and apparel. However, prices of both textile and cotton markets experience both positive and negative changes under different scenarios. Holding other assumptions unchanged, when farm program payments increase, U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> price and adjusted world cotton price declined. When farm program payments are held constant, prices rise. The changes expected in U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> price are, in absolute value, greater than those of the adjusted world price...|$|R

40|$|AbSTRACT A rapidly {{expanding}} ethanol industry is significantly impacting agricultural {{markets in the}} United States. While the most direct effects of this biofuel boom are being seen in corn and soybean markets, {{the objective of this}} study is to estimate the effects on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> industry. Using a partial equilibrium econometric model of the world fiber market developed at Texas Tech University and projections of grain and oilseed markets by the Food and Agricultural Policy Re-search Institute, estimates are made of how the ethanol boom is changing: 1) cotton prices, 2) U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> production acreage, and 3) U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> net farm income. The results show that increasing returns from competing crops will impact net returns from cotton production. While current U. S. farm policy moderates the effects of rising prices for cotton lint, returns from the seed por-tion of cotton production increase significantly. These findings highlight the contribution that cottonseed makes to the overall profitability of U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> production...|$|R
