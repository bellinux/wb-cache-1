5|$|Although {{nothing is}} {{happening}} in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her <b>country</b> <b>when</b> the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} tensions escalated in {{the years}} leading to World War II, the Belgian government again announced its intention to remain neutral {{in the event of}} war in Europe. The military was reorganised into a defensive force and the country left several international military treaties it had joined in the aftermath of World War I. Construction began of defences in the east of the <b>country.</b> <b>When</b> France and Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Belgium remained strictly neutral while mobilising its reserves.|$|E

The Edmonton Eskimos could not afford to bring their players' families to the championship game.

5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up {{residence}} in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973 Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973 Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War {{to an end and}} suggesting the possibility of his return to the <b>country.</b> <b>When</b> the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's advances.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the <b>country</b> <b>when</b> Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he was informed that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Following the meeting, al-Bakri conferred with al-Shahbandar, {{who agreed}} to bring Damascus into the revolt, {{although}} this initial attempt did not materialize. As al-Atrash's men headed towards Damascus to launch their attack against French forces there, al-Bakri assembled some 260 armed volunteers from various neighborhoods and villages in and around Damascus, including al-Shaghour, Bab Musalla, al-Midan, and Jaramana. Al-Bakri maintained particularly close ties to Hasan al-Kharrat, the local boss (qabaday) of al-Shaghur {{and a friend of}} the al-Bakri family. In early August, upon al-Bakri's urging, al-Kharrat formed a militia, which would {{become one of the most}} effective rebel bands in the <b>country.</b> <b>When</b> the French authorities were informed of nationalist rebel plans, they began a wide-scale arrest campaign in the city on 27 August, detaining nearly all of Damascus's nationalist leaders and spokesmen, although al-Bakri, his brothers, and al-Shahbandar managed to evade arrest.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Lexus debuted {{its first}} sport utility vehicle, the LX 450, {{followed}} by the third generation ES 300 sedan. The marque's plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995. Lexus added the first luxury-branded crossover SUV, the RX 300, and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans in 1998. The RX crossover targeted suburban buyers who desired an upmarket SUV but did not need the LX's off-road capability. It was particularly successful, eventually becoming the marque's top-selling model ahead of the ES sedan. The same year, Lexus made its debut in South America's most populous <b>country</b> <b>when</b> it launched sales in Brazil. In 1999, Lexus recorded its 1 millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market and was ranked the top-selling premium car maker in the U.S. overall.|$|E

5|$|The Johnson County War, {{also known}} as the War on Powder River and the Wyoming Range War, was a range {{conflict}} that took place in Johnson County, Wyoming between 1889 and 1893. The conflicts began when cattle companies started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area, many of whom were innocent settlers that competed with them for land, livestock and water rights. As tensions swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, violence finally culminated in Powder River <b>Country,</b> <b>when</b> the ranchers hired armed gunmen to invade the county and wipe out the smaller settlements and alleged rustlers. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months.|$|E

5|$|The Warners {{starred in}} the feature-length, direct-to-video movie Wakko's Wish.

Although children and adults rated Wakko's Wish highly in test-screenings, Warner Bros. decided to release it direct-to-video, rather than spend money on advertising. Warner Bros. released the movie on VHS on December 21, 1999; the film was then released on DVD on October 7, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Dawson Creek {{is named}} after the {{watercourse}} of the same name, itself named after George Mercer Dawson who led a surveying team through the area in August 1879; {{a member of the}} team labelled the creek with Dawson's name. The community that formed by the creek was one of many farming communities established by European-Canadian settlers moving west through the Peace River <b>Country.</b> <b>When</b> the Canadian government began issuing homestead grants to settlers in 1912, the pace of migration increased. With the opening of a few stores and hotels in 1919 and the incorporation of the Dawson Creek Co-operative Union on 28 May 1921, Dawson Creek became a dominant business centre in the area. After much speculation by land owners and investors, the Northern Alberta Railways built its western terminus 3km (2mi) from Dawson Creek. The golden spike was driven on 29 December 1930, and the first passenger train arrived on 15 January 1931. The arrival of the railway and the construction of grain elevators attracted more settlers and business to the settlement. The need to provide services for the rapidly growing community led Dawson Creek to incorporate as a village in May 1936. A small wave of refugees from the Sudetenland settled in the area in 1939 as World War II was beginning. The community exceeded 500 people in 1941.|$|E

The Wolverines, led by the Fab Five in their sophomore season, won 79-78 on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back road games against unranked Wake Forest and #5 Duke. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into {{the last week of}} the regular season (their first #1 ranking {{since the start of the}} 1987–88 season). North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77-75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps, who was injured.
