Such measurements are now available for the assessment of proptosis, eye muscle dysfunction, and optic nerve involvement. However, no validated objective measurement exists for NO SPECS class II signs. The present study compares the use of <b>colour</b> <b>slides</b> with clinical grading for assessing soft-tissue involvement. Forty-three patients were treated with retrobulbar irradiation. Pre-treatment, and 6 months post-treatment the severity of class II signs was graded from 0 to grade c in two ways; 1) Clinically, by two independent, experienced observers, who recorded their scores on the same day; 2) From <b>colour</b> <b>slides,</b> taken at the same visits, which were graded afterwards in one session independently by the same observers. Inter-observer agreement about clinical grading was low (Kappa 0. 32), and was not improved by using the slides (Kappa 0. 35). However, by using the clinical scores, the observers disagreed on treatment outcome in 21 / 43 patients (49 %), whereas using the slides disagreement occurred in only 6 / 43 (14 %, p < 0. 01). It is concluded that the grading of soft-tissue involvement is highly subjective. However, the use of <b>colour</b> <b>slides</b> does provide a more reliable way to assess a treatment effect and should be used in clinical trial...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Sun Printers asked Crosfield {{if he could}} design an {{electronic}} machine {{to do the job}} of retouchers (skilled artists who reworked the contact print of the film negatives so that a 4-colour ink process would produce a good quality print on paper). Sun was expanding its facilities for colour printing but, due to trade union restrictions, the company could not hire and train enough retouchers. Crosfield thought it a very difficult task, but Sun offered to pay half the R & D costs and Crosfield [...] "decided to have a go". He built a new research team and rented premises at Old Street for the laboratory to develop the colour scanner. The first Scanatron appeared in 1958. By then CEL had a large back order for scanners from rotogravure printers in Europe and the US. Colour scanners became the biggest money earner for the company and Crosfield continued their development, launching the Diascan, an improved and cheaper model in 1965 and the enlarging Magnascan in 1969. This machine scanned a <b>colour</b> <b>slide</b> and had all the equipment and software necessary to adjust the size, form, colour and hue to get the desired result for the publisher. The Magnascans launch at the Milan printing fair caused a sensation. [...] The company continued development of scanners, bringing out new models that improved the versatility, quality and productivity of earlier versions. High quality colour printing was now common in catalogues, magazines and newspapers around the world.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of the {{colorimetric}} fidelity of digitised colour slides of painted works of art. A six-matrix conversion model was derived that permitted the transformation of any RGB device-dependent measurement on digitised colour slides to XYZ CIE 1931 device-independent values. The model was calibrated against a reference colour chart. Eighty-one uniformly-painted colour samples were photographed together with a painting on a 4 x 5 inch <b>colour</b> <b>slide</b> that was digitised using a high resolution scanner. A 3 x 3 transformation matrix, of the corrected R, G and B values and the respective X, Y and Z tristimulus values provided by spectrophotometry, was calculated. The calculated matrix was then applied to a 13 th century Byzantine fresco, captured on the same digitised slide, to transform the RGB measurements to XYZ CIE 1931 device-independent values which were then converted into the L*a*b* CIE 1976 colorimetric system...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{sets out}} to examine the utility of remote sensing {{techniques}} in helping to define recommendation domains relatively homogeneous agricultural areas - to act as foci for agricultural development planning in lower Meru, Kenya. Recommendation domains are used in farming systems research (FSR) for agricultural research and development initiatives enabling greater participation from rural producers within the development process. Recommendation domains are defined by agricultural potential (agro-ecological zones) and farming systems (agro-economic groupings). A multilevel approach incorporating Landsat MSS data, 1 : 50, 000 stereo panchromatic air photography, large scale aerial <b>colour</b> <b>slide</b> photography and ground surveys is used {{to collect data on}} the farming systems of the study area. Relatively homogeneous farming patterns are identified and mapped using a number of different computer software packages. These patterns are related to previously identified zones of agricultural potential (agro-ecological zones) to define recommendation domains for new agricultural development initiatives in the area. Several domains are identified for specific attention. Recommendations are made which are relevant to both national and district level agricultural planning in Kenya. It is suggested that future development programmes should focus on areas undergoing population movement and cultivation change since without careful planning these changes are likely to detrimentally affect the local farming systems and natural environment...|$|E
40|$|On Kissing’ at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, 14 November 2008 : Screening Andy Warhol's film 'Kiss' (1964) as a {{historical}} backdrop, the event looked at kissing, both as physical act and metaphor, {{as a gesture of}} exchange or desire, as hidden by the very anatomy of faces and bodies, as playing with the invisible aspects of love. Speakers: artists Melanie Manchot and Wiebke Leister, who will both be presenting new work, writer and curator Lisa Le Feuvre and film historian A. L. Rees. Wiebke Leister's performance consisted of a live reading of her monologue 'Lovers, Liars and Laughter' read by the Shakespearean actor Kenneth Gilbert accompanied by a 32 -piece <b>colour</b> <b>slide</b> projection of the photographs from the series 'Ever After' (23 mins). During the piece each of the eight photographs developed in four stages from either a positive into a negative or from negative into positive – the pale orange skin of the unexposed parts of the colour film not unlike human skin, turning into deep black shadow when developed as a positive. Written in the voice of a young female character, the monologue was read by a white-headed actor in his eighties, as if looking back at an event of his past. At the same time the dissolving slides gradually merged not only giving and receiving participant of each stage of their increasingly indecipherable kiss, but also the couples following each other. The performances, talks and screenings were followed by a drinks reception launching her research publication 'Lovers, Liars and Laughter' (Fieldstudy 11), published by the Photography and the Archive Research Centre.

40|$|The {{geographical}} {{limits of the}} Solway Firth have not been defined so far. However, before considering the shores in some detail, it is pertinent to con-sider these limits, which were discussed by Perkins and Williams (1963). It {{can be argued that}} the area contained by a line drawn from the Mull of Galloway to Haverigg Point, Cumberland, fundamentally constitutes the Solway Firth, but {{for the purposes of this}} study, it will be taken to be the area bounded by a line drawn from the Mull of Galloway to St. Bees Head. The Outer Solway is then constituted by the area which is bounded by this line and one drawn from Southerness Point to Dubmill Point; while the Inner Solway is the area to the east of the latter line. This last is not just a convenience, but represents a real division both biologically and hydrographically. For the sake of precision, both in this immediate section and those to come, each shore is given a station number to which an ordnance survey co-ordinate and the period to which it refers is given. The co-ordinate gives the 100 km. square in figures, but square 25 is also referred to elsewhere as NX and 35 as NY. The nature of the investigations of the Solway Firth with which I have been associated since 1961, has demanded that many shores have been studied, to a large extent on a routine basis. The following therefore represents a brief summary of the conditions and of the changes at each of the stations visited during the period 1961 - 68. In many instances a <b>colour</b> <b>slide</b> or slides of these shores are available, and are deposited with the Burgh Museum, Dumfries. For further details of the transect and ecological reconnaissance data upon which these descriptions are based reference may be made to supporting data to the “ Biology of the Solway Firth in Relation to the Movement and Accumulation of Radioactive Materials. ” This data series is deposited at the following institu-tions...|$|E

40|$|For the {{qualitative}} description of surface properties like vegetation cover or land-water-ratio of Samoylov Island {{as well as}} for the evaluation of fetch homogeneity considerations of the eddy covariance measurements and for the up-scaling of chamber flux measurements, a detailed surface classification of the island at the sub-polygonal scale is necessary. However, up to know only grey-scale Corona satellite images from the 1960 s with a resolution of 2 x 2 m and recent multi-spectral LandSat images with a resolution of 30 x 30 m were available for this region. Both are not useable for the desired classification because of missing spectral information and inadequate resolution, respectively. During the Lena 2003 expedition, a survey of the island by air photography was carried out in order to obtain images for surface classification. The photographs were taken from a helicopter on 10. 07. 2002, using a Canon EOS 100 reflex camera, a Soligor 19 - 23 mm lens and <b>colour</b> <b>slide</b> film. The height from which the photographs were taken was approximately 600 meters. Due to limited flight time, not all the area of the island could be photographed and some regions could only be photographed with a slanted view. As a result, the images are of a varying quality and resolution. In Potsdam, after processing the films were scanned using a Nikon LS- 2000 scanner at maximal resolution setting. This resulted in a ground resolution of the scanned images of approximately 0. 3 x 0. 3 m. The images were subsequently geo-referenced using the ENVI software and a referenced Corona image dating from 18. 07. 1964 (Spott, 2003). Geo-referencing was only possible for the Holocene river terrace areas; the floodplain regions in the western part of the island could not be referenced due to the lack of ground reference points. In Figure 3. 7 - 1, the aerial view of Samoylov Island composed of the geo-referenced images is shown. Further work is necessary for the classification and interpretation of the images. If possible, air photography surveys will be carried out during future expeditions in order to determine changes in surface pattern and composition...|$|E
