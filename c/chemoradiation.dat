25|$|But many HPV+OPC {{present with}} {{involvement}} of the lymph nodes in the neck, and hence a higher stage of disease, generally referred to as locally advanced disease. This group is mostly treated with multimodality therapy, {{with the exception of}} one of the more favourable subgroups with small primary tumours and lymph node involvement confined to a single node no larger than 3nbsp&cm in size, which as noted are considered early stage disease. The three main options for locally advanced but operable disease are resection, neck dissection and adjuvant therapy; <b>chemoradiation</b> (with possible salvage surgery); induction chemotherapy followed by radiation or <b>chemoradiation.</b> However the last option has not been supported in clinical trials that tested it. The primary consideration of surgery for locally advanced disease is to obtain adequate negative margins and spare the patient postoperative <b>chemoradiation.</b> But this must be balanced against the morbidity and functional loss from extensive resection, particularly where the tongue base is involved. To avoid such morbidity, primary <b>chemoradiation</b> is preferred. The management of disease within the cervical lymph nodes has to be taken into account in treating locally advanced disease. Guidelines for all OPC dictate that ectracapsular extension be given postoperative <b>chemoradiation.</b> Where gross neck disease is evident initially primary <b>chemoradiation</b> is usually given.|$|E
25|$|Larger early-stage tumors (IB2 and IIA {{more than}} 4nbsp&cm) may {{be treated with}} {{radiation}} therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires adjuvant radiation therapy), or cisplatin chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy. When cisplatin is present, it {{is thought to be}} the most active single agent in periodic diseases. Such addition of platinum-based chemotherapy to <b>chemoradiation</b> seems not only to improve survival but also reduces risk of recurrence in women with early stage cervical cancer (IA2-IIA).|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{decisions}} {{also take}} into account morbidities, particularly if cancer outcomes are comparable for instance surgery {{is associated with a}} risk of bleeding between 5–10%, and a 0.3% risk of fatal postoperative haemorrhage. Surgery may also be complicated by dysphagia, and while most patients can tolerate a diet on the first postoperative day, long term use of a feeding tube has been reported as high as 10%. Patients with larger tumours, involvement of base of tongue and requiring postoperative adjuvant therapy are more likely to require a long term feeding tube. Overall, function and quality of life appear relatively similar between surgery with postoperative radiation, and primary <b>chemoradiation,</b> but HPV+OPC patients tend to have better quality of life at diagnosis than HPV-OPC but may sustain greater loss following treatment.|$|E
25|$|Anatomical {{considerations}} {{may also}} dictate preference for surgical or non-surgical approaches. For instance trismus, a bulky tongue, limited {{extension of the}} neck, prominent teeth, torus mandibularis (a bony growth on the mandible) or limited width of the mandible would all be relative contraindications to surgery. Tumour related considerations include invasion of the mandible, base of skull and extensive involvement of the larynx or {{more than half of}} the base of tongue. Technical considerations in offering surgery as a primary modality include the presumed ability to achieve adequate margins in the resected specimen and the degree of resulting defect, since close or positive margins are likely to result in subsequent adjuvant therapy to achieve disease control, with resultant increased morbidity. Costs are difficult to estimate but one US study, based on estimates of 25% of all OPC patients receiving surgery alone and 75% surgery followed by adjuvant therapy, using the criteria of the NCCN, found that this approach was less expensive than primary <b>chemoradiation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In RTOG {{clinical}} trial 0129, {{in which all}} patients with advanced disease received radiation and chemotherapy, a retrospective analysis (recursive-partitioning analysis, or RPA) at three years identified three risk groups for survival (low, intermediate, and high) based on HPV status, smoking, T stage and N stage (see Ang et al., Fig. 2). HPV status was the major determinant of survival, followed by smoking history and stage. 64% were HPV+ and all were in the low and intermediate risk group, with all non-smoking HPV+ patients in the low risk group. 82% of the HPV+ patients were alive at three years compared to 57% of the HPV- patients, a 58% reduction {{in the risk of}} death. Locoregional failure is also lower in HPV+, being 14% compared to 35% for HPV-. HPV positivity confers a 50–60% lower risk of disease progression and death, but the use of tobacco is an independently negative prognostic factor. A pooled analysis of HPV+OPC and HPV-OPC patients with disease progression in RTOG trials 0129 and 0522 showed that although less HPV+OPC experienced disease progression (23 v. 40%), the median time to disease progression following treatment was similar (8 months). The majority (65%) of recurrences in both groups occurred within the first year after treatment and were locoregional. HPV+ did not reduce the rate of metastases (about 45% of patients experiencing progression), which are predominantly to the lungs (70%), although some studies have reported a lower rate. with 3-year distant recurrence rates of about 10% for patients treated with primary radiation or <b>chemoradiation.</b> Even if recurrence or metastases occur, HPV positivity still confers an advantage.|$|E
2500|$|Current {{consensus}} is that the long-term prognosis of c-SCLC patients {{is determined by the}} SCLC component of their tumor, given that [...] "pure" [...] SCLC seems to have the worst long-term prognosis of all forms of lung cancer. Although data on c-SCLC is very sparse, some studies suggest that survival rates in c-SCLC may be even worse than that of pure SCLC, likely due to the lower rate of complete response to <b>chemoradiation</b> in c-SCLC, although not all studies have shown a significant difference in survival.|$|E
2500|$|The cancer {{outcomes}} (local control, regional control, and survival) for transoral resection {{followed by}} adjuvant therapy {{are comparable to}} primary <b>chemoradiation,</b> so that treatment decisions depend more on treatment-related morbidity, functional outcome, and quality of life.

Patient preference is equally important. Many clinical trials are under way focussing on deintensification, often with risk stratification, e.g. Low, Intermediate and High risk [...] (see Fundakowski and Lango, Table I).|$|E

For {{patients}} {{such as those}} treated on RTOG 0129 with primary <b>chemoradiation,</b> detailed nomograms have been derived from that dataset combined with RTOG 0522, enabling prediction of outcome based on {{a large number of}} variables. For instance, a 71 year old married non-smoking high school graduate with a performance status (PS) of 0, and no weight loss or anaemia and a T3N1 HPV+OPC would expect to have a progression-free survival of 92% at 2 years and 88% at 5 years. A 60 year old unmarried nonsmoking high school graduate with a PS of 1, weight loss and anaemia and a T4N2 HPV+OPC [...] would expect to have a survival of 70% at two years and 48% at five years. Less detailed information is available for those treated primarily with surgery, for whom less patients are available, as well as low rates of recurrence (7–10%), but features that have traditionally been useful in predicting prognosis in other head and neck cancers, appear to be less useful in HPV+OPC. These patients are frequently stratified into three risk groups: ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} {{radiotherapy}} data, {{most of the}} available knowledge on the efficacy of chemotherapy derives from the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer rather than specific studies of HPV+OPC. Since 1976, many clinical studies have compared CRT to RT alone in the primary management of locally advanced head and neck cancers and have demonstrated an advantage to CRT in both survival and locoregional control. Cisplatin is considered the standard agent, and a survival advantage was seen for those patients who received radiation with concurrent cisplatin. Despite this no trials directly comparing cisplatin with other agents in this context have been conducted. The other agent that is widely used is Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A 10% survival advantage at three years was noted when cetuximab was given concurrently with radiation (bioradiation). Cetuximab trials were completed prior to knowledge of HPV status. The main toxicity is an acneiform rash, {{but it has not}} been compared directly to cisplatin in HPV+OPC, although RTOG 1016 is addressing this question. [...] Concurrent chemotherapy is also superior to chemotherapy alone (induction chemotherapy) followed by radiation. Cetuximab shows no advantage when added to cisplatin in combination with radiation. Although <b>chemoradiation</b> became a treatment standard based on clinical trials and in particular, meta-analyses, a subsequent population based study of patients with OPC, indicated no advantage to the addition of chemotherapy to radiation in either HPV+OPC or HPV-OPC, and significant concerns about added toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|These {{improvements}} in surgical techniques have allowed many tumours to be resected (removed) [...] by transoral (through the mouth) surgical approaches (TOS), using transoral endoscopic {{head and neck}} surgery (HNS). Consequently surgery became used more, increasing to 35% of cases by 2012. This approach has proven safety, efficacy and tolerability, and includes two main minimally invasive techniques, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). No direct comparisons of these two techniques have been conducted, and clinical trials in head and neck cancer such as ECOG 3311 allow either. They are associated with substantial postoperative morbidity, depending on extent of resection but compared to older techniques have shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less pain, and less need for gastrostomy or tracheostomy, and less long term effects, which are minimal {{in the absence of}} postoperative radiation (RT), or <b>chemoradiation</b> (CRT). TORS has the practical advantage that angled telescopes and rotating robotic surgical arms provide better line of sight. Outcomes of minimally invasive procedures also compare favourably with more invasive ones. In early stage disease, including involvement of neck nodes, TORS produces a 2-year survival of 80–90%. TLM similarly, is reported to have a five-year survival of 78% and local control rates of 85–97%. In addition to early disease, minimally invasive surgery has been used in advanced cases, with up to 90% local control and disease specific survival. Postoperative swallowing was excellent in 87%, but long term dysphagia was associated with larger (T4) cancers, especially if involving the base of the tongue.|$|E

50|$|Before the mid-1900s, {{lung cancer}} was {{considered}} to be a single disease entity, with all forms treated similarly. In the 1960s, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) was recognized as a unique form of lung cancer, based both on its appearance (histology) and its clinical properties, including much greater susceptibility to chemotherapy and radiation, more rapid growth rate, and its propensity to metastasize widely early on in its course. Since then, most oncologists have based patient treatment decisions on a dichotomous division of lung cancers into SCLC and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), with the former being treated primarily with <b>chemoradiation,</b> and the latter with surgery.|$|E

50|$|TORS {{provides}} an excellent alternative to <b>chemoradiation</b> and traditional open surgeries for some cancers of the mouth, throat, larynx and base of skull.

METHODS From July 1990 to July 1995, 142 patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head deemed resectable {{on the basis of}} radiographic images were treated with curative intent using a multimodality approach involving either preoperative or postoperative <b>chemoradiation.</b> Patients with biopsy confirmation of adenocarcinoma and a low-density mass in the pancreatic head identified by computed tomography (CT) received preoperative <b>chemoradiation.</b> Patients without a mass on CT or in whom the preoperative biopsy was negative underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with planned postoperative <b>chemoradiation.</b> Protocol-based preoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> consisted of external-beam irradiation at a dose of 50. 4 Gy (standard fractionation; 1. 8 Gy/d, 5 d/wk) or 30 Gy (rapid fractionation; 3 Gy/d, 5 d/wk) combined with continuous infusion 5 -FU (300 mg/m 2 /d, 5 d/wk). Postoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> combined 50. 4 Gy of external-beam irradiation (standard fractionation) with continuous-infusion 5 -FU. RESULTS No patient who received preoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> experienced a delay in surgery because of <b>chemoradiation</b> toxicity, but six of 25 eligible patients (24 %) did not receive postoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> because of delayed recovery after pancreaticoduodenectomy. No significant differences in toxicities from <b>chemoradiation</b> were observed between groups. Patients treated with rapid-fractionation preoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> had a significantly (P <. 01) shorter duration of treatment (median, 62. 5 days) compared with patients who received postoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> (median, 98. 5 days) or standard-fractionation preoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> (median, 91. 0 days). At a median followup of 19 months, no significant differences in survival were observed between treatment groups. No patient who received preoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> and pancreaticoduodenectomy experienced a local recurrence; peritoneal (regional) recurrence occurred in 10 % of these patients. Local or regional recurrence occurred in 21 % of patients who received pancreaticoduodenectomy and postoperative <b>chemoradiation.</b> CONCLUSION Delivery of preoperative and postoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> in patients who underwent potentially curative pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head resulted in similar treatment toxicity, patterns of tumor recurrence, and survival. Rapid-fractionation preoperative <b>chemoradiation</b> ensured the delivery of all components of therapy to all eligible patients with a significantly shorter duration of treatment than with standard-fractionation <b>chemoradiation</b> given either before or after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
