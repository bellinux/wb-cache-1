5000|$|As {{opposed to}} the 6600 and 6620's VGA {{resolution}} digital camera (640×480), the 6630 has a 1.3-megapixel camera (1280×960).

It comes with a hot swappable DV-RS-MMC <b>card,</b> <b>capacity</b> 32 MB or 64 MB depending on the region where the phone is sold. It is noteworthy that normal RS-MMC cards do not work with the 6630, it requires dual-voltage (1.8 V and 3.0 V) RS-MMC cards.

50|$|The DMP-555 was {{a single}} deck {{tabletop}} CD-player in Pioneer's range for DJs that was introduced in April 2002 and discontinued during 2004. The DMP-555 featured several innovative features, such as playback from SD card, and MP3 playback from either memory card or optical media. It also included the ability (unique in Pioneer's DJ product line) to cue from one media source and playback from another {{all on the same}} unit, allowing one to DJ two tracks from a single DMP-555 alone. The product was hobbled by a lack of support and updates, a 2GB limit on SD <b>card</b> <b>capacity,</b> and the inability to write MP3 files directly to the SD card. A special Pioneer-branded writer was required, and transfers had to be encrypted through custom Pioneer software because of music label concerns over copyright infringement.|$|E
50|$|The HT-700 was {{the user}} {{programmable}} {{version of the}} MT-600 (hence the prefix HT). It included the fully editable SD synthesis of the HZ-600, plus it took the auto-accompaniment of the MT-600 and made it fully editable too (a very rare and powerful feature). Users could fully program their own 2-measure patterns consisting of drums, basslines and chord inversions. The fill-in measure was also programmable. The HT-700 had 49 mini-keys and a pitch bender, and looked somewhat similar to the MT-600. Unlike the MT-600, though, it included a programming wheel and a card slot for Casio RA-100 RAM cards. The HT-700 and other HT synths could not store nearly as many patches to a RAM card as the HZ-600, {{because most of the}} RAM <b>card</b> <b>capacity</b> was reserved to store accompaniment patterns and chord/operation sequences. The HT-700 was also sold by Hohner in Germany as the 'KS-49 midi' (with slightly different preset sound set).|$|E
50|$|The LG Rumor/LG Scoop is a {{phone that}} was {{released}} by Sprint Nextel in September 2007. This phone features a QWERTY keyboard that slides out from the right side. 5-way navigation keys are located on the main panel of the phone, but not present on the keyboard. A 176x220 pixel screen rotates as the keyboard is open, but has no contrast controls. The 1.3-megapixel camera lacks an LED flash and a self-portrait mirror but does have negative, sepia, black & white tones, borders and an image enhancer to customize a picture. Basic MP3 playing functions are embedded in this phone, with the capability of expanding music storage via MicroSD card (125 to 1,000 music files depending on file size, encoding method, and <b>card</b> <b>capacity).</b> The music player will not launch unless a card is inserted in the phone, and will not accept a card with the memory that is over 4 GB.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} reported herein was to identify and develop a dried blood spot (DBS) direct analysis technique that could support high sample throughput quantitative bioanalysis in a regulated drug development environment. An initial literature review, coupled with proof of concept testing of the most prominent direct analysis techniques coupled to mass spectrometers (MS), resulted in direct elution (direct extraction of DBS via a confined solvent, producing a liquid extract) being selected as the most suitable technique to develop for this application. Direct elution technology was then developed into fully automated techniques with sufficient functionality to enable compatibility with high sample throughput quantitative bioanalysis. Proof of concept robustness data demonstrated that direct elution, despite the lack of sample clean up, was a reliable technique which had no detrimental effects on detector or chromatographic performance compared to conventional wet plasma extraction and analysis. A proof of concept investigation also demonstrated that a method of improving internal standard (IS) performance by spraying IS solution onto DBS samples prior to extraction, allowed the analyte of interest and IS to be co-extracted, while retaining adequate analytical performance. The foregoing proof of concept data was then combined to produce a fully automated DBS direct elution instrument designed to introduce sample extracts into a LC-MS/MS system. This instrument incorporated a 500 DBS <b>card</b> <b>capacity,</b> an intelligent visual recognition system, a dynamic IS applicator module, and a highly effective wash system that virtually eliminates carryover. Ultimately, this work led to the production of a fully automated DBS direct elution system that is now commercially available. Subsequent research focused on optimising the system, and using this technology to address {{some of the issues that}} are currently inhibiting the development of DBS usage in drug development applications, namely haematocrit (HCT) based assay bias, and the decreased sensitivity on offer from DBS sampling. It was demonstrated that using the IS sprayer enabled the IS to integrate sufficiently with the DBS sample prior to extraction to nullify HCT based recovery bias. The direct elution mechanism was also optimised with a view to maximising assay sensitivity while retaining acceptable analytical and chromatographic (LC-MS/MS) performance. Generic optimised direct elution conditions were developed which demonstrated that increases in assay sensitivity of up to 30 fold (compared to conventional manual extraction methods) were possible using a set of representative small molecule compounds...|$|E
