40|$|The Single Electron Transistor (SET) is a {{sensitive}} electrometer with a <b>charge</b> <b>sensitivity</b> ultimately limited by noise. In this thesis we present measurements of noise properties and <b>charge</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the radio-frequency Single Electron Transistor. The <b>charge</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for the radio frequency Single Electron Transistor (rf-SET) was measured, {{as a function}} of different parameters. The demonstrated result is better than the previously best reported sensitivity value both at 40 mK, and at 4. 2 K. The <b>charge</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at 40 mK is 0. 9 μe/√Hz, 5 times worse than theoretical limit. The <b>charge</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at 4. 2 K is 1. 8 μe/√Hz, only 1. 6 times worse then the theoretical limit for this temperature. The limiting factor is the amplifier noise but shot/thermal noise starts to be important. The SET was operated in the radio frequency mode which allowed to measure the low frequency noise of the SET in a wide frequency range from few Hz up to tenths MHz. Noise spectra were measured over a wide range of the gate voltage and bias voltage. In the data analysis we are able to separate noise contributions from different noise sources in the SET. From the low frequency noise measurements, we conclude that the noise spectrum in the frequency range (f > 10 kHz) is dominated by electron capture and emission kinetics on a electrostatic trap most probably consisting of a metallic grains outside the tunnel barrier. We have also introduced a method of direct measurement of the shot noise in the SET in low-frequency limit.

's seven distribution network operators for charging customers connected at extra-high voltage (EHV) distribution networks from April 2012. The original model is expected to respect network security while evaluating charges based on the extent of the use of the network, which it achieves by reshaping components' capacity with their contingency factors into maximum available capacity. It then identifies the impact of a nodal injection on each component under normal conditions within the threshold of the maximum available capacity. The problem with the LRIC is that it assumes that the impact from a nodal injection is the same under both normal and contingent states, thus underestimating its impact under contingencies. In this paper, the original LRIC model is improved by considering the respective impacts from users under both normal and contingent conditions. The improved model runs incremental contingency flow analysis to determine how they affect components' flows under contingencies. In order to illustrate the differences in the reinforcement horizons, a comparison of the original and enhanced approaches is carried out on three basic distribution networks: single-branch, parallel-branch, and meshed. The new approach chooses the smaller horizons between those from normal and contingent situations to derive <b>charges.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> analysis is introduced to reduce the calculation burden in determining components' flowincrements due to injections.

Carrier density and mobility results are presented, demonstrating top- and backgate control over the two inversion layers created at the upper and lower surfaces of the superficial silicon mesa. A new technique is developed enabling effective depletion gating of quantum dots in a bulk silicon substrate. A lower layer of aluminium gates is defined using electron beam lithography; the surface of these gates is oxidised using a plasma oxidation technique; and a further layer of aluminium gates is deposited. The lower gates form tunable tunnel barriers in the narrow inversion layer channel created by the upper MOSFET gate. The two layers of gates are electrically isolated by the localised layer of aluminium oxide. Low-temperature transport spectroscopy has been performed in both the many electron (&# 8764; 100 electrons) and the few electron (&# 8764; 10 electrons) regimes.
