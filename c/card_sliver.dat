5000|$|Nul’s pragmatism, its sober {{approach}} to the world, to the product of art, to being an artist and to reality, is expressed in the formal characteristics of its works, but also in its everyday practice, in the way works were created and exhibited, the way artists operated and presented themselves. The Nul artists aimed to shed the stereotyped image of the bohemian in a painting smock and had a fresh attitude toward the consumer society, quite {{at odds with the}} artistic scene of the early 1960s. Nul was a search for new relationships between art and reality, with at its base the rejection of uniqueness, authenticity and decorative attractiveness in the traditional sense of the word. The group reduced the multi-coloured to the monochrome and opted for repetition, seriality and the directness of everyday materials and objects, in use and effect. Even its conceptual aspect, the splitting of thought and action, of conception, production as well as the possibility of repeat production was, in the footsteps of Marcel Duchamp, linked to a different interpretation of ideas like craftsmanship and expertise. At the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum in 1962, for instance, Armando and Jan Henderikse left the setting up of their installations to museum staff, and in 1965, at Peeters’s request, Yayoi Kusama produced a work in his material, <b>card</b> <b>sliver,</b> a spun synthetic fibre. ‘The process of creation is [...] [...] [...] completely unimportant and uninteresting; a machine can do it,’ Peeters said. ‘The personal element lies in the idea and no longer in the manufacture.’The identity of the Dutch Nul group navigated between a cheerful orientation toward the world of the everyday and the cool sobriety of the serial monochrome. Whereas the German Zero artists were still ‘painting’ with the elements, with the effects of fire, light, shadow, movement and reflection, the Nul artist preferred to let reality speak for itself by isolating it, usually in raw form. Among the Dutchmen, only Henk Peeters worked with the elements water and fire - although Peeters saw his ‘pyrographs’, soot and scorch marks on various surfaces, as a typically Nul solution to the elimination of any excessively personal element: to work with the fickleness of a flame is ‘[...] [...] {{to let go of the}} work and to become the spectator of a self-directed performance.’ [...] In terms of form, Peeters’s tactile cotton balls, whether on a canvas or on a wall as a three-dimensional installation, are balanced on the cusp between Nul and the German Zero. 'It is not our job to educate, any more than it is our job to convey messages,’ said Piero Manzoni in 1960. This might as easily have been a statement by Henk Peeters, by Jan Henderikse and even by the German Zero group. And yet the sober-minded outlook of the Dutchmen distinguished itself from the German Zero. ‘Yes, I dream of a better world. Should I dream of a worse?’ wrote Otto Piene in ‘Paths to Paradise’ in 1961. [...] With their clear-eyed view of reality, the members of Nul were not dreaming of the world, neither a better nor a worse, and certainly not of ‘paths to paradise’. During the Nul period, radicalism and a sincerely felt admiration for what was new and contemporary went hand in hand; nimble provocation is what Nul seemed to have a patent on.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the effect of {{humidity}} on nep movement in electrostatic field, a self-made experiment instrument was made. By this instrument, under the several kinds of different humidity, fiber neps and SCNs (seed coat neps) gotten randomly from <b>card</b> <b>sliver</b> or raw cotton were laid on down-pole-plate and then the up-pole-plate voltage was increased gradually. The voltages when the neps leaving the down-pole-plate were recorded. With statistical method, the take-off voltage averages {{of different kinds of}} nep under different humidity were calculated. It can be concluded that charging time of neps decreases largely and the take-off voltages of neps also reduce with the increase of air humidity in certain range...|$|E
40|$|Sliver has a {{huge impact}} on yarn quality {{parameter}} like evenness, imperfection index, Cvm%, U % of yarn. In general doubling means the increase in weight per unit length. Doubling is a process used in yarn manufacturing by which a single product is produced from a several intermediate feed product. The study was performed on 0. 12 hank <b>card</b> <b>sliver</b> which was used to produce 24 / 1 Ne carded yarn. At first the number of doubling in the breaker and finisher drawing was 6, 7, and 8 respectively. The paper is to find out whether the change of number of doubling has any effect on yarn quality or to find out the suitable number of sliver doubling in passage 1 and passage 2...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the new {{establishment}} of waveform gauge settings between the revolving flats and cylinder in a Rieter C 4 Card. This waveform gauge has been set in seven positions within the carding region and concluded that they slightly {{reduce the number of}} neps and short fibres in the <b>carded</b> <b>slivers</b> which further improve the yarns produced. Similar results were obtained in the experiments applied to various grade levels of cotton and blends with polyester. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Textile {{production}} wastes are undesirable but inevitable by-products in any {{manufacturing process}} (spinning, weaving or knitting) and are frequently undervalued. However, {{if one can}} convert such wastes into useful product economically, there will be great contribution to the market. In the present investigation, therefore, torn-out garments were firstly cut, then opened and <b>carded.</b> The <b>carded</b> <b>slivers</b> were afterwards fed into the Dref 2 Machine, and yarns were spun at different card cylinder and perforated spinning drum speeds. Testing on the yarns and fabrics were then carried out to evaluate their performance...|$|R

40|$|Carding is {{the most}} vital process in spinning, which infl uences the sliver quality and the {{resulting}} yarn characteristics. The eff ect of carding on single fibre and bundle fibre properties were studied by employing advanced fibre information system (AFIS) and diff erences in properties are reported. For a good quality yarn, the process parameters and setting in the carding are needed to be selected properly. The paper presents the results due {{to the effect of}} points per square inch (PPSI) in stationary flats of licker-in side (SFL). The effect of setting between the flats and cylinder was also studied. The sample was prepared using LMW spinning line using LC- 333 carding machine. After regulatory changing the PPSI in SFL, the neps in the <b>carded</b> <b>sliver</b> were reduced. The experimentation led to the reductions in the total imperfection in yarn...|$|R

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} for the rate modeling of flexible granular solids based on affine average motion of interparticle contacts. We allow contacts {{to form and}} break continually but assume {{the existence of a}} finite friction coefficient rendering contacts force free as they form or break. The resulting constitutive equations are of the hypoelastic type. A specific model for the deformation of a fiber mass is then developed. The model improves on previous theories for fiber masses in at least two respects: First, it is more general ill that it is not restricted to uniaxial compression, although it is restricted to predominantly compressive deformations histories, due to neglect of frictional dissipation. Second, by allowing torsion as well as bending of fibers, this theory covers a larger deformation range. Compression experiments are performed on <b>carded</b> <b>slivers</b> of PA 6 fibers under various conditions. The measured response is found to be in close agreement with that predicted by the model...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of biocomposites in engineering applications {{is demonstrated by}} using aligned flax fibre/polylactate composites as a materials model system. The failure stress of flax fibres is measured by tensile testing of single fibres and fibre bundles. For both fibre configurations, {{it is found that}} failure stress is decreased by increasing the tested fibre volume. Based on two types of flax fibre preforms: <b>carded</b> <b>sliver</b> and uniaxial non-crimp fabric, aligned flax fibre/polylactate composites were fabricated with variable fibre content. The volumetric composition and tensile properties of the composite were measured. For composites with a fibre content of 37 % by volume, stiffness is about 20 GPa and failure stress is about 180 MPa. The tensile properties of the composites are analysed with a modified rule of mixtures model, which includes the effect of porosity. The experimental results are well predicted by the model. The back-calculated effective stiffness and failure stress of the flax fibres are in the ranges 56 - 60 GPa and 515 - 730 MPa, respectively. Finally, model predictions are used to present overall guidelines for the comparisons between tensile performance of flax fibre composites and traditional fibre composites (exemplified by glass fibre composites). The stiffness per volume, per weight and per cost is compared for these two types of composites. Godkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: USB; 20081010 (joffe...|$|R
40|$|It will be {{seen that}} {{irrespective}} {{of the type of}} feed, the precentage of hooked fibers in the outcoming sliver is fairly high, and varies only between the narrow limits 66 - 74. Further, in every case the trailing hooks are in the majority as in normally processed sliver. It should be particularly noted that there is hardly any difference between slivers B and C with regpect to the percentages of trailing and leading hooks, in spite of large differences in the percentages of such hooks fed to the card. Also, the percentages of trailing hooks in sliver B and of leading hooks in sliver C are less than those in the feed. It is clear, therefore, that the card more or less obliterates the fiber arrangement in the feed and gives it a treatment which results in a fairly constant percentage of hooked fibers in the sliver. From an examination of slivers D and E one might conclude that with combed feed the percentage of trail-ing hooks is significantly reduced while that of leading hooks is increased, but this conclusion is not borne out by the fiber arrangement of sliver F which is also from a combed feed. The combing ratio of the different slivers indicates that while there is hardly any difference in the fiber disorder of slivers prepared from blow room lap or from <b>card</b> <b>slivers,</b> the general fiber disorder is sig-nificantly less in slivers D, E, and F, which were pre-pared from combed sliver. The lower combing ratio of these slivers may be ascribed to greater fiber extent and better alignment of fibers arising out of the combed feed with its straightened and well separated fibers. The smaller percentage of short fibers in slivers D, E, and F, as compared to slivers A, B and C, would also be. partly responsible for lowering the value of the combing ratio in the former set of slivers.
