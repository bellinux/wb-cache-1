60|$|Gradually Gerald {{got hold}} of everything. And then began the great reform. Expert {{engineers}} were introduced in every department. An enormous electric plant was installed, both for lighting and for haulage underground, and for power. The electricity was carried into every mine. New machinery was brought from America, such as the miners had never seen before, great iron men, as the <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> were called, and unusual appliances. The working of the pits was thoroughly changed, all the control {{was taken out of}} the hands of the miners, the butty system was abolished. Everything was run on the most accurate and delicate scientific method, educated and expert men were in control everywhere, the miners were reduced to mere mechanical instruments. They had to work hard, much harder than before, the work was terrible and heart-breaking in its mechanicalness.|$|E
