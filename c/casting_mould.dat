The evaluation is only examining the economical aspects. The cost of using concrete <b>casting</b> <b>moulds</b> {{is a big part of}} the total production expenses. Therefore it is important that the calculated price not exceeds the final costs of the <b>casting</b> <b>moulds.</b> The calculated price is the price used in the process of making an offer. The evaluation consists of a comparison of the calculated price and the final costs for three building projects. It also evaluates the exploitation of the concrete <b>casting</b> <b>moulds</b> for each project. The report is made by Sven Gynne and Anders Alexandersson at School of Engineering, Jonkoping University, in cooperation with PEAB Jonkoping. The evaluation is strictly based on the calculated price and final cost of rented concrete <b>casting</b> <b>moulds,</b> only the moulds themselves, not the labour costs. Educational visits have been made to the three projects gathering facts. The conclusions we have drawn are that the difference between the calculated price and the final costs are considerable, especially one project have a greater difference than the others. The reasons for that are among other things tight building ground and a complicated building construction...|$|R

50|$|Copper {{was first}} used for {{fashioning}} small implements or ornaments (needles, awls, fishing hooks, pendants, etc.), while gold was used solely for aesthetic and decorative purposes. For a long time the items were produced by the technique of hammering, for the technique of the <b>casting</b> <b>mould</b> {{as well as that}} of „cire perdue” (lost wax) emerged much later. Although there is no proof of the provenance of the first metal items, they are seemingly local rather than imported products. That does not necessarily suggest that metallurgy was the invention of the local population, for it might have been introduced as a result of contact with regions where metal processing had started earlier (in the East or the Caucasus).|$|E

50|$|Judging {{from the}} {{materials}} available, Kargaly mines were {{discovered by the}} Yamno-Poltavka community, a nomadic population of the stockbreeders. Numerous tribes of this community occupied vast territories in Eastern Europe, from the southern Urals to the Carpathian foothills, adjacent to the middle Danube steppe in Pannonia. The nomadic lifestyle of many cultures in the northern zone of this extensive territory, formerly of the Circumpontic Metallurgical Province, is evidenced in the thousands of burial kurgans and complete absence of settlement remains. Excavations of the big open cast {{on one of the}} lots of the Kargaly complex (the hill of the ancient settlement Gorny) exhibited connections to the early groups of pastoral tribes who inhabited the southern Urals region of Kargaly. Radiocarbon calibrated dates showed that the miners could have begun their quest for this place no later than the fourth to third millennium ВСЕ. Much was yielded from excavation of the burial of a youth 7 in {{the very center of the}} Kargaly mining field, a site occupied by the kurgan cemetery of Pershin. Included in the finds were a <b>casting</b> <b>mould</b> of an early type shaft-hole axe and a copper flat axe dated to the Early Bronze Age. Radiocarbon calibrated dates place the burial between 2900-2700 ВСЕ Finally, the wide distribution of copper products made from Kargaly ores of the Early and Middle Bronze Ages found in the area between the Volga and the Urals shows the significant impact of Kargaly on the development of cultures inhabiting this region. Copper ores from Kargaly were also found among the artifact inventories of rich contemporaneous kurgan burials of the tribal chiefs in Volga basin.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{approaches}} {{the analysis of}} the metal temperature variation during the filling and solidification of steel in the <b>casting</b> <b>mould.</b> Furthermore we made determinations upon the heat transfer through the wall of the <b>casting</b> <b>mould.</b> The casting temperature, the casting speed and the heat transfer through the walls of the mould have a remarkable impact upon the shrinkage process for the prevention of casting defects (heat cavities and cracks). These cavities are also development cores for the heat cracks and the concentration of strains, which reduce the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the cast parts. The shrinkage cavities represent one of the main defects of the cast product, and their reduction should be made up to the limits of technical possibilities...|$|E
