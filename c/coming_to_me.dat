500|$|In {{the early}} stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused {{primarily}} on constructing difficult grooves for songs. To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone and cut a drum part without having a melody in mind. He recounted his approach for the album to Musician, saying that [...] "I just played what I felt, working {{from a sense of}} 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.' And Robbie would come in the next night and lay a bass part." [...] Unlike most reggae or funk bassists, Shakespeare approached his playing as a jazz soloist and attempted numerous subtle variations to his riff. He said that his inspiration [...] "comes from God. Sometimes endless ideas just keep <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Sometimes I'll change the drum pattern to a bass line and Sly will play the bass line on the drums." [...] Along with live percussion, Dunbar played Simmons drums, and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording. Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds.|$|E
500|$|Sue (Jane Lynch) {{recruits}} the glee club to sing at {{a homeless}} shelter where she will be volunteering to distract her from the first Christmas without her sister Jean, who died earlier in the year. Finn (Cory Monteith) tells Rachel (Lea Michele) that all he wants for Christmas is her. Rachel (Lea Michele) replies that he is also all she wants, but gives Finn (Cory Monteith) {{a long list of}} Christmas present suggestions. Her dialogue, [...] "All I want is what I have <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> All I want is my fair share" [...] is a verbatim homage to Sally's Christmas list scene with Charlie Brown in the Christmas classic, A Charlie Brown Christmas. Just as Charlie Brown is with Sally, Finn is appalled by how much Rachel wants, though she assures him that five of the items are enough. When she later hints that an early gift would not be amiss, he surprises her with the donation of a sow in her name to needy Africans. Rachel is unhappy, reminds Finn that she is a vegan, and recommends that he stick to her list to avoid embarrassment, while pointedly mentioning earrings.|$|E

2500|$|Siegel: That {{occurred}} to me in late 1934, when I decided that I'd like to do Superman as a newspaper strip. [...] I approached Joe about it, and he was enthusiastic about the possibility. [...] I was up late one night, {{and more and more}} ideas kept <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I kept writing out several weeks of syndicate strips for the proposed newspaper strip. [...] When morning came, I had written several weeks of material, and I dashed over to Joe's place and showed it to him. (This was the story that appeared in Action Comics #1, June, 1938, the first published appearance of Superman.) [...] Of course, Joe had worked on that earlier version of Superman, and when I came to him with this new version of it, he was immediately sold." [...] They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and introduced his colleague Lois Lane, who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman, but does not realize he and Kent are the same person.|$|E
